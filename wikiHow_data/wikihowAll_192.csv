, This will be the body.


Make sure the place where the body and head meet is underneath the head, not on top of it.

, This will be the tail.

, Put a long, slim beak at the right side of the head.


Hummingbirds' other trademark is their beak, which they can poke into even the narrowest of flowers to extract nectar, so make sure to get this part right.

, Use a fringe line for the body to reproduce the shape of small feathers. Make the shape of the wings and draw both small and big feathers inside. Draw feathers for the tail as well.

, Try to make a modular line, which passes from a thin to a thick line and vice versa. This will make your drawing look better and more professional.

, Look at the illustration for reference.

, Choose a color of your choice and stipple, making a border for a specific part of the peacock.


Start with the peacock's neck using either blue, green or any other color of your choice. Since the peacock is a very colorful bird, you can incorporate a lot of colors in your design.
Make a slender neck resembling the shape of an elongated flower vase.
Make a round head.
Add lines on the head for the crest. On top of the lines make small rectangles.

, Make a circular boundary through stippling, within which the plumage will be drawn.


You can make a plain circle first and then add curves on it after.
Mark the golden circle (saddle) which starts at the end of the neck, before the feathers begin.

, On these lines you will place the 'eyespot,' which is the signature feature of peacock tails.

, Make circles on the lines you made. The circles will be smaller around the neck and bigger as it goes above because the feathers open on the outside.


The placement of the eyespots can follow a pattern to look fuller and uniform i.e.; let the position of the eyespots be about similar in line 1, 3, 5 and so on and let the eyespots follow a uniform placement in line 2, 4, 6 and so on.
You need not stress about making perfect circles. It can be a circle or an oval. As you add more layers to it, it looks better.

, Define the eyes and the beak. Make a circle on the beak.


Their eyes can be made just like human eyes. Make an almond shape and add a circular pupil inside.
Mark the white portion, which is found around the eye, in the shape of a distorted rectangle.
You can either do these with pencil first or start away with crayons.

, Stipple all throughout the feather area using a light yellow color.


Leave blank the circles you made for the eyespot design.
This will add fullness to the feathers and add to its appeal.

, Take a darker yellow or a brown to fill any area that is left after using the yellow. A blend of two colors makes the peacock appear true to life.


This will further fill the gaps and make it more vibrant. Stipple all over the feathers leaving the circles for the eyespots.

, Pick a darker color like violet and outline all the eyespots yet again.


You need not worry too much about the maintaining even shapes. A little distortion gets concealed as you stipple it completely.

, Complete stippling all the eyespots.


Start with light colors first, because it is difficult for light colors to appear on top of dark colors.
Stipple in the eyespots with light green, brown, light blue and dark blue.

, Use a green color to outline individual circles in it first.

, Stipple the inside on the circles with light and dark brown.

, Stipple the neck with dark and light blue.


Use a brown for the crest and a blue for the rectangles on the crest.
Define the eyes and the beak.

, Use yellow for the legs and beige or grey for the claws and nails.

",How to Draw an Owl1," It should be about 2/3 of the height of your paper. It doesn't have to be perfect, but try to make it about twice as tall as it is wide, like the image below:;
, Draw two circles near the top of the oval, about 1/5 of the height from the top. Draw a smaller circle in each, and color them black, for the owl's pupils. Have fun with the eyes, if you want—you can make a serious owl, with in the middle straight ahead; an owl looking at something, by drawing the pupils pointed left or right; or a goofy, cross-eyed owl.

, Make a very wide ""V"" shape, extending beyond the edge of the oval on both sides, with the point of the ""V"" between the owl's eyes at about their centers, vertically. The point in the middle will give your owl lots of character. The less pointy the middle is, the ""nicer"" the owl will look. The deeper the point, the angrier the owl will appear. (In the image below, the red lines show the general shape—the black lines show the finished horns.)

, Draw curves from the top left and right, inward to about 1/4 the oval at the center, then back outward toward the bottom.

, Make elongated ovals at the bottom of your owl, three on each side, and then two horizontal lines for a perch. The perch doesn't have to be perfectly straight—it can look ""branchy."" Likewise, the talons don't have to be ovals—they can be pointed and sharp, which is especially good if you're making a mean owl.

, Make little ""U"" shapes around the area between the ""wings"" to look like little feathers.

, Place a narrow ""V"" slightly lower than the eyes for the owl's beak.

, If you want, color the ""wings"" brown, and the head and breast light tan.

, Add other details as you see fit. You can follow the suggestions below for adding light and shadow, or make up your own. Now that you know how to make an owl, you can create an entire flock of Halloween hooters!

Study your photo reference carefully and decide where you want your leopard to be on the page.,
Make some light tick marks on the actual page scaling up the placement you figured out in your composition thumbnail.,
Block in the cat.,
Look at the photo for where the features are placed.,
Now you will start sketching out the shape of the leopard's head until it is all drawn out.,
Lightly draw the lining for the cat's back, and then sketch out the thick, fury tail.,
Sketch out the belly of this animal and then draw out the legs and large paws.,
Shade the leopard to show the modeling shadows on its body.,
Your last drawing step is the tricky bit.,
Practice drawing leopards in different poses until you're comfortable with the leopard's anatomy.,
Practice drawing leopards from life on zoo visits.",How to Draw Leopards," Draw a little thumbnail sketch for the composition. You don't have to draw the animal perfectly for the thumbnail, if it's only an inch high and as wide proportionally as the paper for your final drawing you're just placing the cat and deciding how large it is in relation to the drawing. You'll surprise yourself at how easy it is to sketch the animal's overall shape that tiny though - it's an abstract shape, a squiggle that may have legs, ears and tail sticking out. Try several different compositions and use the one you like best. This is important practice for paying attention to the proportions too - your little thumbnails each make you understand the length of the body to height ratio and the curves of its pose.;
, Put a mark at the highest part of the leopard, a mark where the tail meets the body and another at the end of the tail, one where the edge is closest to the right, marks for where any protrusions like feet go and where the belly is. These marks are guides for proportion that will make your leopard look realistic. You can print out your reference photo and work out these proportions mathematically too. An easy way to do ""twice as large"" is to just use half inches for the units on the photo and full inches on your paper, for example. Try for an easy proportion that fits your page. Maybe 3/8"" to one inch will do it, or 3/4"" to one inch. Using a grid ruler is great because it gives you proportions in both directions at once.

, Start by drawing two overlapping egg shapes for the body. A cat's back bends sharply in the middle, if it's crouching or arching its back that bend is easy to see. It might be subtle but this will give a better proportion for a cat's long body even if you don't see that bend in that pose. Pay attention to the pose in your photo reference. If the leopard's at an angle facing you, the full length of the body may not show and the oval may be more like a cross section or mostly chest. Add shapes for the neck, legs, and head. Draw a curled tail line, and then move to the next step. With the tick marks in place, you will get these block-in shapes the right size in the right relation to each other. If a shape looks more rectangular than oval, sketch it like it is rather than insisting they all have to be ovals.

, You may want to use tick marks again to place the eyes and nose. A common problem in cat faces is that if the cat's head is at a slight angle, you can get the nose twisted funny by drawing it straight up and down with the page rather than at the same angle as the eyes. So doing tick marks for placing all three are good, then your cat's head angle will stay consistent! You will now start sketching out the shape of the face starting with the snout and lip. Then draw the bridge of the nose and shape of the eye.

, Once that is done you can add the chin, whiskers, and then the small ear shapes. The body of this animal is very hearty so don't skimp on width when it comes to sketching out the thick neck and chest.

, Every part of this animal has boldness and girth, so you must express that through your drawing. Add the solid spots, leopards are fluffy, so a hard line isn't as good to follow their back, break it a few times with light and then proceed on. Look at the photo to see whether the leopard's fur lays smooth or is fluffy - snow-sketchy lines in the direction of the fur.

, The belly should be hairy looking, belly hairs are fluffy so don't sketch this with a smooth hard line. Use short light strokes that follow the direction of the hairs and suggest hairs. Don't try to draw every hair. The hind legs should look large and meaty.

, Do this softly by smudging with a bit of soft graphite on your finger or a tortillon. Follow your photo reference for the shapes of body shadows. Ignore the spots and just see which areas are shiny highlights or light gold and which shadowed areas seem more of a dark gold or brown. This will make your cat look three dimensional and he may look a lot like a puma at this stage. Add a few light fur texturing strokes within the shadows to imply that the light areas are fluffy too.

, You need to do is sketch out each spot that is on the leopard's body. Since no one leopard is the same, you can pick and choose where you want your spots to be. You may want to erase some of the guidelines and shapes that you drew in earlier, but this isn't necessary - sometimes leaving guidelines in can make a drawing look cool. It's not a photo, it's a drawing, right? That's a style choice.


Look closely at the way the spots lay on different parts of the body. They may look rounded or stretch to narrow ovals by the angle of the skin. Getting the shapes right for what part of the body they're on is a major step in realism. Don't draw every spot. You are doing a leopard that's maybe a few inches long but the real cat is as large as you are - fewer spots in more or less the right relationship to the size of the animal are more effective at giving the impression it has a lot of spots. When they are distorted by perspective and flattened along the top of the back or wrapped around the tail, they help to describe three dimensional form as much as the shading does.

, They don't all need to be finished drawings with every spot detailed - sometimes just a few to indicate it's a leopard becomes enough in a working sketch. Keep this up and you may become a famous wildlife artist someday!

, Don't expect good finished drawings unless the cat sleeps for half an hour. Animals move. Life drawings can be left unfinished, start over if the leopard changes its pose. Try for poses the cat takes repeatedly while pacing back and forth or looking back at the crowd. Do a little, work on a different one, go back when it takes the pose again. You will learn a lot from life drawing even if your drawings from photos look more polished. Eventually these quick sketches can become references for lively poses you can't find in a source photo.

Open a new file.,
Define window attributes.To begin, we must specify how large we would like the cat image window to be.,
After specifying the window size, we may specify other window attributes, such as overall image quality and background color.,
Define colors that you will use for the cat.,
Here, the color data type can be defined as any name desired, then assigned an RGB or grayscale color number set or number.,
Draw the ears using four triangles.,
First, we choose the color we’d like the main part of the ears to be filled with.,
Then, we specify the x and y coordinates for the points in the triangles that form the ear shapes:


triangle(50, 50, 50, 90, 90, 60);
triangle(150, 50, 150, 90, 110, 60);

,
Next, we choose another color to fill the inside of the ears with:


fill(earsnose);

,
And last, we specify the x and y coordinates for the points forming the triangles for the inner ear:


triangle(55, 55, 55, 95, 95, 65);
triangle(145, 55, 145, 95, 105, 65);

,
Since the triangle function takes three sets of x and y coordinates for the window in which we are drawing the cat, we type those numbers in the order that we want the triangle’s points drawn.,
Draw the head in the center of the window.,
Here we are using another fill color for the circle we will draw to create the cat’s head.,
The next step in our drawing is to make the mean cat fangs.,
Essentially, we are drawing three long, skinny triangles to jut downward from the mouth area.,
Because we want the fangs to be partially covered by the cat’s nose area, we draw the nose area after we draw the fangs.,
Here, we choose a fill color and draw two matching ellipses over the fangs at the specified coordinates.,
Here, we choose a fill color for the nose, drawing a small triangle in the center of the cat’s face.,
Next, we place the eyes.,
Now, to draw the mean eyebrows, we type the following code:


strokeWeight(12);
line(90, 80, 70, 65);
line(110, 80, 130, 65);

,
Since we would like the eyebrows to be thick and menacing, we want to use a line function, and we want the line drawn to be very thick.,
The last part of the cat to draw is his whiskers.,
Notice that we must change the strokeWeight so that the lines aren’t drawn 12 pixels wide, as they were drawn for the eyebrows!,
Now that we’ve completed the cat drawing, it’s time to compile the program and run it.,
It is a good idea, when creating your own drawings, to periodically check the progress of the drawing by saving and running the program throughout the programming process.

,
Enjoy the mean cat and be glad your own cat is very nice.

",How to Draw a Mean Cat Using the Processing Programming Environment," To begin, open the Processing program. A “sketch,” or new file, will automatically be open and ready for typing. It will originally be labeled “sketch_xxxxxa,” with the current month and day in the x positions in the file name. You may rename the file to whatever you choose, by selecting File → Save As…, and typing a new name in the resulting window.;
, To do this, we type the following code:


size(200, 200);
This is the window size function, and we are passing two numbers that represent how many pixels high and wide we want the program to draw the window. Here, we ask the program to draw the window 200 pixels high and 200 pixels wide.

, Below are two functions we will type to do this:


smooth();
background(0);
The smooth function ensures that all geometric shapes drawn in this window will show with anti-aliased edges. This provides a higher quality image.
The background function takes a number argument, here a zero, that represents a color. Because zero is the color for black, the window’s background will now be returned as black.

, It is good programming practice to use variables to store data that will be used repeatedly throughout a program. In our case, we know that there are a few colors we may want to use more than once in our drawing. We also want to make the programming easier to read. This is why we define the RGB colors before we use them. Here are the colors you will need to draw your mean cat:


color cat body  = color(226);
color earsnose = color(237, 159, 176);
color black = color(0, 0, 0);
color facial = color(202, 200, 193);
color fang = color(249, 16, 85);

, The color “catbody” above has been assigned to color 226, which is a medium gray. The other colors use the RGB scale to define more specific hues. To learn more about RGB, grayscale, and other color-related information, please refer to Processing’s color tutorial at http://processing.org/tutorials/color/.

, Now that we know what colors we’ll be using, we will begin to draw the cat. The order in which we draw its features is important for the final display, because the program will draw each shape in the order it’s called. Let’s begin with the ears:

,


fill the cat's body.

,,,, The fill function takes a color as an argument and returns that color inside the triangles that follow the call. We now have ears!

, To draw the head, type the following:


fill(catbody);
noStroke();
ellipse(100, 100, 100, 100);

, The noStroke function specifies that we do not wish to have an outline around the shape following it. In this case, that shape is of course the cat’s head, which is drawn using the ellipse function. The ellipse function accepts four numbers: an x and y coordinate for the placement of the circle, and pixel width and height of the ellipse at that position.

, The following code does this for us:


fill(fang);
triangle(85, 130, 95, 130, 90, 146);
triangle(95, 120, 105, 120, 100, 146);
triangle(105, 130, 115, 130, 110, 146);

, We specify our fangs’ fill color, and then create the triangles using the triangle functions again.

, The code for this is as follows:


//draw muzzle
fill(facial);
ellipse(115, 120, 30, 30);
ellipse(85, 120, 30, 30);

,


//draw nose
fill(earsnose);
stroke(1);
triangle(100, 100, 90, 115, 110, 115);

, The stroke function brings back the outlining feature that we previously turned off, passing the number 1 to it to denote the grayscale level desired for the nose’s outline color.

, This is done by drawing gray circles containing smaller black circles within them. The code for this is as follows:


For the larger, gray circles:

fill(facial);
ellipse(80, 90, 20, 20);
ellipse(120, 90, 20, 20);


For the smaller, black circles:

fill(black);
ellipse(80, 95, 10, 10);
ellipse(120, 95, 10, 10);


Remember that the stroke function is still “on,” therefore the eyes will be outlined. This adds contrast and looks nice.

,, To do this, we call the strokeWeight function, passing the number of pixels wide we would like the line to be drawn. Then we simply call two line functions, which accept two sets of x/y coordinates, drawing lines between those points in the window.

, To draw whiskers, we again use the line function. The code for the whiskers is as follows:


strokeWeight(1);
line(115, 115, 135, 105);
line(117, 119, 135, 120);
line(115, 123, 135, 130);
line(85, 115, 65, 105);
line(83, 119, 65, 120);
line(85, 123, 65, 130);

, One pixel is enough width for a delicate whisker.

, First, save the file. Then to run the program and see the resulting window we’ve drawn, press the “play” button at the top of the window or press Ctrl + R. The cat will appear in its own 200 x 200 window.

You could just colour them black for a simple look, but for a shiny look, draw a tiny circle in the corner of the eye, then color all of the eye black, apart from that tiny white circle., Repeat on the right, and be sure that the muzzle is the right size to fit the face, just like with the nose., Add a line on the right too, and draw them to be the same length, as a lopsided tiger won't look as good as a symmetrical tiger., Leave a gap in the middle which will soon become legs. The lines you draw across should be the thickness of the leg - if you want skinny legs, leave a large gap in the middle of the lines, and for fat legs, a smaller gap., You should leave a gap between the head and the end of the line. Do this in both sides., The line you draw should be straight with no bumps., Connect back into the body, and don't do the same on the left. This should only be done on the right to add a 3D effect., Draw stripes on it, and color the one closest to the tip of his tail black.

The cross in the face should help you determine where the eyes, nose, and mouth go. The middle point of the cross should be at the approximate middle of the face.
Note that the head should overlap the body. The top line of the body should roughly match the horizontal cross-line of the face.;
, Sketch a draft of the kitten’s limbs. Each limb should be a rounded triangle coming off the bottom of the body rectangle. Note that the legs on the ""far"" side of the kitten should be slightly smaller than those on the ""near"" side.


Similarly, draw two large triangles over the top corners of the head. For a cartoonish look, these triangles should be bigger than those made for the legs.

, You can draw a wavy, rounded tail or a more angled one depending on personal preference. Either way, the tail should have at least one bend in it; do not draw the tail perfectly straight.

, Using the cross inside the square as guide, draw two small circles for the eyes, placing them evenly on either side of the vertical center and just above the horizontal center.


Add the nose and mouth. The nose should land on the vertical center and rest below the horizontal center. The mouth should look like a rounded ""W"" with the center attached to the bottom of the nose.

Erase guidelines, color in your drawing.",How to Draw a Cheetah1," Sketch a simple circle with an oval for the mouth and two round-sided triangles for the ears. Make sure the head isn’t too oversized for your paper, since you still have to fit in the rest of the cheetah’s body in proportion to it.;
, There should be two concentric arcs swooping from the snout to the ears, as well as small circles for the eye(s)/nose and a line to depict a slight snarl.

, Use shapes as guides for it. Draw three ovals: a small one for the neck, a large one for the upper body, and a medium one for the back. Add in circles to connect these shapes. Remember, a cheetah's body is longer in comparison to other big cats, so incorporate that into your drawing.

, Each leg has three ovals again, a large one at the top and two smaller ones at the bottom. Draw larger versions of these for the back legs.

, Don't forget to add a long tail! At this point you might be running out of room on the page, so if you want your cheetah’s tail can be raised up in alarm or curled between his legs.

, Don't forget to add its trademark spots! The image here displays generous application of fairly small spots onto the cheetah, but they can be as big/little/plentiful/sparse as you like. And in fact, they don’t even need to be spots, since some cheetahs have splotchy markings and some don’t have any pattern on their coats all.  After that erase anything outside your black line.

, Use yellow/gold for the majority of the body, with dark brown/black for the spots. You’re done!

Since the finished kitten will be lying on its back, the top of the head should be positioned slightly lower than the top of the body.
Instead of drawing the cross-line at the vertical and horizontal center, angle it so that it looks like an ""X"" meeting at the center of the circle.
The oval body should be about twice as long as the head (but roughly the same height).

, This will be the ball the kitten is playing with.


Note that this circle should be slightly smaller than the kitten's head.

, The complexity of the limbs can vary as desired.


For best results, most limbs should be drawn in two parts. The ""higher"" limbs should be a little longer, with lengthwise ovals overlapping on the ball, and rounded ovals connecting the paws to the body of the kitten. The ""lower"" limbs should be similar, yet smaller, since they would be less visible.

, The ears should be two triangles coming off the head of the kitten, sticking out horizontally to the side. The tail should be one long, rounded quadrilateral curving around the bottom of the kitten's body.

, Using the crossed line from your outline as guide, draw the kitten’s eyes, nose and mouth. You can also add the whiskers using long strokes.


The eyes should lie on the horizontal center line.
The nose should lie on the vertical center line, with the ""W"" shaped mouth connecting to it at the bottom.

, Sketch around the kitten’s face using small soft strokes to make it look furry.

, Sketch the same short soft strokes in drawing the kitten’s body and tail.

, When viewed from the top, you'll only see straight lines where the toes are. For the back paws (viewed from the bottom), you'll see the actual paw pad.


Darken the ball, as well.

, Clean the drawing by erasing unnecessary lines from the outline.

, You can add color as desired. The paw pads, nose, and eyes should vary from the color of the fur. You should also choose a different color for the ball.

The eyes should be positioned over the horizontal center line, and should be at equal distance away from the vertical center.
The nose should be on the vertical center line and below the eyes.

, Sketch a small circle for the mouth area covering as well the nose area. This circle should be below the eyes, yet should completely cover the nose and overlap the bottom of the head circle.

, This includes the legs and tail. The front legs should be two slightly curved lines coming off the front of the body oval, starting about three-quarters up and extending to the bottom, pointing away from the angle of the body.


The back legs should be two arrowhead shapes attached to the bottom of the oval.
The tail should be a curved line sticking out from the bottom back of the oval.

The body should only be a slight oval, and only slightly larger than the head.
The connecting line should reach the approximate middle top of both the head and the body.

, The mouth should be a small circle positioned at the bottom of the head, slightly overlapping the body oval, as well. The tail should begin near the back of the body oval, and should follow along the natural curve of the kitten toward the animal's face.

, The ears should be triangles coming off the top of the kitten's head. Since the kitten is sleeping, the bottom ear should be relatively flat/horizontal, while the top ear should be angled upward and away from the body.


Note that the ears should be approximately the same size as the mouth section of the kitten's face.

, The nose should be a small half-circle sitting at the edge of the mouth area. The eyes should be small, straight dashes crossing behind the mouth area and over a small portion of the face.


Since the kitten is sleeping, use lines to represent closed eyes instead of circles, which indicate open eyes.

, Make it about as big as the head, and position it slightly off-center yet overlapping the body.


The thigh should just barely brush against the bottom of the mouth area.

, Widen and fill out the tail. Darken the top edge of the thigh, as well as the lines smoothing out the connections between the body, head, and ears.

, Add more details like the detail of the ears and fur lines.


Consider adding thin triangular stripes or other patterns to the fur.

, Use any color desired. Note that the nose should be a different color, as should the top ear, since you'll be viewing the inner ear (this does not apply to the bottom ear; you'll see the outer furry portion of that one).


If you added stripes or other details, color those separate shades, as well.

",How to Draw a Cartoon Lion,"


Use a light colour pen or a pencil, you will draw the final outline in a darker colour later.;
, As shown in the picture the shape of the chest resembles a backwards, capital ""D"" - also slightly slanted to the left. The chest should be roughly the same width as the head and about one and a half times the length.

, At this point simply use lines to show the arms' gesture, then circles on the end to represent hands. In the example, the right arm is drawn like a ""C"" with the top meeting the join of the head and cheat (or neck). The left arm is more ""V"" shaped but also joining the neck but on the other side.

, Again use lines and circles at this point to represent the leg and foot. In the example the right leg is slightly curved while the left is slight but angled to the bottom left. This stance makes the lion look like he is storming at the viewer.

, As shown in the picture the ears are shaped like an up-side-down ""V"" but the sides are slightly curved. To show the softer, inside of the ear another line is drawn inside that is curved like a bridge.

,


Starting halfway on the top of the right ear draw a curve, similar to the top of his head, to halfway on the top of the left ear.
From halfway on the bottom on the right ear draw a line, again following the curve of the head, until you reach the arm.
Do the same on the other side.

Add a ""fringe"" that is also jagged.
Draw a ""W"" shape under the lions chin for a ""beard"".

, This time draw them thicker, not just lines. Look at the picture to see how to draw a bent arm. The paw should be drawn as a clenched fist - which means small bumps for each finger (only 3 needed and then a thumb).

, The eyebrow - or mono-brow! - is a line curved like a bowl with a horizontal, downwards tick at each end. Draw two dots underneath and touching the line, for eyes.

, The nose is a large bridge-curved line about halfway down the face with a small (thought larger than the eyes) circle underneath, but touching, in the center. The mouth is a simple smile - a line with the curve of a bowl.

, They should be roughly as thick as the arms but slightly thicker at the top than the bottom. The paws should be curved at the top but quite flat at the bottom. Separate the paws into claws (toes) with 3 curved lines.

, Make sure your lion is all joined up including drawing the back and torso lines.

, Choose your favorite shades, and fill in the details. Color pencils or special drawing markers are the best choices for those who wish to color traditionally. Another option is to color the starfish digitally with art software. If you have trouble deciding on the best colors, use pictures of real starfish as references.

Know that the harder the pencil, the softer the line will be. For hatching and cross-hatching, you will need a 2H pencil. For mid-tone areas, use an HB pencil.;
, Draw the first eye in the shape of a tilted almond. Be sure to leave space in-between, though, for the puppy’s muzzle. Next, sketch the second eye in the same shape on the opposite side; try and make them match. Now draw a circle in each eye for the eyeball. Then draw a smaller circle inside each for the pupils.At this point, everything is sketched in very lightly using a 4H pencil, which is one of your softer pencils.
Shade the pupils in with a 6B pencil. This will make them really dark. Only use this pencil for dark areas; otherwise it’s too hard to erase when you need to.

, Sketch it in the shape of a roundish-looking heart. Make it about the same size as one of the eyes. If you realize later that it’s not exactly where it should be, you can always redraw it later.

, Make it in the shape of a half-open circle with the open part on the top. Leaving it open will allow you draw the rest of the muzzle. Leave plenty of space around the nose that you just drew above.

, On one side of the half-open circle, start drawing a long, oblong shape. It will come up along one eye. When you reach the top of the head, cross over to the other side and back down. It will connect to the other side of the half-open circle.

, Place them directly over the eyes. You want them to tilt down towards each other. They almost look like two puffy clouds.

, Take a look at where the eyes are to determine where to start to draw the head. You don’t want it too close to the eyes or too far. When you’ve sufficiently visualized where to begin, start to draw the head.

, The top of the heart shape will be the top of the puppy's head. The bottom of the heart will be the chin. You want the bottom to be soft, though, not pointy.


It’s fine to use multiple, sketchy strokes for this rough draft. In other words, if the lines overlap, it’s okay.

, Starting at the top of the head on one side, draw a puffy, oblong shape (almost like a half-donut). The bottom of it will stop at about the same height as the nose. Sketch the other ear.

, To hatch, you simply draw small lines closely to each other. To cross-hatch, go over these same lines but in the opposite direction. They will look like tiny patches when you’re finished., Shade it in with hatching and cross-hatching strokes, leaving a few white areas. With the same method, shade in the top part of the heart-shaped head. For the right ear, just shade in the left-third of it and finish with a few curvy, soft lines in that area.

, Shade all around the eyes as if the puppy is wearing a mask. If you look at real puppies and dogs, they usually have a mask, too. Mix the area up with some hatching and some cross-hatching strokes.


Visualize how hair grows in a particular area, and sketch in the same direction. A 2H pencil works best for this.
Use soft, light strokes when shading. For extra-dark areas, use a 6B pencil, which is very soft.

, If your wolf is a pup then you should erase and make the wolf smaller, also give the wolf blue eyes and a ""innocent and cute"" expression, big eyes add to that and a tiny smile or a small, active  tail helps lots. If the female is yearling (around a year of age) then she should look mature but do not add grey hairs and make the markings lighter and the eyes are no longer blue.

, Once you have an idea, make an oblong shape for the head. Sketch it in using light, pencil strokes. If you see that it’s a bit off, simply erase and lightly sketch it again. It sometimes takes a few times to get certain areas you are drawing just right.

, Sketch it right underneath where you made the two curvy lines for the snout. You can either give the puppy a long, drooping tongue or with just the tip coming out. Both are cute.

When you’re finished, your drawing will be of a puppy standing up.

, Starting at the back of his head, draw two lines going out at an angle on each side. Then curve these same two lines down and around alongside his head. You want cute, perky ears so only come about a third of the way down.

, Many cartoon characters start out with these same kinds of shapes. It just takes practice to understand the process. Then you’ll have it down. Draw with light lines so you can easily erase them later if you need to., When you’re finished, this will be a beautiful marking over one eye. Don’t worry about shading. You’ll do that later.

, Draw it slightly above where the two lines cross in the circle. Make a smaller half-circle right below that for the mouth. Remember to sketch lightly in case you need to erase and redraw it later.

, Sketch another ellipse on the other side. Basically, you are drawing two elongated noodles to represent the sides of the puppy’s wide, smiling mouth. Next, where you drew the oblong shape for the nose earlier, right in the middle draw a smaller, triangular-shape to make a button nose.

, For the front legs, draw the first one in an oblong shape. Make it larger at the bottom to give the puppy big paws. Sketch a few lines for nails. Draw the opposite leg but make it a little bit smaller since we see the other paw first. Now draw the back legs using the same oblong shape; make these legs a little smaller than the front.


Most kitten and puppy cartoon characters have big paws, and it will make your puppy look extra-cute., Sketch it coming out of the half-circle that you drew in an earlier step. Take your time. The tongue in a cartoon puppy is a cute feature. Now give your puppy a pointy, curvy tail.

, Using a soft pencil, outline the contours of the body. Shade in the ellipse around the one eye. Darken in the top of his back, ears and tail. Shade in the inside of his mouth and pupils. Lightly shade in the rest of his body, leaving the belly and paws white.

Find a reference photo to help you correctly portray the dalmatian.,

Check that the paws look correct, as this is one of the harder things to get correct.,
Finish cleaning up your outline and give the features a more defined look by cleaning up their edges.,
Using thin lines, start to create fur only in areas with shadows.,
If you're working digitally, select an airbrush tool.,
Start to add on the dots.,
Add a subtle shadow underneath the dog, being careful not to darken the feet too much.",How to Draw a Dalmatian," Draw a rough outline, making sure to get accurate shapes and most importantly good proportions.


Try to draw shapes as you see them in order to get a more accurate drawing.
Getting accurate proportions will be easier if you compare size and distance of features in your reference photo. An example of this is noticing the size of an eye compared to the ear in the reference photo. You should try to get as close to these proportions as you can in your drawing.;
, Don't go too crazy with details yet, just imply that features will be there. Start cleaning up your outline.


Again be sure you are checking the distances between and sizes of features compared to your reference photo.

, Note in the picture the distance between the feet as well as any types of curves in the leg or toes. Use your photo to clean up the area and add a bit more detail.


, The thinner you make the outline the more realistic it will look in the end.


Leaving thicker lines where there would be more shadows (ex: belly, between legs, underside of neck, tail and chin) can create a feeling of depth if done correctly. In order to do this, the areas with more light will need to have thinner lines. (ex: the top of the head, back and tail)

, This will create the illusion that the whole body is furry without the extra effort of drawing hairs everywhere. Treat the fur like you would shading; the more shadow an area would get the more fur you should put there. Notice in your reference photo where fur is most visible.


, If working on paper, use a soft pencil. Start shading where you want to add depth. The shading should generally follow where you put fur. Be sure to pay attention to your reference photo and where you can see underlying bones and muscles creating a shadow.

, If using a reference photo, remember it is just a guide; don't feel obligated to place the dots exactly where they are on the photo. Dots often curve when they raise up or cave in over body structures, so when working next to the edge of a leg, etc make sure to pay attention to the difference in shape.

, Go through and make sure the fur and dots are how you would like them, as well as the features such as the eyes and nose.

Draw the dog first.,
Use the figurine as a guide.,
Pay special attention to the texture of the fur.,
Sketch the scene surrounding the dog.",How to Draw a Dog Using a Figurine As a Model2," Any size is fine, but if your are thinking of putting the dog in an outdoor setting, allow a large, 11” x 14” piece of paper. The same goes for an indoor setting. How large do you want to make the dog, if it is going to be a portrait and how much of the environment do you want to include in your painting? It is up to you, but it‘s best to allow a lot of space on your paper because having the room to expand is better than wishing you‘d allowed more paper at the start., Put everything on a solid work table and prepare your colors, either by activating each dry pad of color with a brushfull of water or squeezing pigments onto a palette. Drop a small amount of water on freshly squeezed paint, too., Tackling the most difficult thing immediately is a good strategy, if only to know that a major hurdle has been crossed. Since the dog is your subject and most likely the focus of the painting, take your time and get it right. Keep in mind you will be coloring the scene shortly and drawn guide lines are helpful., Working from a statue gives you the information you need in three dimensions. Study the shapes, planes and detailed areas of the dog as carefully as you study the outline which defines his breed., Look with an eye to planning how you will depict the fur, describing it to yourself; rough, smooth, shaggy, feathered, etc. Do the same with color and distribution of spots and the like., Even if it is just cushions or drapes in the case of a portrait, indicate what will go where."
"
Decide where you want to start painting.,
Think about contrast.,
Paint until you feel the piece is as done as you can make it.,
Make edits and corrections after the piece is thoroughly dry.,
Try out a different breed of dog in your next painting.",How to Draw a Dog Using a Figurine As a Model3," One idea is to do the difficult or most important part first. There is no hard and fast rule about where to begin. Just jump in. Let the completed area dry before painting too close to it to keep the colors from running together. If you must place a wet area next to another damp area, reserve a tiny dam or line of white paper to keep the shapes from merging. Use a hairdryer if necessary.

, If one area is detailed, you might want to show it off against a more loosely painted area. If the colors are intense in one area, you might want to soften them in another. Look for contrasts; cold/warm soft/hard, textured/plain, etc. Listen to and trust your instincts., Stop and distance yourself from it. Allow time for it to dry. Stand it up and step back. Before long, the painting will “talk” to you and things that need changing, adding to or taking away will become obvious., Use a scrubbing brush with short bristles in tiny areas and a piece of white eraser pad for the kitchen to remove or lighten larger spans of color. Once again, allow the piece to dry before attempting to paint over an area., Or simply turn the statue and do the dog from a new angle. Using a realistic statue or figurine of a dog provides loads of useful information. You can see right before you the structure of the dog and how parts are related to one another.

Darken shaded areas to give a sense of light and dark.,
Add the mane and tail.,
Use your own judgement.,
Touch up.,
Add background.,
Sign the work.,
Finished.",How to Draw a Realistic Looking Horse1," This is optional, but it is very helpful to have a picture as a guide when drawing.;
, Get to know how the head, body, mane, tail, etc. of a horse look. Also learn about where the legs of a horse are positioned when they are moving. This will help to create a realistic horse, and is also helpful when you don't have a picture for a reference.

, Start with a few ovals and circles for the body. Make the head by drawing a large oval or circle, then a small circle near it for the muzzle. Connect them with two lines to make a head shape. Then use two lines to connect the head and body. This will create the neck. For the legs, draw straight lines, with circles for the joints. Add a curved line for the tailbone. Note: If you need to, you can trace the basic outline from the picture instead. Later you can practice drawing the basic outline yourself.

, Darken the curves of the body and head. 'Flesh' out the legs. This is also a good time to sketch in shapes for the mane and tail. make sure you don't darken the lines too much. If you do, it will be hard to fix if you make a mistake, and it will take out that 'realistic' look. Animals are soft, fleshy creatures, and don't have hard, stone carved lines.

, Lightly color in the horse. Don't worry about shadows, or markings. Smudging the shading helps to give the horse a soft, 'live' look. Make sure to erase the circles.

, It's important to remember where your 'source of light' is coming from. make sure you don't darken the 'highlights' of the horse. Also, the darkness of your shading depends on what color your horse is. If you are drawing a light colored horse, use less shading on the overall horse. If you're drawing a dark colored horse, use more. Again, smudging helps to make it more realistic. Also, be sure to use the picture as a reference! This will really help with your shading!

, If they are white, you may not need to shade at all. Just add soft lines to show texture. If they are very dark (Such as black) Shade it to a very dark gray. Then add black lines to show texture.

, If something doesn't look right, fix it! That's what erasers are for. Also, it's a good idea to add your own personal touches here and there. You don't have to copy the picture exactly.

, Erase any shading that got where it isn't supposed to be. Fix minor things. Add final touches to the shading.

, You don't have to add background if you are happy with your picture. If you are inexperienced with drawing, this may be challenging; but if you want to try, go for it!

, Add your signature to your drawing.

, If you want, you can still do a bit of 'touching up'. Drawings never really have to be 'finished' if you want to continue adding on to it.

If you aren't quite comfortable drawing horses at first, just spend some time sketching simple bodies/faces before hand.;
, You will be able to zoom in if you have difficulty seeing certain details. This will help you draw the correct shapes.

, This will create the angle of the body, mainly vertical or horizontal. You don't want the distance to be awkward!

, If it is going over a jump, the upper body will be tilted upwards. If the horse is landing, the front should tilt downwards. Use circles for the chest and hindquarters of the horse.

, Make sure to watch the proportions! Add muscle detail if you want.

, If it is landing, it will be the other way around. Horse always land on one hoof, placing all their weight here.

, Make sure that there is a reasonable gap between the horses' legs and the top of the obstacle, unless its very high so that it is clearly difficult. It can be brushing the obstacle here.

, Make changes if the angle is strange. Finish the legs completely, along with the hooves. If something doesn't look right, take a closer look!

, The neck should be arched, but not to a distressing degree. Try and mimic the position of the horse's neck and head in the picture. Depending on the height of the obstacle and the completion of the jump, the position will vary.

, Add all the necessary muscle features.

, Make sure that the mane and tail are not flat, but blown back.

, If you like the result, fill in the actual obstacle and draw or sketch the immediate surroundings if you haven't done so already.

Imagine the artificial light.,

Use your pencil to add shadows on the circles.,
Show the light areas.,
Start showing the cast shadow.,
Smudge the farther area of the cast shadow.,
Add darker shades on the nearer areas.",How to Draw a Shadow1," Knowing what kind of light that creates the shadow is very important in drawing shadow. That way, you will know where the direction of the shadow should be drawn which is against that specific light source. Train your eyes to see like an artist, let us start by you imagining a light bulb at the middle of your drawing.;
, These circles will serve as the subjects of your drawing. This way, you will see how the light source affected the shadow based on where the subject was placed.

, Draw harder or darker lines on the circles to show the shadows. The shadows are the shades within clear boundaries or the subject that receive no or little light. Use hatching or crosshatching while trying to show the shades. Make sure that you don’t let any shade go out of the circle. The darker areas should be the areas that are against the light source.

, Use your eraser to show the light areas. This is to emphasize that the light areas are conforming to the light source or to make it simple, the light is bouncing from the artificial light to the subject that is facing the light source.

, Always remember that the shadow is against light. So when a subject is placed beside a light source, the shadow should show on the surface where the light is blocked by the subject. Again, keep in mind where the subject is placed to know where the cast shadow should be drawn.

, Use your finger to smudge the farthest areas on the cast shadow. This effect shows that the cast shadow is far from the light.

, This is to show shadowing effects. The nearer the cast shadow on the boundary line of the subject, the less transparent the cast shadow should be.

Add relevant items to the female elf drawing.,

Color your elf.",How to Draw a Girl Elf," Follow the guidance shown in this image, focusing in particular on:

Creating a lithe and fine body structure; convey a smallish and slim size
A fine and pointed face and head
A strong but equally dainty stance.;
, Elf ears are pointed but still retain an elegance without looking odd. This may take some reshaping until you're satisfied with the end result, so use light and even pencil strokes. Follow the image for help (you can even trace over the image until you have the knack of drawing it yourself).

This is a good point to draw the eyes. The image here uses anime style eyes, which give an ethereal and cute quality at the same time. You could experiment with other eye styles as well, if preferred.
Detail her long hair; the character shown here has the hair in plaits but it can also be loose, drawn up into a bun or braided knots, etc. Whatever you choose, be sure to make it a feature of the female elf.

, Typical elf clothing fits tightly to the body and provides ease of movement for swift running, horse-riding and general movement. You may also like to define your female elf by her activities, such as being a warrior, cook, farmer, comedian, princess, etc.







A warrior elf outfit - see the additions of a belt and armor.

, These items might be jewels, a wooden spoon, a wand, a brush, a leash, or a weapon such as the sword shown here. What you choose an object should help to convey what the female elf does or represents., Green is a fairly standard color but any colors typical of forest or wood life work well, such as browns, blues, oranges, muted reds and the like."

",How to Draw a Color Wheel," The color wheel is a standard method used for explaining the mixing of colors. It is used to separate the spectrum into 12 different colors. The color wheel shows you how colors are related to each other and what different effects can be achieved when they are used alongside and opposite each other.



Primary colors: Primary colors must be transparent, all 3 primary colors mix to black, not brown. Read red right. Transparent yellow PY150 is at the top, to the right is transparent magenta PR122, the third transparent primary is cyan PB15. They are called primary colors because they cannot be obtained by mixing any other pigments. These colors, plus white form the basis of all colors used for in the painting art. Any transparent color can be made opaque by adding white. Red, blue and green pigments are secondary colors.

Secondary colors: They are made by mixing together two primary colors.

Transparent Yellow + Transparent Magenta = Scarlet, Red and Orange.
Transparent Yellow + Transparent Cyan = Yellow-green, Green and Turquoise.
Transparent Cyan + Transparent Magenta = Blue, Purple and Violet.



Tertiary colors: Are created by mixing a secondary color with an equal amount of a primary color.

Complements: Complementary colors are opposite across the color wheel, they go well together.

Split-complements: Use any 3 analogous colors. The center analogous color has an opposite color, that is part of the split-complement. Split-complements when mixed make a neutral dark color, black.;

, We will use buildings as subject in drawing shadows.

,, In here you will start to notice the difference between the artificial shadow and natural shadow. Natural shadows show when the light source comes from either the sun or the moon which are natural sources of light. Natural shadows have the same direction no matter how large the area is. It will only change if you go into the area where the natural light source’s light is directly facing the point of view of the artist. Examples are sunrise or sunset drawings where the sun is placed at the upper middle part of the landscape. That also applies on full moon drawings where the moon is placed at the middle of the landscape. On the other hand, artificial shadows are created with artificial lights like light bulbs, night lamps, spotlights, streetlights and so on.

Layer your colors to create a blending effect.,
Utilize a blender pencil.,
Spread colored pencil with a bristle brush.,
Smudge colors to imitate blending.",How to Blend With Prismacolor Pencils1," By layering one color on top of another, you can lighten or darken it to accomplish the hue you have in mind. This should be done lightly and with as few strokes as possible. You can always add more of your layer color, but once added, it'll be difficult, if not impossible, to remove.


You can lighten dark colors with a layer of a lighter color, like white, over top. This can also help with softening colors, like the one found in skin tones.;
, This tool looks like a clear colored pencil and it is intended specifically for blending colored pencils. It is sometimes referred to as a colorless blender. Rub this tool firmly upon the colors you are trying to blend and pass it back and forth until the desired level of blending is reached.By spreading a thick layer-color over a base-color with your blender pencil, you can create a glaze effect over top the base. This will also impart a blended effect to your artwork.

, With a moderately stiff bristle brush, you can drag colors you've already applied to the page around it. Thin coverage will give your colors a lighter tone; thick concentration will intensify the color. Colors spread together will blend.


You may have to experiment with this and get some experience before you become fully comfortable with the technique.
You should choose your brush with regard to the paper you have used. Thicker paper may allow you to use stiffer brushes for easier blending. Thinner paper might require a soft bristle brush and gentle blending over time.
You should also be able to use a torillion to push colors around the page to create either increased or decreased brightness., Though paper and tortillions won't be effective for blending, a cloth can be used to smudge colors together to attain this look. You may want to start by smudging a small, inconspicuous area with a tiny piece of cloth to see how the colors blend before attempting to blend the main parts of your art.


Some cloth might blend differently than others or create a unique effect in your drawing. Testing your cloth beforehand can prevent unintended effects when blending."

Try tick hatching.",How to Cross Hatch," To add hatching to your drawing, you'll need to draw a series of parallel lines over the area you wish to shade.








There are two types of basic hatching: parallel and contour. With parallel hatching, the lines will remain straight and usually run vertically or horizontally. With contour hatching, the lines follow the contour of the outline containing them.
Regardless of which hatching type you use, the lines do not cross over one another in standard hatching. Additionally, either version of hatching (parallel or contour) can be used as a base for cross hatching.;
, To add cross hatching to your drawing, you'll need to start with a base of standard hatch marks, then add a layer of perpendicular hatch marks over the first set.









This second layer of hatch marks should cross over the first in perpendicular or near-perpendicular directions. The lines of the second layer should not cross over one another, though.
Your cross hatch marks should match the hatch mark type used in your base layer. In other words, if you started with parallel hatch marks, your cross hatch marks should also be parallel; if you started with contour hatch marks, your cross hatch marks should also be contour.

, To vary the depth and darkness of the cross hatching, you'll need to vary the number of lines you use. Fewer lines create lighter shade, but more lines create darker shade.








There are two ways to accomplish this task. You can either change the density of the lines in both layers or change the number of layers.
By sketching more hatch and cross hatch marks, and by positioning them closer together within an area, you can make that area appear darker and more heavily shaded.
Alternatively, you can create your first hatch and cross hatch layers, then sketch additional layers of cross hatching running in different directions. Note that the lines within each layer should still run parallel to one another.

, Since cross hatching typically requires you to position thin lines close together, you'll need to create the effect using a fine-tip drawing utensil.


Even if you want the final drawing to be inked, it's still a good idea to start the drawing with pencil. Use a standard ""number two"" pencil, but make sure that the tip of the pencil is sharpened to a fine point.
For your inking tool, opt for either a nibbed pen or fine-tip ink pen. Both options work well, so choose whichever instrument you feel more comfortable handling.

, Before cross hatching, you'll need to draw the actual shape or object you want to shade.








You can use nearly any image. When practicing the technique, however, it might be best to choose a three-dimensional geometric shape with clear, angular lines.
For this step, it's also best to draw the outline in pencil. You can trace over it in ink later on.

, Before adding any hatch marks, figure out which areas of the drawing should have the lightest shading and which areas need heavier shading.









Think about how an imaginary light source would hit the object and reflect off its surface if both the object and light were real.
Note that the absolute lightest sections will have no hatch or cross hatch marks. Your imaginary light source would hit these areas directly, so they shouldn't have any shadows.
Areas and surfaces further away from your imaginary light source should be darker and will ultimately require more cross hatching.

, Sketch your base layer of standard hatch marks into the outline. Keep the hatch marks in each section parallel to one another, even if they curve along the contours of the outline.









For this step, use a pencil and press lightly.
Place more hatch marks closer together in sections that need heavier shading. For sections that need lighter shade, space the hatch marks further apart and use fewer hatch marks overall. The base hatch marks should indicate which areas are darker than others even before you add the cross hatching.

, Sketch a layer of perpendicular or near-perpendicular cross hatch marks over the base layer of hatch marks.








Try to keep the spacing, number, and placement of these cross hatch marks similar to that of the base hatch marks. In other words, areas of the drawing with more hatch marks should also have more cross hatch marks.
By the end of this step, you should be able to easily determine which areas of the drawing are supposed to be darker than others.

, Take a step back and assess the overall drawing. Make any necessary adjustments to the hatching and cross hatching before continuing to the next step.









If certain areas need to be darker, try adding more layers of cross hatching to those sections.
If you need to make an area lighter or if you're completely unsatisfied with certain sections, you can erase the existing marks and start over.

, Once you're satisfied with the placement and amount of cross hatch marks, trace over the pencil marks with your inking tool.









When working with a nibbed pen, dip it in the ink, then draw a line on a separate piece of scrap paper before moving to your drawing. Doing so allows you to unload some of the excess ink and prevent it from bleeding onto the drawing itself.
Trace over the outline of the drawing first, then work on tracing each section of cross hatch marks. Work carefully and try to follow your previously created marks as closely as possible. You can add additional cross hatch marks as needed, but try not to get carried away since you won't be able to undo any of the marks you make in this step.
Note that any pencil marks that are still visible after inking might make the drawing look darker than the final piece will look, so don't worry too much if the overall drawing looks darker than anticipated right now.

, Allow the ink to dry, then use an eraser to carefully remove any visible pencil marks from the drawing.









You must wait for the ink to dry before you attempt any erasing. If you swipe the eraser over the drawing while the ink is still wet, you'll smear the ink and ruin the crispness of your cross hatching.

, Take another step back and look at your drawing. If you need to add more cross hatching to any particular area, do so now.









For this step, you can skip the pencil cross hatching and work directly with the ink. Adding pencil hatch marks to ink hatch marks won't give you an accurate portrayal of the end result.
Once you finish making these adjustments, the overall cross hatching process is finished.

, To apply partial cross hatching to a drawing, start with your base layer of hatch marks and only add a layer of cross hatch marks over part of that base.









This practice is a good way to add gradual shading to an outline. The sections of hatch marks left alone will create a lighter appearance, but the sections of that also include cross hatch marks will look darker.

, Basket hatching, also called ""woven hatching,"" is a particular type of hatching that makes the shading appear woven throughout the entire outline.









Instead of keeping the hatch marks parallel to one another, create short sets of parallel marks in one direction, then add another set of short, nearly perpendicular marks directly next to the first. Create as many short marks as needed to fill up the entire space, alternating the direction of each set without crossing over any of your previous marks.
If you want to add more density to the drawing, you can also apply cross hatch marks over your basket hatching.

, Tick hatching requires you to use very short, parallel strokes (called ""ticks"") to create density and shade throughout the drawing.









Unlike other forms of hatching and cross hatching, this style works best if you use a thicker pen instead of a fine-tip pen.
The ticks you draw should all be parallel to one another, but you can pile the marks on top of each other to add heavier shadow to a particular part of the drawing.
Note that cross hatching isn't often applied over a base layer of tick hatching.

Choose a coloring book that appeals to you.,
Select your coloring utensils.,
Find a surface to color on.,
Decide what colors you are going to use.,
Choose the best place to begin coloring.,
Color along the lines first and work your way in.",How to Color in a Coloring Book1," There are countless coloring books created specifically for kids, so finding one that suits your interests or mood should not be too difficult.


You are not necessarily limited to actual coloring books. Tons of printable coloring pages are available online and many of them are free.;
, Crayons and water-based markers are both great for kids. Gel pens are another fun option.


If you are using water-based markers that have become dried out, try reviving them by submerging the marker’s tip in warm water for roughly five seconds., If you are using a loose leaf coloring page you will need to find a hard surface to work on, while coloring books allow you more flexibility.


When using on loose sheets of paper, you may want to cover your work surface in newspaper depending on the coloring utensils you’ve chosen (markers may bleed through your paper and leave behind marks).
When using coloring books, you can use your lap as a coloring surface if you’d like to draw while in bed on the couch, for example. You may still find it easier to have a more flat and solid surface to work on, though.

, For example, you might want to only use cool colors (blues, purples, and dark greens) or only use warm colors (reds, oranges, yellows, and light greens). Or, you might prefer to use all of the colors of the rainbow in your picture.


Regardless of the colors you choose, having a rough idea of how you’d like your completed piece to look can help you create a picture you’re satisfied with.

, Some drawing utensils (such as gel pens or markers) are more likely to smear than others.


If you think your utensils could smudge, either color the center of your picture first and work your way outwards, or to start at the top of your page and work your way down.
If you are not concerned about smudging, you can begin coloring wherever you’d like.

, Coloring along the edges of a distinct area first and then working your way work way in will help prevent you from coloring outside of the lines.


You may also find it helpful to filling in one distinct section completely before moving on to another section.

"
"
MANES: If you decide your horse is depicted as running, think of a mane position that goes with its body, or else you could have a running horse with a straight 'down the neck' mane when it should have a 'scattered' mane(the mane would be flowing backwards and straight up in the air.If the horse is standing draw its mane straight down the neck.,
TAILS: A Running horses' tail will fly out behind the horse, but if the horse looks Arabian draw the tail held up high(like a flag).,
If your drawing is a pony make sure to add layers of pencil streaks to make the mane look thick, draw the mane at a medium length.A draft horse usually has a short mane with with not as much hair layers.,
Remember when drawing manes and tails, just go with what look suits best with the horses action.",How to Add Details to a Horse Drawing2," If the background makes it look windy draw the mane flowing sort of backwards in places. If the horse is rearing draw the mane flying back away from the neck(the mane shouldn't touch the neck only at the roots.) If the horse is bucking draw the mane what-ever way you like, just make sure its in the air.

,  A standing horses' tail is your choice. A rearing horse will have the tail flowing on an angle like this-->      \          A bucking  horse will have the tail high in the air by the back legs, it will also have a curve in it.

, But some drafts such as the Gypsy Vanner have extremely long manes with thick layers.Normal riding horses manes can vary, chose the length/look you think fits.

, Feel free to add braids or other hair styles that look good, experiment with what braid look seems the best. (By braid look I mean that there are many braid styles for horses, like the jumpers and the special draft braids). Add in ribbons in the mane or tail if you think it goes with the scene. If the horse is at a fair in the drawing, add a bow on the tail.(Different coloured bows on tails can mean lots of things like: I kick, I bite, I'm for sale, I'm a stallion, mare, or a yearling, Etc.

When drawing a draft remember to draw in the 'feathering'.,
Do you want your horse to have leg markings?",How to Add Details to a Horse Drawing3," Feathering is the long white bunches of hair that usually grow long enough to cover drafts hoofs/hooves. Some types of drafts don't have feathering, just add some extra hair to the horses hocks/ankles.

, Horses have white marks on legs called markings, not all of them have them. Choose what type of styles of leg markings you want like stockings, socks, coronet or even plain. If you show the horses face remember to add a white marking if you like, since most horses have them their too. The style could be blaze, stripe, star or snip.

"
"
Once you are done adding those details, you can add tack or equipment, such as: Saddles, bridles, saddle blankets, breast plates, horseshoes, halters with or without lead rope, polo wraps/leg wraps and ear bonnets.,
Once done all that, colour your horse!",How to Add Details to a Horse Drawing4," Make sure to choose a style of equipment either Western or English or else the horse would look silly all dressed up in dressage equipment(an english competition) with a bulky western saddle. If you like even add a rider.

, Colour the equipment too! If the horse is suppose to look real use black or brown for the leather saddles or bridles since that is the most common colour for them.

Add your colored pencil to the image.,
Choose your solvent for blending.,
Brush on your solvent to blend the Prismacolors.,
Allow your blended Prismacolors time to dry.",How to Blend With Prismacolor Pencils2," You're going to be breaking down the lead of your Prismacolors to blend the colors together, so you'll first need all your color on the page. Start with your base and add strokes of other color. These accent colors will blend with the base once the solvent is added.Sometimes after drawing with Prismacolors you might notice a waxy buildup on the colored areas. If this makes your blending more difficult, you can wipe away the waxy film with a soft, dry cloth.

, In most cases, mineral spirits should be sufficient for your blending efforts, though there are specific brands intended for this purpose, like Gamblin Gamsol Odorless and Weber Terpinoid natural. Pour a small amount of this solvent in a small, resealable glass container.These kind of solvents can break down certain common plastics over time. Due to this effect, you should avoid using a plastic container for your solvent.
You won't need much solvent for blending. A little bit goes a long way, so a small container will likely serve your purposes best.
A resealable container is especially helpful when you are drawing often with Prismacolors. This way you can reuse your solvent easily.

, Using too much solvent can cause your colors to become runny. It may take some time and practice before you get the knack for adding the right amount of solvent. Generally, you should:


Dip an inexpensive synthetic brush into your solvent. Remove the brush, then blot excess solvent from it with a paper towel.
Brush your solvent lightly onto the area you are blending with your brush. Continue blending, little by little, until you achieve the desired effect., Eventually, the solvent will evaporate and your blended Prismacolor lead will return to its original consistency. Keep your artwork level to prevent colors from accidentally running.


Depending on how much solvent you needed to use while blending, your solvent blended art may be dry in less than an hour. In some cases, this may take up to a day to completely dry.

Cover unused areas on the page.,
Use a pencil extender to get your money's worth.,
Remove wax buildup.,
Remove marks made with your Prismacolors.,
Treat your Prismacolor pencils gently.",How to Blend With Prismacolor Pencils3," Over the course of your blending, it's easy to accidentally spread color to an area you hadn't intended. To prevent this, you might cover the areas you don't want blending with removable tape.For large areas, to save on tape you might decide to use a piece of scrap paper held in place by a few small pieces of tape.

, Prismacolor pencils can be very expensive, so it's a good idea to get the most out of every pencil you purchase. A pencil extender will allow you to hold the end nub of a used pencil more easily so you can use every last bit., Wax is a component used in manufacturing your colored pencils. Over time it can rise to the surface of your drawing to create buildup on the image. This can be removed without harming your artwork by wiping it away firmly with a clean, dry cloth or moderately stiff bristle brush.You'll often find that wax buildup occurs in areas you have heavily applied your colored pencil to a specific area. Keep an eye on these areas for buildup., Prismacolor pencils leave behind marks that can be difficult to erase, though you may have some success with a normal eraser. However, it's likely you'll have the best success with an electric eraser. You can also lift unwanted marks by applying and peeling free adhesive putty, like the kind used to hang posters and artwork.Even with an electric eraser, it's likely some remnant of the Prismacolor will remain. Avoid erasing too much to try and completely erase the mark. Doing so could result in a ripped page., The colored cores of your Prismacolors are relatively fragile and can break from dropping or rough handling. These breaks can result in inconsistent drawing or wasted lead, so you may want to keep your pencils in a box or case to keep them protected."

Color along the lines first and work your way in.,
Use varying amounts of pressure to create the illusion of shadows.,
Blend colors and shades to create dimension.,
Vary your strokes to add depth to your drawing.",How to Color in a Coloring Book2," Coloring books geared towards adults have enjoyed a recent surge in popularity, so you have many options to choose from.Note that you are not necessarily limited to actual coloring books, as there are many printable coloring pages designed for adults are available online, many of which are free.

, Popular options include colored pencils, colored pens (e.g. Sharpie brand fine point markers), or art markers (Artist’s Loft Triangle Markers are a good cheap option, while Copic markers are a popular higher-end product).If you are using pencils, be sure to sharpen them before you begin your coloring project, as this will allow you to have more precision in your coloring.

, If you are using a loose leaf coloring page you will want to find a hard surface to work on, while coloring books allow you more flexibility.


When using on loose sheets of paper, you may want to cover your work surface in newspaper depending on the coloring utensils you’ve chosen (permanent markers, for example, may bleed through your paper and leave stains).
When using coloring books, you can use your lap as a coloring surface if you’d like to draw while in bed on the couch, for example.

, You might, for example, choose to only use cool colors (blues, purples, and dark greens) or only use warm colors (reds, oranges, yellows, and light greens) for your project, or you may choose to mix many different hues together.


No matter what colors you ultimately choose, having a rough idea of how you’d like your completed piece to look will help ensure that you are satisfied with your final product.

, Some drawing utensils (such as gel pens, colored pens, or markers) are more likely to smear than others.


If you think your utensils could cause unwanted smudging, it can be helpful either to color the center of your picture first and work your way outwards, or to start at the top of your page and work your way down.
If you aren’t worried about smudging, begin coloring wherever you’d like.

, Coloring along the edges of a distinct area first and then working your way work way in will help prevent you from coloring outside of the lines.


You may also find it helpful to filling in one distinct section completely before moving on to another section.

, This technique, referred to as shading, adds depth and dimension to your picture. Simply vary the amount of pressure that you are apply with your coloring utensil depending on how light or dark you’d like a given area to be.


Pressure shading is easiest to do with pencil.
While shading is completely optional, creating depth or shadows in your picture can make it appear more realistic and detailed.

, Another way to add depth is to blend different shades or colors together to achieve different values.


Example: if you want to create the appearance of shadow, try using a deeper blue (or red, or yellow, etc.) to create darker areas and a lighter blue for highlighted areas.
This method can work with pencils, pens and markers.

, Crosshatching is a popular and fairly simple way to create depth using variation in strokes. Crosshatching is done by drawing overlapping sets of lines at right angles (this pattern should look mesh-like). For darker areas, draw these lines closer together. To create highlights, leave more space between each line, or don’t draw any lines at all."
"

Assemble your supplies.,
Decide the area where you want your colour and tie back excess hair around the area (this is obviously optional, but it prevents the marker slipping and spotting on areas that you don't want coloured.),

Start with pink, not red, but only colour a SMALL section pink, unless you want a bigger section pink (it just helps the red to not look so ""bluntly"" red.),

Continue adding the different colours to the sectioned hair (don't worry about the stark lines between colours just yet.),

Every two or so colours you add, stop to ""comb out"" the colour.,

When you have finished with your colours in the sectioned hair, now it's time to blend them.,For blending between red and orange, blend with orange.,
For blending between orange and yellow, BLEND WITH YELLOW.,For blending between yellow and green, also blend with YELLOW.,For blending between green and blue, blend with green.,
For blending between blue and purple, blend with blue.,

There will be spots you missed or gaps in the colour--fill in these with the appropriate colour.
,

Flat-iron the coloured spot again (if needed), style, and then you're done and can enjoy your rainbow hair!
",How to Do Rainbow Highlights With Markers," The only supplies you ""need"" on the things you'll need list is the light hair and markers, though it is highly recommended that you at least have the comb or brush.
, Section the hair you want to be coloured. You don't need to tie it back or pin it up, but get a basic idea of how much hair is going to receive a part of each colour you have. Flat-iron the whole section of hair before you colour it (optional, but convenient.),, If you are worried about the colour getting on your face/head, fold up a paper towel and put it under the hair you are colouring. This also makes colouring the ends more convenient for you., It will not remove the colour, but your hair may get sticky and slightly matted, and the combing helps to remove the stickiness as you go., For most of the colours, you can just blend with what is next to it, but the pink and the yellow are exceptions. Grab a small section of hair that is half part of red and half part of pink, and simply colour with the pink until the colours look blended.,, The orange will only mask the colour, make your sections uneven, and not blend anyway.,,, (If you have any more colours than are described here, use the same pattern of blending with the lighter colour.),,"
"
Be careful.,
Use good quality paper.,
Think about the softness of your lead.,
Get the right erasers.,
Use a brush to remove eraser or graphite crumbs - don't brush them off with your hand.,
Use a mahl stick or a drawbridge.,
Fix as you work.,
Fix permanently when finished.",How to Avoid Smearing Lead when You Draw," It sounds pretty obvious, but it's the first step to better quality finishes with graphite. Be mindful, and watch how your drawing is developing, and try not to rest the heel of your hand on parts that you have already drawn on. Any oils from your hand can make smudges permanent. Any loose particle of graphite will get caught in that oil and deposit itself on your nice white surface. Watch what you're doing.;
, Bristol board with a vellum or kid finish, or Canson papers are excellent for this purpose - they have what's known as ""resist"" and ""tooth"" which is critical for a good appearance with a pencil drawing. Don't use thin typing paper or scratch paper to do your masterpiece on - invest in some good quality paper with some heft to it. These papers not only resist smudges a little bit, but they erase cleanly if you do smudge on them.

, Softer leads: 6B thru HB, with 6B as the softest and HB as the hardest. 2B is the hardness used most often by animators on cartoons. The softer the lead, the blacker the lines - and the more smear. Harder leads: H - 6H - with H as the softest and 6H as hardest, are most often used by architects or for drafting. Remember that the softer your leads, the more careful you will need to be about smudges and fingerprints.

, You will need a white plastic eraser - if you're doing a lot of fine details, get one of the ""pen-type"" ones that you can just click to feed more eraser out. Also, get a kneaded eraser - this is a special type of putty that picks up graphite, and which can be formed with your fingers into just the right shapes. You may also want to look into an electric eraser - these are capable of the greatest detail. You can also get what's called 'cleaning powder."" It's really just a bag full of eraser crumbs, but if you smear a lot, it can help clean up your drawings quite a lot.

, Soft brushes like this can be purchased at any art supply store. Take care not to use the brush for any purpose other than this, though, or you may find that dirt or other foreign stuff will get transferred from the brush onto your nice drawing.

, If you're working on a large picture, sometimes you just have to put your hand somewhere. Luckily, there are a couple of tools specifically made for this problem. The first, a mahl stick, is nothing more than a length of doweling with a non-mar rubber tip. Holding the stick in your non-drawing hand, put the rubber tip on the desk or the paper, out of the area where you are working. Now put a pencil or a paperback book at the other end of the stick, where you are holding it. Continue to hold onto the mahl stick so that you can move it with your drawing hand. Rest the heel of your drawing hand on the stick rather than on your drawing, and draw. It keeps your hand up off the picture. A drawbridge is similar - it's usually a piece of clear acrylic about 4""x12"", with rubber feet on the bottom. Put the drawbridge on the drawing, where your drawing hand needs to rest, and use it to rest your hand on, instead of laying your hand directly on the drawing.

, Get a can of workable fixative. There are several kinds - make sure you get the workable kind. This is a kind of spray coating which prevents smearing, but it can be erased, and you can draw over it. Don't use too much - it can make the drawing difficult to work on. But used sparingly, this stuff really helps.

, Use a permanent fixative on the drawing when you are done. Make sure you sign your work first!

Learn about the color wheel.,
Match primary colors with other primary colors.,
Match complementary colors.,
Match analogous colors.,
Learn about warm and cool colors.,
Consider ""earth tones"" or ""neutral colors"".",How to Match Colors1," The color wheel is diagram of colors that provides a useful illustration of what colors match and what colors don't work well together.The first color wheel was developed by Sir Isaac Newton in 1666, and variations on his design have been used as the basis of traditional color theory since then.The color wheel is divided into the following parts:


Primary colors: red, blue and yellow. These are the colors that cannot be mixed using any other colors.
Secondary colors: Green, orange and purple. These colors are made by mixing primary colors in different combinations.
Secondary and tertiary colors: Yellow-orange, red-orange, red-purple, blue-purple, blue-green and yellow-green. These are created by mixing a primary color with a secondary color.;
, The concept of matching is also called ""color harmony,"" which is achieved when colors create a pleasing effect. Red, yellow and blue always harmonize. These colors are bold and eye-catching, and they never really go out of style. Whether you're putting together a palette for your wardrobe, a painting or your dining room, you can depend on primary colors to lend your project a cheerful and bright appearance.


Bold primary colors are often associated with young children, tropics, and sports teams. However, there is no reason you cannot play with darker or lighter hues.
If you want your project to look more sophisticated, you might want to consider using just one or two of the primary colors, rather than all three. A red, blue, and yellow outfit might look a little juvenile, but a yellow and red combination be more sophisticated.

, Look at the color wheel and pick any color, then move your finger to the color just opposite. Colors opposite on the wheel are complementary colors. When you place them next to each other, they help each other stand out and the combination looks appealing.


Complementary colors of the same brightness and hue will always work well together.
Popular complementary combinations include blue and orange, purple and yellow, and green and pink.

, The concept is to stay within one color family in order to achieve harmony. These are the colors that are next to each other on the color wheel, like blue and indigo. Using varying shades of colors in the same family creates a nuanced look that has a beautiful, pleasing effect.


For instance, a denim skirt with a light blue T-shirt and indigo scarf will likely go together well.
Pick a favorite color and match it with a color to the immediate right or left. Red goes with pink, yellow with orange, and so on. Any gradations in the same family will match as long as they are the same hue, brightness, and so forth.

, Warm colors like yellow, orange, and red are on one side of the color wheel, and cool colors like blue, green, purple are on the other side. Any color can have an element of warmth or coolness depending on what is mixed in.


For example, if you mix basic purple with red, you end up with a warm, vibrant reddish purple. If you mix purple with blue, you end up with a cool, calming violet purple. When it comes to matching colors, temperature matters.When creating a color palette to use in your wardrobe or to decorate a room and you want a coherent effect, pair warm colors with other warm colors, and cool colors with other cool colors. For example, you might choose a rust-colored dress, a creamy mustard yellow scarf and a cognac purse.
Mixing warm and cool colors in the same palette results in an effect that can be either fun and funky or a little jarring, depending on how you look at it., Earth tones are not found on the color wheel, they are colors that do not exactly have an easy definition--these are colors that are more fashion-based than scientifically based. They tend to be muted colors which include: brown, cream, white, grey, and slate (grayish blue) fall into this category. These are natural, muted colors that match most other colors. They are reminiscent of natural elements like sand, soil and rock. However, they also encompass colors like off-white.
Black, white, and tan or khaki are often considered neutrals in fashion. They will usually always go together with any color. An example is a black pair of pants with a bright pink blouse.
In fashion, blue denim often is treated as a neutral. A pair of blue jeans will go with any colored shirt, for instance.
When you are deciding what neutrals match your color palette, you need to take color temperature into account. For example, if your color palette is cool, your neutral could be a bright white or a blue black; warmer neutrals would clash. For a warmer palette, you might choose a brownish grey or cream.
White and black are neutrals, but be aware that they are rarely absolutes. An off-white wall may have an undertone of yellow, for instance. Or a black shirt may have an undertone of blue.
Neutrals are not boring! People sometimes mistakenly think neutral means boring, bland colors. The strength of neutral colors is that they work well in group and work well with primary or secondary colors. For example:

A white t-shirt with blue jeans.
Khaki pants and a black sweater.

Learn the moods associated with colors.,
Prioritize cool colors.,
Avoid over saturating bright colors.,
Create an airy feel with pastel colors.,
Combine different colors to create your color scheme.",How to Choose a Soothing Color Scheme1," Colors have an influence on your mood. Generally, these are divided into warm, cool, and neutral colors. Warm colors generally convey a stimulating and communal sense. Cool colors are generally soothing and calming. Neutral colors blend in with most environments.



Warm colors include red, orange, and yellow. These strong colors are frequently unsuitable for creating a soothing effect.

Cool colors include green, blue, and violet. These colors, and combinations of these colors, soothe and promote trust.

Neutral colors include white, gray, black, beige, and similar colors. These colors tend to fit well with most color schemes.;
, You can mix various shades of green, blue, and violet to create your own soothing color scheme. So long as one of these cool colors is the base, your color scheme will likely have a soothing effect.Green is an excellent base color if you want to create an atmosphere of rejuvenation and growth.
Light blue as the base color will give a light, refreshing sense. Dark blue communicates a sense of dignity.
Violet mixes the calmness of blue and the vitality of red. It gives the impression of serenity. Although a cool color, it is considered to be the warmest of the three. For this reason, you may want to avoid overusing violet., Even cool colors can become agitating when they are too bright. Use bright colors in small amounts as an accent to prevent them from overpowering the main colors in your scheme.Accent colors generally highlight features like knobs, buttons, edges, and so on, to create contrast and gradient in your color scheme.

, Pastel colors tone down hues with the addition of large amounts of white. This washes out the sharpness of the pigment, giving the color a comfortable, wide-open feeling. Pastel colors might be perfect for your soothing color scheme.

, Now that you know how colors effect people, you can choose your color scheme. You never know what might suit your tastes, so experiment liberally with various combinations.You can tone down the energetic feel of warm colors by using darker shades of these. In some cases, a single warm tone as an accent or supplemental color paired with two cool ones can be uplifting while retaining a dominantly soothing tone.
Feel free to integrate neutral tones with cool colors in your color scheme. Most neutral tones will work well as supplements to cool tone color schemes. However, keep at least one cool tone dominant to maintain the soothing effect.
If you are painting a room, it can be difficult to imagine the color on the wall. If this is your situation, you may find it helpful to request color swatches from a paint store so you have a point of reference.

Choose the right marker.,
Practice drawing simple fonts.,
Add color and depth to the letters.,
Blend the colors together using a colorless blender marker.",How to Use Copic Markers1," There are four types of Copic marker - sketch, ciao, wide, and classic. For hand lettering, the wide marker with a chisel nib is a good choice.Working on good paper is also essential for hand-lettering. When practicing, plain printer paper works just fine. Because Copic markers are alcohol-based, they won’t destroy or erode regular paper like water-based markers do.You may also use grid paper if you want to ensure the straightness and uniformity of your letters.;
, Wide Copic markers are good for practicing easy, larger fonts. Learning hand-lettering is also one of the best ways to learn how to line draw and shade. Beginners can learn by working on simpler fonts and eventually moving onto fancier lettering as they improve.


Try a font that is familiar to you first. Choose one you like from a book or one that you’ve found online. Draw it in a larger size with a pencil first, then go over it in Copic marker.

, Start with the lightest shade, then add darker shades on top. Choose colors from the same color family when blending, such as a light blue and dark blue.


Always begin with the lightest color as the base, then add on layers of the darker color.

, Colorless blender markers will help create seamless, shaded letters.


You can also create unique effects by smearing the edges of each letter with the blender.

Understand the movement of the fire.,
Paint or color the background black or another dark color.,
Take a slightly darker colour than the one you used for the base of the fire.,
Choose a light yellow or orange colour.,
Take a very small paintbrush or pencil and a light, nearly white colour.,
Make any desired changes or adjustments, and you're done!

,
Change the background or embellish the flames.,
Finished.

",How to Paint Fire," Although it might seem challenging initially, movement can be successfully drawn through observation of how the object moves (in this case, fire) and noticing the varying shades and shadows thrown by the movement. Changing perspectives of the movement can also give you a better overall idea of the object's many faceted moves. Stare at a burning fire for a time before going to your drawing; if you don't have a fire, look at a video of a crackling fire online or simply light a match somewhere safe.


Common shapes in fire include teardrops and tendrils for the flames and an elliptical shape for the entire space taken up by the fire.;
, A dark color adds intensity to the fire and keeping the background simple to begin with is important to ensure that you concentrate on the fire itself. You can embellish the background more when your fire drawing improves. For the flames, choose a dark orange or reddish color for painting. If you're working on paper rather than on a computer, you can either paint the flames direct or draw them in first and paint next – whichever you're most comfortable with.


Start to draw or paint in the shape of the fire. It's good to use a reference for the shape, such as drawing an ellipse within which the fire will remain and you can send the flames up to any of the edges of this ellipse.
Use ""S"" like shapes to form each flame. Join the flames together about a third of the way or midway from the base of the fire and have the flames separated going up from that point.
Be sure to vary the height of different flames – no flames remain the same height at the same time and the difference in height gives a greater sense of movement.
See How to draw flames for some clear pointers with step-by-step images.

, Paint the edges of the fire with it. Doing this gives the fire more shape and smoothness, as well as giving an indication of heat and movement. You can do this later, too, if you want to.

, Start to colour inside the fire's base, following the shape of the flames. The lighter the colour you choose, the more intense (and hot) the fire will appear to the person viewing it.

, Again, paint inside the fire following its shape to make it look even more intense and realistic.

,, When you're more comfortable with drawing the flames and fire, consider working in a more detailed background. You could also make the flames appear fancier. The following images suggest different ideas for you to try:


Fancy flames for an more abstract, funky look.
Introducing a subject into the picture.
A larger fire.
Introducing a character with the fire.
Rainbow fire.

Try a monochrome look.,
Wear an accent color.,
Learn to match prints.,
Know your neutrals.,
Use accessories to play with color.",How to Match Colors2," Wearing the same color from head to toe is a striking look. The classic monochrome look is an all-black or all-white outfit, a sophisticated choice that lends an air of dressiness to your outfit. If you want to really turn heads, try a monochrome look in a brighter color, like red or green.


This needs to be done with some care. A black dress, heels and purse may be gorgeous, but also could accidentally come off as a person in mourning, a Gothic look, or a hairdresser. The whole outfit needs to have consideration, not just color!
The key to making a monochrome look work is finding items in the exact same color. Wearing a bright white top with cream pants is going to clash, but if you find two pieces in the same color, you're golden.
To make a monochrome outfit look less extreme, break it up with some neutrals, like beige heels or a brown belt.

, If you’re headed to a formal meeting that requires wearing a navy or black suit, you can still add some personality to your look with an accent color. Just make sure the accent color you choose is similar in temperature to your neutral basics. For example,


If you're wearing a black suit, try a red or turquoise camisole or blouse.
If you're wearing a navy suit, try a yellow or pink camisole or blouse.

, Once you gain the confidence to match colors effectively, you can start creating really stylish outfits by pairing unlikely items in your closet. You aren't limited to matching solids with solids. Branch out and start matching your stripes, polka dots, florals and animal prints with each other to completely reinvent your wardrobe.


If you are wearing a print, generally try to match it to a solid. If you have a black skirt with a small floral print, pair it with a green top that matches the color of the leaves. While you can mix prints, it is a tricky thing to do.
Wearing colors that pop also can help you out with your wardrobe style. Try Purple, Orange, and yellow. A purple shirt, An orange skirt, and yellow tights would look very nice. Maybe try it with a zebra print.
Match two prints with the same color. A bit more difficult, but it produces striking results. The key is to find one like color across two prints. For example, if you have an orange-striped blouse, you can match it with a leopard-print skirt that has the same color.
Match prints in the same color family. You can match prints that do not have the exact same color by playing within the same color family. A pair of ikat shorts with beige and cream tones can go with a chocolate brown polka-dotted blouse.

, They are the versatile items in your closet that go with almost everything. Neutrals are easy to incorporate, but you should still put a little effort into making sure they match the other items you are wearing. Here are a few popular neutrals:


Denim. Goes with everything, right? Just remember to take the wash into account. A saturated dark wash may match different colors than a light blue faded denim.
Camel or brown. Perfect for a muted, earth-toned palettes.
Navy. Looks beautiful with jewel-toned hues. Navy always pairs wonderfully with white and red.
White and cream. Brightens any outfit, as long as you keep the temperature in mind.

, If you're just starting out in your quest to match more colors in your wardrobe, try playing around with accessories. Experiment to find out what looks good and what doesn't by wearing more belts, flats, jewelry, and scarves. Wearing accessories is also a fun way to learn more about mixing prints without splurging on expensive clothes that might not end up matching.

Go with Pre-Made Palettes or Color Collections.,
Pick slightly different colors for your paint and fabrics.,
Consider having an accent wall.,
Experiment with colorful decorations.",How to Match Colors3," If you are unsure, it is often a good idea to start with something that professionals recommend. Most home improvement stores and paint vendors offer a selection of palettes that work together. Often these include a trim color that takes the headache of deciding which shade of off-white will work, too.

You do not have to select all the colors off the palette or collection. If you do not like the green, but everything else works for you, simply do not use the green. You also do not have to use all twelve colors; just use what works for you and your space.
You do not have to buy any paint to use the color in your house. For instance, you may like a little orange in your house, but painting a whole room orange may be too extreme for you. Instead, bring in that orange color with throw pillows, or a bedspread, paintings, curtains, and so forth.

, Do not match a wall and couch with the exact same color. While these items will technically ""match,"" the furniture and curtains should not essentially vanish into the walls. Instead, the color of both the wall and the couch will look understated. here are a few ideas you can try instead:Go with colors in the same family. If you have a blue wall, try a blue-green couch. If your wall is yellow, choose a red and orange color scheme for the furniture. The colors will harmonize instead of canceling each other out.
Or choose a contrasting color for a bigger splash. Buy an overstuffed violet armchair to put in your sunny yellow room, or try a bright coral sofa to offset your light turquoise walls.

, Many people hesitate to paint an entire room one bold color, as it is a bold and risky move. An accent wall gives you the chance to play with color without committing to an entire room or area with one color. Here's how to do it:


Saturated colors can have a strong effect on your emotional state. A bright red room might make you feel nervous, and a dark grey one might give you the blues.
However, strong colors can affect a person positively. An orange room might make a person feel joyful and creative, and a dark grey one feel focused and sophisticated. Different people react differently to the same color in the same space.
Pick a smaller wall in the room, like the area around your front door or above the kitchen counter. Paint it a bright color that matches the room's neutral.
Or use a contrasting color for the trim. Painting borders in a contrasting color gives a room an eclectic, fun look. You could also create a stenciled trim in a different color.
Keep in mind that color temperature can affect a room's mood. A soft purplish-pink wall color on a bedroom is romantic. But a bright fuchsia bedroom may come across as a bit too much. You can use nearly any intense color, but use just an accent. This can give the room the feel you want without being overwhelming.

For example, if you love intense fuchsia in the bedroom, consider having such colors in the pillows, bedspread, and some paintings.
If you are a homeowner, keep in mind that if you do choose very bright or saturated colors, you may well have to re-paint before selling. You may enjoy turquoise walls, but most home buyers may not. This can affect the re-sale value.



, If you do not or cannot commit to painting your walls pink or buying a bright yellow couch, you can still add color to your decorating scheme through decorations. Throw pillows, vases, clocks, flowers, bookshelves, and other smaller items can add bursts of color that liven up a room. Just keep these thoughts in mind when you're decorating:


Pick colors in the same family. Have a few decorations that match each other so that the room looks pulled together. For example, try a bookcase painted green, a pair of sea-green vases on the mantel and a collection of turquoise and green throw pillows and blankets.
Avoid using too many colors in the same room, though. As a guideline, three is the maximum: main color, accent color, and trim color. Keep things simple, or else the room may take on a mismatched or chaotic appearance.

Account for the influence of lighting.,
Choose colors that match the function of what you will paint.,
Use existing colors to determine your color scheme.",How to Choose a Soothing Color Scheme2," Rooms with good lighting will clearly reveal your color scheme, but darker rooms may leave it looking more shaded than you intended. Lighter tones may work better for darker rooms, as these soft colors give a sense of freedom and calmness. Also, it is important to keep in mind:The quality of light, which also influences the appearance of your color scheme. Evening light, for example, is often deeper in color, and may give a golden tint, which will generally mute the hues, making them more calming.
Shadows, which may be cast by trees, furniture, and so on. Shadows will have a darkening effect on your color choice. If the colors become too dark, the atmosphere of the room will shift from cool to neutral or possibly refined.
Color bleeding, which is where a color diffuses through a room with light. For example, a green, well lit wall might cause the rest of a room to have a slight green tint.

, A soothing color scheme could be one that matches the atmosphere of its function. For example, though red is not soothing in a traditional sense, it stimulates appetite and may be considered soothing in a restaurant., In some cases, like when remodeling, you may have existing base colors, like the color of your floors, furniture, appliances, and so on. You can use these as a foundation for your soothing color scheme. For example:If you have brown wood floors, you might create a soothing color scheme using shades of dark green, brown, and black.
If you have white carpet, you might use shades of blue with black accents for your color scheme.

"
"
Evoke a comfy, homey feel with wood tones.,
Create a cool atmosphere as refreshing as fresh fruit.,
Mirror the colors of the beach.",How to Choose a Soothing Color Scheme3," Rich browns often impart a polished, sophisticated sense. A combination of two shades of accent black, a muted gray, and two brown tones will give the impression of warm calmness.This particular color scheme designed to simulate the polished wood that used to be common in studies, libraries, and sitting rooms.

, Use a cyan, a dark blue, and a black for the base of this color scheme. Accent these base colors with beige and a muted red, which here represents fruit. The beige will tone down the energy of the red. The resulting color scheme should be cool, refreshing, and upbeat.


To shift this color scheme to something lighter and more playful, you might swap red for a burnt orange., The colors of the beach are sure to have a relaxing, calming influence. Start with a sandy brown color at the bottom. Above this, use a light blue. Continue to progress through darker shades of blue until you reach a very dark blue, like midnight blue.


The gradient of these colors gives the illusion of sand on the ground and water disappearing off into the distance."
"
Draw the outline of your design with a Copic pen or sketch marker.,
Begin coloring with the lightest shade of your choice.,
Add in the darker shades to give depth or volume when coloring illustrations.,
Use the base shade to blend the two colors together.,
Continue coloring until you complete the illustration.",How to Use Copic Markers2," Copic pens come in a variety of colors and nib sizes, just as the markers do. Pens allow for very precise, thin lines when drawing, and sketch markers allow for slightly thicker, but still precise lines.The beginner artist can always draw in pencil first, then go over the lines with a Copic pen or sketch marker when satisfied with the initial sketch.
Alternatively, you can use a rubber stamp to create the outline of a design, then color in the image using Copic markers.

, You can use either end of the Copic marker when coloring. Move the marker in small circles over the area you want to fill in order to cut down on visible lines and streaks.Experiment with using either end of the pen to find out which one works for you when coloring.

, When adding dimension, be sure to pick a color one or two shades darker than the base color, but still in the same color family.


If you don’t know where shading would look best, start with the outer edges of the design., In the space where the darker and lighter shades intersect, color the area with the lighter shade of marker, using circular motions.Copic markers work extremely well for blending, but you must blend while the colors are still relatively wet in order to create a seamless color transition.

, Try using different colors in different areas, practicing blending in each section. Allow the paper to dry completely before touching, framing, or handling in any way.


If you plan on using colored pencils to add depth to an image, apply them as the last layer. The Copic marker’s alcohol-based ink can’t absorb into the paper through layers of pencil.

"
"
Apply different colors of Copic marker directly onto a rubber stamp.,
Spray rubbing alcohol lightly over the colored stamp.,
Stamp the colorful image onto paper or cardstock.",How to Use Copic Markers3," Copic marker tips will not take on the colors of other Copic markers they touch, so feel free to mix and match any colors you like.It is okay if the colors dry a little before you start stamping. Just work until you are happy with the color composition of your stamp.

, This helps re-wet the colors, and will also help them adhere to paper or cardstock.Use a misting bottle to spray the alcohol onto the stamp.
If a misting bottle is not available, dip a small bit of paper towel into the rubbing alcohol and dab it onto the stamp very lightly. Be careful not to smear or remove any colors.

, You can stamp the image approximately two times before needing to reapply the alcohol mist.To keep consistent coloring in each image, check the rubber stamp after each stamping to see if any colors need to be reapplied.

Choose the right Copic marker for your needs.,
Store Copic markers correctly to ensure quality and longevity.,
Refill the Copic marker by uncapping the broad end and holding it at a 45 degree angle.,
Add 15-20 drops of Copic ink onto the nib of your marker.",How to Use Copic Markers4," Each marker comes with a letter that tells you which color family it belongs to and a number code that represents the color saturation.


An example of the color family codes is the letter “B” - any codes that begin with a ""B"" belong to the blue family.
The number code representing saturation is a 2-digit number code. The first digit represents the vibrancy, and the second digit represents lightness. A marker with a ""05"" code would be a vibrant mid-tone, while a marker with a ""99"" code would be very dull and dark.

, Luckily, these markers are simple to store and are not easily ruined. Keep the caps on them when they are not in use, store them either vertically or horizontally, and try to keep them in a cool, dry place.


If you accidentally leave your markers on a really hot window ledge or in a cold car, it is okay. The caps on each marker are airtight, so they are not easily destroyed by extreme temperatures., Both ends of the marker get ink from the same reservoir, so it is only necessary to add the ink to one end.The broad end is a larger surface for the ink to seep into, and this angle will help the ink drip down into the marker more efficiently.
Be sure to refill your markers over a protected area. Cover the surface with paper towels, newspaper, or any other thick, disposable paper.

, Allow each ink drop to absorb into the marker before adding the next drop. The ink will run down the tip and into the marker.


Be sure to add the correct color of ink to your marker.
If you accidentally overfill the marker and the ink begins to run over, absorb the excess with a tissue or paper towel.

Basics of the basics. Pencil and eraser, not much to say here, just a pencil and eraser for rough sketches of manga.



 


Nib pen. Many people think using a pencil to sketch out an image is all there is to manga, they are very wrong. In fact, some may consider inking the image of the manga harder than doing a rough sketch of it. How you handle a nib pen is important.






G pens. Not just any nib pen is for manga, there are many types of nib pens,G pen is a must have and usually used for characters. For backgrounds, usually a kabura pen is used, but there are many other pens. You may be able to get nib pens at your local bookshop. Practice to get used to them. Check out the related articles for manga practice.






Ink. Nib pens need to be dipped in inks to draw, strictly no fountain pen should be used in manga unless you are confident. For manga, the best choice is still traditional nib pens that dip in inks.






Brush. For effects like blood or inking a large part. A brush is usually also dipped in ink.






Curve. A curve is needed in many aspects in drawing manga, either backgrounds or fancy character's clothing and even effects.






Feather sweeper. This interesting tool is used for sweeping off eraser dusts. Manga usually requires a lot of erasing and re-doing or erasing after you have inked the script. Feather sweepers are handy in times like this.

Research famous illustrators.,
Visit art museums and galleries.,
Purchase art books or graphic novels.",How to Develop Your Own Drawing Style1," Do your research on famous artists of the past and present. By taking a look at their work, you can try to determine how it lays the foundations for contemporary illustration. When researching famous illustrators:Take note of how they use composition, color, and line to bring their art to life.
Determine the tone and lines of your favorite artists and try to emulate them by using the same colors or line styles.
Research the materials that they used and try to replicate the process by using the same materials.
Famous historical illustrators include people like Jean André Castaigne, Edwin Austin Abbey, and Rose O'Neill.Some successful contemporary illustrators include Pat Perry, Dagna Majewska, and Mouni Feddag.;
, Visiting art museums and galleries will enable you to view other artist's illustrations in person, which is a different experience than seeing a picture in a book or online. Do a search online to find open art galleries near you. You may want to specify your search so that you can find illustrators that use the same medium or draw the same subject matter as you.


Take note of their style and technique and find things that you like in other people's art.
Things that you can notice in person that may not be obvious in a photo may include things like the texture of the drawing.

, Graphic novels tell a story by using sequential art and text. Unlike comic books, graphic novels tell a complete and often time more complex story. Pick up a graphic novel at a comic book store and take note of the various styles that exist. Art books, on the other hand, allow you to view a variety of different pieces of art from artists that you appreciate in a textbook format. These are good to get if you're unfamiliar with an artist's work or you can't make it a museum.


The primary types of graphic novel include, manga, superhero stories, personal narratives, and non-fiction.Some of the most popular graphic novels include titles like Uncle Scrooge, Persepolis, and Maus.Some popular contemporary art books include ""Every Person in New York,"" ""Beastly Verse,"" and ""Beloved Dog."""

Make sure you have a selection of similar markers that you will be able to use.,
Select 3 or more markers to use for the skin.,
Make the outline of the face using a pencil.,
Start to add in the features of the face.,
Before you use the markers, erase the nose so it's barely visible to avoid discoloration.,
Start to add on more layers of colors.,
Once you're happy with the way the skin looks, begin adding details to the eye.,
Fill in the eyebrows fully on the outside, tapering the color off as you reach the inner side.,
To color the lips, start with neutral shades if you have them.,
Start to outline the hair using the darkest shade of your chosen colors.,
Color the neck like you did the face.,
Add white areas on the lips and in the eyes to make it look shiny.",How to Draw Faces with Copic Markers," Only having one or two markers will make it difficult to get a smooth look. The more markers you use the better the end result will be.


Copic sells packs of three markers that are good blending combinations so you can create a gradient look.
They also have a pack of 5 that consists of skin tone colored markers.;
, The lightest color in your group of markers is what color the skin will end up looking like, so choose that marker wisely. Once you have your markers together, test them out before using them on your drawing. This will prevent you from accidentally using a marker that doesn't match the rest like you thought it would.

Take note of the best ways to blend the colors together, which is dragging the colors across each other (see photo for reference)






If you are using thin paper make sure to put something under it so you prevent stains on the surface you're using.







, Don't go too in detail with the curves of the face. This should be done after the features are added so the face shape complements the features of the face better. Add in the cross-T that will help you with the placement of features. The horizontal line should be placed about 1/2 to 3/4 of the way up the face depending on how big you'd like the forehead to be. The vertical line will sit in the middle of the face where the center of the nose will be.

, When doing this be very light with your pencil and don't add detail to the skin. Things such as the bridge of the nose and crease of the eye will be added with the markers. This is due to how the markers react to pencil marks (the pencil will cause discoloration you won't be able to get rid of)

The eyes will be placed on the horizontal line of the cross-T with roughly half the eye above the line and half below. When deciding the distance between the eyes a general guideline is to put a ""third eye"" between them. This means that the space between the eyes should be about the width of one of the eyes itself.






The nose should be done on the vertical line of the cross-T. The length of the nose depends on your desired look, but generally should reach halfway between the horizontal T-line and the chin.






The lips should be placed low enough to allow room between the nose, but high enough that the chin isn't too small. Look at the space between the top of the lip and the chin. The lips should take up about half of that space, meaning you should be able to fit a ""second set"" of lips between the bottom lip and chin.






Now that you have the major features you can adjust the face shape. While doing this, make the cheekbones and jawline more defined.






Add the eyebrows with your desired shape. They can be as far from the eyes as you want, as this can create different expressions. A good way to know where the arch of the brow should be is by drawing a straight line from the edge of the nostril to the outer edge of the iris.






Erase your cross-T and any unnecessary pencil marks when done.

,


Using the darkest of your selected markers, outline the nose and face. Don't make the outline too thick or it will be difficult to create realistic shading.






Picking a light source will help you get realistic shading. If the light is coming straight on, shading will be even on both sides of the face. If it comes from the right, the darkest areas of the face will be on the left. Coming from the left the dark areas will be on the right. Using the same dark marker begin to lightly shade the darkest parts of the face, being sure to drag the marker towards the center of the face for better blending (see photo for reference). The darkest areas will be the bridge of the nose by the eye, the nostril area, the cheek hollows, under the lips, under/ above the eye and on the outer side of the eye. Also start to add details such as lines under the eyes and the cupids bow between the lip and nose.







, Use your markers in order of dark to light. The lightest areas of the face will be the middle of the nose bridge, cheekbones, chin, and the forehead. Leave these areas for last so they are the lightest.

Make sure your strokes of the marker are going in the right direction and that you stay as consistent as possible with these directions. The more you go over the area with the marker the darker it will get, but the less you'll see the strokes.






















, Using a black marker, add the pupil, and also outline the eye so it stands out. Do this by making the line thick towards the outside of the eye and having it taper off. You can also use a thin marker to add eyelashes. Consider using the 0.3 Copic multiliner.


To add color to the eye, fill in the white space with the color you want the eye to be. Then take a dark shade of that color and outline the iris. The easiest way to create shading of the iris if your light source is from the right is the put the darker colors on the left, and vise versa. Then taking a skinny marker, create zigzags in a circle around the pupil to add the detail of the iris.
















Shade the whites of the eye by coloring them in a very light grey, making the greys darker as you move out from the iris. Try not to reach a black-ish color by the time you reach the edge of the eye whites.







, Then create skinny hair-like lines where the color is light. If you want you can go back and create more hair texture in the rest of the eyebrow using a skinny marker.

, This will allow you to build up.


Then take a dark color and outline the lips. Begin to shade, creating lines that lips naturally have.






Using your desired color, fill in the lips. Like the face you should taper the color off to the center of the lips. The middle of each lip should be the lightest part.







, If using a dark hair color you can start the hairline a bit lower than the top of the forehead. Go with the grain of the hair so it looks like strands. Keep in mind where light would hit the hair and also where it would be darkest. Where the hair would be light, just do a few strands with the dark marker.



Overlapping your strokes will give a greater illusion of hair texture. Add layers of color like you did with the skin, leaving the light areas for your lightest marker. Add more hairs where you feel necessary.







, Depending on if you want to add shoulders you can put in details such as the collarbone.

, You can use the Copic opaque white bottle to do so.

Pick water-based pens for beginners.,
Switch to alcohol-based pens for advanced work.,
Get pigment-based ink for durability.,
Get gel pens for fine details.",How to Choose Coloring Pens1," Water-based pens are the most abundant pen variety. Brand names such as Crayola offer felt-tipped marker pens which are affordable and available at any general store. They are safe for children but can tear paper when added in layers. They will provide your drawings with bright colors, but don’t work well for shading techniques., Alcohol-based pens, such as Copic, are useful for putting down a lot of color. Many can be used for detail work as well. These are professional-grade markers typically found in craft stores and can be purchased individually. They work well on thicker paper and allow for color shading and blending, but will bleed through paper.Oil-based pens also exist and function similarly to alcohol-based pens.

, Pigment-based ink pens, including acrylic pens and some India ink pens, have been improved over time to rival alcohol-based dye pens. These pens give you clearer colors, bleed through paper less, and resist water and light better than dye pens. However, they are generally more expensive than alcohol-based pens.Examples include the Sakura Pigma Micro pens and Montana acrylic markers.

, Gel pens are water-based and come in a variety of finishes such as metallic or glitter. These pens are ideal for making small details. They run out of ink faster than other pens and tend to skip when not pressed hard enough against the paper.Gel pens dry slowly and are difficult to color over, so other coloring implements should be used first when you desire to fill in underlying space.Examples of gel pens include Fiskars and Sakura Gelly Roll.

Practice using different mediums.,
Draw using different techniques.,
Determine which subject you like to draw the most.,
Express yourself in your drawings.,
Establish your line style.,
Determine the colors you'll use.",How to Develop Your Own Drawing Style2," Different mediums can open your eyes to new styles of art and inspire your current style. If you are always drawing in only one medium, consider switching to one that you don't use often. For instance, if you always draw in pencil or pen, consider changing to something like pastels or charcoal. While you'll have to adjust your technique to draw, it could inspire your overall style.You can also try doing other art forms like sculpture or painting if you feel like you have illustrator's block.

, Sometimes artists can get caught up drawing using a particular technique, and it limits their body of work. For instance, if you're always used to drawing in an anime style, it could be holding you back from discovering other things you like to draw. Think outside of the box and draw inspiration from innovative artists around you.


Other styles include photorealism, surrealism, abstraction, and manga.If you always draw cartoony, try to draw something realistic.
Drawing in different styles can help hone your skills.

, Different illustrators enjoy drawing different things. Some artists prefer to concentrate on the human form while others prefer to sketch inanimate objects or landscapes. In addition, other illustrators like to draw architecture and some like to draw designs for clothes. Think of what you are trying to get out of your illustrations and decide on the subject matter that you like the most.


Some artists are best known for drawing a particular subject, such as Georgia O'Keeffe who is best known for her distinct paintings of flowers., Think of your emotions and favorite themes while you draw and try to translate that into your art. For example, if you want to convey dark emotions, you can portray that in your art by drawing serious subject matter like a violent or depressing scene. Show your frustration by using sharp, jagged lines. If you want to portray a serene scene, using sweeping bright colors and pick subject matter that will inspire people.


Try doing quicker concept pieces instead of obsessing over getting something perfect if you are having a hard time completing a drawing. Try taking thirty or fewer seconds to draw something. Aim to get the form and idea of your subject matter, rather than drawing the minute details.
Many artists stick to similar themes, colors, lines, and drawing techniques which distinguish their style from other artists.If you have a block in inspiration, concentrate less on achieving a unique style and focus more on getting your emotions out on paper.

, Once you've established the medium, you'll be working in and the subject matter, it's time to set yourself apart visually. Think about your line thickness and how you'll be using your lines within your work. Ask yourself if you like drawing thick bold lines or would rather draw more intricate and detailed lines. Also determine if your lines are going to be short, sharp, and jagged, or smooth and long. Will your lines be dark and make the outline the focal point, or are colors and details more important for you?


Vary your line width throughout a drawing, but try to maintain a cohesive style overall.
The way you outline your drawings will influence your style heavily., As an illustrator, color can sometimes play a huge role in the emotions and feelings you can evoke from an illustration. Often, darker tones like dark blue and black and can create an ominous feeling in a drawing while lighter tones like yellow, red, and orange can evoke positive emotions.The intensity and method of application also significantly change the way your drawing turns out.


Decide whether color will even play a role in your illustrations as some artists prefer to draw in black and white.
You may choose to color your drawings with paint, pastels, or colored pens, or scan them and do color edits in a software program.

Sign up for classes to learn the basics.,
Practice consistently and frequently.,
Get feedback from teachers and artists.,
Be unique.",How to Develop Your Own Drawing Style3," While formal education is never required for art, it will help you learn the basic illustration techniques like shading, adding texture, and composition.Sign up for a drawing or illustration class at your local community center or find a college that offers classes. Research different courses that are provided and choose one that interests you.


Even if you've been drawing independently for years, taking a class may teach you something new and will surround you with other illustrators that you can give you feedback.
Things to consider when looking for classes include the class schedule and the cost of the courses.
In addition to these basic techniques that every illustrator should have, there are also more advanced techniques used by many illustrators that include etching, stipple, and crosshatching., Doodling or drawing images to take notes in class can help hone your skills, however, dedicated and concentrated practice enables you to make vast improvements in your technique.Set aside extra time each day to sit down and seriously draw something in your newly developed style. Pinpoint areas that you are weak in and deliberately practice drawing things you have difficulty illustrating.


For instance, if you are great at drawing faces but bad at anatomy, take extra time to draw the human body until you become more proficient.
Make sure that you're in an environment that you feel comfortable so that you can get the most out of your practice.

, Even though your style is unique to you, it's important that you don't let your ego get in the way of actually improving. Though art is all subjective, there are things that you can do to improve your technique regardless of your experience. Have open and honest conversations about your drawings and take the advice if you feel it is valid.


Many art classes will have critiques where other artists will comment on your work and talk about how you can improve.
Don't let a suggestion get you down. Instead of being upset, examine what's being said and consider that it could improve your art.
You can say, ""My feelings won't be hurt. I just want to know how I can make my drawings more appealing to people. Can you give me some advice?""

, Now that you've gotten the basics down, you should try to develop your own style that's unique to you. Take inspiration from different artists, different styles, and different techniques and combine your favorite things about each of them. Don't just become a carbon copy of another artist. Try to stand out on your own.


For example, you can use the dynamic colors of Matt Lyon and combine it with the thick lined, black and white style of Matthieu Bessudo to get a unique style that's your own.Experimentation will lead to your results that you may be able to incorporate into your style.

Choose plastic tips for smooth lines.,
Get felt tips for versatility.,
Choose the appropriate tip size.,
Use marker pens for broad coloring.",How to Choose Coloring Pens2," The tip, or nib, of the pen controls how much ink is left on the page. Pens with traditional plastic tips leave thin, even lines. This makes them best for outlines and detailed coloring., Pens with felt tips function like markers. When held flat, they impart lots of color to fill in wide areas of paper. When held upright, the tips can be used for finer details. These tips use more ink and lose their shape faster.

, Pens can also come in a variety of tip sizes. A finer tip leaves small, precise lines and is good for detail work. Broad tips are good for thick lines and filling larger areas of paper. Medium tips are a combination of the two.


The definition of fine, medium, and broad tips differ between manufacturers due to the type of ink and tip used. For example, gel pens and plastic tips leave finer lines than marker pens and felt tips.

, Marker pens have tips similar to markers. While some varieties have finer tips, most have broader felt tips that allow you to fill in more space without running out of ink as quickly as when using a gel pen. These pens come up in all varieties of ink and are practical for beginners and professionals alike.


These pens put down a large amount of ink, which often bleeds through paper and colors the other side.

Use water-based pens for double-sided images.,
Choose alcohol-based pens for thick surfaces.,
Look for smooth paper with a high GSM number.",How to Choose Coloring Pens3," When you use a coloring book, the paper quality is chosen for you. However, alcohol and oil-based pens will bleed through paper, ruining the image on the other side. Water-based pens are safer to use in this case, although if you attempt to layer colors you may tear thin paper.One trick to reduce bleeding is to place a second surface, such as cardboard or another piece of paper, under the sheet you’re coloring.
You can also try more bleed-resistant pens, such as pigment-based pens, for detail work.

, Thicker paper, including watercolor paper, Stonehenge paper, Bristol board, and illustration board absorb more color than standard paper. This limits the bleedthrough by alcohol and oil-based pens., Smooth paper works better for pen drawings since rough spots break up lines and colors. You can see the smoothness of the paper by looking for bumps. However, look at the package for a GSM (grams per square meter) number. A larger number means thicker paper, which retains ink better.GSM goes from 74, which is standard copy paper, to 260, which is heavy cardstock.
There is also low GSM bleedthrough-proof paper that is designed for alcohol-based pens and is used for comics and other designs."

Choose an appropriate surface.,
Keep an appropriate eraser.,
Purchase a sharpener.",How to Buy a Drawing Pencil," Pencils are assigned numbers or letters based on their lead, which is a mixture of graphite and a filler such as clay. The graphite creates marks on paper while more filler makes the lead harder, leaving lighter marks due to having less graphite.Pencils are graded first on a scale from no number to nine. The greater the number, the more the pencil mark skews towards lightness.
Pencils are then graded on a letter scale. H stands for hardness, and B stands for blackness.American-made pencils have their own numeric system, more often associated with school than art. A #2 pencil, for instance, is the equivalent of an HB pencil, dark enough to be legible but hard enough to not smear.Japanese pencils use the European scale of number followed by H or B, but due to the thin, dark lines required to make the characters in the Japanese language, the pencils leave darker marks than their equivalent European counterparts.;
, H pencils have hard lead due to having more filler than graphite, so they leave light lines that don’t smudge and are easier to erase. These are used for precision work, including delicate details and outlining areas to be filled in later.


For example, a 9H pencil puts down the smallest amount of graphite on paper, so it leaves the lightest mark.

, B pencils have soft lead due to having more graphite than filler. This means that they leave darker marks that are hard to erase and smudge more easily. This is why they’re used for darker shading and finishing details.


A 9B pencil puts down the most graphite on paper, so it leaves a black mark.
These pencils wear down easily due to using more graphite with each stroke, so they need to be sharpened more often.
Art in dark shades is vulnerable to “graphite glare,” which results from the graphite forming a smooth surface that reflects light., In addition to an HB pencil, which falls right in the middle of the shade and hardness scales, you may encounter an F pencil. F indicates that the pencil is sharpened to a fine point. These are only slightly lighter and harder than HB pencils.H, B, HB, and F pencils are good for beginners who want to practice using a variety of different leads.

, The only way to find a pencil that works for you is to put it in your hand and use it. Art is subjective, so different people find comfort and results in different brands and types of pencils. Choose a pencil that feels good in your hand, leaves the kind of mark you want, and provides the kind of effect you want.


Even though the pencil manufacturers follow the rating scale, they still have their own internal standards on lead quality. A B5 pencil from one manufacturer may be darker than a B5 from another.

, Regular pencils are familiar. Many people have used them at school or around the house. They're common and the use of different grades of lead allows you to learn about the rating scale and how the change in lead affects your style.


Beginners who want to start with a single pencil can experiment with an intermediate-grade lead pencil.
Buying specific lead grade pencils gives you the opportunity to specifically choose what you need to achieve the desired effect.

, These pencils do come in a variety of lead grades, but not as many as regular pencils. The reason for this is that the mechanical action can only handle thin, dark lead. The ease of pushing a button to feed lead to the tip makes this a good choice for beginners.The pencil keeps one grade of lead at a time, which promotes learning consistency and control with that particular pencil.
These are the cheapest pencils available, found in art supply stores or online, along with lead packs to refill them. They're durable and come in a variety of designs.
Mechanical pencils that use lead with a .5 millimeter diameter are very versatile. Smaller thickness pencils are useful for detailed drawing, and larger thickness is good for rough sketches.
Due to only using one grade of lead, these pencils can leave you with less of a range in shades, making your work appear darker.

, These are specialized pencils used by artists and are a combination of regular and mechanical pencils. Compared to regular pencils, they have a larger variety of lead diameters, but also use the lead dispensing system of mechanical pencils.The most common lead diameter size is 2 mm and can be used for drafting. Thicker lead is used for sketching and thinner lead is used for drafting.
Varieties of these pencils are hard to find at art supply shops. Regular and mechanical pencils are more specialized and popular.

, Pencils now come made in a wide variety of substances that can give the ambitious different results in drawing. One of these, charcoal, is known for its dark color and popular for its versatility. Charcoal is good for new artists because it provides the ability to make different types of lines with minimal effort.Charcoal pencils follow the European scale, but the lead is soft. Charcoal pencils range from lead grades H and HB to 6B.The pencils can be bought individually and in sets for minimal cost. Besides the traditional black color, you can find sepia tones and white.

, These are a mixture of clay, black pigment, and charcoal or graphite, allowing them to have the darkness of charcoal and the smoothness of pencils. This means they make soft black lines smoothly and consistently.Carbon pencils are soft and therefore come in a range of lead grade B to 6B., Also called Conté crayons, are mixtures of pigments, clay, and graphite. Because they have pigments, they come in a range of earthen colors and are used for sketching or finished art pieces. These are harder than charcoal, so they can produce finer lines while also being used for shading.Conté pencils are firm, yet waxy. They are similar to pastel sticks except harder and less oily., Colored pencils are similar to graphite pencils, except they include wax and pigmentation. Their versatility, ease of use, and resistance to smudging makes them popular with animators.Artist-grade colored pencils contain more pigment and better resist light and water.
Lower-grade colored pencils, in addition to being available and inexpensive in sets, leave behind no mess, so they’re ideal for children.

, Getting a whole set is a bit more of an investment, but you’ll have the whole range of leads to use to experiment. This allows you to experience a range of shading and to better accustom yourself to the lead grade scale, should you need to buy individual pencils. Pencil sets are handy for those who are already serious about drawing, too.In many art supply stores or online shops, a beginning set of pencils can cost little more than a single mechanical pencil.
You’ll need to sharpen and replace these pencils over time, all the while keeping the ones you do have encased, if drawing on the go, due to their fragility.
You’ll also need to be mindful of the lead grade of each pencil you pick up, which can be a distraction.
The amount of options and the freedom to experiment can be too much for a beginner, so consider simplifying the process by buying a single, versatile implement such as a .5 mm mechanical pencil.

, The chemical makeup of the kind of pencil you choose determines how well it works on different types of paper and board. Your ability to experiment is unlimited, but keep in mind that using a combination is difficult and changes the effects of your drawings.


For colored pencils, for instance, it’s helpful to choose a surface that isn’t too smooth so that the lead sticks evenly. Examples include Stonehenge paper, illustration board, and suede board.Smooth bristol paper or pads can be used for graphite drawings.
Charcoal works with plain paper but can be held and smudged better with newsprint or charcoal paper.

, A part of the drawing process is being able to fix mistakes. With pencils, this means you get more of an opportunity through erasing. Again, different erasers have properties that affect how they behave and the effect they have on the type of pencil you use.


Rubber erasers are the most obvious choice due to their use in school with HB pencils. They come in pink wedges that last long but can tear paper if used too vigorously.
Gum erasers are similar to their rubber counterparts, except they are softer, don’t last as long, crumble to pick up graphite, and aren’t as hard on paper.Kneaded erasers are essential for charcoal, but also useful for other substances. They are flexible, so they can be shaped in your hands to attack small details.
Vinyl erasers are the hardest kind. At the cost of wear and tear on paper, they combat most substances. Some even come shaped like pencils so you can sharpen them for detail work.

, A good sharpener helps keep you drawing by giving your pencil the proper point without wearing away too much of its substance. There are many different models that take you towards the same goal. The kind of sharpener that feels right is up to you.Consider the size of the pencil. Sharpeners come in different sizes, so you wouldn’t want to choose one too small for your pencil.
Consider the shape of the pencil, too. Chances are the sharpener can work with any shape, but some are better for specific tips such as hexagonal or circular.
Sharpeners sharpen pencil tips to different angles. A sharpener that takes off more of the pencil’s wood leaves more lead exposed at the risk of breakage.
How much of a lead point do you need? A sharpener that leaves a pointed tip, naturally, allows you to create more intricate details with the pencil.

New supplies and mediums can be encouraging. Try beginner sets of artist grade supplies, because they are often easier to use than the cheaper, student grade supplies.


Begin with an inexpensive sketchbook with lots of pages, and a sketching set that includes kneaded putty eraser and different grades of graphite pencils. It may also include charcoal pencils, charcoal sticks, graphite sticks and brown, gray, or reddish sketching sticks. All these tools are useful, and the supplies are cheaper in bundled sets than bought individually.
""H"" and 2H, 4H, etc are ""hard"" pencils that sharpen to a fine point, and give a very light mark, easily covered by paint or inking. They're for design. ""F"" is a ""fine"" pencil, a little harder than an HB, which is a normal No. 2 pencil, and middle hardness. ""B"" means black, and each successive degree of B pencil is softer, blacker, and smudgier. 2B is a good sketch pencil, 4B is a great one that gives good shading, and 6B or higher is almost like using charcoal, for ease of smudging and shading.;
, This includes books on specific subjects, like how to draw animals, how to draw horses, how to draw seascapes, etc. Whatever you like most or get interested in. Try to accomplish at least one drawing a day. You can even frame them and put them up on your walls, to inspire you to keep going through the next day. You can also check out drawing books from your local library, and find out which one inspires you the most before buying it. Work through each of the exercises in turn, rather than trying to do everything in the book at once.

, They don't need to be complex or difficult - a five minute ""gesture sketch"" is as useful for learning to draw as a half hour spent doing a detailed drawing. If you have a half hour, spending it on half a dozen shorter sketches will actually give better practice. Try to get it right, but don't worry about perfection. You'll achieve good, recognizable drawings by constant practice more than anything else.

, This might be your cat, a favorite flower, a rock, a bottle with light coming through it, anything you would really like to draw well and care about personally. Draw the same thing over and over many times, in many different ways. Repeated drawing of the same subject or type of subject (Each of your cats, your cat from several different photos, your cat's paw one day, your cat's nose the next) will give you a much richer grasp of the anatomy and proportions of that subject. When you've drawn your pet cat enough times, it becomes easy to sketch a tiger on the first try. Draw enough pebbles, and a mountain becomes easy and understandable.

, It could be the homeless dude begging for change, or the little girl skipping around with a balloon in her hand. Whatever you see that looks interesting, draw or sketch it!


Still, life is one of the easiest subjects for beginners to draw. Literally, the objects don't move. Choose simple ones at first, a vase without too many curlicues, a few pebbles, a flower without too many petals, a clear bottle with an interesting shape, etc. Draw each of the objects separately as a study, then start arranging them together in different ways to see how they go together. The big advantage to still life is that your models don't move, and if you do it indoors, the light from your lamps doesn't change with the time of day, either.
Animal drawing may be your passion. Start with your pets. Start when they're sleeping, even if that doesn't seem like an exciting pose - it's when the animal's more likely to hold still long enough to be drawn. Or, use photos of your pets. Visit zoos with a camera, and snap photos of every animal you see and like, then work from your own photos. Alternately, look for open source photos like Wikipedia Commons and other photos where the photographer gives permission to draw from them. You can also contact photographers who take good animal photos and post them on Flickr or Facebook, asking permission to draw from their photos. Many will be happy to give permission, and most will want to see your drawings. When you're used to drawing animals fast from life, try drawing at the zoo, or wildlife like the birds at your feeder. Life drawing of animals is a good way to learn to do quick gestures and detail them later!
Buildings and architecture. Study perspective, as it's important in buildings more than anything else to make them look real. Find a good book on perspective, and do all the exercises. Be careful about working from photos, because they will sometimes distort vertical lines and alter perspective. You may have to correct the photo once you understand what you're doing. This is another popular fine art subject that never loses its appeal. Like still life, you can go out and draw buildings in person, without your model getting up to walk away.
Landscapes are a traditional fine art subject. Sketch your own yard from life often, sometimes a small beautiful area, sometimes trying for the big panoramic view. Go out on camping trips, or visit local parks with your sketchbook in hand. Do several quick, five minute or less gesture sketches, to get the main elements of your landscape design down, just rough outlines, then pick the best small thumbnail and draw that view larger. This saves a host of troubles over starting with the details of a leaf, and only finishing one branch of that tree in an hour. Details are actually easier than doing the big shapes of things. Landscape drawing is about textures, shapes, and light that changes quickly, so learn to draw fast! Get the shapes of shadows down first thing, because the angle of the light will change in half an hour, and so will the shape of the shadows.
People are a popular subject for drawing. Start with the friends and family members you can convince to sit still for a half hour or more to let you draw them. Paint the ones you love. Sketch anyone who interests you. Again, practice quick small ""gesture"" drawings in public, so that you can get the gist of a figure or a face within a few minutes before the person wanders off or does something else. Sketching in public is also a great ice-breaker, a good way to meet people, because someone often wanders up to see what you're drawing. You have a topic to talk about right away - art - one that most people like and one that isn't controversial.

, Most places offer community classes, where you can sign up to take some art lessons. Just know that you will have to invest a bit of money, but it certainly will help.


Look for art lessons online, and art videos or DVDs. Many professional artists create instructional DVDs in various mediums, or on drawing in general. Websites with forums like http://www.wetcanvas.com will often have free art lessons, with volunteer teachers who give assignments, critique your work, and help in encouraging ways. Sites like http://how-to-draw-and-paint.com may have a lot of free instruction available, and downloadable e-books, as well as further instruction for sale. ""Try before you buy"" with online art lessons, some are as good or better than in-person art instruction. You should like the teacher's art, and also enjoy the teacher's style of presentation, to get the most out of an online class.

, The Artist's Magazine, Pastel Journal, Watercolor Artist, American Artist and others all have excellent articles on how to draw and paint. The more you read, the more you'll understand the many technical terms and different techniques there are to drawing and painting. Learning art is cumulative. It may seem easy, because people who do something well for a long time do it easily, but it's a complex field of study that takes time and effort to master. Patience, practice and study are what really constitutes ""talent"" - talent is loving the process so much, that you're willing to put up with your mistakes in order to learn how to do it so well, others call you talented. This usually comes at the point they can recognize what you drew for what it is.

, Look for books on design and composition, take classes in design, study it as much as you do how to draw things accurately. It makes the difference between whether you create great art or just copies of photos. Learn how to crop reference photos, choose which subjects to shoot or sketch in a landscape, guide a viewer's attention in the painting to the most important thing in it - a portrait's eyes, the sunlit patch in a landscape that you chose as a focal point, the animal bending to drink, the people on the beach. Some subjects are attention-getters by themselves, like a cute kitten, but you can improve on that cute kitten picture to the point it's irresistible, if you learn good design principles and give just the right balance of background space around it.

, It could be at a craft store like Joanne's or Michael's, or you could be an intern at some sort of design studio. Get to know a gallery owner and volunteer to help with setting up shows, and you may eventually be hired to work at the gallery. Alternately, sell your art online at eBay or Etsy, sell portraits or pet portraits or landscapes in person off the easel, bring your portfolio to galleries, sell at art fairs, or science fiction or media conventions.


What type of art you do will affect where it sells best, and whether you're ready to make a living at art yet. The point at which good art supplies pay for themselves comes very fast, whenever you master at least one popular subject that non-artists like your work. This can be cartoon cats, dragons, cute manga animals or cute manga kids as easily as a fine art subject. Someone will offer to buy something. Sell it, give them that joy, even if you know you could have done it better. The connection they have with your drawing is real and emotional. Your technical criticism has more to do with your growth as an artist and less to do with the external value of your art. You're often its poorest judge, don't undersell yourself.
To make a living in art, learn how to become self employed. There are many aspects to self employment that have nothing to do with how well you draw and paint, everything to do with how well you manage your money and time. If you prefer to set your own schedule, make all your own business and financial decisions, work well without supervision, plan, schedule, and complete major projects without any outside authority, the life of a full time self employed artist may be right for you. If it's not, then enjoy having a side income, and look for a related job where you have an employer, a steady check, benefits, and someone else responsible for all the business stuff. How much you need to earn to be happy in life is a lifestyle choice. If you have your health, you may not need a high income to be happy as a full time artist. If you have dependents or health issues, it may not be practical to go full time until you can earn a professional level income, pursue your career part time till it matches your job income.

Place the pencil between your forefinger and thumb on your dominant hand. For basic drawing, you don’t want to hold your pencil too close to the tip or you won’t be able to move it enough. Likewise, holding it too far back won’t give you enough control. Try holding it a few centimeters up from the tip. About a fourth of the way up.
Keep a loose enough grip so that you can move your fingers, hand, and wrist.
When drawing a line, use your fingers. Think if it like a small flicking motion.
When drawing a curve or circular shape, use your wrist, while keeping your fingers in place. Though it feels weird a lot of the time, try to keep your pencil connected to the paper. Even when drawing a circle. Lift your wrist off the paper and practice making a continuous loop.
Don’t make small jagged lines. A lot of the time, novice artists will make small dashes, trying to connect each one as the pencil progresses. This won’t make your drawing look smooth. Though it may feel weird, and harder to draw longer lines and curves without lifting your pencil, keep practicing. Once you get used to the feeling, your lines will look much better.
Sometimes, you want to grip the pencil in your palm when shading. This technique lets you use the edge of your pencil to create a smoother shade and gives you more control on the amount of pressure you apply.;
, Most of what you are doing when drawing is using your pen, pencil, or another tool to define the edges and contours of forms. These forms can be anything from a coffee mug on a table, to a superhero flying between tall skyscrapers.


Begin with a pencil. When training yourself to draw, a pencil will be your best friend. You can control how dark or light a line will be. You can also easily erase any mistakes you make and correct your drawings.
A lot of what you draw is essentially made up of shapes like circles, ovals, squares, rectangles, and triangles. Your art will incorporate these shapes in different ways to form an image. Practice drawing these shapes. See how well you can sketch out these shapes with a freehand. Get a feel for how your hand moves the pencil on the paper. Keep practicing until you can draw these basic shapes well.
Practice shading. Draw a 20 centimetres (7.9 in) x 2 centimetres (0.79 in) rectangle. You can use a ruler if you’d like. Divide your rectangle into boxes which are each 2 centimetres (0.79 in) wide. You will have 10 blocks. Number these blocks going left to right, starting at 1. Leave the first block blank. Then very lightly shade the second block. As you continue to each new block, make it a darker shade until the last box is colored in black. You will now have a shading gradient as a reference guide. , Depending on how realistic you intend your drawing to be, you sometimes want to have hard outlines for your shapes. This is good for a lot of cartoon drawing. For drawing more realistic objects, you may want to use shading to soften your outlines to edges. Outlines are are made by going over the outside lines of your object again with your pencil or pen and tracing over these lines with more pressure to give your object a solid outline and shape. This will make an object look more two-dimensional.
Edges are created by shading your object so that the darkest part of the shade is the same as your outline. As you shade farther away from the edge, lighten your shade. This will make your object look more three-dimensional.

, Whether you’re an experienced artist, or just starting out, getting back to basics is a great way to improve your drawing skills. A great way to get back to basics is to simply draw what you see around you. As you do, pay attention to light and shading.


Everyone’s seen countless drawings of bowls of fruit or a coffee mug on the table. This is because drawing these objects helps you to understand how to shade an object, incorporate depth, and light.
Find something near you like a bowl, fruit, or even your smartphone and practice drawing it on paper. Look at how the light source casts a shadow on and around the object. You can tell where a light source is coming from because the shadow will be pointing opposite the light.
Practice drawing an object you are looking at using shapes. Dissect the object and break it down into your basic shapes. If you are looking at a coffee mug, think about the different shapes that make up the mug. The main part of the mug is a cylinder, made up of a rectangle with a curved bottom, and an oval to show the curved top which is open. Practice drawing these shapes together to form the main part of your mug. Next, look at the handle. The handle is like a half circle or oval. Don’t worry about having your lines overlap or not making everything even. You can always erase and adjust. Use your pencil to help you measure the proportions of what you’re drawing. If you line up your pencil to the coffee mug and see that the mug is about ¾ the height of the pencil when your pencil is vertical, and the width of the mug is slightly less the ¾ of the length of the pencil when it’s horizontal, you can use that knowledge to help you get the proportions correct on paper. Once you draw your vertical lines, use your pencil to make sure the distance between the two is relative to the width.

, Take some time to read up on the different styles, techniques and ideas that inspired these artists. What about these experiences or techniques excites your interests? There should be plenty of ideas and approaches to enthuse you to learn from.


Books and videos that teach you how to draw using techniques on perspective, construction, anatomy, and color theory will help you hone your own skill. These kinds of material can not only provide you with exercises to practice in a visual way but can also help you discover what kind of drawer you are.
These types of reference materials will help you with step-by-step instructions or techniques that you can learn to improve your ability.

, Drawing the objects, places, and even things from pop culture you like will help you hone your skill. This is because you will naturally pay more attention to the details of what you are looking at, and take more time when drawing it. Your natural interest in drawing a great rendition of something you like will help you understand how lines and shapes work. How shading is incorporated, and so on.


Draw the cartoons you like. If you like a certain cartoon or comic, and like that art style, practice emulating that style in your own drawings. Drawing your favorite characters in a certain style will give you an idea of what’s easier and harder for you.
Perhaps you find that you’re not as good at drawing very realistic objects or characters. But that anime or cartoon styled drawings come much easier.

, After you've done some research and practiced drawing what you like, move out of your comfort zone and try other drawing styles. You might feel comfortable with one method of drawing but if you don't try other styles, you'll never know if there are other styles that fit your skills well. Or styles that you can blend into your own mix.


Branching out will help you discover what you are good at and what you are not. You may find that you can draw beautiful, colorful cartoons, but have a difficult time drawing realistic figures.
Don’t discount an art style just because you’re not good at it. Keep practicing it and use this as a chance to improve on areas where you are having a hard time.
Pick a piece of art or drawing, that is outside of your comfort zone. Then try to recreate it by looking at it. Doing this will give you an idea of where you are having trouble, and it will force you to figure out how to get better. By drawing something that is hard for you, you will train your brain and hand to discover the movements your pencil needs to make. Attempting different drawing styles will also help your own style to emerge naturally over time. You can't force a certain style, it has to develop.

, If you have always been drawing in pencil, try charcoal. Or switch to watercolor pencils, colored pencils, or ink.


While a pencil is great for sketching out the first part of a drawing, and sometimes doing the whole drawing, other tools may suit you better.
You may find that you have more control with markers, pens, or paint. Or that your personal style really seems to fit a certain medium.
Perhaps your style looks ok in just pencil, but once you add a pen, and are able to play with the thickness of the pen’s stroke, you see that your style really comes through.

, Artists use colors to evoke a certain mood or atmosphere. Colors are used to create space and light and shadow. Therefore, playing with not only what colors you use in your drawings but how you use these colors, will help you get better and create a style all your own. Look at your favorite comics, cartoons, artists, etc. Notice how color is used in these drawings. Are there bright, happy colors in a shot of Batman as he jumps from a roof in downtown Gotham? Or are the colors darker, more muted? In Batman, the colors are darker and muted to enhance the noir-like tone.
Practice with color pencils to get a sense of how your use of color can be incorporated into your drawings. As you use your color pencils, take the time to study your drawing. Does your drawing look better because of the color, or worse? Learn to use color to depict temperature and shades. Blue hues are cooler for example. The darker the blue and the closer to black, the colder the temperature is. , If you truly want to become a better drawer, like every skill, you have to practice, practice, practice. Draw every day, whether it’s a doodle for ten minutes, or a larger piece of art you work on for several hours.


As you continue to draw, you’ll notice where your strengths lie, and where you can improve. Look at your drawings and analyze each one.
Take note of what is common throughout your drawings. Are you always drawing cartoons? Or do you frequently only draw part of someone’s body, like the face and head, but never the rest?
Spend more time on the types of things you avoid when drawing. If you have a hard time drawing hands, look up tutorials on how to draw hands, and practice drawing just hands over and over. Then, once you’ve improved, incorporate your new skill into your art.

, While you may draw pictures that don’t have a human, animal, or human-like figure, chances are a lot of drawings do. Use your own body as a guide.


Say you’re drawing a character you’ve created in action. Picturing and sketching the body in movement, or even standing still, can be tough. It’s not always easy to draw correct proportions or get the placement of body parts right.
Position your own body in the pose you are trying to draw. Look at yourself in the mirror or take a picture. Having this kind of reference will help you get a visual understanding of how the body moves, how the arms look in a certain position. What the head looks like when turned at a certain angle.

, After mastering the techniques of drawing objects, adding depth, texture and form, the composition is the real telling point of an advanced drawer. The composition can be dull even if your drawing technique is excellent; the real art is found in careful and well-spaced composition. Composition is the spatial relationship of your objects within a frame. Being able to draw with a good sense of space and distance between objects is a skill that takes time.
Use real life examples to help you use composition in your art. Say you’re drawing a fence going off into the distance. The gaps between each post will be slightly different.
Give objects different sizes and space within your drawing. If you’re drawing a crowd of people, not everyone will be the same height and width. And if some are closer to the eye, or further off in the distance, the size of the person and the detail will vary.
Use the rule of thirds. This means dividing your paper into nine equal sections. Your paper is divided horizontally into three sections, and vertically in three sections. Align your areas of focus near the intersections of your imaginary lines. Say you are drawing a person sitting in a chair in a room. You may consider drawing the head in the top left area where your top and left thirds intersect. This is an area of focus and will draw the eye to your person’s face. You might leave the right third of your paper emptier with fewer details and objects to show depth to the room and balance out your drawing.

, Some people can draw quickly, and fill in details with ease. But the only way you’ll improve your ability is if you take your time and draw slowly at first. The slower you go the more control you have. You can pay more attention to the slight curve of a line, or get the details of that hand just right.


It may get frustrating to go slowly as you draw, but it makes a big difference. Look at a drawing you did quickly, then go and draw again, this time going slowly, notice the difference.
The more you draw, and the more time you take to care for your drawing will be your biggest advantage to becoming a better drawer.
Once you’ve learned the basics of drawing, it really comes to down to practice and patience.

Wrap the graphite paper around the edges of the canvas and tape it to the back with masking tape.,
Place your drawing on top of the canvas with graphite paper and tape it down.,
Grab a pen, colored pencil or a fairly pointy object and trace your entire drawing.,
Now CAREFULLY remove the drawing and graphite paper.

",How to Put Photos Onto a Canvas," It's OK if it's not perfect because remember- this is your artwork!;
, It will need to be dark side down. If both sides look the same, take your index finger and thumb and rub both sides. Graphite will get on one of your fingers and that's the side you will put face down.

, It should be fairly snug but be careful- graphite paper is fragile so be careful not to rip it.

, Be careful not to cover up any of your drawing.

, Press fairly hard so that your drawing will show up on the canvas.


You may want to go over it 2 or 3 times.

Set up your sheets of paper.,
Outline your image.,
Coat the back of your tracing paper with graphite.,
Adjust your papers again.,
Create your final outline.,
Finish your drawing.",How to Trace1," Tracing paper is a very thin paper - almost like tissue paper - that is as a result, easy to see through. Place the image you would like to trace on your tabletop, and tape the corners down. Put your tracing paper over the top of it; you can secure the corners of the paper if you would like, or leave it free so that you can adjust it as you draw.;
, With a pencil, carefully draw the outlines of all the figures in your image. Don’t worry about adding any shading; focus only on drawing the outlines of objects. Be sure to include any small details that may be in the image.

, When you’ve finished tracing your picture, remove the tape and flip your tracing paper over. Using a soft graphite pencil (such as 6B or 8B), shade the area over all the lines that you’ve drawn on the other side of the paper. Make sure that you add a relatively thick layer of pencil down, so that there is enough to accomplish the next step.

, Take the paper that you are transferring your image to, and tape it to your tabletop. Then, flip your tracing back so that it is right-side up, and tape it in place over the top of the drawing paper. Be careful not to rub the tracing paper too much, for fear of smearing the graphite on the underside.

, Take a very sharp pencil or pen, and applying medium to heavy pressure, draw over all of your outlines again. As you do this, the graphite you shaded in on the underside of the tracing paper will transfer under the pressure to your drawing paper. Work around your picture until you’ve completed all of the outlines.

, After going over your outline a second time, you can remove the top sheet of tracing paper to reveal your final drawing on the drawing paper below. At this point, fill in any missing lines that there might be, and add any shading or details from the original image.

"
"
Layer your papers.,
Outline your drawing.,
Finalize your drawing.",How to Trace2," To trace an image using transfer paper, you will need three pieces of paper: your image, your transfer paper, and your drawing paper. Place them on your table, and tape them down in order. Put your drawing paper (that you’re transferring the image to) on the bottom, followed by your transfer paper (graphite-side down), and your image on top.

, Using a very sharp pencil or pen, carefully work around the outline of each figure and object in your image. As you apply pressure with your pencil/pen, the graphite on the transfer paper below will be applied to the drawing paper on the bottom. Make sure to get any details you want in the photo, and avoid adding shading.

, When you’re sure you’ve traced all the major components in your image, remove your image and tracing paper from your drawing paper on the bottom. At this point, go in and make any changes or enhancements to the outline that you’ve traced. You could then shade or color your image, if you so desired.

"
"
Set up your supplies.,
Trace the outline of your image.,
Finish your drawing.",How to Trace3," Place your lightbox on your tabletop (or lap, depending on the style you have), and put your image over the top. Tape the corners of your image down, and layer your drawing paper on top of the image. Secure the drawing paper with tape as well, and turn the light on. Assuming your drawing paper isn’t too thick, you should be able to see the image through your drawing paper.

, Carefully work around your image, outlining all the major objects and figures with your pencil. Because you don’t have to remove or transfer any papers other than the one you’re drawing on, you can shade in figures in addition to the outlines, if you want.

, Turn off the light on the lightbox to determine if you’ve missed any spots on your drawing. If you have, turn the light back on, fill them in, and finish up your outline. When you’ve finished tracing the image, you are free to move on and add color or more shading and detail, with or without the use of the lightbox.

Select a picture to copy.,

Decide on the size of the copy you're drawing.,
Draw a grid on the reference photo or picture.,
Create a grid of your own with the appropriate sized squares.,
Write numbers and letters into your squares.,
Copy the image square-by-square.,
Gently erase the grid when you're finished.,
Grip your pencil correctly.,
Look for basic shapes in each square of the grid.,
Pay attention to line quality.",How to Copy a Drawing or Picture by Hand," To start, you'll want to select a picture to copy. You may already have a picture in mind that you want to copy. If you're new to drawing, it's a good idea to pick something simple. Go for a picture without a lot of detail with a clear shape. For example, the image of a child's cartoon may be easier to draw as shapes may be more simplistic.;
, To create a grid, you'll need to know the dimensions of the original image. This is to make sure the image you draw is to scale. To do this, take a ruler and measure the length and width of the drawing or image. Write this measurement down. For example, say your drawing is 5"" by 7""., From here, determine the size of your canvas. If you're drawing on a canvas that's 5"" by 7"", you will not have to do much extra work to do. However, if you want a larger image, make sure you choose sizes of the same ratio. This will assure the drawing gets copied correctly.If the drawing has the same ratio, you will get the same number if you divide the width by the length. For example, say you want to make a drawing that's twice as large. You would want the drawing to be of the dimensions 10"" by 14."" Five divided by seven is roughly .714. Ten divided by fourteen is also roughly .714.
If you want to make the drawing bigger, make sure you multiply the length and the width by the same number to assure you have the same ratio. For example, say you want the drawing to be 3 times as large. Five times three is fifteen. Seven times three is 21. You would need to copy the image onto a canvas that was 15"" by 21.""

, From here, you'll need to draw a grid on the reference photo. This will allow you to map out you're drawing. If you do not want to draw directly on the picture or photo you're copying, copy the image using a scanner or a copy machine. You can do this at home, if you have a scanner, or at a local office supplies store.Place a ruler on the top of the drawing or picture. Make a small mark at every inch. Then, do the same thing at the bottom of the paper. Use the ruler to draw a series of straight lines connecting the top and bottom marks.
Set the ruler on the left side of the paper and make a mark every inch. Do the same on the right side of the paper. Then, use the ruler to draw straight lines between the left and right marks.
When you're finished, a grid comprised of one-by-one inch squares should be drawn over the image you're copying.

, Now, draw a grid over your own canvas using the same method. Use squares of an appropriate size given the size of your canvas. If you're making an image twice as large, you will need two-by-two inch squares. If you're making an image three times as large, you will need three-by-three inch squares, and four-by-four inch squares for an image four times as large, and so on.If you're using 2 inch squares, mark the top, bottom, left, and right sides in two inch increments instead of one inch increments and then connect. If you're using 3 inch squares, mark the top, bottom, left, and right sides in three inch increments and connect.
Your grid surface should more or less match your reference photo.

, It can help to write numbers and letters along the columns and rows of your grid. This can give you a framework by which to track what portion of the drawing you're copying. Make sure to write numbers and letters small and light so they can easily be erased later.Write numbers along the top and bottom of the grid.
Write letters along the left and right side.
You can mentally think of the sections in terms of how the columns and rows connect. For example, say you're drawing in a box that falls in a column labeled 3. The row corresponding to this column is labeled B. You can think of this box as B3 or 3B.

, You will want to copy the image moving from one square to the next. For example, start in the corner, where you'll find box A1. Focus only on the shapes and images you see in that square. Slowly copy these shapes onto the corresponding square on your blank grid.An image will probably be broken down into basic shapes when it is splayed out on a grid. This can make it less overwhelming to copy. For example, the corner of a cartoon character's ear in one box may look like two semi-circles. Focus only on drawing the semi-circles without thinking about other areas of the grid.
Copy exactly what you see in the square. One benefit of drawing by grid is that you're copying what you see rather than what you think you see.

, Once you've filled in all the boxes, gently erase your grid and the corresponding numbers and letters. Do so slowly and pay attention to where you're erasing. You do not want to accidentally erase any of your copied drawing.You may want to outline your drawing in pen before erasing any of the grid. This can make sure your drawing stays in tact.

, One way to make sure you copy accurately is to grip your pencil correctly. Hold your pencil in a way that allows you to maintain control. The closer to the end of the pencil you place your hand, the more control you'll have over the pencil.However, if you're going for lighter strokes, you may want to move your hand further up the pencil. The closer you place your hand to the tip of the pencil, the darker the marks will be.

, There are basic shapes in every image. Most people feel more comfortable drawing basic shapes than they do drawing complex images. Try to look at images as shapes to help you draw them better. For example, see the corner of a cartoon character's mouth as a triangle. Just try to draw a simple triangle to help yourself focus.

, Line quality means the thickness or thinness of a line. When you're drawing, keep line quality in mind. You want to make sure the lines you draw are of the right quality for the image.Try to use thinner and thicker lines when appropriate. In some portions of your drawing, for example, you may notice lines are thicker. There may also be shadowy portions of the drawing where it would be appropriate to draw thicker lines.
Make sure to pay attention to line quality as you copy your drawing. Keep your lines of an appropriate thickness or thinness for the image.

",How to Draw a Semi Realistic Portrait2," Select Preset > International Papers > A4. Set the resolution at 300 pixels per inch. Next, open a reference photo in another window.

, Take the Brush tool (B) with a recommended size of 10 pixels and change the colour from black to a bright colour. The reason for doing this is that you want to be able to differentiate the line art from the sketch lines. Sketch out the shape of the person, ignoring such details as the face and patterns, only drawing a basic outline of the clothes.

, Draw in details such as buttons of clothes and creases in fabric.

, Change the layer colour to red to help you find this layer quickly in the future. Turn the brush size to 15px and change the colour to black––the shortcut for this is (D). If using a tablet, click Window > Brush > Shape dynamics > control and select 'Pen Pressure'. With your sketch lines visible underneath, draw more defined lines over the top. The sketch lines will be rougher and line art needs stronger lines, so be confident.

, Create a new layer called 'skin' and drag it so it's underneath the 'line art' layer. This way the line art is on top of your skin tone. Change the brush to a large size, recommended 140px-370px, and choose a suitable skin tone. This can be done by clicking the colour chooser at the bottom of the left hand tool bar or by clicking Windows > Swatches. Then colour all the exposed skin; it doesn't matter if the colour is outside of the lines. Zoom in close and go around after with the eraser (E)35px to clean up any lines.

, The easiest way to add colour to clothes is to think about the order of the clothes on the body. For example, shoes go over socks, so the shoe layer goes over the socks layer. Create a new layer for each item of clothing and repeat the process used for skin.

, To add colour to the face is easy. Separate the face into layers. For example, lips, teeth, eyes, eye colour and makeup.

, In the example piece there is a shiny belt buckle. To colour a shiny item there are a few possible ways to do so. One is to create a new layer and colour the item grey or yellow and shade as you would for the rest of the piece. Or, if you are using Photoshop, create a new layer colour the item grey or yellow and select Windows > Styles and select a metallic style; the style will only affect what's drawn on the layer.

, The top in the example shown here is striped. The easiest and most time efficient way to paint something like stripes is to lock the layer. At the top of the layer box, you will see that there is the word 'Lock:' and a checked box next to it. By clicking this box it locks the layer, meaning that whatever is on that layer cannot by destroyed but can still be drawn upon. Draw carefully the stripes onto the top using the 'Undo' ctrl + z to reverse mistakes, as the eraser cannot by used. Another way of doing this is by making a new layer called 'stripes', by ctrl + clicking the layer icon for the 'top'––a dashed line appears, meaning that the layer is selected. By clicking back onto the 'stripes' layer it means that the selection is on the 'stripes' layer but still in the shape of the 'top' layer. You can draw stripes onto the dress but can still use the eraser.

, Shading a piece correctly is very important for ensuring that the outcome appears semi-realistic. For each layer made (except for Line art and Sketch lines), make a new layer called 'Layer name shade' above it. Using the 'skin' layer as an example, using the eyedropper tool (I or B+alt), select the colour of the skin (that colour should be in the colour chooser), then choose a colour a little darker than the original. Set the brush to 0% hardness and 40% opacity.


Using the technique mentioned earlier in the 'Patterns' step, select the 'skin layer and then draw onto the 'skin shade' layer. Try not to take the brush off the page as the next time the brush touches the page it creates a double opacity.
When drawing shadows, keep changing the colour a little bit, making it darker with each layer, so as to build up the shade.
When drawing highlights, such as the end of the nose or cheeks, select the 'base' colour and change it to a slightly lighter colour, and repeat the process used when shading darker. Remember that unless a person is in strong light or wet/shiny, there will always be less highlights than shadows.
Repeat this process for every layer.

, A background is not always necessary and sometimes a subtle gradient effect is the best. By double clicking the background layer it should unlock, by double clicking again Layer options > gradient effects.

If you're using this method for the first time or you don't have a lot of drawing experience, choosing a simple cartoon image like the one shown is ideal.;
, It should be scaled to the size of your original print. The image in this example uses a 1:1 scale drawing (8.5"" x 11""/21.4cm x 28cm), meaning that the reference image and the final product will be the same size. However, depending on the size of your image, you may need to scale the size of your drawing up or down accordingly.


For example, if you have an image that's 8.5"" x 11"" (21.4cm x 28cm):

To scale the drawing size up 2x, the paper should be 17"" X 22"" (43cm x 56cm).
To scale the drawing size down 0.5x, the drawing paper should be 4.25"" x 5.5"" (10.7cm x 14cm).



, The example image uses one-inch (2.5cm) intervals, which is a good size to use, however your intervals may have to be slightly larger or smaller depending on the size of your paper. In the end, you should make sure to have equally spaced marks along the edges of your paper.


Note that in the example image, because one-inch markings were used, there is a quarter-inch (0.64cm) marking at both the upper and lower half of the drawing, since the height is 8.5""/21.4 centimeter (8.4 in). These two quarter-inch markings account for the extra half-inch. Depending on the size of your paper, you may have to do this as well.

, These connected lines will form a grid pattern, hence the name ""Grid Method"".

, Mark the edges at equal intervals and connect them using a ruler to create a grid as you did with the original image. However, make sure to only draw the markings and grid lines lightly so that you can erase them later on. In the end, you should have something similar to the image provided.

, This will enable you to easily keep track of which box on the original image corresponds with which box on your drawing paper. Start with the top left corner and work down from there, creating what will look like a calendar. Again, remember to press lightly with your pencil on your drawing paper so that you can easily erase the numbers at the end.

, Look at a box on your reference picture and re-create what's inside of it in the corresponding box on your drawing paper. You can begin in whichever box you'd like, but it's helpful to start with the boxes that include the general outline of your image in order to make sure that it will all connect properly. Make sure to use a pencil so that you can easily make adjustments to your drawing.

, Once you have the outline complete, you can begin to add in smaller details such as eyes, noses, mouths, etc. You don't have to include all of the details that your reference image does - it's up to you to decide how detailed you'd like your picture to be.

, Once you've finished the drawing, take a pen or a fineliner and re-trace your drawing with it. After that, use an eraser to get rid of the grid lines and the numbers so that all that remains is your drawing. Make sure to wait until the ink from your pen or fineliner is completely dry before you erase, otherwise you may smudge the ink.

Have the animal doing something that only humans do.,
Style parts of the animal's fur to look like human hairdos.,
Use speech bubbles to show the animal talking or thinking.

,
Use exaggerated facial expressions to denote certain emotions.",How to Draw Humanized Animals," Try to work out quickly what makes them look more human than animal. Don't try too hard to guess the reasons - it's your initial, fast reactions that reveal the most telling features.


Some animals to check out include those created by Beatrix Potter, Brambly Hedge characters, Wind in the Willows characters and Disney animals.;
, This is probably the most obvious way to make the animal appear more human-like. It might be a whole outfit of clothing or just pieces of clothing, such as a top, pants or just jewellery.

, In general mammals and marsupials walk on all fours. Of course, there are exceptions such as the kangaroo and birds, fish, insects and the like have different ways of walking. However, take a basic four-legged animal and draw it walking on only its two back legs and it soon starts to look very humanized. Even fish can be drawn walking on their rear end and tail.

, As soon as an animal is carrying something other than food or nesting material, it begins to take on a human-like dimension. Think of an animal carrying a basket, a fishing rod, a sword or similar items and you'll start to see it as humanized.

, There are plenty of choices here but technology presents some of the greatest contrasts, such as a cat typing on a computer, a rat talking on the phone or a toad driving a vehicle. Or, the animal might play a sport (holding a golf club, tennis racket, hockey stick, etc.), play a board game, have a sword fight or cook a meal, etc.


Dancing animals are striking as a drawing subject.

, Comb-overs, buns, beehive dos, plaits and the like can all make the animal appear more human. And don't forget beards, mustaches and even baldness.

,, The manner in which you draw the eyebrows, lips, nose, eyes, etc. can all say something about the emotional state of the animal. Of course, emotional states are a very human trait, so this can certainly humanize the animal.


Smiles are good. As are upturned or down-turned eyebrows.

, Draw a quarter circle just a few spaces from the eyes. Put in a few more if you wish.

, The fins are fairly large in comparison to the body, taking up essentially half of the fish's total mass, so don't be afraid to go big or go home.

, These fins are small, so draw them with more reserve than the fins in step 4.

, They can be as large or as small as you want, or even differently shaped, but keep them within the lines of the body and spaced evenly.

Shade or color the lily as desired.",How to Draw a Lily1," Sketch a small circle, then draw a long, slightly curved line extending down from the 5-o'clock position of the circle.


The circle will become the bud of the lily and the line will become the stem.
Connect the line directly to the outline of the circle and make it roughly five to seven times longer than the circle diameter.;
, Draw seven short, slightly curved lines extending outward from the center of the circle.


These lines will set the direction of the lily petals.
The curve of each line should open slightly downward.
The lines do not need to be even in size, but they should range from one-fourth to one-half the size of the stem. Note that the lines pointing opposite the stem should be longer than those directly next to it.
The lines do not need to be symmetrical, either, but they should be spaced apart at relatively even intervals.

, Draw an outline around each petal line, allowing the contours to meet and overlap near the center of the flower.


These contours will become the petals.
Center the petal line within each contour, keeping an even amount of space on either side of each line. Note that the amount of space between center lines and contours may vary from petal to petal.
The contours should touch without intersecting one another. If you do cross some of the contours, you'll need to erase the intersecting segment later.

, Erase the initial petal lines, leaving the contours in place. Correct the petal contours as needed to make each one look more realistic.


Some contours may not need any adjustments, while others will. In particular, you should try to narrow the tips of the contours to prevent them from looking like perfect ovals.
Add detail to the stem during this step, as well. Make the bend appear sharper, and draw a parallel line to one side of the original line to give the stem width.

, Sketch several leaves on both sides of the stem. You'll only need roughly five to eight.


Vary the direction and size of each leaf. Each should look like narrow, curved teardrops. Some should curve upward while others should curve downward.
Do not draw the leaves in even pairs. Space them apart at random intervals.

, Draw the stamen in the center of the lily and lightly sketch line markings inside each petal.


The stamen will look like a cluster of short, narrow stems, and each stem should have a small rounded block at the tip. Place five to eight of these shapes within the center of the lily, making it no higher than the largest, most upright petal.
For the petal lines, lightly sketch two to three lines in each petal that highlight the direction of the petal. these lines should only occupy part of the petal interior, though, and should not extend from the base to the tip.

, By this point, you should already have a completed lily form. You can add shading or colors to the picture to make it even more realistic.


To add shading, try to visualize which areas of the lily would receive direct light if it were real. Any area that would not get hit with light should be shaded, with the darkest areas being those hidden by other parts of the flower.
If you want to add color, use lighter shades on the areas that would receive direct sunlight and darker shades on those that would be hidden in shadow.

Clean up the drawing.",How to Draw a Lily2," Sketch a circle in the center of your paper, making the diameter approximately one-third as large as you wish to make the finished lily.


This circle will become a hidden bud or base for the lily petals. You'll need to draw over it, so keep the pencil lines light enough to erase later.

, Draw two trumpet-shaped petals, placing them on the right side of the circle.


Trumpet-shaped contours are similar to teardrop-shaped contours, but the outlines should be curvier.
Both petals should be roughly twice as large as the circle.
The wide portion of one petal should point upward with the tip pointing down. Place this petal directly over the right side of the circle, allowing it to slightly overlap the circle itself.
The wide portion of the other petal should point down with the tip pointing up. It should touch the side of the circle and the side of the other petal.

, Draw two more trumpet-shaped petals, placing them on the left side of the circle.


Draw the top petal first, followed by the bottom one. Both petals should be attached to the contours of the first two, and the base of each one should be hidden beneath the existing petals.
The size of these petals should roughly match the size of the original two, and they should completely cover the remaining width and height of the circle.
Angle these petals in the same general direction as the first two petals.

, Place two small, pointed petals in between some of the other pairs. The first should go in between the top two petals. The second should go in between the two left petals.


These petals should be slightly curved but slightly straighter than the others.
Only draw the tips of each petal. Doing so makes it appear as though the lower portions are hidden by the upper petal layers.

, Carefully draw a smooth line down the center of each existing petal contour.


Keep each line in the center of its respective petal and curve the line along the curve of the petal. Extend it from base to tip, too.

, Draw five to seven lines sticking out from the center of the lily. Draw small, flat ovals at the end of each line to finish the stamen.


Each of these lines should be no longer than half the length of the longest petal.
Position the stamen so that they point out to the left. Let the top few curve upward, but give the bottom few a slight curve downward.

, Draw a horn shape coming from the base of the flower, then sketch a downward pointing stem at the base of this horn.


The horn should look like a ""V"" tips on its side. Point the wide portion toward the original circle and hide it beneath the petals. Angle the narrow portion away from the petals and do not close off the tip.
From the narrow tip, draw two parallel, curves lines. Both lines should point down. These will be the stem of the flower.

, Erase your starting circle and any other stray lines. Leave the lily as it is or add other details as desired.


Consider adding long, slivered leaves extending upward from the base of the stem.
Add shading or coloring to the picture, if desired. Use lighter shading or colors on the areas receiving direct light, but use heavier shading or darker colors on any area hidden by shadow.

Connect two lines to the base of the lily.,
Detail each petal.,
Erase any stray marks.,
Shade or color the lily as desired.",How to Draw a Lily3," Lightly sketch six ovals, arranging them into the form of a ring.


These ovals will become the petals of the lily.
The narrow ends of each oval should point toward the center, rather than lying against the perimeter of the ring.
Allow the ovals to slightly overlap at the center of the ring.

, Go back over each oval, altering the outline slightly to define the petal shape.


For each petal, you'll need to make the blunt, rounded tip a little more pointed. You should also curve the sides of each petal slightly. Each petal should curve in toward the right.
While defining each petal outline, you should also decide how the petals fall. The petals on the right are ""closer"" to the viewer, so the full outlines should be visible. As the petals progress toward the left, the overlapping sections will be ""hidden"" beneath the closer petals.

, Draw four curved line pairs (eight lines total), starting each set in the center of the lily. Top each pair with a small oval.


These will be the stamen of the lily.
Keep the lines within each pair close together. The oval at the top of each pair should close off the lines, making the resulting shape appear solid.
Each stamen should curve slightly downward. Try to make them about half as long as the lily petals, and keep them relatively even in length.

, Draw two slightly curved lines at the bottom of the lily. These lines should both fall in between the same two petals on the bottom right side.


These lines will create the stem of the lily.
Both lines should curve away from the blossom. The space in between the lines should be slightly wider at the top and narrower toward the bottom.

, Draw a single line down the length of each petal. Position each of these lines in the center of its respective petal.


The lines should span most of the length without actually touching the bottom or top of each petal.
Each line should follow the curve of its respective petal.

, Darken the lines you wish to keep by tracing over them again in pencil. Erase any lines you do not wish to keep, working carefully to avoid the permanent lines.


If you do erase one of your permanent lines by accident, redraw the line as soon as you notice the mistake.

, the shape of the lily is already done. If you want to make it more realistic, though, you could shade it with pencil or color it in.


Regardless of which option you choose, try to visualize how the lily would look in natural light. Any area that would come into direct contact with a light source should be kept lighter, but any area that would be hidden in shadow should be made darker.

The fur on the tail is usually moving against the direction where the wolf is running to. Its spread and its form should also be affected by its speed and the wind present in the environment.

, Start with the two prominent legs (marked in red) before the other 2 (marked in blue) as most of their parts are hidden. Also erase the lines marked in green to avoid further confusion.

From the line, go up with a curve, and then make it a little flat, then do a curve in, then an other flat, then do a hook-like curve, you're done! With the back side of the tail......
Okay, going on the other side is easy, just do the exact same thing, like, if you did a bump in on the inner side(the side you jut did), you do a bump-out on the back side(the side you are doing now), but flat is always the same.

, Easy!

Make the next layer, make little flame layers on the active one, so there should be little flames atop the active and the same, no closing them.
So, the salamander should look like he is standing in a large flame.

Get out the drawing paper and your pencil.,

Continue making these elongated teardrop shapes around the circle, letting them overlap randomly, until the whole circle is filled.,
The shape of many dandelions is a semicircle which can be shown by putting lots of the small petals (because they are most concentrated here).

,
Decide if you want to include leaves on the bottom of the stem.",How to Draw a Dandelion," These are the basic tools for drawing, and depending on the artistic quality, they can range from simple and inexpensive, to professional grade.


Pencils come in different strengths. For dark, wide lines, use the soft grade pencils, like 1B <lighter darkest="""">6b, and for fine, light lines, harder leaded pencils, H1<darker lightest="""">H6. For sketching, an ""HB"", or common number 2 pencil is fine.
Paper, as well, comes in different stocks, grades, types, and weights. Newsprint is a cheap, light sketching paper, but does not tolerate much erasing (without tearing) and is usually not suitable for matting and framing. 20# drawing paper is a basic, inexpensive sketch pad paper, fine for doodling, sketching, or even matting and framing. For practice, regular computer printer paper will work.;
, You have a basic slightly curved line for the stem, and an irregular round shape for the flower, so start the drawing so that the finished image ""fits"" your page.

, Bring your pencil up, making the line of the stem, and don't be especially concerned if it is straight, since in nature, flower stems seldom are. Draw another line parallel to the first, making the stem thicker than a simple single line.

, These are guide lines, so make them soft and light enough to be erased or unnoticeable when your drawing is complete.

, Elongate, or stretch the teardrop shape, out to the circle guide line you drew earlier. The individual petals are very elongated teardrop shapes, so make each one long and thin.

, You may want to erase out some of the overlapping lines of these shapes to make the illusion of depth more realistic, as the ""petal"" (each teardrop shape is an individual petal of the flower) on top covers the part of the petal underneath it, so those lines will be invisible in nature.


Add smaller petals on top of the others. Again you will need to rub out extra lines that are hidden because of petals overlapping.
When/If colouring, make the petals in the center a darker shade of yellow than the ones at the back.

,, These will be shaped like a teardrop, with serrated (saw-tooth) edges. They should be shortened tear drops, rather than elongated like the petals.

, Put the additional leaves on the existing leaves. Again, use however many leaves per arm you'd like, just make sure you can draw them in.

, Add the ridges of the cactus following the shapes of the stem and arms. These mark where you'll place the thorns.

, Put the thorns on the ridges, outward from the stem and arms. Have them go in different directions and be of different sizes, just like thorns on a real cactus.

, Most people use green for the color, with lighter green on the arms, while the ground is cracked and light brown. But your cactus could be purple or pink or polka-dotted, so long as it's still recognizable--the pigment is really up to you.

Experiment more with the angles, shading, and overall appearance.,
Work your way up to drawing clusters of blossoms.",How to Draw a Cherry Blossom," Get an idea of what different designs look like so you're ready to draw them.;
, As you can observe in real life, flowers are not just shown in one angle, but in many. Drawing them from different angles like in front, side, or back adds realism to your art.


for the front and back angle, the circle is usually a perfect circle, while in side-view, it's an oval shape, because the flower is flat and not a sphere. Imagine a piece of paper in the shape of a circle; when you look in front, it's a perfect shape, but as you move or rotate it at the sides in different degrees of angles, it becomes an oval until it completely becomes thin in 90 degrees.

, The filaments are one of the basic parts of the cherry blossom. Make sure to incorporate the angle you want it to be. Think of sticks or people standing, as you also go in different directions or angles. The line changes, rotates, and increases or decreases its length.

, The anthers are an important part of the cherry blossom. Think of the ball of a pin, positioned in different angles.

, Cherry blossoms aren't just one shade of pink. Different species of cherry blossoms comes in different shades of pink to white. There can even be color blending on the petals. The blending of the petals can be dark to light, or light to dark from the inner to the outer. The center of the flower is usually colored in different shades of dark pink, and white cherry blossoms usually have a dark green to olive green color.

, Add them to make the scene of the Cherry Blossom Complete. Because a Cherry Blossom can't stand alone without something to hold it. Not only just the flower, the leaves, stems, and branches are an important part of the tree.

, We can't just leave the remaining parts colorless and lifeless. Give it life by putting color in it. Add some texture to make it look a bit natural.

, The different species of cherry blossoms not only differ in color, but also in petal shapes. Some have a bit of a spiky appearance, while some are roundly shaped.


Look up pictures of real cherry blossoms. You can observe from nature, that there are more styles of petals in different forms. You can even experiment and try inventing your own style.

, Using the different designs and colors, try to keep it more diverse as possible. Here are some examples of more Cherry Blossom ideas.

Create your own doodle world.",How to Doodle," If you want to be a master doodler, then you should be prepared to doodle wherever you go. Inspiration -- or boredom -- can strike at any moment, not just in your third period history class, so you should always be prepared to start doodling. You should always carry a notebook around, along with a few tools. You can begin with a few basic tools and use more artistic tools as your doodling skills improve. Here are some great tools to doodle with:


Simple supplies:

Pencil
Ink Pen
Highlighter
Marker
Ballpoint pen


Artist supplies:

Charcoal
Chalk
Coloured Pencils
Paint
Pastels

;
, As soon as you feel the urge to doodle, just put your pen to the paper and get started. Whether you're thinking of an act, an event, a feeling, a person, a place, a song, or even your own name, you should just put your pen to the paper and start drawing to see what you come up with. When the urge to doodle strikes, don't ignore it (unless it's not appropriate for you to doodle), or the feeling may pass.


You'll find that you can also become inspired after you begin to doodle. You don't have to wait for the feeling that tells you to doodle -- you can just start doodling and feel the inspiration seep into your pores.

, You don't have to stick to doodling just flowers, puppies, or your own last name. You can start by doodling a garden of flowers, then think of your best friend Mary Flowers and start drawing her pet poodle, Pork Chop, who makes you think of the delicious pork chop dinner you had last night...just start with one image and keep drawing whatever pops into your head.


You don't have to stick to one theme or concept. No one is judging you -- and it's likely that no one will even see your doodles, so feel free to draw whatever you want.

, Flowers are a popular item for doodling because there are endless variety of flowers and they are fun and easy to draw. Here are some ways you can draw flowers:


Draw a vase and fill it with your own bouquet of flowers.
Draw a garden that is filled with unique flowers.
Draw a field of sunflowers with a sun shining down on them.
Draw a rose bush surrounded by rose petals.
Draw daisies. Cross off some of the petals and play ""He loves me, he loves me not.""
Write your own name or another word in simple flowers.

, Faces are more complicated to draw than most flowers, but you'll feel rewarded when you've truly learned to draw a face. You can draw the face of your teacher or your classmate, or just have fun drawing a random face. Here are some other ways to doodle faces:


Practice drawing almost the same face with different expressions. This will help you get to know the face you're doodling.
Doodle a face of a person you know from memory, whether it's your crush or favorite celebrity. Later, you can compare the doodle to the actual person and see how well you did.
Doodle parts of a face. Draw an entire page of eyeballs, lips, or noses, and see how much you learn.
Doodle a caricature. Draw a face with silly, exaggerated features.

, Your name is another popular thing to doodle. There are a variety of ways to doodle your name, whether you're writing it over and over again in the same way, or writing your name in a completely new way every time. Here are some ways to doodle your name:


Write your name in cursive. Try writing it with exaggerated loops.
Try writing your name as small as you possibly can while making it still legible.
Write different versions of your name that abbreviate your first, middle, or last name. For example: ""Jean M. Carmen,"" ""J. M. Carmen,"" or ""Jean Marie C.""
Write your first name along with the last name of your crush. This will help you see if you're a match made in heaven.
Write your name in big block letters. Decorate the block letters with vines, stars, planets, or hearts.
Write your name in bubble letters. Have soap bubbles floating off the top of your name.

, Animals are another fun thing to doodle, and there are endless possibilities to covering your pages with cute or scary creatures. You can draw your pet dog, create a creature of your own, or even turn an ordinary kitty into a monster. Here are some other ways to doodle animals:


Doodle underwater creatures. Draw an ocean and place all of the underwater creatures you can think of, from jellyfish to sharks, in this fun seascape.
Doodle jungle creatures. Create your own jungle filled with parakeets, monkeys, snakes, and any jungle creatures you can think of.
Turn ordinary creatures into monsters. Doodle a collection of cute kitties, puppies, and bunnies, and then have fun giving them fangs, evil eyes, and devil's horns.
Doodle your favorite pet. Are you obsessed with your dog? Draw him in a variety of cute poses.
Doodle your dream pet. Draw the pet you'd like to have the most, even if it's completely impractical. You can even name him and write his name around him in bubble letters.
Doodle a hybrid creature. Draw a dog with a lamb's head, a leopard with a peacock's tail, or a fish with an alligator snout.

, Have fun doodling whatever you see in front of you, whether it's your teacher, your classmates, the board, or the world outside your classroom. You can find a lot of originality in the ordinary objects right in front of you. Here are some other things to doodle:


The contents of your pencil case
The expression on your teacher's face
The clouds or sun outside your window
The trees outside your window
Anything hanging on the wall in front of you
Your other hand

, A fun way to free associate while you're doodling is to listen to whatever your teacher or the people around you are saying and to doodle the things that you're hearing about. Here are some ways to doodle what you hear:


Doodle a historical figure. If your teacher is talking about George Washington, draw him in a variety of poses.
Doodle a person you've never met. If you hear two people discussing a person with a funny name, just imagine what he would look like and draw him.
Doodle a concept. What do you think of when your teacher says, ""embargo"" or ""bell curve""? You don't have to doodle what the object actually is -- just doodle what it makes you picture in your head.
Doodle a song. Did someone walk into the classroom with that song that always gets stuck in your head blaring from his headphones? Draw whatever it is the song makes you think about.

, Cityscapes are fun to doodle and are perfect for the bottom or top margins of your pages. Draw a cityscape along the top of your notebook page, and have fun adding all of the little details that make it unique. Here are some things you can do when you doodle a cityscape:


Make it night. The city looks the most beautiful at night, so draw a full moon and shade the sky in a dark color.
Draw little windows in all of the houses. Some will be lit and some won't be.
Add more details. Add trees, lamps, phone booths, trash cans, and even people walking their dogs on the streets outside the city.
Draw a city you love. Think you know exactly what the New York cityscape looks like? Try drawing it and see how accurate you were later.

, As you become a more experienced doodler, you can create your own world, with your own people, your own animals, your own buildings, and your own trees in it. As you become more experienced, your creatures, thoughts, and people will begin to take on their own form and everyone will be able to recognize them as yours.


Once you're a professional doodler, you can spread your love for doodling to others. Become an after-school doodle coach and share your love for doodling with others.
You can even name your own world something like, ""Megland,"" or ""Walt's World,"" and write this name on top of your doodles.
You can create a collage of your doodles in your room by taping the pages to your wall and being proud of all the doodling you've done.

Gather your supplies.,
Find a quiet place.,
Create a space for yourself.,
Relax.,
Do some warm-ups.,
Focus on the subject rather than on the process, especially if you tend to stress about the details.,
Let yourself experiment.",How to Write or Draw in Peace," You won't be calm and collected if you're constantly hopping up to grab another pencil.


Choose good supplies that won't get in your way or cause a distraction themselves.;
, This could be a corner of your room or home that you reserve as space for creativity. If you need inspiration or if home is not a peaceful place for drawing, it could be away from home. Try the library or, if the weather is nice, the park.

,


A permanent space might be a desk or nook or studio.
A temporary place might be wherever you end up with a portable easel or notebook.
Choose what is peaceful for you as far as environment goes. Do certain colors feel peaceful or comfortable to you?
Decide whether you like your environment neat and tidy for creativity or a bit jumbled and cluttered. You may find inspiration even in the mess on your desk, if it's not bothering you. Make or choose your environment to suit you.

, Put yourself in a calm, peaceful state of mind. Breathe deeply, imagine a peaceful scene, and consciously relax. Relaxing music or sounds of nature can help too.

, Scribble for a bit, write some stream-of-consciousness stuff (whatever comes to mind)

, Concentrate on getting something on paper first, without worrying about whether it is any good. You can always rewrite, redraw, or even throw it out later if you still can't make it go.


For example, when drawing a figure you should just draw all the parts before worrying about whether it is any good.

, Go in whatever direction seems interesting at the time, and don't worry about the details just yet.

Draw 3D letters.,
Write in calligraphy.,
Attempt some ancient-looking letters.,
Draw bubble letters.,
Try writing like a tagger.",How to Draw Letters," This is a simple method, requiring only that you know how to connect lines in a way that makes them appear three-dimensional. You can even do it on the computer if you so desire, and if you want them to stand out even more, you can try 3D block letters.;
, Calligraphy, the art of decorative handwriting using a pen and/or brush, can be difficult to master, but once you get there you're golden. If you already know calligraphy, you can still work on improving your calligraphy by writing short notes to yourself in calligraphy.

, To do this you'll need to practice your flourishes; every single letter must be elaborate. Make your script look extra realistic by doing it on parchment, or a scrap of paper you've burned at the edges.

, These are a little juvenile, but aesthetically pleasing nonetheless. Use them when doing lettering on cards and signs for kids.

, Incorporate designs you like and other types of lettering you've seen, including those above. Tagging is all about creativity—just let the inspiration flow.

Understand the basics of psychotherapy treatment.,
Consider whether your problems will benefit from psychotherapy.,
Decide whether art psychotherapy works for you.,
Become familiar with the few materials required for art therapy.,
Decide if you prefer individual or group art therapy.",How to Decide Whether Art Therapy is Right for You," Talk based, it is a way to explore the patterns of behavior, feelings and thoughts through which the patient can be suggested some healthy coping strategy. When you discuss your past and current experiences, you develop an understanding that you contribute to the array of unsuccessful and successful outcomes in your own life. This helps you in acquiring the tool in making lasting changes.;
, It can be used to treat emotional and psychological disorders such as depression and anxiety, as well as relationship difficulties. It can work for you if you have a tendency to act on emotions that you do not understand.


Psychotherapy is not like drug therapy, which only helps treating the symptoms of the emotional illness; and is effective only when the medication is taken. Psychotherapy makes a lifelong impact and brings about a positive impact on the thought and behavior pattern.

, This is a procedure or treatment that helps you bring about an expression of your thoughts via an art form. Here, art is used as a form of communication. It helps you to understand your own problems better.


Art here is used as a tool for the process of psychotherapy; it could help you to express easily and communicate without feeling threatened or unsafe; these thoughts might not be really easy to express otherwise.
You are given an opportunity to bring out your feelings and thoughts in the form of lines, shapes, form and color. The creativity process brings about a form of interaction and communication; which you find difficult, shy or awkward to express otherwise.
As the artwork is a display of both unconscious and conscious thoughts and feelings; it makes for better opportunities to explore.

, These are items such as clay and markers, paint, brushes, chalk. There are no criteria for you to have past experience with art of any level or any artistic skills. Here you don’t need to aim to get in place a picture or sculpture that has aesthetic value; it is a process that is given to you for self-expression to bring a positive change, healing and personal growth.

, In just the same way as with other psychotherapy or counseling techniques, art therapy can be used in one-to-one or group situations.

Relieve stress with a coloring book.,
Paint with soothing colors.,
Create a collage.",How to Reduce Stress Using Art Therapy1," Coloring books are a popular way to reduce stress because they allow people to focus on the action of coloring, rather than creating a complex piece of artwork. Many adult coloring books are available at craft and book stores, and feature complex patterns that help engage and distract the mind.There are also coloring apps available to download to your smartphone. If you feel self-conscious about using a coloring book, especially if you want to destress while in a public place, an app is a more discreet option.
Many find coloring books a useful tool to express creativity and actively engage their mind without the stress of having to design and plan a full art piece of their own.;
, Think about colors that are soothing to you. For many people, those are cool colors such as blue, purple, and green, but these can be any colors you find calming. Paint a picture, abstract or realistic, using these colors to help calm your mind.You can use any type of paint, but some suggest that watercolor used on watercolor paper may be more soothing, as it naturally produces easy transitions between the colors.
Alternatively, those who feel the need to express stress or rage may benefit from using paints such as acrylics or gouache and applying pigment with greater force using rough brushes and paint knives.

, Mixed media art offers people the greatest range of expression and experimentation. Create a collage using art and crafting materials as a way to take your mind off of your current stress.Your collage can feature whatever materials you want, from art media such as markers, pens, and paint, to craft media like modeling clay, pipe cleaners, and fabric, and even found materials or materials that weren’t designed for a creative purpose.
You may opt to create an ongoing work that you use whenever you feel stressed. You can work on it when you need to calm yourself, and then set it aside until stress hits again.

Draw one side of your heart.,

Create a jagged edge down one half of your heart.,
Draw a second jagged line down the other side.,
Double-check your handiwork.,
Add any details you like.,
Color your heart.,
Complete your broken heart.",How to Draw a Broken Heart," It’s best to use a pencil while you’re learning how to draw a broken heart. This will allow you to easily erase mistakes. Begin at the top by drawing a semicircle. Then, extend your line downwards at a diagonal.This first step is no different than if you were drawing a regular, intact heart.;
, When you begin, do not connect it directly to the first side. The second side of your heart should be mirror image to the first. However, instead of joining the two sides together, as you would with a normal heart, leave a tiny bit of space.

In other words, you should have a small gap between the two semi circles forming the top curves of your heart, and there should be another small gap where the point would normally form.

, If you don’t feel comfortable or capable drawing the two sides of the heart free hand, you can use the shape technique discussed here. This will walk you through drawing the full outline of a heart, and then you’ll simply need to use your eraser to create tiny gaps at the top and bottom of your finished heart., Start at top of one of your heart halves, where you left a small gap. Then, create a jagged edge that extends downwards towards the tail of that half, where it normally would meet in a point. This should create a separate half, complete with a jagged edge.

This is why you left the two gaps when you drew the outline of your heart. It will allow you to have a bit of space between the two broken pieces.
If you didn’t leave a gap, you can always draw your jagged line anyways. The heart will still look broken, just not in two pieces.

, However, this time, carefully draw it so that it would fit into the other side of the heart like a puzzle piece. In other words, where the first half juts in, the second half should poke out. It should appear that, if you were able to bring the two pieces back together, they would fit.









This doesn’t have to be perfect. You can just eyeball it, and use your first half as a general reference for how the second half should look.

, The beautiful thing about working in pencil is that you can easily fix any mistakes. You can redo the jagged edges, round out the top more, or make any other corrections you need. Make sure you are pleased with your pencil outline before outlining it with a pen or maker, or adding color.








, You can make your heart look three-dimensional by adding shading around the borders. You can emphasize the damage done to the heart by adding bandages, additional scrapes and cuts on either half, or even drawing tears coming off the heart. You can even add arrows or knives entering the heart, piercing it. You can get really creative with your additional details.








, Again, this step is completely up to your personal preference and creativity. You can stick with a traditional red, or you can certainly mix it up. Set a dark tone by coloring out heart black, or use several colors to create bruising or extra blood around the broken, jagged edges. It’s your drawing, so there is certainly no wrong way to go.








, Outline the entire thing in a dark black to make it pop, or leave it as it is. You can add text around it, such as quotes about heartbreak or a message about someone who has hurt you. Let any marker ink dry fully before touching it.

Sculpt with clay.,

Make a calming book.",How to Reduce Stress Using Art Therapy2," A 45-minute session making art using sculpting clay, among other media, helps create measurable reductions in stress.Take an hour or so when you’re feeling stressed to sit down with clay and some sculpting tools.


If you don’t know what to sculpt, try creating a sculpture depicting your stress or emotions. It can be realistic or abstract, whatever you feel is right.
Remind yourself that it’s not about what the sculpture looks like at the end of your session. The important thing is to engage in the creative process and turn your mind away from its stress.

, Drawing in the sand shares the same principles as a zen garden, particularly those pertaining to clearing the mind. Simply use your finger or a stick and a patch of sand for stress relief on-the-go.Do not focus on creating an elaborate or intricate drawing. Instead, work on one sketch until you are content with it, then wipe it away and start on something new.
Sand drawing can be as simple as you want. You are free to create anything from elaborate scenes to abstract shapes to stick figures.

, Use a sketchbook or journal to create a book filled with images and mementos of people, places, and things that can help calm you when you’re stressed. Think about people and things of significance in your life that help you feel calm, and paste pictures or reminders of them into your book.Not only will creating your book help you de-stress, you can also use your book whenever you get overly stressed to help calm you and remind you of people and things you love.

Contact a certified art therapist.,
Set an initial appointment.,
Begin to attend sessions.,
Try a therapy group.",How to Reduce Stress Using Art Therapy3," While some therapists may encourage art as a form of expression or stress relief, only credentialed art therapists that meet the Art Therapy Credentials Board’s standards are considered practicing art therapists. Search the ATCB or your national art therapist regulating body’s directory to find a credentialed art therapist near you.Art therapists go through all the schooling expected of any therapist, including a master’s degree, and receive further training under practicing art therapists before becoming certified.
You can search the ATCB’s website for a credentialed therapist and filter your search based on preferences such as area.
If there is not a certified art therapist in your area, doing art therapy with a regular therapist can still be beneficial. For instance, you could do an exercise at home, such as painting your emotional state, and then bring it to to discuss during your session. You can also ask your therapist if they can help you come up with more creative stress management techniques.

, Just as with most therapists, you will need to set an initial appointment to meet with your therapist before you begin the actual art therapy practice. Call a practicing therapist's office and let them know specifically that you interested in their art therapy over their other practices.Intake appointments often include some questions about personal history and present emotions. Always answer honestly to the best of your ability, but know that you do not have to provide any information that makes you uncomfortable.
Let your therapist know that you are interested in their art therapy practice for the purposes of stress relief. This helps them create a plan that is tailored to you.

, Once you have met with your therapist, you are ready to start attending sessions as you and your therapist see fit. Call their office to set appointments, and start working with your therapist directly on establishing your comfort level with art and setting goals for your therapy.Know that your therapist will likely watch you intently and speak with you regarding your creation throughout the session.
This is not so that they can correct or judge what you are doing, but instead so that they can help you through the emotional process you experience as you create your piece.

, If you are not ready for one-on-one art therapy or want a cost-effective alternative, you may opt to join an art therapy group. These groups are generally offered directly by practicing art therapists and often meet once a week or once every month.Contact your local art therapists’ offices to ask about any new art therapy groups that may be starting in the near future.
Groups generally run in sessions of a few weeks to a few months. If no one has a spot open for you now, ask to receive a notification to sign up for the next session before it starts.
Group sessions are generally more affordable than individual sessions, and may or may not be covered by insurance. Ask your provider for your specific coverage information.
If group art therapy is not available, you might look into more casual group art activities. These have grown in popularity in recent years, and you may find that going to a painting or ceramic class (over a period of weeks or even just for a single evening) with friends helps you engage your creative side and de-stress.

Give the kangaroo a face.",How to Draw a Kangaroo1," The vertical line should still point upward, but the horizontal line should tilt downward.


The vertical line will be the front of the kangaroo and the horizontal line will be one of its hind legs. Since the kangaroo has long back legs, this horizontal line should be approximately the same length as the the vertical line.;
, This new line should only be one-quarter the length of the lower horizontal line.


Also note that this line should extend outward in the same direction of the lower horizontal line, but it should curve in the opposite direction (upward instead of downward).
This new line will form the lower part of the kangaroo's head.

, Draw one long, curved line connection the outer point of the top horizontal line to the inner point of the lower horizontal line.


This line should rise above the top point and curve into a half-circle above the top point of the vertical line. Leave some space in between the lines; when finished with this portion, you should see the shape of the head.
Continue drawing toward the bottom point from behind the vertical line. Curve this new line close to the original line for one-third of its length, then expand it into a larger curve until it reaches the bottom point. From the top of the head to the bottom of the body, the new line should look similar to the letter ""S.""

, Complete the first back leg by drawing a parallel line just beneath the lower horizontal line of your original ""L.""


Bring the back end of this new line up to meet the lower portion of the curved back line.
Draw three short lines in between the front of both lower horizontal lines. These short lines will represent toes.
Sketch a half-circle inside the body, connected to the front curve, and roughly one-third up from the bottom. The half-circle should not reach the back curve line.
Complete the other back leg simply by sketching another line that runs parallel to the original lower horizontal line. This new line should be above the original and should remain outside the body.

, Add three downward curved lines to the front of the body, placing them roughly one-third from the top.


These lines should mimic the curve of the back legs, but they should only be approximately one-quarter the length of the back legs.
Draw three short parallel lines in between the lower two front leg lines; these will be the toes of the closest front leg.

, Draw another curved line coming off the bottom of the back body (""S"") curve. This line should curve upward and point away from the body.


Note that its size should roughly match the size of the back legs.
After drawing the first tail line, draw another line just above it. Both lines should be connected to the body and should meet each other at a point.

, Draw a shallow ""C"" curve at the back of the head, allowing the curve to slope upward. Connect the top of this curve to the head in a straight line, completing one ear.


Draw another ear just like the first directly beneath the first. The second ear is ""closer,"" so it should be slightly larger.
Note that both ears should be just a little smaller than the head itself.

, Add a dot to the center of the face for an eye and a straight or gently curved line near the bottom of the head for the mouth.


This is the final step. Once you draw the face, the entire kangaroo is complete.

Draw a curved line for the back and tail.,
Add the front leg and belly.,
Sketch the back leg.,
Mirror both legs.,
Add a face.",How to Draw a Kangaroo2," Sketch a sideways cone with a rounded point. Leave the base of the cone open.


The two slanted edges do not need to mirror one another. The bottom edge should be fairly horizontal, but the upper edge should slant upward at an approximate 45-degree angle.
Both lines should stop at the same imaginary vertical boundary, however.

, Draw a vertical triangle at the end of top muzzle line. Draw another vertical triangle just behind the first, but make it slightly smaller and partially hidden behind the first.


The sides of the ""front"" ear should be roughly two-thirds the length of the upward muzzle line.
Leave the bottom for the ""front"" ear open and the bottom of the ""rear"" ear closed.

, Draw a slightly curved line that comes down from the end point of the ""front"" ear triangle. This will be the back of the neck.


Draw a straight line coming down from the end of the bottom muzzle line. This will be the front of the neck.
The two lines should be nearly parallel, but the front neck line should be nearly twice as long as the back neck line.

, Sketch a downward-pointing arc starting at the bottom of the back neck. This arc should extend downward and away from the head.


The first arc will only be the back of the kangaroo.
To attach the tail, draw a straight line from the end of the back arc, keeping the connecting point smooth instead of sharp.

Draw a second line from the tip of the tail, extending back toward the body. This second line should end where the first began, and the two combined should form a slightly curved triangle.



, Draw the front leg just beside the end point of the front neck line. Sketch a gently curved line for the stomach on the opposite side of the front leg.


The top part of the front leg should angle back and away from the head; the middle part should be twice as long and should angle down and forward, gradually becoming more narrow near the bottom; the final part should be an enclosed-half circle for the paw.
Note that the belly line should be roughly the same size as the middle part of the front leg.

, The back leg has the shape of a capital ""L,"" and both the top and bottom of the leg should be the same size. Position the back leg at the end of the belly line.


Sketch an arc at the front of the back leg (where it connects to the belly). This arc should open toward the back leg itself.
Sketch another arc from the back of the back leg. This arc should open toward the first and will create the rear of the animal. Make sure that it connects the leg to the bottom opening of the tail.

, The existing legs are those ""nearest"" the viewer. Draw two slightly smaller but otherwise identical legs along the underside of the body to represent the ""furthest"" legs.


Position the second front leg to the inside of the first, somewhere near the top of the belly.
Position the second back leg just a little above the first.

, Draw a small arc from the front of the muzzle to represent the nose. Place a dot just beneath the top muzzle line, halfway between the nose and the ear; this represents the eye.

Expand the tail.,
Detail the face.",How to Draw a Kangaroo3," Draw one large oval in the center of the paper, then add a slightly smaller one directly beside it on the upper right side. Finish by drawing an even smaller circle to the upper right of the second.


The largest oval will form the main part of the kangaroo's body, and it should be just a little taller than it is wide.
The middle oval will continue the body. It should nearly be a perfect circle, and it should be roughly half as big as the first circle. Its edge should meet the edge of the bigger circle.
The small circle will form the head and needs to be roughly two-thirds the size of the middle circle. Its edge should also meet the edge of the middle circle.

, Draw one cone off the right side of the top circle; this will be the kangaroo's muzzle. Draw a second cone near the top left of the top circle; this will be the ear.


The muzzle should have rounded edges, and it should also point slightly downward. Make it just a little smaller than the circle itself.
The ear should be thinner and slightly longer than the muzzle. It should also point upward.

, Draw lines that connect the head to the middle of the body, and separate lines that connect the middle of the body to the bottom.


The lines connecting the head to the middle will form the neck. They should run tangent to both circles and be fairly straight on either side (left and right).
The lines connecting the middle to the bottom will form the outer edge of the actual body. The top line should form a downward arc between the top of the middle oval and the top left of the bottom oval. The bottom line should be a smaller upward arc connecting the bottom of the middle oval to the right side of the bottom oval.
After drawing your connecting lines, you can erase the inner oval/circle edges lying in between these new lines.

, Sketch a series of three blocks for the arm, two blocks for the lower leg, and three blocks for the tail.


The blocks forming the arm should start at the center of the middle circle and hang beneath the animal's belly. The first block should slant back and end where the oval ended; the second should slant forward and drop beneath the belly; the third should be slant back and be roughly half the size of the first.
The blocks forming the back leg should form an ""L"" shape, and the top of the first block should connect to the bottom edge of the lowest oval. Both blocks should be the same size.
The blocks forming the tail should connect to the lower left side of the lowest oval, just behind the back leg. Curve these blocks away from the body and make them progressively narrower. The final block should have a pointed outer tip.

, Trace back over the outer edges of the arm and leg blocks, smoothing out the connecting points and making them less sharp.


Angle the top line of the last block in each leg so that it comes down at a gentle ""C"" curve. Both of these last blocks should form the feet of the kangaroo.
After smoothing out the legs, erase the inner block lines, leaving only the outline of each leg.

, Draw a line just above the bottom leg line. It should match the direction and shape of the bottom leg line, but it should stop a little shorter than the established leg.


Similarly, draw a line to the inside of front leg/arm line, matching the direction and shape of the front leg but falling just a little short of the overall length.
Both of these new lines should form the legs ""furthest"" away from the viewer.

, Smooth out the connecting points between the tail blocks, making them less sharp.


Erase the inner tail lines, leaving only the outline behind.

, Erase the line between the muzzle and the main portion of the head, then draw a semi-circle nose at the tip of the muzzle. Add a large dot for the eye near the right edge of the original head circle.


You should also add another ear that mimics the line of the first.
Detailing the face is the final step in this drawing method. Once you finish drawing the face, the kangaroo should be done.

Learn the foundation of calligraphy.,
Get a variety of nibs.,
Hold your pen at a constant angle.,
Maintain proper form.,
Do not press hard on the pen.,
Draw vertical, horizontal and diagonal lines parallel with one another.,
Beware of the different angles.",How to Draw Fancy Letters1," Calligraphy letters are drawn using thick and thin strokes to create shapes. They are not written like traditional letters. This ‘thick-and-thin’ effect creates a flowing, consistent pattern.Here are basic rules to follow:


Keep the pen-angle constant
Don't push too hard on the nib
Draw parallel lines and even curves.;
, A ‘calligraphy nib’ refers to a pen tip that is broad and flat instead of a more commonly rounded point pen such as a fountain pen. This wide, flat structure allows the nib to create a unique ‘thick-and-thin’ effect which is what makes calligraphic letters look fancy. Nibs come in different widths, so having several will allow you to experiment., It is important that you hold the pen so that the tip of the nib points away from you and to the left, at around 30° to 60°. The angle will vary depending on the specific script that you want to create, or naturally with the way you hold the pen., As you write, the nib should never turn to form lines and curves. The trick to creating beautiful, uniform calligraphy is to keep the point in the same direction. This is why you will have to pick your hand up to create several strokes that form each letter. Each stroke follows a pattern and shares similarities with other letters., Form each stroke by gently leading the nib across the paper. Your strokes will move backwards, forwards, and sideways from the direction the nib is pointing. Your hand, wrist, forearm, and elbow should not be touching the table. By fully supporting your hand and arm, it will help you keep a light pressure on the pen to help your strokes flow.You may damage the nib if you press too hard. If you lean on the pen, your letters may not flow, and your arm may get tired.By pushing the nib incorrectly, it may dig into the paper and blot. Always follow the strokes of calligraphy., Regardless of the specific type of calligraphy you draw, this same rule will follow. For example, italic calligraphy is created with lines that slope away upwards to the right, while Roman letters are drawn with perfectly vertical, straight-up-and-down lines., Each skill focuses on the practice of accurate angles. Drawing lines that have the same angle as each other is just as important as keeping your pen-nib at a constant angle. If you draw lines at the correct angle, they won't look right if your pen is not kept at the correct angle. Never alter your pen angle for different line strokes.


As you form each letter, you will constantly be picking the pen up from the paper to start new lines. To keep your pen angle accurate, do not move the pen from your fingers before finishing a letter, and do not twist the pen around between your fingers.

, This often works best if you use a natural pose, but you can also draw the animal in a more human-like position.

, For example, if you are drawing a mouse, draw a considerably small head. However if you are drawing an elephant, use a large head. For a fox, use a medium sized head.

, This may, again, depend on the animal. For a fox, draw a fairly long rectangle that sits behind the head.

, This includes the eyes, ears, nose and mouth. For a fox, draw an elongated snout with an oval shaped nose, almond shaped eyes and pointy ears. The mouth may be sly or neutral, depending on the character that you are drawing. For example, if the fox is destined to be cunning, use a sly smile.

,, For a fox, draw bushy cheeks, fluffy ears and a strip of white down the centre of the head.

, This may include fur and markings. When drawing a fox, add a fluffy, white underbelly.

, You may choose to leave it simple or you may choose to add in shading. If you decide to do this, decide on a point from which light may shine and use darker shading the further away from that point you get. To keep it simple, use a limited colour pallet and colour each part in the same colour.

Pay attention to patterns.,
Use these main strokes to create the alphabet.",How to Draw Fancy Letters2," This style is characterized by densely packed, angular letter forms, and a uniform style of vertical strokes. Blackletter font may be best used to express the wonder and fear on book covers, posters, records, or film titles. They could also express seriousness on diplomas or award certificates. , This style is best known for being dense and having angular letter-forms. The letters share many shapes to create a uniform and flowing piece of work. Here are important skills to use:


Keep the pen angle at 30° to 45°
Draw straight vertical lines
Draw short, diagonal lines for decorative tails
Use small, controlled movements
Create a flow and a rhythm among the letters

, Although there will be a slight angle variation as you write, the angle will still add uniformity and character to the overall work., Instead of one fluid motion to form a letter, you will use two to four strokes to create each one that will form a pattern among the letters. Even though each letter is different, there are certain shapes that many of them have in common., For h, m, n, r, and t, the first stroke will be the same. Hold your pen at a 30° angle, and make a straight line down and a sharp 45° tail up and to the right. The tail should be small with a sharp edge and not interfere with any part of the letter., For b, d, l, u, and y, the first stroke will be the same. You will create a straight stroke downwards with a soft 45° tail that angles up and to the right. The curve should be more rounded than sharp., For b, c, d, e, o, p, g, and q, you will start from the top, and move right and down to form the top part of their circles. Once you reach halfway around the circle, pick up your pen, and start a new stroke that moves from the right and down to the left. End the circle when you reach the main vertical line., Some tips and lines require softer, 30° angles, letters like k, v, w, and x all require 45° strokes. To make their downward lines, start at the top, and move either to the right or left being sure to move at a 45° angle. When you reach the bottom of the line, make an upward 30° curve.

, The ""a"" is unique, and it requires three separate motions. Hold your pen at a 45° angle. Create a tail at the top by moving to the right and up, and then make a line going down and to the right. Finish the stroke with a tail that curves up and to the right. Lift your pen, and make the bottom part of the circular pattern by moving from left to right, and stroking upwards. Move from right to left as you finish the top of the circle by starting at the first straight line, and finishing at the start of the second stroke., Make the middle of the ""s"" first by drawing a downward stroke from left to right. Create the bottom curve moving from left to right and wrapping upward to the bottom of the center line. Finish with the top moving from left to right, starting from the middle line and curving up and then, back down.

, Horizontal strokes are made be moving left to right. To create the curvature of the ""z"", slightly curve up where you start and end. Remember to keep the angle of your pen consistent. Create the middle line by starting at the right end of the top horizontal line, and stroking down and to the right at a 45° angle. Finish the letter with another horizontal line that starts at the bottom tip of the middle line, and strokes to the right with an upward curl at the beginning and end. The two horizontal lines should have identical curves.

, Although ""g"" and ""f"" have some different strokes, the main downward stroke with tail are the same. Start by moving your pen down, and create a small tail to the left. Do not finish the tail by moving your pen up. Pick up you pen, and start a new stroke that moves down and to the right. This stroke should meet the small tail of your first stroke.

, All letters in calligraphy follow the same basic strokes. Practice each letter using this guide so there is a uniformity among all of the letters.

Notice the detail of cursive calligraphy.,
Use a basic upward stroke.,
Learn the downward stroke.,
Practice the curve stroke with the letter ""o"".,
Try drawing a ""u"".,
Draw the letter ""h"".,
Try the other letters.",How to Draw Fancy Letters3," This style has many similarities to standard cursive. Most of the letters are made with just one stroke as cursive is meant to be done with efficiency. The main strokes to learn are downward, upward, and curve strokes., Use lined paper, and start just above the bottom line. Curve down and to the right to the bottom line. When you touch the bottom line, stroke up to the top line moving from left to right., The letters b, f, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, and z all start with a downward stroke. Depending on the letter, you will have strokes that go to the top line, and some will only reach the middle line. The letter ""f"" will actually reach below the bottom line. These lines will flow from right to left., Put the tip of your pen right below the top line. Arc your pen down and around to the right, and bring the pen tip back to where you started. Finish the ""O"" with a curl to the right.

, Start with your pen tip on the bottom line. Draw an upward stroke to the middle line, and make a downward stroke that reaches to the bottom line and then, curves back up. Finish with another downward stroke and a small curl.Letters like i, j, m, n, r, v, w, and y have this stroke.

, Start with your pen tip on the bottom line, and stroke up to the top line. Then, arc your pen to the left, and draw a downward stroke to the bottom line so that you cross over your first line at the bottom. Make an upward stroke to the middle line, and another downward stroke back down to the bottom line finishing with an upward curl at the end.


Letters like b, f, k, and l have similar strokes.

, Use a cursive calligraphy chart, and these stroke references, to guide you through the alphabet. Remember to keep your angles consistent, and resist the temptation to finish letters using the same, continuous stroke.

Use ""sized"" paper.,
Choose acid free or neutral pH paper.,
Try archival or “Rag” Paper.",How to Draw Fancy Letters4," Sizing refers treated paper that inhibits the absorption of ink to prevent it from bleeding This is the most common paper type for calligraphy because it helps to create clean, sharp lettering., Over time, wood pulp paper will begin to turn yellow and deteriorate. Acid-free or neutral  pH paper is a treatment that neutralizes this problem and should be used for works that are meant to be kept for long periods of time., This type of paper is usually made from cotton or linen and has a neutral pH that will not yellow. Some papers and sketchbooks are labeled with “acid-free”, “archival” or “rag” and would be good to use for calligraphy."

By using pencil, you will be able to easily erase and mark over what you draw., Be sure to keep your lines parallel to the top and bottom of the paper.


Try clipping your paper, or the material you are drawing on, to the table to keep it straight. This will help keep your letters straight., You can use the fonts stored on your computer for inspiration, or you can search for fonts online. Once you find a font you want to use, keep it out if front of you as an example., Go slowly, and try to be as accurate as possible. Remember to use a ruler when possible.

, Using a pen with a finer point, or one that is made to glide smoothly, will help your letters turn out better. You can find special pens such as calligraphy pens online or at large convenience stores., Gently go over the area, and make sure you do not smudge the your pen lines. Try waiting until the pen is completely dry before erasing your visible pencil lines."

There are many different types of italicized fonts to choose from., The first step is to use a pencil to trace your letters. This way you can fix any errors or spacing issues. Once your letters look the way you want, trace over them with a good pen that is meant for fancy lettering. These pens offer finer tips and a smoother glide so your letters flow nicely., After you have traced out your letters, go back and add some creative design.

Open your text editor.,
Select your font.,
Decide on a picture.,
Resize your image.,
Type your text.,
Design your art in various shades using solid art techniques.,
Shape your image using line art techniques.,
Create images with dimensional depth.",How to Make Pictures out of Text1," Any text editor like Word or Pages will work to design your image. You can also choose to use a graphic design program like Photoshop to make your picture into text.


Simple text editors like Notepad will work too, but they will not allow you to import or paste an image so you will need to be prepared to create your image from scratch.;
, You will want to pick a fixed-width font, such as Courier. Fixed width fonts will make it easier to design your pictures since each letter or symbol will be the same size as the rest., If you would like to reproduce an image file, you can copy the image to the file and open a text box to type letters over the shape of the image. You can also try to make an image from scratch.


When you are first getting started it is easiest to try some simpler pictures. Once you learn more about how to shade and shape your pictures you can move on to more complex images.

, Click on the picture, then place your cursor on one of the corners. Click and drag. The more complicated the picture is, the larger you’ll want it to be. However, if you need the ASCII image to be a particular size for something, resize it now.

, Insert a text box. Adjust your settings if the text box is not transparent and displaying above your image. The text box needs to be a tiny bit larger than your image. Move the text box if necessary on top of the image by clicking and dragging the border. Then, enter your desired text and let your creativity take over.


There are many way to style your image using letters and symbols in various ways. You might choose to make the text cover the entire background and change the colors to form your picture, or you might simply type letters over the shape of the image itself. The possibilities are endless. How you want your image to look is entirely up to you.
Decide what you want to say. You may choose to make your text spell something relevant to the image you are creating. For example, if you are making a picture of the Eiffel Tower, you might decide to use the letters P-A-R-I-S or F-R-A-N-C-E to create the shape.

, Some letters like M and W can make an area look darker when used repeatedly. Other characters like ""."" take up relatively little space.


To form solid images, shape your design by using a combination of characters to create a silhouette.
Use variations of ""heavy"" and ""light"" letters to create your shapes and refine the curves.
Rounded letters like e and u or symbols and punctuation can help shape curved areas of the image.

, Line art is created by spacing letters and characters on the screen to draw just an outline of your image. The end result will be similar to solid art, but the spaces within the outline are typically left blank or other characters are added to create additional detail or characteristics. For example, you can use rounded shapes or zeroes to create eyes for your character., Even though your screen is flat, you can use the space to create a sense of spacial depth. You can use techniques like overlapping objects to give your art a 3D look and feel.


You can also use the space between multiple images and slight differences in image scale to create a sense of proximity to the screen.

, Beneath your word, spell out it out with the letters in backwards order as in the picture below.

, Now that you have the words written out, you can see which letters you'll need to pair. In this case, we'll pair ""W"" and ""W,"" ""I"" and ""O,"" ""K"" and ""H,"" and ""I"" and ""I."" Work with one pair at a time in the next steps.


In some cases, the two letters in the pair will be the same, such as the ""I"" in wikiHow, or every letter in a palindrome (see Tips). This usually makes the ambigram easier to construct and gives you a stable point to build around.

, Decide whether working in upper or lowercase will give you more flexibility.

, If you wrote the letter on paper, you can just turn the page so that the letter is upside-down. If you're on a computer, there may be an option to rotate 180 degrees clockwise, or you can flip horizontally and then flip vertically.

, For example, to make a rotated ""I"" look like an ""O,"" you can turn the line into an elongated circle. Leave the dot; when the ""O"" is readable, it will look decorative, but it will make it recognizable as an ""I"".

, What you should be left with is an image that looks like one letter in the pair, but when you rotate it 180 degrees, it looks like the other letter in the pair.

, Put the new letters together to form the ambigram.

, If this is too difficult, there are a couple of ambigram generators on the internet (such as FlipScript) that can do this for you.

Outline or sketch the general shape and placement.,
Hold your writing utensil correctly.,
Create the letters.,
Use pressure to control line width.,
Use the correct stroke order.,
Protect your writing surface.,
Add decorations.",How to Write in Calligraphy2," If you want to, outline where you wish your characters to go on the page. You can simply leave basic base lines or you can outline the space for each character. If you want to get even more elaborate, you can design the entire page before you begin.


Use a ruler to get the spacing right and look at references for your preferred style so that you can copy the general style of the letters.

, The calligraphy brush will be held differently than the pens. The brush will also be held differently depending on whether you are using it for Western or Eastern calligraphy. Holding the utensil properly will help you form the letters correctly.


For Eastern calligraphy, hold the brush so that it is nearly straight up and down in the first three fingers of your dominant hand. The closer to the bristles you hold it, the more defined the line will be. In this style, your elbow should be held high and your hand still, moving the brush only with your fingers.
For Western calligraphy with the brush, hold it in much the same way you would use a normal paint brush. Using a brush for Western calligraphy, rather than a pen, will give your letters a rounder, more fluid form.
For Western or Arabic calligraphy, hold your pen at a constant 30-60 degree angle with the point of the nib pointing away from you, up and to the left. When the wide part of the nib is parallel with the paper it will create a thicker line and when it is perpendicular it will create a thinner line. Quills will work in a similar manner.

, Form the letters on the page. Pay attention to how you are holding your writing utensil. Use line width variation to give the letters a pleasant form. Keep your strokes even and proportional.









Be sure that you are not moving the writing utensil too slowly. This will cause too much ink to go onto the page and lead to bleeding and uneven lines.
Allow the ink to dry before touching the lines. Make sure to keep the heel of your hand off of the paper, as this will cause the ink to smudge.

, You will want to use line width variation to make your letters have the calligraphy look. This can be done by controlling the angle of your drawing utensil, but it can often also be controlled by pressure. Press down harder for brief periods to get a thicker line and use only the lightest touch to get those hair-thin lines.









Different nibs, or pen tips, will also help you get different line thicknesses. There are lots of different nibs and some are better for certain styles than others.

, Each letter or symbol will be made up of several different sections. These sections are done in a single movement, so they are called strokes. Which order you do these strokes in will matter, so be careful. It is advised that you follow the correct order of the strokes because they follow a certain rhythm.









Stroke order will be different for different types of calligraphy. The best way to know how to do this is to get a book on calligraphy. A trick for Western calligraphy is to essentially use the same strokes as if you were writing normally (vertical, then horizontal lines, for example).
Stroke order not only ensures that the sections overlap correctly and are even, it also often has philosophical significance!

, You will want to make sure that the paper you are writing on doesn't get smudged. Some of this will require planning; write in such a way that your hand will not make contact with ink that is still wet. You will also want to protect the paper from anything you might already have on your hands, like grease. You can put an extra sheet of paper under the spot where your hand is to help protect your document.







, Once the ink is dry you can add decorations and elaborations. This can take the form of illustrations, color, or gold embellishments. These will make your text stand out and give it more character and appeal.








"
"
Practice freely.,
Use the grid method.,
Trace others’ work.",How to Write in Calligraphy3," You can practice by simply writing with any instrument on any paper available. The most important thing is that you gain a steady hand and an understanding of how to vary your line widths. Practicing freely will allow you gain experience quickly and easily, since this can be done anywhere, with minimal materials and little pre-planning.








, If you want to practice a little more formally, you can set up a grid to practice with. Draw a grid lightly, in pencil, with squares roughly 1”x1”. Fill each row with repeated versions of whichever letter you wish to practice until your strokes are even and clean-looking. For some other calligraphy hands like Italic, they are formed using ""nib widths"". You can learn how to form such calligraphy rules here.








, You can also learn by trying to recreate the work of others. Get images of calligraphy, either from the internet or calligraphy books, and cover the image in tracing paper. Write on the tracing paper, trying to recreate the strokes of the original. If you intend to use ink, be aware that it may bleed through the paper and prepare accordingly.









Because of the issues with the paper bleeding, try to always use cheap photocopies or prints of the work you are tracing. This will keep you from rendering the original unusable.

Decide which style is right for you.,
Sketch your ideas.,
Get the best paper.,
Get a proper writing utensil.,
Get the best ink for your style.,
Get rulers or other guide instruments to give you the 'pro' look.,
Get tape or weights to cut down on frustration.",How to Write in Calligraphy4," There are several different kinds of calligraphy, corresponding with some of the calligraphic traditions which exist across the world. You will want to decide which one is right for you, based on which you prefer and why you are wanting to learn calligraphy.









Western Calligraphy is the style with which most people in the English-speaking world are acquainted. This style arose with the creation of the Latin script. It is most often see in Bibles and illuminated manuscripts, often accompanied by illustrations.
Eastern Calligraphy is the style of Japanese, Chinese or Korean decorative writing. A common and honored practice in the East, calligraphy is usually used to write poetry and add to paintings and other artwork.
Arabic Calligraphy is a usually religious art form, common in the Islamic world. Muslims believe that to create art which depicts something real is morally wrong (as it insults God). Calligraphy as the main art form of the culture then arose in response to this.

, Before you start a new piece, you will want to sketch out your ideas. Think about what you are wanting to write and where you would like it to go. Think about the space that you want to fill and how you intend to fill it. Draw a few quick, small images (with just a regular pen or pencil on scratch paper) to get you ready for creating your final image.








, You will need paper to draw on . This can be as simple as printer paper or as elaborate as fine calligraphy paper. Use whatever material suits you best. Paper can be purchased from office stores, craft stores, and paper shops.


You will want paper that is smooth. This will keep your writing utensil from catching or being redirected by the paper. Avoid paper which is greasy or waxy. These will keep the paper from absorbing the ink. You want to use a paper that does not cause the ink to bleed but instead dries quickly.
Look for paper which is labeled as being acid-free and archival. This will ensure that your image does not age poorly. You will also want to look for paper which is labeled as being “sized”. This is paper which has been treated to keep ink from bleeding., You will need some kind of utensil with which to create your calligraphy. While you can technically create calligraphy with any writing utensil, there are certain writing instruments which are considered better than others. Which you use, however, will depend upon what type of calligraphy you are doing and what writing utensil feels best to you.


Dip pens are pens which you dip in ink. They consist of a wood, plastic or bone handle and a metal nib (the pointed end which will make contact with the paper). The nib is dipped in the ink and stores it in the well of the nib. This type of pen is most common for both Arabic and Western calligraphy, though it can be used for Eastern calligraphy as well.
Fountain pens are similar to dip pens but instead draw their ink from a container within the pen. While this ink will occasionally need to be replaced or refilled, it will save you the trouble of constantly needing to dip your pen.
Brushes, most commonly used in Eastern calligraphy but also in Western calligraphy, come in a variety of sizes but will usually all be roughly the same shape. These are dipped in ink and use the pressure and direction of the writer’s strokes to form the line variations.

, You will need to get some kind of ink in order to write with. There are many different types of ink and which one you choose will partially depend on what you are writing with. Inks will also come in a variety of colors but black is the most commonly used color in all styles of calligraphy. Use whichever you prefer.


Ink sticks, which will also require an ink stone, are sticks of ink which must be ground and mixed with water in order to form the ink you will write with. They are an excellent option for calligraphers because they allow you to get many different tones from the same ink, depending on how it is mixed. They can be found at craft stores and in some Asian stores, as well as online.
Pot ink is the most common ink used for calligraphy. This ink comes pre-mixed in a small jar and your writing utensil will be dipped into it. India ink is the most common type of pot ink used in calligraphy. It is easily found at art stores.
Fountain pen ink is a special kind of dye-based ink which is used for fountain pens. It is important to use fountain pen ink and only fountain pen ink in these types of pens as other ink types will clog the pen. Fountain pen ink will come in either pre-loaded barrels, which you place in your pen, or pots, in which case you fill the pen yourself.

, You may wish to create guide lines for yourself, to ensure that your writing is straight. Or perhaps you wish to write across a curved or circular line and need a reference. Rulers and other guide instruments can help you keep your writing looking professional and even.

, You will want tape or weights to hold the paper in place while you are writing. This will keep you from skewing or bumping the paper while you are writing. You can also use clips or a drawing board.









Be careful what kind of tape you use. If it is too strong, you will tear the paper when you try to remove the tape. Painter's tape is best.

Measure your pen's nib.,
Rule pencil lines across your page at the correct x height.,
Add an extra two pen widths at the top and bottom of your x height for the ascenders and descenders.

,
Divide the extra two pen widths at the top in half again with another line for the six pen widths of the capitals.

,
Hold your pen or quill at a 40° angle (see picture).

,
Look at your example of Gothic Calligraphy.,
Practice calligraphy regularly.",How to Write in Gothic Calligraphy2," Lowercase Gothic script is done at five pen widths, ascenders and descenders use an additional two pen widths and uppercase letters are done at six pen widths.


, This means that if your pen's nib is 3 millimeters wide, you'll need a line 15 millimeters wide for the lowercase letters. In the picture the lines are ruled in pen to make them show more clearly, but it is usually done in pencil to erase them later.

,,,, Familiarize yourself with the form of the letters and then make the letter on your ruled lines.

, At first your letters are going to look shaky and silly, but it will improve if you are dedicated to your new hobby.

Master connecting letters together.,
Use graph paper to improve the balance of your writing.,
Write out full words in brush lettering.,
Trace the work of others or pre-printed messages.,
Use brush lettering regularly.",How to Create Brush Lettering," A brush lettering calligraphy pen looks a lot like a regular marker. However, these special pens work similarly to a watercolor brush. The nib of the pen (its writing tip) is flexible. This will allow you to use just the point for fine lines, or more of the nib for thicker lines.In many cases, you can find brush pens at your local craft store, like Michael’s or Hobby Lobby. Check online for coupons. These pens can sometimes be expensive.
If you’re having difficulty finding a brush pen, search for one online. A popular brush pen used by calligraphers is the fude brush pen. “Fude” (foo-day) means “writing brush” in Japanese.;
, Although plain paper should work well enough for practice, in some cases low quality paper can cause the ink to feather or bleed. Calligraphy paper can be bought from many craft stores, specialty stationary stores, or online.

Calligraphy paper can be expensive. An inexpensive alternative is 32 lb laserjet paper. This works great for practice and can be found at office supply stores., For the most part, a brush pen should be held much like a regular pen. Generally, you should hold the pen to the paper so that it forms a 45° angle. You may find you have better control over the pen by holding it close to the nib.Keep your grip relatively relaxed when holding your brush pen. Maintain only a slight bend in the middle finger of your writing hand while writing.
Depending on your hand, you may find that a grip unique to yourself works best. Mainly, try to support the pen with your thumb, index, and middle fingers instead of trying to control the pen with them., Because a brush pen is more like a paintbrush, it can apply a lot of ink to paper very quickly. While getting used to writing with a brush pen, you may want to lay a cover below your practice paper, like newspaper or scrap paper. This will prevent ink from bleeding through and getting on your writing surface.If you have extra sheets of paper, you can use a few of these to prevent bleed through from getting on your writing surface. You could also write on a clipboard or a piece of cardboard.

, Although practice sheets aren’t necessary, they can be a big help. Many practice sheets break down letters into numbered strokes, so you’ll have an easier time knowing which stroke to make first and whether it’s an upstroke or a downstroke.

There are many free calligraphy resources online. Do an online keyword search for “brush calligraphy practice” or “brush lettering practice” and print practice sheets.
If you don’t have a printer, you can always pull up practice sheets on a computer and imitate them on a separate sheet of paper., A downstroke is whenever your pen moves in a downward motion. Increase your pressure on downstrokes to make these thicker. Upstrokes are when your pen moves in an upward motion. Decrease your pressure for these to make them thinner.

If you have difficult making downstrokes thick, you may want to slightly decrease the angle between your pen and paper. This will allow more of the nib to touch the paper, making a thicker line.
When making upstrokes, you may find that increasing the angle between your pen and paper so that the pen is directed more closely to straight up helps to thin your lines., There are 8 strokes that make up nearly every letter in the brush lettering alphabet. Stroke 1 is a thick downward line that slopes down from right to left. Stroke 2 move upwards from left to right to form a slightly inward bowing line. These are the simplest of the 8 basic strokes.


Stroke 3 forms a U shape. It starts with a downstroke on the left and thins to an upstroke at the bottom of the U.

Stroke 4 forms an upside down U. It starts with an upstroke on the left and changes to a downstroke at the top of the upside down U.

Stroke 5 forms an O. The left half of the circle should be thick and the right thin.

Stroke 6 forms an N shape. Starting on the left, an upstroke transitions to a downstroke and then finishes with an upstroke.

Stroke 7 forms a top loop. An upstroke curls back on itself to form a loop and transition into a downstroke. The up- and downstroke should cross at about the downstroke's middle.

Stroke 8 forms a bottom loop. A downstroke curls backwards in a loop to an upstroke. The upstroke should cross the downstroke at about the halfway point of the downstroke., Now that you’ve mastered the 8 basic strokes, it should be much easier to learn letters. Practice each letter on its own multiple times until you’ve mastered each letter, both upper and lowercase.When practicing the stroke order of letters, be sure to follow the order indicated on your practice sheet or web resource carefully. Incorrect stroke order will affect the appearance of your brush lettering.

, Learning brush lettering is almost like teaching yourself again how to write. This can be frustrating and lead to you trying to speed through your practice, but be sure to take your time.

Learning stroke order incorrectly could lengthen the time it takes for you to learn brush lettering. If you learn something incorrectly, you may have to re-learn it the right way down the road.

, Once you’ve mastered the stroke order of letters, you can start working on putting letters together. It may take some time before you get the hang of connecting letters together in this writing style. Start by practicing simple combinations, like those found in your name, the names of friends, and so on.The final stroke of a letter you are writing will determine whether you'll need an up- or downstroke to connect the letters. If the ending stroke of the letter just written is higher than the first stroke of the next letter, use a downstroke, and vice versa.
You can also connect letters by extending the ending tail of the letter you are writing so that the first stroke of the next letter intersects it. This will give the appearance that the letters are connected., Graph paper will make it easier to see when the balance of your lettering is off or lopsided. Some practice sheets may have graph lines drawn in to help you see the distribution of properly drawn letters., Little by little, increase the length of your writing practice. Write out common words in brush lettering. Then try your hand at composing full messages or writing full-length letters using this writing style.

The more you practice writing with brush lettering, the more engrained it’ll become. With enough practice, it should become second nature., If you notice you have trouble putting all the basics together to write full messages, this can be a powerful practice tool. Print out a message written in brush lettering. Trace this printed message to improve your sense of the flow of this writing style.

If you have a friend who’s good at brush lettering, ask them to write you a short message. Trace this to practice and improve your own technique.

, The more you use brush lettering, the more familiar and easier it will become. However, if you stop using this writing style for a length of time, you may notice that you get rusty. To prevent this, use brush lettering regularly."

, Continue making the outline of the head by adding another circle that is intersecting the outline for the forehead. This time it is the outline sketch for the lower part of the head.

, The facial feature outlines consist of one vertical line and four horizontal lines. The vertical line is the guideline for the nose. The horizontal lines are for the eyebrows, eyes, nose and lips.

, Start drawing the actual lines for the eyebrows, nose and the lips. Use the outline sketches as guidelines.

, Draw two slanted acorn-shaped lines for her almond eyes.

,, Since the eyes are the highlight of the face, we must take it one step at a time. To finish drawing the eyes, make sure that the eyelashes are shown as well. Cartoons have a different technique in drawing so you always have to keep in mind that the lines are limited. In drawing a cartoon character, one of the indications that you are drawing a girl is to add the eyelashes. You can put around 3-6 eyelashes each eye.

, Next is the outline sketch of the body. When you are drawing Tinker Bell, you should always keep in mind that she is a feminine character that has a girly, childish attitude. So make sure that she has girly features and poise. Draw an 8-shaped line for her body and continue the outline sketches for her arms and feet, just the way you wanted her pose to be.

, This time, draw the outlines that almost show the actual lines of Tinker Bell.

, To show that she is Tinker Bell, make sure that you are drawing her character style. Most of the cartoon characters have the same outfits so make sure that you get to know the outfits that Tinker Bell always wears. Her outfit is a green mini dress with a zigzag hemline and a pair of green doll shoes with little white pom-poms on top of them.

,, To continue being in character, add Tink’s hair bun.

,, If you can try to exclude the lines where the dress should be located, or you can simply erase it if necessary.

,,, Erase the outline sketches completely once you have drawn the fairy wings.

,, Pink is preferable

,, To finish drawing Tinker Bell, add light strokes of darker colors on the shadows. And then, add light strokes on the highlights.

Sketch Ariel's figure and add her unique design traits.,
Refine the sketch using a smaller tipped drawing tool.,
Draw the outline over the refined sketch.,
Erase and remove the sketch marks.,
Add color.",How to Draw Ariel1," There are three shapes common to her design: her head, torso, and waist. She has a fairly oval face, with prominent cheeks, a rounded forehead, and a dainty, yet pointed, chin.


The three shapes need to be in proportion to each other and all line up at the correct angles. When you're drawing Ariel, what is she doing? If she has fins, she's probably swimming!;
, Include lines on her face to line up her eyes and nose, placement for her seashell bra, her elbow and shoulder joints, and fins.

, The most important being her unique hairstyle, of course! Remember: She's in water, so her hair doesn't need to be along her back and her fins are floating, too.


Ariel has wide, Disney princess eyes (they're all relatively similar). They're usually open and curious-looking.
Her nose is dainty and small; her lips are generally in a bit of a smile.
Her hair miraculously has no part and is incredibly voluminous.
Her hands and arms are generally held strong but femininely, like a ballerina. She has definite poise (especially for such a youngster!).

, You want fine, definite lines that are determined and confident. If worst comes to worst, just resharpen your pencil.

, If you have anything to add or change, do it now! The outline is your last round of actual drawing. Did you remember the lines in her fins, top, and waist-frills?

, That's it for drawing! Are we feeling ambitious and gonna tackle Flounder and Sebastian, too, or just keep it to Ariel?

, To keep it traditional, her seashell top should be purple, her tail should be medium green, and her fins light green. But this is your drawing -- maybe she should be sporting zebra stripes?

"

Sketch Ariel's wireframe and pose using the same technique as the previous method.,
Sketch the additional shapes needed for her torso, arms and legs.,
Sketch Ariel's figure and add her unique design traits.,
Refine the sketch using a smaller tipped drawing tool.,
Draw the outline over the refined sketch.,
Erase and remove the sketch marks.,
Add color.",How to Draw Ariel2," Just remember that as a human, she actually has to be using surfaces! The angle of her body needs to be believable.

, If she's sitting, what is she sitting on? What is she looking at? Try to always maintain a curve in her torso, through to her waist.


Don't forget her facial lines and joints. Her large eyes should match up with her small nose and smile. And her hands and fingers need to be delicately proportioned, too.

, You may need a template, as Ariel in her human form is much less iconic than when she's in her fins. The dress is fairly basic -- full, straight angles, and complemented by an absolutely huge bow.


Have you mastered her hair flap yet? The great thing about it is that it doesn't have to look believable at all (she's too perfect to be human). It just has to look adequately Ariel-esque.

, This is the chance you get to put the delicate lines exactly where you want them. The finer the tool, the more precise you can get.

, It'll be a lot easier to do this if you've refined the sketch. Sometimes too many lines gets a bit confusing. Outline whatever lines need to be present in your final draft.


Have you got the wrinkles in her fabric outlined? The lines in her hair? Eyelashes? Don't forget those eyelashes!

, Be diligent; depending on your medium of color, pencil marks (or even eraser marks) will sometimes be visible.

, The bodice of her dress should be dark blue, her skirt and bow medium blue, and her sleeves light blue. Her eyes are also blue and her hair is that classic fire engine red.

Add in her arms.,
Draw curved lines on either side of her torso.,
Add tail fins as shown.,
Sketch in Ariel's seashells and the fins at her stomach.,
Add details and outline the entire drawing.",How to Draw Ariel3," Put a curved line underneath for the basic shape of her chin. This will be her head. Draw in guidelines for the facial features (i.e., where her eyes, nose and mouth will be).


Ariel has a very rounded forehead, curved cheeks, and small chin. Though this may look funny initially, it's correct.

, Draw two curved lines for the brows that are up, happy, and a bit inquisitive. Add in two big eyes and draw thick eyelashes as shown. Draw a small nose and full, smiling lips. Add a half circle for each ear (if drawing both).


The majority of her eyes should be taken up by her pupils and irises. Think in terms of rounded triangles.

, Remember, Ariel's wavy, luminescent red hair is her trademark, so emphasize it as much as you can. It should go at least down the length of her back, ending in a soft curve.


Don't ask how the flap works -- it just does. And it seems to be floating off of her forehead. Don't worry about abiding by the laws of physics when it comes to drawing this princess! Work in a few lines for her hair layering and all will be well.

, Draw a small rectangle for the neck and a square for the torso. Add circles for her seashells, and a small circle underneath that for her waist. Put a larger one below that as the beginning of her tail.


Ariel (the water version, at least) always has a slight curve to her body. It should resemble a very loose ""S."" The placement of the shapes should mirror this angle.

, Draw two ovals connected by a circle. Draw small ovals for the hands and thin shapes for the fingers. Ariel's fingers and hands are especially delicate and pretty, so be careful with this part.


Remember, Ariel holds herself like a dancer. Her arms are strong but free, and her fingers hang gracefully.

, Try to have them gently arcing into smooth lines, converging at the end of a length about the size of the rest of her body. These lines will serve as the tail.

, They should fan out gracefully from the end of the tail, creating an inverted ""V"" shape within them. Draw lines inside the tail fins to make them look more like real fins.

, These fins are comprised of a round, ruffle-like shape at the top of her hips. It is where the tail begins, so don't make it too high.

, Erase any unnecessary guidelines. Color her in using violet for her seashells, green for her tail, and (of course) bright red for her hair.

Add a background and make your final changes if you wish.",How to Draw Anna from Frozen," Anna's face shape is a tall circle that comes to a gentle point at the bottom. Divide her face into quarters with general guidelines. Add a slender neck and narrow, rounded shoulders.
If you need help getting the overall shape of Anna’s head, draw a small circle at the bottom of her head. This will be her chin. You can erase intersecting lines to get a final form. Your circle should extend just below Anna’s head. This will create the gentle point of the chin.
Sketch loosely with your wrist and shoulder. You’re just trying to draw a base outline. You can erase any extra lines later.;
, Anna has wide eyes that slant upwards on the bottom. Draw the outline of her eyes like a sideways capital “D”.
Make her irises large and round. Note how the top of the irises are cut off by her eyelids. Use your horizontal guideline as a reference point. Her eyes shouldn’t extend below this line.
You may choose to draw individual eyelashes, or just make the lines thicker near the outer top edges.
Her eyebrows are full, blocky, and expressive.
If you’re drawing on paper, add a small circle in each eye to create a shine.

, Anna has a tiny nose that is little more than a squashed U-shape. She has thin Caucasian lips. Feel free to make her grin somewhat asymmetrical. It adds to her quirky appearance.


Draw the nose closer to her mouth than to her eyes.
To draw the mouth, start with a curved line which moves up at the ends. Then add lines on the top and bottom to fill out the lips.
Erase your guidelines.

, Note how it is parted on the side. All hair flows from a single spot at the top of her head. Her braids may take time to draw, but are made up of S-shaped lines which intersect one another.


Note how each section of hair tucks into the following one. You can draw her braids overlapping one another and then erase areas to create the braided look.
Braids also have a zig-zag line going down the center. If it’s easier, draw the middle part of the braid first and then fill out the curves around your zig-zag. Start at the bottom of a zig-zag line and draw a line upward, continuing the line from the zig-zag. Her hair starts above your initial circle for her head. Follow the curve you drew for her head when drawing the hair.
Follow your starting point and move out, adding a few lines for her bangs.

, You may choose to draw one of the dresses she wears in the movie or invent your own outfit.


Anna often wears modest blue or green clothing, with flower motifs or stripes.
If you layer her clothing, take note that cloth has volume; it will not be perfectly flat. For example, the shoulders on the vest should be a little higher than the outline of her body. This will give your drawing some weight.
Follow your initial outline for her shoulders when drawing the vest. In the center, draw a large U-shape to connect the two sides of the vest.
Add flowers or other details as you see fit.

, Go over your drawing and erase any trace lines which may be intersecting details like her hair or clothing. Use thicker lines to indicate the shadows under her chin and her eyelashes.
You may wish to use a pen with black ink, or make some of your lines colored. For example, you can use a deep orange for her eyebrows. Or, you may wish to stick with pencils.

, Hide or erase any leftover sketch lines.


If you are drawing digitally, change the background color to something other than white. This will help you use more contrast when you color, and the image will look nicer.
Decide where your major light source is coming from. This will help you with adding shadows. As a general rule, the closer part of an image is to a light source, the lighter it will be.

, Choose warm, peachy colors for a glowing complexion.


Don't be afraid of contrast; shading timidly is a common beginner's mistake. Pick a medium brown for the deepest shadows. This will help you get a more detailed drawing that looks close to the version of Anna in the movie.

, You want to shade in the direction that her hair falls to help it look natural.


If you are drawing digitally, make a new layer for the hair. Drag your brush in the direction her hair falls.
When shading her braids, make the darkest part the top and bottom of each section, and the brightest part in the middle.
This method of shading will help her hair look healthy and clean.

, Move on to her clothing and the whites of her eyes.


Her shirt needs less dramatic shading because it is not the focus of this picture. You can use a dark green for the vest, and a light blue for her shirt.
To add depth to her eyes, start with a grey-brown color and go lighter and lighter as you move down. This will mimic the shadow caused by her eyelid and eyelashes.

, If you’re digitally drawing, you can fill in the entire circle for the iris with a blue gradient. If you’re drawing on paper, Draw a large circle for the pupil before coloring her eyes blue.


You may also want to add another circle in the corner of her pupils to give her eyes a bright glare if you haven't already.
Move from a medium blue to a lighter greenish blue as you color from top to bottom.
Choose bright, saturated colors if you are drawing digitally, or have access to these colors. Saturated colors will make the eyes call attention to the viewer.

, Large pupils look more attractive, so make sure you draw large black circles in the center of her eyes for her pupils.


The pupils may be cut off by her eyelids.
You can add a bright white shine to make her look attentive if you haven't already. At a diagonal from the shine, add a bright blue-green highlight to further emphasize the eyes.

, Clean up any loose lines or colors, shade her lips, and bolden the shading if desired.


Scatter orange freckles over her cheeks and nose. To get a sense of what could use fine-tuning, zoom out of your picture, or lean it against a wall and step back.
Darken and blush to Anna's cheeks if desired. Darkening and adding blush will help to give her cheeks more depth.

, You can add a simple color gradient, or draw a more detailed background if you want to place Anna in a scene.


If you’re drawing digitally, consider tweaking the color to make it look more unified. Most drawing programs will allow you to make a Gradient Map correction layer, which looks best at around 10-25% opacity.
Don't forget to sign your masterpiece!
When signing the image, try using a color from the picture, such as an orange from her hair or a blue from her eyes. This will integrate it more nicely into the image.

, You can draw a vertical line down the center of the face, and then draw a horizontal line halfway between the bottom of the top. This determines where you will the draw the eyes. Then, divide the bottom portion in half, drawing a line in the middle. This is where the nose should be. Divide the remaining portion in half, and that is where the mouth will be.

, This determines where you'll be shading. For this picture, the light source is coming from the left, meaning that you will be lightly shading on the right side of her face and neck.

, Do this by creating light pencil strokes in the middle of her hair near her parting and move your way toward the edges.

, You can do this by using your pencil to create light pencil strokes all throughout her hair. After you are done with this, use a small piece of tissue or a Q-tip to blend it out. Use the tip of the Q-tip and hold it as a pencil as if you erasing. If you use tissue, you can take a small piece and wrap it around your index finger and rub it in the areas that need blending.

, This would be near the edges of her hair and near her forehead, and also where her hair is parted. If you don't have a 2B or 4B pencil, just use your normal pencil and go over those areas so they are darker. Use tissue or a Q-tip to blend these areas. Also, use the very tip or edge of your eraser to create highlights in the hair by erasing thin strands.

, Also, go over her upper waterline with your pencil to make it look thicker, and draw in her eyelashes.

,, For this part, lightly shade the upper lip and the bottom part of the upper lip should be darker, so use a 2B pencil. Use a 2B pencil for the rest of the upper lip, but apply less pressure so it is lighter. The bottom lip should have a highlight around the center, and the rest of it should be shaded in using a 2B pencil.

, Shade the edges of the ponytail darker than the rest.

, Use the tissue or Q-tip to blend.

, Shade the edges darker then the rest and blend it in lightly.

Things to focus on for a child's hairstyle include curls or waves, keeping the hair short and adding a cute accessory, such as the little headband bow shown in the image. Color the hair in, using a black marker or pencil.


When coloring in, keep the curl edges white to ensure a better definition and to give the impression of flow; refer to the image for guidance.

Look how the mouth of the character looks like in different angles before drawing.

,,


While drawing the wings, make sure that the height and width of the right wing is equal to that of the left wing. If you're making a 3D look it doesn't matter but, normally wings of different length won't look good.

, For the pants, sketch two curved lines for the top and two curved lines on each foot for the end of the shorts. His eyebrows are thin zigzag lines.


Patrick’s emotions are conveyed mostly by his mouth and eyebrows, so edit those in accordance with the way you want him to look.

, Then add two dots for the iris and two curved lines for the eyelids.


For a tired Patrick, have his eyelids fall down to cover part of his eye. If you want him to look surprised or in awe, widen his pupils (and make his mouth into more of an O shape).

, Erase the sketch lines.

, Include his belly button and the flowers on the shorts.


Remember, Patrick has no nose--in fact, his lack of the feature is one of his defining characteristics on Spongebob Squarepants. So if your drawing doesn’t look quite right, check and make sure you didn’t accidentally give him one.

, On the show his shorts are green with purple flowers, and he himself is a lively pink, but the colors in your drawing are your decision.

Find reference images.,
Simplify the image.,
Measure the height in terms of the head.",How to Draw Selena from Harvest Moon1," Just about every artist out there uses reference images when they draw. In this case, since you're going to draw a replica of a pre-existing character, it's pertinent to find images of Selena. You can use online image-search engines, such as Google, Bing, Pinterest, etc. You want to see her from head-to-toe.;
, In the end, you want Selena's body proportions to be correct according to her design. If you start off drawing her eyes, hair, or other details, you run the risk of proportional errors later on that may require lots of erasing and/or redrawing. The basic goal here is to start simplistic and slowly add more details as the image progresses.


Draw a circle. This circle is going to eventually become Selena's head. Don't worry if it's not an exact circle or if the lines are sketchy. You're going to erase portions of this later, so keep the line-weight light.

, Ever seen a map with the scale bar generally at one of the bottom corners? A shorthand version of that concept will be employed here. Here, the scale bar is going to be Selena's head. However, all you have to do is image 6 of the image collage posted above. The following bullet points will merely explain how image 6 was conceived:


1) The green circle is the reference to the circle that was made for the head.
2) Taking ""image three"" from the reference images of Selena, image 2 shows how the circle compares to her head. This reference image was picked because it was the best one found that showcased her full height.
3) Identical circles were added until her feet were reached.
4) Removing the background image, you should be able to see more clearly that a total of three circles (of the size of her head) is equivalent to her height.
5) For the sake of simplicity, remove the curve and--instead--stack the circles as you would a snowman.
6) Now that you've seen the relationship between her height and the drawing thus far, go ahead and draw two more circles as done in image 6. In this image, the circles are labelled as what will become the ""head"", ""torso"", and ""legs"". You're welcome to label them as well, though it's better not to since they'll get in the way later.

Think about page layout.,
Use a grid to moderate pace.,
Create a point of focus.",How to Draw Comic Book Action1," The size and shape of your panels will help to depict the flow of your comic. For action, you need a panel that is large enough to fit the movement. You also want to create a flow that makes it easy for the reader to move from one panel to the next.Only include a few panels horizontally. You should never use more than four in a row.
Stagger your grid gutters. The gutter is the blank space between each panel. Staggering the gutters helps to differentiate each panel.;
, The most common grid layouts include pages of six or nine grid panels. A nine grid panel is effective when you need to convey a lot of information. A skewed grid can also be used to create a sense of motion and dynamic action. You can also use a widescreen panel to create a moving, cinematic feel.A six or nine panel grid is good for showing continuous action like someone walking or to simulate the pan of a camera.
Skewed grids can be used together to show a lot of action happening at once on a page. Instead of drawing squares or rectangles, draw parallelograms to create motion.

, Before you draw the characters and action in your panels, determine where the main focal point in each panel is. A focal point directs the reader’s eyes to a specific spot in the panel and helps avoid confusion as the eyes move from panel to panel. Like a movie, think about the rule of thirds, cutting each panel into three equal parts, and placing your focal point in one.Plan your focal points out so that the reader’s eyes follow each one down the page in more or less a zigzag formation.
For horizontal panels, place your focal point in the left, right, or center portion.
For vertical panels, place your focal point in the top, bottom, or middle third.
With a square panel, you can put your focal point anywhere, so the key here is to place it somewhere that guide your reader’s eyes to the next panel.

Create a line of action.,
Begin drawing with a center line.,
Be dramatic.",How to Draw Comic Book Action2," A line of action doesn’t mean dialogue, it’s the imaginary line that traces your character’s movement. The line of action should be a dramatic, intense path that dictates how your character’s body is moving in a panel.To practice, you can draw a line of action with an arrow pointing the direction you want your character moving. Draw this line in pencil and the use it as guideline when drawing the rest of your character.
The line of action should be fluid so that we can see the intentions of your character’s movements.
Don’t be afraid to exaggerate. If your character is pointing, the line of action starts at the feet and moves up through the body, extending through the arm.

, The center line should always be the first thing you sketch out when drawing a figure. This line can even double as your line of action. Once you have an exaggerated center line that depicts movement, begin to draw your character around it.Each pose has a rhythm to it, and your center line is what depicts that rhythm. Say your character is running, a center line that is more or less vertical isn’t as action filled as a center line that curves. Think about how the body should be leaning forward to depict more motion.

, When you draw your characters, make each pose dramatic, even if your characters are simply standing. By thrusting the head farther forward or spreading the legs wider, you can create a better sense of motion and action.


Incorporate expressions to indicate an action or event is about to happen. Even if you’re drawing a character's face in a panel before the one where the action will happen, draw that character so that there is an acknowledgement of the pending action.
For example, if your character is watching the beginning of an explosion, draw the eyes wider, the mouth open. Use your center line, or line of action to depict the character reeling back as if preparing for the explosion.

"
"
Employ proper lettering techniques.,
Use tone to create action.,
Draw action, or speed lines.",How to Draw Comic Book Action3," Lettering is often an afterthought when novice artists are drawing comics. Lettering can give the action that last needed impact, or deflate the whole situation if done incorrectly. Speech bubbles and sound effects are artwork and should be given due attention. Think about where your focal points are in each panel and place bubbles accordingly.


Lettering advances the story and should follow the same zigzag method to facilitate an easy to follow flow for the reader.

, Instead of drawing a word bubble with lettering and an exclamation point, use colorful block lettering in a burst balloon. A burst balloon has jagged edges and creates a sense of urgency.


Think about the onomatopoeia of your sound effects. If you’re writing “BLAM” to show a gunshot, consider what those letters should look like. Are the big, bold and colored in to create a loud, ringing sound? Or are they hollow block letters that sound more like a quick cracking noise.
Place your sound effects somewhere that draw the eye to the next panel.

, Use a point of focus in your background that show depth. Action, or speed lines are a very effective way to create motion and action in a scene. Instead of drawing a detailed background, sometimes action lines drawing to a single point in the background can create the proper feeling of movement.If a character is running at you, draw lines like the iris of an eye around the character to make it look like that character is moving forward.
If a character is moving left or right, draw speed lines trailing your character.
Another way to draw action is to draw spit or debris flying. If someone is getting punched, draw trails of spit flying away.

Know the standard drawing sizes for comic books and comic strips.,
Choose a 2-ply Bristol paper for your pencil sketches.,
Get vellum paper if you want to ink on a different paper than you drew on.",How to Pick the Right Drawing Paper for Your Comics," The standard drawing size for comic books is 10 inches (25 cm) wide by 15 inches (37.5 cm) tall, while the standard for a multi-panel comic strip is 13.25 inches (33.1 cm) by 4.25 inches (10.63 cm) and 3.5 inches (8.75 cm) by 4 inches (10 cm) for a single-panel strip. The paper size you use should accommodate these dimensions, plus a border of at least 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) on each side.;
, Most professional comic artists use 2-ply Bristol paper, which comes in both pads and large sheets that can be custom-cut to whatever size you need. Bristol paper also comes in 2 styles, each with its own particular feel.


Rough finish Bristol paper is also called ""kid"" or ""vellum"" paper. Rough finish paper may produce fuzzier lines when inking directly on the paper, and may cause inking pens to splatter the ink a bit more.
Smooth finish Bristol paper is also called ""plate."" Smooth finish paper causes ink to dry more slowly, leading to a greater chance of ink smears.
Each brand of Bristol paper is formulated slightly differently, giving it different properties from another brand's rough or smooth paper. You'll want to buy the best paper you can afford.

, Not the same ""vellum"" as rough finish Bristol paper, vellum paper is thin like tracing paper, but costlier and of higher quality. If you're the kind of artist who erases a lot, you can do all you pencil sketches on Bristol paper, then overlay it with a sheet of vellum paper and do your inking there. However, vellum is subject to tearing, and because of its thinness, it's usually mounted on a piece of stiff backing board after the inking is done.

Think of a good name.,

Think about their appearance.,
Decide on their personality.,
Now think of their abilities and powers, think of their weapons too Use Narutopedia to look for some cool powers.

",How to Make a Naruto Original Character," This part of the guide is important because each pre-existing character's name shows something important about them. For example, Chouji's name relates to him because ""cho"" means butterfly. This is important: Make sure your character has a JAPANESE NAME! Any other name, no matter how creative or cool it is, does not fit. All the characters have Japanese names. Try looking at websites like Behind The Name or Baby Names to find one that fits. If you want to develop your character further before naming them, you can always go back to this step later.;
, In the Naruto series, almost every ninja is from a clan, and every clan has their own special abilities and/or signature techniques. It IS GOOD to use still-existing clans, like the Inuzukas, the Aburames, or the Hyuugas. It is ALSO GOOD to make up your own clan for your O.C. Just make sure that it isn't far better than the Uchiha or Hyuuga clans, which are very good ones, or your O.C. will seem like a Mary Sue (more on that later). DO NOT make your character part of an extinct clan such as the Uchihas or Uzumakis/Namikazes. Naruto and Sasuke are the only people left from those clans, and if your character suddenly pops up, it isn't very believable.

, You have to go through this very carefully, because there are certain ways all the Naruto characters dress-although some of them dress strangely, there are still rules. Don't dress your character in any modern stereotype clothing. They CAN NOT be emo, because although Sasuke looks like he is, none of the Naruto characters know what emo is. They also wouldn't dress overly flouncy or anything if they are ninja-it has to work when they are training, fighting, etc. Just think when you draw your character, would this allow him/her to move properly if I put this on their outfit?

, You can change some of these around to put on your character's outfit. For example, the hitai-ite can be worn anywhere-Naruto uses it as a headband, but it can also be worn around the neck, arm, waist, forehead, or as a hat. There are also some common ninja accessories: Fishnets (shirts, tights, stockings, arm warmers), bandages and wrappings, zippers, gloves (normal, biker, or fingerless, and of any length), or a large scroll or weapon strapped to their back.

, Here's where the Mary Sue part comes in. A Mary Sue is a character who is perfect in every way, who makes even Ino look bad (ugly). Now, here's how to make your character be less of a Mary Sue.


Don't give them unnaturally-colored hair. Unless it's a soft tone of that color, like Sakura's, unnatural color doesn't exist, especially in neon. It looks messy and badly done.
Don't give them a perfect body. Nobody's perfect. Naruto is shorter than everyone else and Sakura has a small chest. If your O.C. looks absolutely perfect then it will make the other characters jealous!
Don't give them a ""showy"" outfit if they are a girl. It wouldn't make sense, for a mission to Snow Country, for your O.C. to be dressed in what is practically a bikini.
To help you: Give them some kind of flaw to their appearance.

, If you're a good writer then this part will be easy. Think about how they would react to different situations. Are they optimistic or pessimistic? Shy or confident? Quiet or loud? Angry or happy? Don't copy another character's personality, and don't make them an unemotional person like Neji. Think about how they would react to talking to Naruto, or Ino, or Rock Lee.

While you’re first learning how to ink, it will be better to start with simpler drawings with clean pencil line work and fewer details. Cartoon characters, minimalistic images and simple shapes will work best, since they’ll allow you to focus on clean inking without worrying about the lines running together.Your sketch doesn’t have to be perfect. Just try to get the major lines, focus and proportions right. A lot will change by the time you begin inking.;
, Once your drawing has been sketched out, look for places where you can make corrections or erasures to get the pencil lines as smooth as possible. This will make inking over them easier and result in a neater, more distinct final drawing. Don’t worry about incorporating too much detail during the sketching phase. You’ll be better served if you wait until after you’ve inked the major lines to start adding extra touches.The pencil lines of your sketch should be precise and clearly defined. Try not to let them run together too much, as this can make inking tricky.
Erase pencil mistakes completely so they don’t become a distraction.

, Inking requires a lot of patience, so you want to make sure you're focused and using the right technique. Sit up straight and position yourself squarely over the paper. If the drawing you're inking is resting on a drafting table or another flat surface, try looking down over the paper so that you have an unobstructed frontal perspective. It's okay if you prefer to work at an angle as long as you can clearly see each detail and move your drawing hand freely.The more upright you sit, the better. Otherwise, your back may start hurting during lengthy inking sessions.
Your work area should be well lit to promote visibility.

, Grasp the pen firmly in your dominant hand near the tip. Keep the tip of the pen at an angle to the paper, not straight up and down. Hold your hand steady and let your arm guide you over the lines, rather than trying to use the movement of your wrist alone. Relax your drawing hand and arm; too much tension can leave your finished drawing looking rigid and lifeless.Gripping the pen near the tip, close to the paper itself, will keep it more stable than holding it higher up near the middle. You'll make fewer mistakes, and what small mistakes you do make will be less pronounced.
Maintaining a sharp angle between the pen and paper helps pull ink out of the pen more efficiently, resulting in smooth, fluid line work.

, Go over the lines of your sketch, beginning with one side of the drawing and radiating outward from there. Most artists achieve the best results by inking in the direction of their dominant hand (if you're right handed, starting on the left side of the page and inking to the right, and the opposite for left handed artists). This will prevent you from running the edge of your hand over fresh lines. After you’ve inked the major lines, move outward and fill in smaller details and those in the background. This will ensure that the most important elements in the drawing are properly emphasized.Don’t just trace over the lines you’ve already drawn—imagine that you’re drawing them a second time, this time with the boldness of ink.
When you come to a section of the drawing that's difficult to ink, turn the paper and continue in the same orientation, rather than contorting your hand or trying to ink in an uncomfortable direction.
Keep the final image in mind when inking your drawing. If you’re just following the same lines you sketched, the objects will look forced and crude.

, With your first pass at inking complete, look for places where you line work can be touched up. Go over key lines a second and even third time to thicken and smooth them out. Try adding realistic perspective by leaving the lines thin where they face an imagined light source, and thickening them where they’re further away. Tweak your inked lines until you’re satisfied with how they look.


Use a thin nib (the interchangeable tip of a dip pen) and light ink for the initial outline and thicken lines later as you go.
Give the ink a few minutes to dry before you start adding detail or going over lines a second time., Finish your drawing by inking small details and embellishments that give scope to its forms and lend an element of realism. Techniques like hatching (drawing a series of thin parallel lines close together), crosshatching (hatching in a grid-like pattern) and stippling (making closely-grouped small dots) can help bring your drawing to life by making it more engaging to the eye. These skills are a unique way of representing depth and texture in two dimensional art.Hatching, crosshatching and stippling are useful when you want to create the effect of texture without having to use an excessive amount of ink coloring in empty space.Don’t go too crazy adding textural elements. If overdone, it can end up looking chaotic.

, Fill in around the edges of objects to provide contrast. Using various layers, thicknesses and shades of ink in different parts of the drawing will allow you to play with the way light is depicted. Ink is advantageous because it can be used to easily manipulate light and shadow, which will help round out the dimensions of the drawing.As a rule, the parts of an object that are furthest from a light source need to be shaded more to deepen shadows, whereas leaving an area unshaded will suggest brightness.The more realistic the drawing, the greater amount of shading and toning it will require.

, Not every drawing will be inked the same way. Before jumping right into the inking process, think about which tools you’ll need to properly highlight the contours of the rough drawing you’ve done. You can also start thinking about how you might enhance the drawing with detailing techniques.Cartoons tend to look better with thick, bold outer lines, while the line work of realistic drawings varies and is often dictated by lighting and perspective.
A drawing that you plan on coloring will not need too much interior detail, as it will get in the way.

, Figure out which techniques you like most, and which feel best, for your particular art style. Decide whether you prefer to grip the pen tightly or take a loose, free approach; learn how much pressure to put on the paper to make your lines look the way you want them to. Just as everyone draws a little differently, no two people will ink in exactly the same way, either. Your inking methods should closely match and complement your freehand drawing style.Because of the way you naturally make strokes, your drawing and inking techniques should be very similar.

, Select an inking tool that will let you trace, fill, shade and employ other techniques as you please. Most artists prefer pens for conventional line work, as it goes on bold and straight. An inking brush might also be used, especially for filling large areas and when you want to taper the width of a line mid-stroke. You should pick the pen or brush that will let you achieve the effect you’re trying to create.Test out different pen nibs so that you’ll have a several available to you when you need them. The nib is the interchangeable tip of the pen that comes into contact with the paper and deploys ink.Pens can work as all-purpose inking tools, but a brush can save you time when it comes to shading tasks.

, It’s usually best to experiment with several kinds of ink to find one that you can work well with. If you’re using a traditional fountain pen for inking, you’ll be able to dip it in an ink of your choice. Inks come in different shades and thickness, and some are better suited for certain drawing tasks than others. For some projects, you might even use more than one type of ink on the same drawing.India ink is a reliable standard choice for artists, as it is dark, waterproof and permanent.
If you’re using prepackaged or commercial grade pens that contain their own ink, switch them out when you need to change how thick or dark your lines are.

, Before you start inking, examine and feel the paper you’re using. Is it thick or thin? Smooth or rough? Ink will settle into different papers in a unique way. Get in the habit of thinking about paper and ink together. Make sure you’re not using a rough, soft paper with a thin ink, for example, or the ink may bleed.Browse your local arts supply store for high-quality papers that are designed specifically for inking.
You should also be sure to draw on a flat, solid surface and work at an angle that’s most comfortable for you

, Don’t forget that you have the option of playing around with all sorts of pens, brushes, papers, and ink. Some artists prefer a simpler process, and may only ever use one type of each of these materials, but the combinations are nearly endless. The tools and mediums to you decide on will have an effect on the way your finished drawing turns out.Put together an artist’s toolkit so that you’ll have a greater number of implements at your disposal.
Part of becoming a better artist is discovering what works best for your individual style.

Choose a brush made for inking.,
Know the appropriate brush sizes to use.,
Choose a brush with good quality bristles.,
Choose a quality ink to complement your brush.",How to Ink Comics with a Brush1," Artist's brushes intended for inking comics have short handles, similar to those used for painting watercolors. Brushes used for painting with oils or acrylics typically have longer handles and are not recommended for inking. As inkers typically get close to their work in order to follow sketch lines made by a penciller, longer handles get in the way.;
, Artist's brushes range in size from as small as 20/0 to as large as 30. The most common sizes of inking brushes, however, are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, with 3 being the recommended size for first-time inkers, although some artists go down to size 0 for inking finer lines.


Brush sizes are not necessarily universal among brush manufacturers; one company's size 0 may be another company's size 1. Check with your local artist supply store for guidance.

, Many artists favor natural bristles made from the hair of the Kolinsky sable, a species of weasel. Other artists find synthetic bristles a cheaper alternative, provided the brush is made by a manufacturer with a good reputation. To evaluate the quality of a brush you're considering, ask to dip the brush in water until it's good and wet, then strike the middle of the brush against your wrist. If the brush hairs come to a point without any ""split ends,"" you can expect the brush to perform well as an inking brush.


Good quality natural hair brushes include the Winsor Newton Series 7 and the Raphael.
Good quality brushes with synthetic hair include the Winsor Newton Specter Gold II.
Some artists prefer to work with a brush pen, which has a fibrous tip like a brush but uses ink cartridges like a fountain pen. Kuretake and Pentel each make quality brush pens. You may prefer to use different cartridges than those the pen comes with, however.

, The standard ink used for inking comics is India ink. Quality brands of ink include Higgins Black Magic, Pelican, and Speedball Super Black. Different brands of ink may have different properties, however, despite being of equal quality; some tend to be thicker than others. Some artists prefer to use a thicker ink when inking with a brush than with a pen and to thin the brush ink with a tiny bit of ammonia when necessary.

"
"
Dip your brush straight down into the ink bottle.,
Wipe the excess ink off on the rim of the ink bottle.,
Roll the bristles to get a fine point.,
Grasp the brush between your thumb and forefinger.

,
Hold the brush perpendicular to the paper as you apply ink.,
Follow the penciled lines you want to highlight using smooth strokes.,
Apply more pressure to make a thicker line, less for a thinner line.,
Rotate the paper when following the curve of a penciler's line.",How to Ink Comics with a Brush2," Dip only the bottom 2/3 of the bristles into the ink. This will keep the ink away from the glue holding the bristles onto the metal ferrule. Hold the brush in the ink long enough to saturate the bristles.

, You may have to do this 2 or 3 times.

, Use a scrap of paper for this.

,, This will keep the brush tip pointed and your inked lines at the proper thickness.


To help hold your brush in this position, place the side of your wrist on the paper and rest your middle finger on the paper ahead of the brush.

, Keep your thumb and forefinger locked, while bending your wrist from left to right if you're using your right hand and right to left if you're using your left hand.


Don't try to highlight all the penciled lines, only those that in your judgment bring out the scene you're inking. You may want to discuss beforehand with your penciler which lines are the important ones.

, Thicker lines are more important for outlines and showing shadows, while thinner lines are more important when doing detail work where the light source strikes. If you're doing mostly detail work, don't load as much ink into your brush.

, This will allow you to keep your brushstrokes straight, either horizontal or vertical, while keeping your ink lines flowing smoothly.


Be aware that some non-repro-blue pencils (very light blue pencils designed not to show up in photocopies) can be very waxy, which may cause the ink to run when crossing these lines.

Consider whether you'd like blank pages, pages with lines, or a combination of both. If you like sketching as well as writing, the combination can be ideal.;
, Do you work out? Mosaics from Roman ruins indicate that exercise was as valued in Roman times as it is today. What is it about exercise that transcends the ages? How are the styles of exercising different from early ones? How do you feel before and after exercising? Do you wear special clothing to exercise?

, How much do you love food? It is a vast and varied part of our lives from shopping, prepping, and sitting down to eat. Do you dine alone or with others? What is your favorite food? Do you admire chefs who make food their life focus? What dishes can you create? What holiday foods and nostalgia for the foods of yesteryear are repeated time and again?

, The way we pronounce words has traditionally been fodder for songs. Do bits of conversation, floating in the air, sometimes spark imagination? The mere act of writing those words down on paper can start a chain of connections leading to funny situations and, eventually, cartoons.

, This can open dozens of avenues in our brains for laughter. Clothing trends are funny all by themselves, then, add the emotional aspect we have all felt wearing different items, and fun lies ahead.


Going shopping for the basic necessities of life, not to mention luxuries go from the sublime to the ridiculous. What do you buy? Why did you buy that item? How large can stores get? How far have we come in terms of necessities than our forefathers? How does the science of marketing affect us?

, The past can yield great material. A wise person once said, ""The more things change, the more they remain the same."" Do you agree? What is an improvement and what should be buried and left alone?

, Is your home graced with pets? Animals are comedians by nature, so watch and jot down their antics. The Internet is loaded with clips of animals at their zany best, so keep that notebook handy when you use the computer, or sit at the local coffee shop to observe the dogs on leashes passing by.

, A love of the arts, be it visual, auditory, or tactile can unearth lots of funny situations and observations.

, Getting older is lampooned more than it ought to be, but isn't it better to laugh than cry at the changes age brings?


Dying and burial with the complicated, sometimes inexplicable rituals can have surprisingly light moments.

, Can stories we have known since childhood survive scrutiny by our older selves? The written word, from fairy tales to master works, seen through fresh eyes, can have funny moments.

, Who among us is without an occasional misstep? The foibles of human beings have always been held up to scrutiny from the Three Stooges, and slapstick comedy to touching dilemmas seen in old movies. Life decisions are fraught with emotion. Have you ever wished you could take back a choice you have made? Did you ever see a silly situation that was avoidable?

, Does anybody like chores––dishes, vacuuming, and laundry? We do them dutifully because we know to stop might be disastrous, but do we love the humdrum, repetitive, often thankless routine? Write out your boredom and frustration to discover humor in household duties.

, Going outside and onto the road can be hair raising, either as a driver, passenger, jogger or pedestrian. The ordinary paths we tread each day doing errands, getting to and from work, just getting from place to place can be eye opening, to the point of terror. You catch more flies with honey than vinegar, so shine a light on bad driving and rude events on the road, and maybe you can help change the way things are done.


Packing for a trip and traveling is a multi-faceted thing to explore. New experiences, places, activities, modes of transportation and just being outside our normal environment can cause anxiety, be funny or downright pathetic, depending our your mood and stamina level. Keeping an idea book helps pass the time en route, too.

Begin by drawing a straight line vertically. Draw a horizontal line that crosses your vertical line about an inch below the tip for the shoulders and chest. Then add the arms and legs. Draw circles at the joints, these will be used as guides later on. To help you when drawing Wolverine, find a picture of him that you like to help you as a guide.
While you can draw Wolverine in any position, it’s easiest to start with Wolverine simply standing and facing forward. This will give you the best idea of how he looks.
Use a pencil and keep your initial sketch lines light as you will erase these lines later.
Your initial vertical line serves as the spine for the body. It connects the head, chest, and body together.
Draw a circle around the top of your first line for the outline of the head.
Leave a little space below the head for the neck, then draw a large oval shape to form the chest. Wolverine is bulky so the shapes you draw for the body should be round and cylindrical.
Below the chest, draw a cylinder to make the outline of the torso.
Create circular joints at the shoulders, and elbows by drawing circles.
For the legs, draw your lines and add circular outlines for the kneecaps.
Draw small triangles for the hands and feet right now.;
, Connect the circular joints on the arms and legs by drawing cylinders in the areas between joints. Use your original stick figure lines to guide you. Wolverine is very bulky, so make your shapes large. It’s also ok to overlap your shapes. These shapes will end up forming the muscles in the arms and legs.


Draw your cylinders, which will be the muscles and body of Wolverine, as wide you drew the circular joints to keep everything proportional.
Don’t worry about making everything look perfect or even right now, just get the general outline down.

, Right now you should have a stick figure outline with circular joints, cylindrical muscles in the arms and legs, a circle for a head, and large oval for the chest. Complete the general shape for Wolverine’s torso and waist by adding another cylinder that begins just above the bottom curve of the chest. Then, draw another shape like a pyramid pointing down.


The pyramid shape should be round at the edges and begin about a third of the way from the bottom curve of the cylinder you drew for a torso.
The body should be made up of three separate shapes: A large oval at the top for the chest, a cylinder for the torso, and an inverted pyramid for the waist.
The bottom two shapes should be the same width, while the width of the torso is wider.

, So far, you should have a circle for the head. Add a shape that’s similar to a “U” under the head for the jaw.Start your “U” shape at about the midpoint of your circle.
The distance from the bottom of the circle to the bottom of the jaw’s arc should be about half the distance from the top to bottom of your circle.

, Starting about halfway down from your “U” shaped jawline, draw two curved lines for the neck.


Your lines should be convex, meaning the line curves inward.
Wolverine has a thick neck, so draw the lines even with the sides of the head.

, Draw a vertical line that splits the head and jaw in half. Make a cross by drawing a horizontal line in the middle of the circle for the head. This will help you place the eyes and nose. Draw a smaller horizontal line in the space between the bottom of the circle that makes up the head, and the bottom of your “U” for the mouth.


You can use your original vertical line here. Just extend it up through the crown of the head.

, On either side of you vertical line, draw two angled lines which look like a tilde. These should be above the top horizontal line that’s perpendicular to your vertical one. Under those lines, draw rectangle shapes for the eyes. At the bottom of your circle, draw vertical lines and a “V” shape to make the nose. The mouth goes just above the second horizontal line you drew below your circle. Add a small triangle for the lower lip on the horizontal line.To best get the shapes of the eyes, nose, and mouth down, it’s easiest to look at a picture of Wolverine for guidance.

, Use your “U” shape to outline Wolverine’s jaw in more detail. The jaw should start as wide as your “U” and then angle inward around the mouth.Make the bottom of the jaw more flat than round.
Erase any leftover lines from your “U” shape.

, Wolverine’s mask is one of the defining features of the character. Begin by drawing lines inside the face for the opening of the mask. Start with two horizontal, slightly curved lines going out from the nose. Then add two vertical lines on the sides of the mouth, connecting to the jaw.


For the horizontal lines, use the line you drew to place the eyes as a guide, keeping the mask lines parallel.

, Start just above the eyebrows and draw curved lines that extend out and above the head. The way you draw the outer points of the mask may differ for everyone, but once you draw your original curves for the mask, draw one more curve on each side to connect the mask to the portion of the mask around the mouth.


Think of the top portion of the mask like two horns that begin near the center of the face just above the eyebrows.
Draw these lines lightly at first. If you don’t like how the mask looks, erase and try again. It make take a few attempts.

, Now that you have your head pretty much completed, follow the outlines of your joints and muscles to start to form the body. Start at the neck and work your way down.By darkening the outer edges of your drawing you give Wolverine a three-dimensional look.
Don’t worry too much about your proportions right now. You may find that not all body parts look perfectly equal, that’s ok, you just want to get the general look down.

, Once you’ve outlined the whole body, look to see if any areas look disproportional or out of place. If there are problem areas, erase and redraw using a stick figure, then fleshing out the area with shapes before outlining again.


Wolverine has a large chest, wide torso, and long muscular legs which should be about the same length as the distance from his waist to the top of his head.
His shoulders are roughly level and shouldn’t be angled up too high.
Once you’re happy with the overall shape of your Wolverine, erase the lines that make up the stick figure and joints, leaving only the outer lines of the body.

, Wolverine has several components to his costume, but most components are made up of triangle shapes. Start at the shoulders drawing two triangles for the shoulder pads. Then add the two triangles on either side of Wolverine’s neck which are pointing down. Below the pecs are two sets of three horizontal triangles. Then, draw a thick belt below, and add the spandex.


The shoulder pads should be slightly curved at the top and connect where the armpits are at the bottom.
The spandex forms around the tops of the thighs and ends just below the belt. It meets at the gap between Wolverine’s legs.

, Wolverine’s boots are similar to his mask. Draw a “V” shape that starts just below the kneecap and extends up around the leg to the lower third of the thigh. The outer edges of the boots come back down and connect to the the leg. The gloves extend to just below the elbow.


Add the three grooves for Wolverine’s spikes on the back of his hands. Make the top of the gloves concave curves, meaning the curve bows out.

, Add muscles to Wolverine. The easiest way to add muscles is to follow the outline of the different portions of the arms and legs you’ve drawn. The hands can be tricky to draw, make the hands fists or draw his claws coming out to make it easier. The feet are flat and angle slightly inward before widening at the leg.Add an “X” in the middle of the belt for the X-Men logo.
Erase any sketch lines that you still have.

Now you can shade or colour your character!",How to Draw Comic Drawings of Female Faces," If the character is young, a round or wider face may be more appropriate. If the character is more mature, use a more 'egg shape' face. The face shape may also depend on what kind of cartoon you are drawing.;
, As it is a female, the neck should be slim and petite. Depending on your characters age and style, the neck could be straight on both sides or with an inwards curve.

, This can be widely varied, and is completely up to you. Use light, smooth strokes for now.

, Do it roughly two thirds of the way down of the face you have left, and right in the middle, unless your character is looking to the side, in which case, you use a curved L shape at your chosen side. For the centre: As this is a cartoon, use a small curve, like the top half of a circle. Alternatively, you could use a light dash, but keep it small and simple!

, Is she smiling, laughing, frowning, crying? Add on the mouth in your chosen expression. Keep it light for now, it will be easier to rub out.

, The shape should reflect your characters emotion. Make them big and full of light reflections. This adds emotion and makes your drawing come to life.

, Don't press too hard at any point, and take your time!

Acquire a pencil, pen, marker, sharpie or other writing utensil.,
Get paper.,

Draw a traditional smile.,
Draw a toothy smile.,
Draw a mouth with braces.,
Draw a sneaky mouth.,
Draw a slight smile.,
Draw a cute smile.",How to Draw Cartoon Mouths2," The traditional type of cartoon smile is shaped like a D. It is usually red, and is paired with happy eyes. Draw a wide arch and connect it with a straight line at the top.

, Similar to a traditional smile, a toothy smile has the teeth showing. This can be a face for an arrogant character, a cute character, or a mean character depending on the eyes. Draw a traditional smile, then add lines in between.

, This can be a mouth for a nerdy/unpopular character. Simply draw a toothy smile, then add squares to each tooth.

, Though this may or may not be considered a smile, it is in this category. Draw a slightly curved line, then draw a deeper, shorter line. Make sure it reaches to the center and is off centered so it is not mistaken as a tongue.

, This is when someone is slightly amused, and/or slightly happy. Draw a slightly curved line, then draw a more curved line directly underneath.

, A variation of the toothy smile, this is for toddlers or small children. Simply draw a curved line, then two rectangles for teeth.

"
"
Draw a traditional frown.,
Draw a very simple frown.,
Draw a dismayed face.,
Draw a cute sad frown.",How to Draw Cartoon Mouths3," Basically the opposite of the traditional smile, the frown is an upside down D. Draw curved eyes to really emphasize the look.

, This version of a frown is a simple curved line with two curved lines at the ends.

, This is the opposite of the slight smile. It is a simple line, possibly curving downwards slightly.

, This is when someone young or someone stupid gets sad. Draw a traditional frown, then add two rectangles for teeth.

"
"

"
Draw a circle on your sketch paper.It will be helpful to draw a perfect circle using a compass, if one is available to you.,
Use a ruler to draw a cross in the middle of the circle.The cross splits the circle into four quadrants, which will help you position the eyes for the cartoon.,
Design the shape of the cartoon character's head.",How to Draw Cartoon Eyes1,"


Set the width of your compass to a small or medium-sized circle. Place the point of your compass on the sketch paper, and gently place the pencil tip of the compass down on the paper. Pivot the pencil tip around the stationary point of the compass to draw your circle.
It may be helpful to lightly hold onto both “legs” of the compass, as the angle can sometimes widen with the pressure of pivoting and drawing. This will help maintain the size of your circle.;
,


Draw the lines as close to the middle from top-to-bottom and side-to-side as you can. This will help ensure that your eyes are placed evenly and at an equal distance from each other.

, Around the baseline of the circle, draw the shape of your character's head.


The shape of the character's head will inspire you in the type of eyes you give your character.
It will also help you determine whether your character is male or female or maybe even an animal or monster!
Drawing the shape of the head will include the chin/jawline, ears, and hairline.

"
"
Decide where you want the eyes to sit.,
Draw a pair of ovals in your face, equidistant from the vertical line of the cross and evenly placed on the horizontal line.,
Shade pupils into the ovals.,
Color the iris around the pupil.,
Add eyelashes and eyebrows.",How to Draw Cartoon Eyes2," You can position them anywhere on the cross, but it is important to keep a couple of things in mind.


The higher the eyes sit, the smaller they might have to be to account for eyebrow and forehead space. Visa versa, the lower they are set, the larger and more dramatic the eyes can be.
You will likely want the eyes to be an equal distance from the vertical line of the cross as well as levelly placed on the horizontal line of the cross.

, Your ovals can have a few different shapes.


Straight up-and-down (Note: In this style, you may want your ovals touching on their inner sides right in the middle of the face.)
Slanted to the outside edgesOverlapped, with a small semicircle drawn at the bottom of the eye, cutting off the bottom of the oval, These again take on your creativity, as you can choose how big they are and where you want them. Here are a few ideas:


Shade small pupils into the center of the ovals
Draw and shade large pupils that fill the bottoms of the ovals
Draw the pupils on the inside of each oval, making the character look cross-eyed
Leave a small spot of the pupil unshaded to hint at the glint that often appears on human eyeballs in light

, This will give your character a little more life and realism.


Common colors for eyes include blue, green, brown, gray, and hazel. However, you can get creative with your cartoon and use other colors, such as purple, orange, or red.
Depending on the size you made your pupils, you can make the iris thicker or thinner. The size of the pupil indicates the emotion of the character, i.e. if the character is scared, then his/her pupils will be larger, showing less iris.

, It is up to you how you draw these characteristics, as it will depend on whether your character is male or female.


Shade in the top edge of the oval to be a thick line that tapers at either edge to demonstrate more masculine eyelashes.Draw wispy eyelashes from the top of the oval to demonstrate more feminine eyelashes. You might still want to add in the tapered shading mentioned above to give the appearance of makeup.
Only add a few thick eyelashes to make the eyes and face look very rudimentary and simple.Shade in the eyebrows to a style of your liking. You can make them thick and bushy for a male or slender and arched for a female. You can also play around with the emotions of the eyebrows, making them angry, surprised, shocked, worried, et cetera.

"
"
Decide where to place the eyes on the face.,
Draw a pair of circles in your face at an equal distance from the vertical line of the cross.Circles are a great shape for cartoon eyes because humans do not have circular eyes.,
Shade dark pupils somewhere into the circles.,
Color the iris around the pupil with your preferred hue.,
Add eyelashes and eyebrows to the eyes and forehead.",How to Draw Cartoon Eyes3," Circular eyes seem to make the most sense being placed evenly apart from each other, as opposed to side-by-side.


How high or low the eyes sit on the face could help convey an emotion, so take that into consideration as you begin to draw.
You will also need to decide how big you want the eyes to be. How much space of the face they take up determines what other features you can add to it.

,


Use your compass to make these circles. Be sure to adjust the angle of your compass in order to make smaller circles.
Make the circles large enough to leave room for pupils inside.
Remember that you may need to hold both legs of the compass to avoid your angle widening as you draw the circles.

, Circular eyes are great for conveying a few different emotions, and the placement and size of the pupils lend showing to these emotions.


Surprise
Fear
Shock
Worry
Delight

, Keep in mind the emotion that you are trying to convey with your cartoon character's eyes.


The thickness of the iris helps your audience better understand how your cartoon character feels.
The color that you choose for the iris can also help to convey an emotion. Or, the color can simply demonstrate your unique creativity and the embodiment of what you envision your cartoon to look like.

, It is up to you how you shade in these characteristics, as it will depend on whether your character is male or female.


You might want to simply thicken the top line of the eye, with tapers at either end, to indicate eyelashes without drawing wispy lashes. Alternatively, you might want to add a number of eyelashes. Fewer numbers of eyelashes, or even no eyelashes, are common with circular cartoon eyes.Remember to draw your eyebrows in a shape that helps convey your character's emotion, as well as to indicate male or female. High arching eyebrows indicate surprise or fright, while lower, less arched eyebrows might indicate boredom or sadness.

"
"
Decide where you want the eyes to sit on the character's face.,
Draw two almond-shaped eyes on your face, using the cross as your guide for placement.Almonds are typically wider on one end than they are on the other.,
Shade pupils into the circles, in a place that makes sense.,
Color the iris around the pupil with whatever hue you like for the character.,
Add eyelashes to the eyes and eyebrows to the forehead.",How to Draw Cartoon Eyes4," They can be placed anywhere on the face, but you have to add other features, as well.


If they sit higher on the face, you might have to make them smaller or make the eyebrows smaller. However, this could lend to an emotion like surprise or fright, where the eyebrows “disappear” high on the forehead.
In most cases, you will likely want the eyes to be an even distance apart from each other, as well as level with each other horizontally.

,


For cartoon eyes with this shape, typically the wider end is placed on the inner part of the eye, close to where the nose will be.
Sometimes the wide end is exaggerated, making the inner part of the eye very large, while the outer part of the eye tapers down to a small point. This is good for conveying concepts or emotions like innocence, surprise, and youth.
Almond-shaped eyes are often used for female cartoon characters to create the ideal of beauty and femininity.

, Almond-shaped eyes convey a slightly different set of emotions from the other two methods above, and they are more human-like. This potentially opens you up to a wider range of emotions for your cartoon face.


Innocence
Sadness
Fear
Surprise
Excitement
Shyness

, Remember to make your iris thicker or thinner based on the emotion you want your cartoon face to convey to your audience.


If you are going for a flirty, feminine character with this eye shape, then it could be fun to use colors such as purple or pink for the iris.
Colored pencils are the most useful tool for this type of coloring, as you can sharpen their tips to keep the coloring crisp and neat.

, It is up to you how you shade in these characteristics, as it will depend on whether your character is male or female.


For female cartoon characters with this eye shape, it is common to place eyelashes only on the outer edges of the top eyelids. This gives off a flirty, feminine vibe.
Keep in mind that you want to match the shape of your character's eyebrows to his/her emotion. With more emotions available with this particular eye-shape, you must take care to match the two together."

Complete the rest of the head.,
Draw the upper body.,

Add colour.,
Add any extra details.",How to Draw Bunnie Rabbot from Sonic the Hedgehog," The materials are listed in the Things You'll Need section.


Make sure you set yourself up somewhere appropriate! On a desk in your room is okay. On the kitchen table twenty minutes before dinner is not.;
, Bunnie's eyes, nose and mouth have similar shapes to Tails' - her eyes are basically just simple ovals, her nose is a rounded triangle, and her mouth has a lot of fluff on the edges. An important thing to take note of is that Bunnie wears eyeshadow, which can be drawn as a thick outline on her eyes. Don't forget the 'female' long eyelashes!

, The hardest parts here are the hat and the hair. It's probably good to draw the hat before the head, but leave it a bit incomplete so that you can go back and make it look like Bunnie's wearing an actual hat, rather than standing with a hat flying around in front of her head. To draw her hair, you may have to rub out a little bit of one eye to make room for the hairline.


Her ears are also a part of this step. They're just like regular rabbit ears, which aren't too hard, so you probably don't need to worry about those.

, It is recommended that you start by drawing her jacket first, or at least before her arms. Bunnie has a very basic shirt, you don't even need to draw it like it's separate from her body. Her right arm is the 'normal' one, so if you're drawing from the front (which most people would be), it's the one on her left. The other arm is a little more complex, but it shouldn't be too problematic if you handle it correctly. Draw it like her other arm, but make the fingers a bit more stiff. Then add all the complex lines.

, This step is probably the hardest one. The lower body (which is pretty much just the legs) is almost exclusively mechanical, which is more difficult to draw. Break the legs down into 3 sections - the upper leg, the lower leg, and the foot. The upper leg's outline is the same shape as it would normally be drawn, cybernetics or not, but don't complete the bottom. The lower leg overlaps the upper leg, but otherwise it's also drawn in the style most of us are familiar with. As with the arm, draw the outline first and the details later. The feet are more difficult. When you're done, remember to add the small cotton-ball tail.

, You're done with the outline! Bunnie is a yellow colour. Her hair is blonde; use a lighter shade of yellow for that. Her shirt and the insides of her ears are pink. Her jacket and hat are brown. Her eyeshadow is purple, and her actual eyes are green. The mechanical parts of her are grey, of course.

, If Bunnie is flying, draw flames coming out of her feet. If you want to put in a background, draw that. You can do a logo if you want. Anything which wasn't covered in the tutorial that you want to add, get that in. Make your fan art unique. And don't forget to sign your work!

Set up your area for drawing.,
Mark a general outline lightly for both Calvin and Hobbes.,
Add more distinct shapes.,
Draw two parallel vertical lines for the trunk portion of his body, with stubby arms and legs.,
Draw two ovals near the center of Calvin's face, with the edges touching, for his eyes, then add smaller circles for his pupils.,
Make a sharply curved ""C"" shape for his nose, very close below the ovals you have drawn for his eyes.,
Define Calvin's clothing by making horizontal stripes on his shirt (his typical attire, though it varies), and putting legs on his trousers, which are usually black.,
Draw Hobbes's head an almost round oval, remembering he will have tufts of tiger fur about his chin, so make this area very light so it will be easy to remove or hide later when you define this feature.

,
Place two ""C""s on top of his head for ears, and make his nose an oval laying on its side near the bottom of the oval you have drawn for his head.

,
Place two small, black circles (his beady little eyes) closely spaced just below the center of the oval which you have drawn for his head.

,
Draw shoulders just slightly wider than Hobbes's head then make his torso long and slender, ending it with two very short legs, with paws made from two more oval shapes at their ends.

,
Make a long, snakelike tail, curving almost randomly or ""hooked"" behind his back, then add vertical stripes penciled in black down it, as well as around his legs.,
Make the fuzzy, or fur-like dash lines around Hobbes's chin, a bit wider than the oval of his head, and dimple the line of his lower chin below his mouth to give it a catlike shape.

,
Erase the sketch lines and use extreme expressions on both Calvin and Hobbes, since they are very emotional characters.",How to Draw Calvin and Hobbes," Put your paper on a comfortable surface to draw on, in a well-lit location, get out your pencil, and put your imagination to work.;
, Their shape could be generally described as rectangular with curved corners, Hobbes being more elongated (he is taller than Calvin), Calvin being almost box-like.

, Draw a rough circular shape for Calvin's head, making sure the line across the top is very light, since when you make the slash like lines for his hair, this guideline will be erased or drawn over.

, Defining individual fingers and toes is not needed, since we are drawing cartoon characters.

, He often keeps his eyes in a rolled expression, so putting them off-center but pointed in the same direction will make him look more natural.

, Underneath this, you can make a short slash mark (-) for his mouth, curving up for a smile, or down for a frown, depending on whether he has gotten the best of Hobbes, or Hobbes has gotten the best of him.

, You can exaggerate the size of his shoes, which appear to be almost directly connected to his butt, since his legs are disproportionately short.

,,,,, These stripes do not cross Hobbes's stomach, since it is white, do cover his forelegs (or arms, if you prefer) and back.

,, Place them in ferocious (or frightened) poses. These are two cartoon characters who are seldom found idling away an afternoon.

Think of what kind of actions your characters will be doing, step by step.,
Decide on the angle for each frame.,
Rewrite the panels on a different sheet of paper and fit them together .,
This process can be done several times until the manga-ka sees the page as fit.",How to Panel Manga," In the first stage, plot out four to six boxes on a piece of paper and write your first actions in each box, with the caption under them.;
, Close-up or background-shot? Horizontal or vertical, maybe slanted? How does this effect the scene?

, If you are leaning towards traditional format, right-to-left panels are a nice idea. Decide in this part of the process what frames bleed out from the edges, but be careful to keep the important captions and drawings inside a ""safe-zone"".


Now, there doesn't have to be a gap between boxes like in American Marvel Comics. Usually, the borders separating each panel are just thin yet bold black lines. In some cases, the borders of a given panel will be left out entirely. This technique is called 'bleeding out' frames.

, After you've made the perfect page, ink it with inking multi-liner pens . Copic and Pigma are recommended highly.

Finish up your pencils.,

Set your type or ink your letters in.,
Find a title for your story.,
Decide whether or not to publish your comic book.",How to Make a Comic Book," Since comic book characters are very much defined by how they look, making a few quick sketches is a great way to inspire yourself to create a unique character – and might even give you plot ideas. You can start with pencil, crayon, or even a digital design program depending on what gets your creative juices flowing.;
, The pros call these ""model sheets."" The more you practice, the more consistent the drawings will be, making it easier for your reader to ""read"" your artwork. Making sure you know how each character looks from all angles will help your readers identify them, even if there's a lot of action around them on your pages.

, This will allow you to make your characters look smoother and will help you work out the few kinks in your technique. To practice, draw your character with four most important feelings (happiness, anger, sadness, and fear) in five different ways each (mildly happy, kind of happy, happy, very happy, extremely happy, hysterically happy). This is a good way to practice drawing your character's facial traits. Since comic books are full of action, you will also need to draw each character in various action poses.

, Developing your characters’ backstory and personality is crucial to making a good digital comic book. Even if you choose not to reveal much to the reader at this point (ex. Wolverine), it’s important for you to have a sense of the character’s roots so that you can make their behavior realistic and organic; their past experiences, victories, hurts, and failures should inform their reactions in new situations. If your comic book hero will be a superhero, read How to Create a Super Hero for advice. Otherwise, read How to Create a Fictional Character from Scratch.


Develop your antagonist/rival/evil person's personality, but don't go too much in depth in the story itself. Over-explaining the antagonist takes away their intrigue (which is why Joker remains so interesting) and dulls the larger conflict of the story. On top of that, since comics have to cover a lot in a limited time, there is no time for the reader to be distracted by someone other than the protagonist. In the example of cartoons like Biowars, the protagonist is actually biology-related, so don't feel compelled to keep your storyline based solely off human or monsters.

, If you're a beginner, it will be hard to make specific facial traits to your characters and you don't want your reader confusing your rival and your hero. If your protagonist has short, blond hair, make your rival have long, black hair. If your protagonist wears shorts and a T-shirt, make your rival wear jeans and a lab coat (or anything else). Match your character's attire with their general demeanor, if possible; bad boy clothing, etc.

, A common mistake in beginner comics is that too many characters make your reader lose interest in the main character's story. Keep it simple. For a very short story, a good number is three characters. These can be the protagonist, the antagonist and the protagonist's helper if your story is about a quest or it can be the protagonist, the rival and the protagonist's crush if it is a love story.

, This is usually the protagonist, but if your villain is particularly intriguing, you might want to open with him or her (especially if you want to set a tone of corruption, decay, or terror for the entire story). You will need to cover who (s)he is and what his/her life is like at this point to allow the reader to connect. Remember to cover all the important details of that character's life. You may have thought about this story for a very long time, but the reader is discovering it and may not understand well if you skip over some details.

, This can be something that causes a disturbance in your main character’s daily life. Be sure to show why this is different from what the character is used to.

, This is your character's adventure to setting things right (or, if you’ve chosen an anti-hero, to set things wrong). This is where you can add a lot of twists and turns to keep your reader interested. Remember that you want your reader to stay interested but you don't want to lose him so keep an idea of the world your character is evolving in.

, This is where your main character either chooses or is forced into a huge confrontation that leaves all parties involved forever changed. Avoid the temptation to show off how capable your hero is by making victory seem too easy; the best confrontations are ones where the participants are very evenly matched and the audience truly fears for the character(s) they love. This is the moment when the reader will be holding his breath to see what happens.

, This is when the reader sees everything falling into place. Make sure that the end gives you a feeling of accomplishment, of catharsis. If it works for you, it should work for your reader.

, To help you out, write a timeline with each step or event in the story in it and write in advance how many pages you will devote to each event: that way you won't make the mistake of making an unimportant event have more pages than the climax. Then, make thumbnails based on how you’ve distributed you events. This doesn't need to be a full script based on what you've written: thumbnails are small, sketchy versions of each page. Use the thumbnails for your ""plot breakdown"" - decide how much of the story you will tell on each page and in each panel. Think about how to compose each panel and how to make your point to the reader. Don't be afraid to try lots of different thumbnails, organizing your story in different ways. Since they're small and sketchy, you won't have to spend as much time on them as you would a fully drawn page.

, Compile these (in order), toss out the rejects, and made additional panels if necessary. If you like certain aspects of a rejected panel, be sure to trace them into your other attempt(s).

, Use your final thumbnails as a guide. This can be loose at this stage, as you begin to place your final artwork in the space of the page. You may decide something from the thumbnail needs to be slightly larger, or smaller, or be emphasized more or less. This is the time to make those last second decisions.

, You may be tempted to start drawing first, but you need to make sure there's room for your text boxes and word or thought balloons. Planning the placement of your copy now will save you many headaches later.


Watch out for the position of the speech bubbles. A reader will naturally read a bubble on the top and on the left first. Keep that in mind when you position them for a dialogue.







, Make sure that everything in each panel is clear and works the way you want it to. Are drawings crowding the lettering so it's smushed into one corner and hard to read? Is a word balloon covering an important detail in your artwork? Is everything clear and easy to understand? This is called ""penciling."" Try to use a sharpened pencil so people can read your comic. Maybe a mechanical pencil would be good. Some artists use non-repro blue pencils to rough in their characters and panel designs. The reason is that this very light blue pencil is invisible to photocopiers and black and white printing processes, so there's no need to erase them later. Then you can refine the artwork with your pencil. Work light - any lines that overlap your ink work will show in the final comic pages.


Remember to make someone reread each page to make sure it's clear enough. If your friend asks you any question like ""What do you mean by that?"" or ""How did the character get here?"", the page isn't clear enough.

, Add details to the characters, objects, and backgrounds.

, Some artists just leave the work in pencils (""Hero bear and the Kid"" is one example). Most comics, however, are inked over the finished pencils. Use whatever you feel most comfortable with - or consider handing the pages off to someone else to be inked (like the big companies do). Using Penstix, Rapidograph, or quills, brushes and India ink will bring life to the work. Pay close attention to line weight - generally, outside or defining lines are thicker, while details like facial lines and fabric wrinkles are lighter and more delicate. Ink in the lines of the borders.

, Lettering is extremely important - it tells half of your story, while the pictures tell the other half. Hand lettering can be time consuming and difficult, but it looks superb when done by a talented calligrapher. Use pencil to rough in your letters - nothing looks worse than running out of room in a word balloon. Or consider using Word or something similar, and a font like Comic Sans to make your letters perfect and legible. Don't forget to spell check!! Grammar is important in writing.

, This isn't always as simple as it sounds. If you've already found one, good. If you haven't, start by writing as many words that can relate to your story as you can. Try writing around 50 to a 100 for a short story or 100 to 200 if it's a long story. (It’s tedious, yes, but it will stretch the limits of your imagination and force you to come up with something a little more creative).Then, combine words together to make a title. After having made a few combinations, choose the ones you like best and have some friends help you. Always have a second, third, fourth or even fifth opinion. Ask your friends which title makes them want to read the comic most.

, If it turns out really well, you might even be able to sell it at Comic Con. If the results aren’t that spectacular (or just you aren’t interested in publishing), you can make a Facebook page for it or put it on YouTube instead!"

Create your characters.,
Think of a plot.,
Begin drawing your manga.,
Once you are finished make copies and give them to friends.",How to Make Manga Comic Books," To design a good character, draw a basic figure and add a unique hairstyle, plus one prominent, unusual feature that will set them apart from other characters, such as a pointy nose or a scar. Also, create an outfit that matches their personality. For example, a mysterious person might wear all black.;
, Manga is meant to be like a story with a problem and solution unlike superhero comics which are pretty much have no end. You should create a plot that is interesting and funny at the same time.

, Use only grayscale colors. Manga is meant to be read from right to left and starting at the back of the book.

, Tweak your manga until you get good reactions.

"
"
Reflect on your intentions.,
All you need to start off with is a cheap notebook that you would usually buy for school, a ruler with smooth sides, either Artgum or a pink eraser, a #2 mechanical (or wooden) pencil, and a fine point Sharpie pen.,
Learn anatomy and draw as much as possible.,
Come up with your own style.",How to Make a Manga Comic," Writing a manga takes a lot of time and effort. These graphic novels are often many chapters in length, and if you're working alone the artwork will take a lot of time. Is it truly what you want to do? It will only be a waste of your time if you make a manga halfheartedly. It will also cost you some money to buy the stationary supplies necessary for a handmade manga. You do, however, have the option of creating it digitally.;
, It's not the art utensils that makes art good but the artists themselves. As a side note, once you have written out a draft of your manga in your notebook, you can do the final drawings with nicer paper, but it's better to draw out roughly how you want on the cheap paper so that you don't waste any high quality paper.

, You don't have to learn what all of the parts of the body are called; just learn what the overall outer parts are and there proportions compared to the rest of the body and the proportions of other things. that's not hard to do once you get the hang of it. Also try to draw clothing, landscapes, and other things in detail. Every time you draw you get better, and if you're always drawing things from the real world in detail Your manga Will look incredibly better and some parts (or the entire thing) may even be breathtaking. A website that helped me out when I first started drawing manga was http://www.mangatutorials.com/

, This may be hard for some of you, especially if you're always trying to draw other peoples' styles. If it is hard, try to think of the type of manga you like (horror, syfy, adventure, etc.) and the mangaka's that usually draw and write the stories that you like. It's okay to base your art style off of your favorite mangas, but don't copy there art style and call it your own; it's not. If you're having trouble making your own style, look into the manga(s) that your drawing from and try to find the objects in it or them that intrigue you. then try to search for those objects online or out in the real world and try to draw them however you want to. It takes awhile but overtime you'll develop a style that you can call your own :-). I would type in more types on how to make a manga but I have school tomorrow and it's already pretty late, so that's it for now.

Figure out where you want your story to be set.,
Find the interesting things about your world.,
Decide the technological advancement of this world.",How to Make an Anime1," Is it going to be on an alien planet? Is it going to be on a place that is relatively similar to places on earth? You don’t need to figure out everything about the entire world, but you do need to figure out where you want your story to occur. For example, maybe you want the major action of your story to occur in a world where most people live in caves because outside of caves there are a ton of dangerous slime pits that you could fall into.;
, Like slime pits! Anime’s often have parts of their world that are slightly magical or strange in some way. Maybe pianos talk and give people lots of advice. Maybe there are flying beasts that people use to get from place to place. It doesn’t have to be something incredibly fantastical or something out of a science fiction novel – just pick something that works with your world and your story. For example, the magic of the world could be a simple folk tale that may or may not be true. Maybe on the slime pit world there is a story that if you fall into a slime pit and survive you’ll be granted special powers but no one knows if this is true or not.

, Are the residents of your world living in apartment complexes or in wooden huts? Are they hunting for their food, or can they go out to dinner are restaurants? Obviously there are a ton of other possibilities in between and beyond these examples. The technological status of your world will inform a lot of the ways that your characters interact with the problems that face them. For example if someone falls into a slime pit in a technological advanced world, maybe it’s no big deal because everyone wears anti-slime suits.

Decide on what they look like and their personalities.,
Decide on a protagonist.,
Consider giving them special abilities.,
Create relationships between the characters.,
Figure out each characters motivation.",How to Make an Anime2," You should try to decide what they look like at the same time that you decide their personalities. Try drawing the characters and then jotting down beside them what their personality traits would be. Maybe you have one character that is really intelligent and perceptive but prone to losing their temper. Maybe you have another character that is very loyal but very unkind to strangers. Sketch drafts of your characters. The way the characters look is important because it can play into their personality. For example, maybe the very muscular character is the hero. Conversely, maybe the very muscular character is a total coward. Either way, his body informs his personality in an interesting way.

, You don’t need to have just one main character, but it’s nice to give the reader somebody to rout for. Most anime have a protagonist. , Anime often feature characters with special abilities accomplishing extraordinary things. It might be a good idea to give your main character some sort of power that will help him or her deal with whatever the problem in your anime is going to be. Your character doesn’t have to be able to fly or have super strength – find something small and interesting that helps the character deal with unique challenges. For example, maybe your character is incredibly brave! That’s a special ability, but it isn’t magic.

, Family members, love interests and friends of your protagonist should all play a major role in your story. These are the strongest connections that people have with others and they help motivate, inspire, and create conflict. All of those things are positive attributes in a fun story.

, The other characters can play into your characters motivation, but find a unique thing that drives them. It can be getting educated or getting the girl, it just has to be something that the protagonist is very passionate about. "

Start by drawing your world in an animation program.,
Draw your characters.,
Draw your characters interacting with the world.",How to Make an Anime3," You can find many free web animation programs online that allow you to easily create a world and character. You’ve already decided what you want the world the look like, so now you just need to bring it to life. Take your time and don’t worry if it changes from your original plan. , Make your characters in the same animation program. Refer to the drawings and sketches that you have already done in order to inform your final product.

, Now all you have to do is combine the characters and the world. This will immediately start to give you ideas for stories and potential plot lines to follow. Maybe your characters want to explore those massive cliffs out in the distance that they have never been to before. Maybe the sun is getting dimmer and dimmer each day and they have to figure out what is going on. The environment can be a huge impetus in any story, and anime is no different. For example, maybe your world has giant slime pits all over the place. Maybe your main characters little brother falls into one of these slime pits and the other characters have to figure out a way to save him. Now you have the beginning of a plot!

"
"
Incorporate dialogue that matches the motivation and personalities of the characters.,
Make sure that you have a beginning middle, and end.,
Include a character arc.",How to Make an Anime4," Once you have characters and a world you can start turning the characters interacting with the world into a story. This involves creating dialogue. Use dialogue that matches the situation and the character. Try to make the dialogue as realistic as possible. Think about the way you talk and create conversations like that. Conversations are rarely 100 % directed. They sway and change subject constantly. Figure out a way to add authenticity, and humor to your dialogue. , The beginning middle and end doesn’t have to be incredibly distinctive, but keeping this organization in mind will help you plan out your plot. Take a look at other classic books and start to figure out what the beginning middle and end of those stories are.


For example, maybe the beginning of your anime has the protagonist’s little brother falling in a slime pit. The middle could be when your protagonist deciding to travel alone into the slime pit wearing an anti-slime suit to try to find his little brother. The end would be the thrilling conclusion where the slime demons living in the slime pit allow only one of the brothers to leave, and your protagonist stays behind so that his little brother can go home. , Character arcs don’t need to be really simplistic and dull. Not every story has to start with a sad character and end with a happy character. Rather, a character arc should allow the main character to undergo some sort of minor transformation or come to a realization. Even if that realization is that nothing changed from when the story started, that still adds a dimension to the story. What you don’t want is your character just running around doing assorted activities without any chain of logic. For example, maybe your protagonist is selfish at the beginning of the story but after helping save his brother he starts to realize that he really does care about other people but that he was shutting himself off to the world. Now you can address why he was shutting himself off to the world in the next episode.

Think of a good title.,
Decide if you want your anime to be one story or a series.,
Add an exciting climax and conclusion.,
Tie the knots in your story.",How to Make an Anime5," The title is what catches people's attention. Make sure the title has something to do with the plot.

, This may determine how your story ends, or if it ends at all. If you want your stories to be a series then you have to figure out a way to keep people interested. If everyone is satisfied with the way the first story ended, then there is no reason for them to watch your next episode. Create cliffhangers. , This is a big part of creating a cliffhanger. If you’re making multiple episodes you want to balance the line between concluding the previous episode and setting the next episode up. They shouldn’t feel like they watched the first episode for nothing, but the viewer should also be excited to see what happens next. Find this balance.

, If there was a love interest at the beginning of the story, there should be some acknowledgement of that at the end of the story. Not everything needs to tie up perfectly, but you want your anime to look well planned and professional. If you have a bunch of untied story lines it feels messy. "

Share with family and friends.,
Create a blog or website.,
Contact a publisher.,
Send out your anime to competitions.",How to Make an Anime6," This is the easiest way to make fans. Your family and friends are bound to be supportive and they will probably share your work with others that they know. This can help you build a small base.

, Publishing your work on the Internet is a great way to start to build an audience. You can’t expect to get paid for the stuff you create immediately, but if it becomes popular then you might be able to! Try to market your blog through social media by creating a Twitter and Facebook page for your anime. , Try to find someone who is excited enough about your story and anime to consider publishing it. You can find a publisher near you online. Look for someone who specializes in anime and who has a history of getting other young artists started. Who knows, they might love your work.

, If you don’t want to send the whole story you can just send out chapters of your anime to shorter competitions. There are plenty of film and writing related competitions that accept anime, as well as anime specific competitions that you can find online.

Gather your materials.,
Find a anime, show or character that you like.,
Make a light sketch of your inspiration.,
Take inspiration from, but don't imitate the original style.,
Flesh out the sketch.,
Go over your sketch with pen.,
Add color or shade to the character you have finished tracing.,
Draw realistic style fan art.,
Draw manga style fan art.,
Draw cartoon style fan art.",How to Make Fan Art," You'll need something to draw with and something to draw on. Paper and pencil is recommended. If your pencil doesn't have an eraser on the end, you'll need a separate eraser. You'll also need a pen, and either markers, paint or colored pencils if you want to color your art.

Alternatively, you may want to use a computer to make digital art



 

;
, This will be the inspiration for your fan-art. If you can't find a show or character, just find a person who inspires you greatly. Another option is to find any picture of a person or character to practice drawing from a source.

, If it is an anime, or character it doesn't have to be in a situation, clothing, etc. that the original creator has positioned it in. You can draw it in whatever position you like or want the character to be in.For example, if the series you've taken your inspiration from is usually very serious in tone, consider putting the character you've chosen in a more lighthearted situation.
Every good sketch is going to start by framing out the figure with basic shapes that indicate the proportions and locations of the body parts. For example, you can start with a single line to indicate the spine, and then draw two ovals to position the torso., It's great to take ideas from the way the original artist portrayed them, but add in some of your own style too. Examples of this include drawing the character with a more or less realistic face, changes the proportions of the character, making other objects such as a fashion range inspired by your character, or adding details to his/her outfit.


A common way to make your fan art a unique take on the original inspiration is to change the art style. If you're taking inspiration from an anime, try drawing the character in a more western cartoon style. If you're taking inspiration from a live-action show, try drawing the character in a manga style.

, Take a step back and look at where your sketch could use improvement. Erase as necessary and keep sketching until you're happy with it. Add in all the details, like pockets, hair, and facial features, that were left out of the initial rough sketch.How much detail you add will depend on the style you've chosen to draw in. A realistic drawing will require the most detail, including detailed facial features, folds and creases in clothing, and anatomically correct muscle shapes. A very cartoony drawing won't require much more than an simplified version of body anatomy and basic, bold shapes for clothing and hair.
Pay attention to what details about the inspiration you're drawing from stand out and define the character, from the obvious things like hair color to the subtle things like the size of the eyebrows. Carrying these details over to your fan art is what will make your fan art recognizable as fan art, and not an original character.

, Once you have the final sketch, trace it over with a pen, going extra slowly and carefully to avoid mistakes. This way you can erase all the un-needed lines in the sketch.

, The most common coloring materials used are markers and colored pencils. If you wish to keep it un-colored, it's best to shade it with a pencil.The easiest way to start shading is to imagine a light source off in one corner or side of your drawing. Sides of objects and body parts opposite the light source will be the darkest, and should be shaded appropriately.Options for coloring include: colored pencils, illustrating markers such as copic markers, and digital coloring using a program like Photoshop. For Photoshop, you'll have to first scan your inked sketch and then open the scanned image in Photoshop.

, To draw your fan art in a realistic style, you'll have to learn human anatomy, specifically, how to draw the various muscle shapes on a figure, and the proportions of each body part. The best way to do this is to find a figure drawing anatomy book, such as Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist by Stephen Rogers.


There are plenty of resources online that will help you learn how to draw realistic figures. Typically the process looks like this: start with the frame of the body, add in the basic body shapes, detail the muscles of the body, then add clothing last. Keep your lines light as you sketch, so that when you go over your sketch in pen, you can erase all the pencil easily., Manga style drawings are characterized by exaggerated proportions and facial features, and simplified and stylized hair. The main difference between manga and realistic figures will be in the face, so if you're going from learning realistic figure drawing to manga drawing, focus on how to draw manga faces.


Manga faces typically have large, highly detailed and shaded eyes, with much simpler mouths and noses. Often, manga noses and mouths will be drawn with two simple lines., The great thing about drawing in a cartoon style is that you aren't restricted by realistic proportions or body shapes. In fact, the more exaggerated, the better. Cartoon faces are more expressive than real faces, and poses are more extreme. Typically, cartoon heads are larger in relation to the body, which helps with making expressive faces.With cartoon sketches, it's often not necessary to sketch out the whole body before adding the clothing. Just start with the simple body frame, lines for the shoulders, hips, spine, and appendages, draw the basic shapes of the body, and then start filling in the details like the clothes and hands."

Become familiar with manga and anime.,
Practice manga characters and/or animals without books.,
Follow each step in drawing books.,
Practice drawing your favorite characters.,
Do not allow others to discourage you.",How to Learn to Draw Manga and Develop Your Own Style," A crucial step in learning to draw manga is to study the art styles of Japanese artists and understand the different components that set manga apart from other types of art. For instance, the eyes are normally the main focus of the face and contain the most detail. Furthermore, a variety of different manga styles exist, and it can be helpful to study them before deciding which one appeals to you the most.;
, Before purchasing a how-to-draw book, attempt to learn the basics on your own. Because instructional books are normally written by a single artist, the images may be drawn in one style. To prevent unconsciously absorbing his or her style, it is best to practice for a while. With many references and guides on the Internet, you can search the basics of manga anatomy and do your best to learn them.

, Rather than skipping to the final product and copying it, it is best to lay out each step. The directions will guide you through the process of starting from scratch and developing each essential part of the face, so you can eventually draw on your own without the book's guidance. If you attempt to cheat and skip ahead, you may have difficulties with remembering and learning the anatomy of manga. Furthermore, attempt to draw your own character so that you can start to develop your own style.

, Although you should not completely adapt another artist's style, copying their work can help you decide what design you prefer. If you enjoy that particular style, bits of that technique will eventually carry over to you. Although this method can be used as a starting point for style development, you should not solely rely upon it; otherwise, you may have difficulties with creating original designs.

, Although it is important to remain open to suggestions, remember that there is a difference between constructive criticism and demeaning remarks. As long as you remain dedicated towards drawing, you have a chance to improve your art. All artists work at different paces, so remain focused upon your own path and avoid comparing yourself to others.

, Start by draw a random shape. It can be anything. A circle, square, ETC. Also you'll need to brainstorm how the character is going to feel. Try making expressions into the mirror and then copying them down. You can also act out what your cartoon character is going to do. Try picturing how he/she/it looks like. *If you need too, you can look at drawings you find in magazines, books, poster, and the internet, but DO NOT copy them! You'll get into a copy writing mess!

, All you need to do to practice this is to draw scenes without characters. draw objects that you'll need or don't need.

, To do this draw a couple panels with a straightedge. (at best try a ruler)

, Just remember, draw outlines first, THEN color with colored pencils, markers, crayons, paint, glitter, etc. You might want to draw how big you're making the cartoon; such as "" 11' 4', 3' 5', etc.

",How to Develop Your Own Unique Cartoon Style," Everyone's style is influenced by another's. Even Osamu Tezuka the ""Father Of Anime"" was inspired by Walt Disney to create characters with huge eyes, which became the anime style we know today. Find a good artist that you admire, ""shadow"" their work by looking at how they draw their bodies, proportions and how it works together overall. This way you can see the mechanics of their style.;
, You've found an artist and you've shadowed them. Now, think of yourself. What are some line styles that you are comfortable with? Sharp, quick, pointy lines that feather out? Smooth, round, bold lines? Jagged edges, and pointy features? What lines make your art yours? This is important because your lines are what makes up the ""mood"" of your style and the ""mood"" of the characters.

, You've found a good artist to shadow, and let's say, you're in love with sharp pointy edges and quick-feathered features. You've got your inspiration and an idea of lines you're comfortable with...now what? Grab some paper, a pencil and get started! Start doodling random characters using the line style you chose. Experiment by varying the size and shapes of limbs and features, and placement of things.

, After you've developed the basics to your personal style, it's time to explore the 2nd most important thing in developing a new unique style - color! Color is important because it works with your line work to create the ""mood"" and ""feel"" of not only the style but your characters too. Sit back and think. Do you want happy-go-lucky bright colors, or gloomy, dark colors? Are you thinking exciting and ravishing or monochromatic, like the old fashioned cartoons back in the day?

, Once you've got a general idea of the line style and color scheme, it's time to put it to the test! Will it hold or flop? Is it a versatile style or can you only go one way with it? Try going out to public places like the mall, or the park and draw who and what you see in your new-found style. Draw different variations of what you see and if it doesn't work, keep tweaking it!

, It will hopefully be unique to you and what you like, and you might just make your own comic book, manga book, or get your own Cartoon Show!

Figure out what kind of character you want.,
Give them a personality.,
When you've gotten their personalities, make sure you have given weak points and strong points.,
Now you're ready for physical features.",How to Create Your Own Cartoon Character," If you're making a comic or an animated cartoon then figure out what role your character plays.;
, Shy, evil, nice, or not just one personality. A character can be evil and bold, or quiet and mean.

, You can't create a character that's completely perfect, or completely bad. A character could be nice, yet a bit selfish.

, Is it a guy or girl? How old are they? Remember, cartoons are exaggerated. You know, big eyes, or big ears if it's an animal? Big nose? What color is their hair/fur? If you want an animal, what species? Draw your character out.

Draw the outline of the face and its guidelines.,
Draw a U-shaped nose.,
Add a mouth.,
Draw the child's eyes.,
Sketch the child's neck and shoulders.,
Draw the child's hair.,
Outline your image in pen.,
Color the face as desired.",How to Draw a Cartoon Child1," Most children have a round/oval face shape, with a slightly pointed chin. The guidelines should split the face equally into fourths. Sketch lightly, and don't worry about getting the lines perfect on the first try.;
, The nose should be 1/3 of the way down the bottom half of the face. Children tend to have small noses, without much nose bridge definition, so a simple nose will do for most kids.


The child in the above illustration is a white girl, so the nose will be narrow.

, The mouth should be placed approximately 2/3 of the way down. You may choose a simple curve for a smile, or an open mouth, or whatever you feel like.

, The eyes should be big and rounded, with a large iris (the colored part). This will make the child look cute and young. Thicken the top eyelid to draw attention to the eyes and make them appear alert. Add raised eyebrows.

, A thin neck and narrow shoulders will give the character a sense of childlike vulnerability. You may choose to refine the face shape a little bit as you get a sense of how it will look.

, Many children with straight or wavy hair wear bangs. Children tend to have large foreheads, so be sure to add plenty of volume to the hair.


This little girl's hair is straight, but that does not mean your lines will be. Gentle curves will give a sense of movement and make it more interesting.
Notice how the bangs curve outward like a sphere to show volume.

, Take your time. Thicken the outline where there are shadows, or where you want to draw attention. In this image, the artist used a darker outline on the upper eyelids, the shadows on the chin, the corners of the mouth, and a few other places.


If you are drawing digitally, lower the opacity of your sketch and draw your outline on a new layer.

, For a cheerful image, use bright colors and/or pastel colors. Shade as desired and fine-tune your final image.


In this image, the artist chose to use pastel colors for everything except the bright blue eyes, making them stand out.
Don't forget to sign your name!

Go over your sketch with pen, refining details as needed.,
Color your lineart if desired.",How to Draw a Cartoon Child2," Then draw a line coming down from one side of the face, and a curved line connecting the bottom of the line to the bottom of the circle. This will be the chin.


This picture will show a boy looking to the left.

, You only need one guideline for profile view, because the vertical guideline is on the side of the face.

, The nose should be rounded, with a gentle slope. Notice how the forehead curves inwards at the top of the nose bridge, and then back out. The bottom of the nose, just like before, should be around 1/3 of the way down from the horizontal guideline.


Younger children tend to have larger foreheads. The boy in the above image is quite young, so his forehead will be very big.

, Some cartoonists prefer to leave this area flat, while others prefer to draw more realistic lips. If you add lips, make them pointy and thin, because children's lips tend not to be very full yet. It should look roughly like an M-shape coming from the side of their face.


White people tend to have the thinnest lips, while black people's lips are usually the fullest. This boy is Asian, so his lips are somewhere in the middle.
Little girls' lips aren't usually fuller than boys' lips yet. Children look pretty androgynous.

, Notice that eyes are not oval-shaped in profile view—they are more like a rounded triangle, with one corner pointing to the center of the head while the largest flat side is on the outside.


Since this boy is Asian, his eye has a gentle (and subtle!) upward slant at the corner.

, The jawline will be around halfway across the head. The top of the ear lines up with the eyebrows, and the bottom of the ear lines up with the bottom of the nose.

, Notice how the hair curves outwards like stripes on a beach ball, showing that the child's head is round. The back of the neck attaches near the base of the ear.

, Notice how the upper eyelid has a darker line.

, Notice how the light and shadows hint at the roundness of the cheek, and the blue-gray highlights make the hair look shiny and clean.

Notice how the head is slightly tilted this time. This will make the picture look dynamic and be more interesting.
The artist used a squashed oval to give this girl a wide face. Feel free to experiment with rectangles, triangles, hearts, and other face shapes.

, Start with an oval, and refine the shape from there. This girl is black, so her nose is wide with a shallower bridge.

, This smile started out as a crooked trapezoid, and then teeth were added. One corner of her mouth is farther away from the others, giving her an impudent smile.

, This girl's eyes are almond-shaped. Notice how the bottom lids slant upwards—this is what eyes do when a person smiles. The big eyes make her look cute and friendly.

, Children have big heads, especially cartoon children. Shape the body like a rectangle, with arms coming out from either side.


The bottom of her sleeve is simply a random squiggly line. Lace does not have to be even in order to look cute.

, This girl's hair is curly and thick, so it is represented by random squiggles in a general oval-like shape. Curly hair is wild, so use loose scribbles and don't worry about the exact shape.


This is one way that art can send a positive social message—by showing that black girls can embrace their natural hair texture and feel good about it. You can send a message about diversity by drawing cute children of color, disabled children, and children of all shapes and sizes.

, Here you can add any extra details (like her gap teeth) and refine the shapes more. This artist added a few wrinkles to the clothes and worked on the shape of the hair more carefully.

, Take note of where the shadows fall—under her nose, her neck, her eyelids, and the back of her hair.


Curly hair can be shaded with squiggles of different colors. The hair is the same color as the eyes and the freckles to give unity to the picture.
The girl's shirt has a purple texture. Digital artists can use screentones with layer modes such as Multiply or Screen to add interest to clothes.

Shape the two ovals that will form the eyes.






Add in the eyebrows. These have a wild, jagged edge to them, as shown.






Draw two curved lines that will serve as his ears. Draw both left and right ears, shaping them in opposite directions.







Draw two oval shapes to form the nose. The smaller oval shape will serve as a reflection of the nose.






Draw the fur atop the head. Draw the fur in wave-like shapes, with jagged tips to help keep the impression of wildness and movement. Keep the same flow as with the eyebrows.






Pencil in the mouth clearly. Leave space for the tongue to loll out. While drawing the fur-side of the mouth, keep with the jagged fur flow that you've already used for the eyebrows and head top fur.






Draw the tongue. Now that the mouth is in place, concentrate on fine-detailing the tongue. Be sure to give the impression that it's big and fleshy.






Draw in the fangs. Make these slightly curvy rather than simply pointing straight down but still create a sharp end point for each fang.







,

Draw the left paw.






Sketch the right paw.







, Draw as shown, with his legs in a bent stance.

, This will make these features stand out from the remaining outlines and colors of the body and also gives depth and a small sense of cheeky menace.

, Once that is done, erase the remaining guidelines and refine any elements as needed.

, The suggested colors are a dark brown for the fur, pink for the tongue and a beige or tan color for the fur surrounding his mouth area and covering his chest or belly area. Leave the fangs white, as well as the whites of his eyes.

, Ones 3 months or younger are usually the best.;
, Remember, it's always better to get something from the ORIGINAL MAKERS of the cartoon. Not other artists who draw it. This helps make it look more authentic.

, Some people think that's not true, But it is. The person who is telling you this article doesn't hold his pencil right!

, It doesn't matter if you screw up, even if you've barely drawn the head!

Now you are done!",How to Draw Tohru Honda," If it is your first time drawing her, you may want to stick to drawing her by looking at a picture. Find a picture of Tohru that you can reference while drawing.;
, A good way to do this is to draw lines that show how the character is standing. Make sure these lines are drawn lightly so you can erase them later on.

, The outline should be very simple. You should not worry about details until later. You should also draw this lightly in case you wish to change it later on.

, Adjustments to the drawing can also be made at this point.

, This includes the nose, mouth, eyes, and eyebrows. Also put faint lines of where the hair will be. Take into account that the particular anime style Tohru is drawn in has large eyes and a small nose and mouth. The nose and mouth are extremely simple with little detail while the eyes have a lot of detail and are more difficult to draw.

, Some may feel it is easier to use a straight edge like a ruler for certain parts of the clothes. Put a line around any area that has a shadow so you can fill it in later.

, If lines of pencil show up in the shading rub your finger on it and it will fade. This may smudge the pencil into areas you don't want it in if you are not careful. Erase any gray areas that should be white.

, Take note of what areas will be darker than other parts of the hair. Also draw in her hand and shade the underside of it.

, Her hair is dark brown so color it in heavily. At this point you should go back and make sure no areas got darker than you wanted from dragging your hand across the paper while drawing.

, It is okay if your drawing does not come out exactly like the picture you used. All you can do is practice until you get it right! Good luck!

Flesh out the details.",How to Draw Batman3," Unlike Superman, whose look evolved early and has remained fairly constant throughout his appearance in the comics, Batman's look has been revised a number of times during his years of crime fighting. Both his physical appearance and his costume have changed, with the most notable changes being the addition of the yellow oval around his Bat-insignia in 1964, which has been dropped in more recent renderings of the Gotham Guardian, as well as no longer showing him wearing trunks that match his cowl and cape, coupled with a different rendering of his utility belt.

You can find examples of your favorite Batman look online, in comics anthologies such as ""The Greatest Batman Stories Ever Told,"" or in shows such as ""Batman: The Animated Series"" or ""The Brave and the Bold.""

, When not behind the wheel of the Batmobile or in the cockpit of the Batplane, Batman can often be seen swinging through downtown Gotham City on his Batline, crouching on rooftops, breaking through skylights or tumbling his way into or out of danger. These action poses require knowledge of perspective and foreshortening to render the Caped Crusader correctly. If you haven't mastered these techniques, you may instead want to draw the imposing figure Batman casts when he's standing still., In general, you'll want to draw Batman's body to be about 3 times as wide and 7 1/2 to 8 times the height of his head. The Dark night Detective is described as standing 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 meters) tall and weighing 185 pounds (84 kilograms). If you're showing Batman from the perspective of a terrified thug seeing the Masked Man hunter drop down on him, you'll want to lengthen the body parts nearest the viewer and shorten those furthest away., Draw a circle initially to represent Batman's head, a square for his jawline and a rounded rectangle for his chest. Use sticks to represent his lower torso, arms and legs until you work of the specifics of his pose and the perspective needed.

Because Batman's cape is so voluminous, you need to plan what parts of the Caped Crusader's body it will cover when you begin your sketch. You can start with a set of curved lines to show where the upper part of the cape will rest with respect to Batman's back.

, Start roughing in Batman's chest, arm and leg muscles. Batman should have a well-defined chest and abdominal muscles and a neck thick enough to bear the weight of his head, cowl and cape. Work the shape of his face from the original circle to be more squarish; if you're going for the look Sheldon Moldoff created in the 1950s, you want an especially square-jawed Batman.

Although Superman is much more physically powerful, Batman's physique should be roughly the same as Superman's, as the two heroes used to trade costumes to confuse their enemies in 1950s and '60s issues of ""World's Finest Comics."" Other than in Frank Miller's rendering from ""The Dark Knight Returns,"" Batman should not appear musclebound, either; his physique should most closely resemble that of a decathlete.

"
"

Make it hug his body.,
Put the trunks in the right place if you're showing them.,

Extend the gloves and boots to the right length.,

Give the Caped Crusader a large cape.,

Add in the utility belt.",How to Draw Batman4," Batman's costume is close-fitting, although in more recent years, it has incorporated form-fitting soft body armor to protect the Dark Knight from bullets and knives. Thus, it isn't necessary to show every detail of every muscle, although the most significant ripples should be shown., Although the contrasting color trunks have been dropped in recent years, Batman is still drawn with them in many pictures. If you're including them, the lower parts should ride where his legs meet his groin, and the upper part, which reaches his waist, should be concealed by his utility belt., The sides of Batman's boots should come up to the thickest part of his calves, with the point at the front coming to just below his knees. His gloves should reach the thickest part of his forearms, with 3 serrated projections curving backward from the outer sides of his forearms to suggest bat wings.

The glove serrations are primarily decorative, but they served as bladed weapons in ""Batman Begins.""

, Batman's cape is both longer and wider than Superman's. It should extend as far down as the backs of his upper ankles, ending in scalloped points to suggest bat wings and be wide enough that he can wrap it around his body the way Sherlock Holmes can his Inverness cape. In action poses, the cape should billow out behind Batman, large enough for him to use it as a parachute or parasail in an emergency.

Bob Kane's original vision for Batman's cape was as sort of a wearable hang glider, but this created a cape that was too stiff to draw.

, Draw a line just below the waist and another line about the width of Batman's hand above it to represent the edges of the utility belt. Create a rectangle in the center for the buckle, then either draw in a set of spaced cylinders or rectangular pouches depending on which version of the belt you're rendering."
"

Draw in reference lines for the eyebrows and nose.,

Draw in the lower edge of the cowl.,

Position the cowl's eyeslits.,

Add the cowl's ears.,

Shade in the cowl face.",How to Draw Batman5," Batman's nose and eyebrows are concealed by his cowl, but the cowl is molded around his forehead so the lines made by his brows show. The nose itself should be rendered as 2 triangles with a common side over the septum., Extend a diagonal line from either side of the nose to the side of the head. Draw another line from each of these lines from where the cheek would be down to the jawline and erase the lines running from the cheeks to the ears., The eyeslits should be roughly almond-shaped and placed where eyes would normally be. By convention, even in facial close-ups, Batman's eyes are not drawn in, but the slits are left white, although some artists defied this convention in the 1970s. (In recent years, this has been explained with eye-covers similar to those used by Spider-Man.), Use narrow triangles to represent the bat-ears of the cowl. Bob Kane originally drew fairly long ears, which were shortened a few years into the character's run and remained short until Neal Adams extended them again in the early 1970s., A common convention in drawing Batman is to shade in the area of the cowl that covers his upper face. This is not a coloration of the actual cowl, but rather a means to suggest the facial features covered by it. The shading usually covers the forehead and upper cheeks, but not the nose or where the mask rests on Bruce Wayne's eyebrows."
"

Make an oval on Batman's chest.,
Draw another oval just inside the first oval.,

Draw a set of reference lines bisecting the oval horizontally and vertically.
,

Sketch in the Bat-symbol, starting from one of the sides.,

Remove any reference lines you drew.
",How to Draw Batman6," This will serve as the outer border of the logo if you choose to render the chest emblem with the oval and as a guide for the bat if you don't. The oval should be about as long as the distance between the ends of the Dark Knight's eyeslits., The space will form a border for the emblem. If you don't plan to include the oval in the logo, ignore this step.,, Until 1969, the bat was drawn with slightly curving lines radiating from the bat's head to form the peaks of the wings, which then curved down to the outer tips. After that point, the outer edges of the wings curled to resemble the edges of a 2-headed ax. Using the reference lines, draw in one half of the Bat-symbol, then draw the other half as its mirror image.,"

Erase messy lines, add shading, and do everything else needed to turn your sketch into a finished drawing.",How to Draw Manga Wings," For this demonstration, a straight-on head shot is being used. You can draw your character any way you want, but remember, most wings attach to the back, so if you're drawing a profile or back view you'll have to draw that, too. Also, you must decide if you're putting the hair in front or behind the wings. In this demonstration, the hair is in front, but again, it can be any way you choose. Also, you can draw your character full body, or just to the torso. Head shots are not recommended for wings pictures because wings generally attach to the body below the head, but again, it's your artwork, your choice.;
, Notice that you're just drawing the top, not the extensions. This basically looks like an upside-down ""V"" on each side, or a giant ""M"" together. If you want your wings to go up, again, draw the basic line in which you'd like them to follow.

, Your skeleton is your guide. Towards the vertex of the ""V,"" draw lots of little triangles, your first feathers, then follow the ""V"" line back to the shoulders. If you're not using the ""V"" skeleton, make your first layer end about where the joint would be.

, Draw lots of triangles coming down from your first layer. Keep in mind the lengths; this will determine the overall shape of the wing. Usually, the wing will become smaller as it approaches the shoulder, or wherever else it connects to the body. The main shape of the feather should be roughly triangular, but not perfect straight lines, and wider towards the base. Especially if you are doing an unorthodox wing shape (smaller character), don't be afraid to have spaces between your feathers. If your character has shadows, retrace the wing on the shadowed side to make it seem darker. You can add third, or even fourth layers to make your wings longer and more realistic looking.

, Add color if you want. Congratulations, you're done!

Lightly sketch out Fluttershy's general shape.,
Distinguish the shape.,
Add in details.,
Color/shade and final touch-ups.",How to Draw Fluttershy from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic," Draw a circle for the head, thighs, and upper muzzle. Add curved lines for her hooves. Sketch the boundaries where her wings will be. Draw ovals for her eyes.

Draw the shape of her upper mane along with her widow's peak, and have swirls to represent her lower mane and tail. Think of this step as guidelines for the actual line art.
;
, The belly, in this pose, overlaps the thighs. Front hooves widen as they go down and have rounded edges. Draw in the swirls of her mane. She has a smile coming down that meets with her chin and another line to the right of it to show her open mouth. The right side of her thigh connects to the lower part of her hind hooves. The left side of her hind legs makes a gentle curve. Draw sloping lines that border Fluttershy's eyes (an eyelash is made automatically) then add two more lashes to each eye. Pony ears are somewhat triangle shaped. As for her wing flaps, draw three elongated ovals at top (longest at the topmost flap) and a plumper oval at the bottom.




, Add the bottom lashes, nostril, inner mane/tail lines, and a curve marking the interior of the ear. Her iris is a necessary detail (oval for iris, oval for pupil, circle or oval for highlights). Her front wing flaps are two elongated ovals and a plump oval at the bottom. They are shorter than the four flaps behind. Put three little dashes on her flank for the body of the butterflies on her cutie mark.




, Add wings and antennae to her cutie mark butterflies and eyebrows if you wish. Shade in and color mane, tail, and body however you want. (it doesn't have to be in black in white like in the picture, of course) This step is mostly improving whatever you deem necessary.

Details.,
There you have it!",How to Draw Manga with a Tracing Method," You can get it online or maybe even through a book! It really doesn't matter how complex the picture is. But you don't want to get one with too many details if this is your first time tracing.;
, There are four steps of tracing manga. Place one of the tracing papers onto the printed picture. Label it Step 1. Try clipping it with a strong clip to a board. That will secure it to stay in the same place while you are tracing.

, When you have your first tracing paper in place and in line with the printed picture, start tracing shapes you see. For example, trace a circle for the head, and oval for the body and a bigger circle for a dress. Make sure your shapes line up with the picture or else you will have a crooked picture.

, Once you have the major basic shapes down, you have to do the other simple shapes. So start by tracing the major basic shapes onto another piece of paper. Once you have 3 or 4 major steps down on paper, put the 2nd tracing paper, which you would have labeled Step 2, on top of the printed picture. Then trace the simple shapes that are slightly more complex than the first 3-4 shapes. As an example, do circles as hands and long ovals as arms.

, Trace the simple shapes onto another piece of paper and start to draw the edges of the character. Just simplify the edges a little more. Label it step 3.

, Trace all the details along with all the 4 steps.

, Now just follow the steps to draw on a paper, and now you have your own!

Draw the head for your manga character.,
Think about what you want the hair to look like.,
Mark the hair outline on your character's head.,
Draw the basic outline of your hair.,
Detail and shape your hair.,
Colour/Shade your hair.,
Complete the rest of your character's face.",How to Draw Manga Hair," You'll need a basic frame to work on. Don't concern yourself too much on facial features, only on the shape of the head. Remember manga heads change depending on gender, females generally have rounder, smaller, less-angular faces than males.;
, Don't be afraid to make it a little bit crazy. A lot of famous manga characters have quite absurd and impossible-looking hairstyles. There are a few basic things you'll need to decide:


Where the parting will go.
Whether the character will have bangs or a fringe or not.
How long the characters hair will be.
If the hair style matches the character's personality.
Whether the character be wearing a headband, hat, forehead protector or any other accessories which will alter the appearance of the hair.

, Traditionally, the distance from the forehead to the top of the head should be equal to the distance from the top of the head to the top of the hairstyle. Additionally, the same distance should be applied to the sides of the head to determine the distance from the side of the head to the side of the hairstyle. This is just a guideline and can be altered once the hair is drawn to suit your tastes.

, Pay attention to the guide marks you marked earlier. It is easier to start from the fringe/top of the forehead and work outwards, paying attention to the direction in which the hair falls.

, Manga hair is composed of many strands, or 'clumps'. Hair is made more complex by adding more clumps, or by breaking down larger clumps into smaller ones. Remember to pay attention to the direction of the hair.

, Regardless of whether you've chosen to work in colour or not, shading/colouring your hair follows the same techniques. Manga hair is always shiny and pronounced. Decide upon the direction of light before you start. If the light is shining from the left, your character's hair should be lighter on the left than the right. If the light is coming from the front, frontal hair pieces such as the fringe and sideburns should be a lighter colour than the hair around the back of the neck. Start with a 'base' colour, and add lighter and darker shades to areas affected by light.

, A Manga character's hair is what gives it its personality; in fact, most Manga characters will look the same if their hair is taken away. Consider this when deciding on facial features and expressions. Colour and shade the face, and refine the hair. Once you are happy with your character, go over any outlines and prominent features and shadows with a black-ink pen. This process is known as inking and features heavily in Manga drawing. Inking strengthens lines and hides pencil-work, while making your image stand out and giving your character its final touch-up.

Purchase a drawing tablet.,
Download or purchase a drawing software.,
Adjust to computer drawing.,
Know benefits of digital drawing.,
Draw.",How to Draw Manga on a Computer," It's tough to draw with a mouse, unless you're using vector lines. Many artists use drawing tablets, with Wacom tablets being fairly common across the art world. However, search for different brands if you feel that Wacom tablets aren't right for you.


Decide what tablet is best for you - however, keep in mind your budget and how often you'll be using it. If drawing manga is your source of income, then it may be worth it to save up and get a touchscreen or a pen display. These are extremely costly, however, so start off with a regular tablet and decide which one is best for you.;
, You can't use MS Paint for manga, as the quality of art is terrible. Research art programs and find a free one, or purchase one if you can afford it.


Free-of-cost applications available to both Mac and Windows are FireAlpaca, MediBang Paint Pro, and GIMP. Mischief has a free version, but it doesn't have layer tools.
A commonly used software is Paint Tool SAI. It costs money, but many people use it. However, it's Windows-only, and running it on Mac through an emulator disables pen pressure.
Good quality software that is available to both Mac and Windows include Mischief, Adobe Photoshop, and Manga Studio. They can be costly, but they're good choices for art.

, The first thing you want to do after installing the tablet drivers is to figure out how the tablet matches to the screen and adjust any settings you want to change. Take some time to orient yourself with the tablet and drawing, and test out different settings that you may want to use.


If you haven't already, learn your way around the drawing software. You can search online for guides on your program, or explore by yourself to find out where certain settings are. Be aware, though - when it comes to programs such as Photoshop or Manga Studio that have different versions, you want to make sure that your searches are limited to the version you have.

, With pencil and paper drawings, there are certain qualities that can be bothersome - such as getting graphite all over your hand. Digital art has more features; however, some are dependent on the drawing software you use.



Layer tools permit you to create transparent layers that don't mix with other parts of the drawing. In other words, you don't have to draw your sketch and your final lines on the same layer anymore.

Most programs also have opacity locks, which prevent you from drawing or coloring outside of what's already been marked, and clipping masks, which make the layer ""snap"" to the layer below it and lets you add different colors without needing to be on the same layer.



Brush tools are extremely useful, especially if your software allows you to create your own brushes with different settings. Many programs have a catch-all list of brushes - pencil, pen, watercolor/blend, airbrush, blur, and the eraser. Some programs have different categories and other types of brushes, but most programs follow the list above.

Transform tools allow you to select something on the drawing - whether it's a whole layer or just a part of it - and move it, resize it, and in some software, change the angling of it. This is useful if you need to check sizing on something or draw something in the wrong place.

Select tools allow you to select part of the drawing - whether it's opaque or not - and color it. Using the select tools also allow the selected portion to be transformed.

Vector tools are only available in some programs, but are useful for creating lines that aren't shaky. They can be edited to be thick, thin, curved, straight, and the color of them can be altered. However, some artists prefer not to use these, viewing them as cheating.

Zoom tools can help to view your image up close or far away to see if you've done the linework incorrectly. Some programs also permit you to screen flip and change the angle of how you're viewing the art, which is recommended if something looks wrong but you can't tell what it is.

, Have fun with your art software! Draw your manga and have fun while doing so.

As you keep on practicing, you will be able to draw a perfect circle without any need of dividers or anything else. (Do not put too much pressure on the pencil while drawing this as this is ""just"" a baseline and you will have to erase it when you're done.)

, (Draw the second line a little lower from the diameter of the circle.)

, The two points where the circle and the horizontal line touch, mark the point where the jaw will start and the tip of the vertical line will be the tip of the chin.

, This line should be parallel to the first one. The eyes will be placed between the two of them.

, Start off with two lines on the horizontal baseline on the top, shaped like an arch. The lower lines of the eye should be straighter than the ones on the top but should still not be too straight. The lower lines should be shorter than the ones on the top but not too short. Add some eyelashes, both on the top line and the lower line.

, The lower tip of the oval should ""slightly"" touch the lower eyelid when the upper part of the oval should look like it was ""half-covered"" by the upper eyelid. (Check the image for this step for some more help.) Although, if you want to give her a ""surprised"" look, the upper part of the oval nor the lower part should not touch the eyelids ""at all"". Add little circles inside the eyes. These will be the sparkles. Then add the pupils. The pupils should be large but if you want to give her a ""frightened"" look, the pupils should be small.

, This is the nose.

, The mouth will be placed on the vertical line and just under the nose. But before erasing, mark the point where the mouth will be so it will be easier. Don't panic if you had erased the lines before marking the spot, it is easy to understand where it should be.

, Start with a short line, shaped like an arch. Then draw the same line, but this time upside down so that it looks like a pout. Add another little line under the mouth. This is the lower lip.

, Eyebrows can be straight (if you want an innocent or afraid look) or they can be arch-shaped (if you want a serious or neutral look).

Next up is the perky expression. Draw 2 curved lines below the hairline for the eyebrows. Then draw an oval with 2 curved lines above and beneath it for the left eye and a just a curved line for the right eye. Draw the mouth with a big wide smile.






Last but not least is the expression of having an unpleasant surprise or dread. Draw the eyes as drooping semi circles with the right eye having several vertical lines. The mouth should be made using a rectangle going over the chin or the ""jaw drop"" as they call.

Don't forget the idea of perspective. In the introductory picture, the hand in the front is a lot bigger to appear closer to the viewer.;
, He should be bigger at the shoulders and narrower at the hips, with little or no expansion at the chest or constriction at the waist.

, These are pretty key in differentiating the jawbone and adding masculinity.

, Guy eyes are different because they are not as round or shiny, unless they are very young. For a teenager like the one depicted, a good medium sized, slanted eye style works well.


Guys don't accentuate their eyelashes. So, in cartoon styles like manga, they have little to NO eyelashes.

, So, go wild and draw a messy tuft of hair.


The guy in the introductory drawing has a hat, another boyish feature.

, For guys, they usually wear baggy tee shirts or graphic designs, jeans, hoodies, and lack accessories. Draw the tee shirt like you would define his back, and then let it hang off in the front to show the bagginess.

, The main details are his shape, which should be boxy and muscular, and his head with short, spiked hair. Goofy grins are optional!

, Why? Ask yourself, ""Why does this person react this way when approached?"" Now that you have observed human nature, gather the data and form a conclusion about it. Think of possible outcome and situations where your conclusions might apply. This is the mental structure of your character.

, Pick out ten subjects to draw in as much general detail as possible. Pick off subtle characteristics about said subject. How they stand or sit, how they walk, how they talk to the people around them.These will form the physical structure of your character(s). When they are seen using subtle signs, it forces them to appear more human, making them easier to draw and visualize.

, No doubt your subjects are all different, compare and contrast how you perceive them. How do they appear to you? Finding similarities in the people you drew will help you gather up both mental and physical stability in your character.

Start off according to your gender and learn to know the male/female body better before you draw any boy/girl characters. Turn your dots into larger circles, for example, around the knees (this eventually makes the kneecap).

, Women have a slimmer waist while a man's is less defined. Add some lines for the neck and make some triangle shapes for the feet. Erase all the original 'skeletal' lines leaving only your border.

, You can basically design any clothes but an important part is the fold. They make the look realistic (that ever so important word again). Start basic though, a simple robe or something.

To create the head shape, draw an oval-circle shape.,
From the right side of the circle, draw a small line going downwards.,
Just above half-way up the circle shape, draw a horizontal line, maybe curving slightly (but for it to curve is not important).,

And now, you've come to the end.",How to Draw Manga Like the Characters on CartoonDollEmporium.Com," This may be hard to get perfect, but if it's close enough it will work just as well. This is necessary as the head is one of the hardest parts to put in right measurements.;
, Join a diagonal line, ending to the right of the center of the circle shape which will form the chin. Now, using the bottom of the circle to guide you, draw a kind of gentle, sloping diagonal towards the left edge (so it looks as if it could meet the circle outline had it carried on).

, Draw another of these just below half-way. Then, right near the bottom of the circle, draw another. This will create space for the eyebrows (top gap) and the eyes (bottom gap). For a guideline for the nose, draw a vertical line through the face, ending just to the right of the chin.

, Make the eye fill the height of the bottom gap. For the second, count one or two eye widths to the right of the vertical line, and draw another oval- slightly thinner this time (again, filling the height of the bottom gap). As for the nose, there will be visible circle coming from where the second eye sits. Draw a small line here, sloping to upwards and right. Then you add the mouth; there are many ways you can draw the mouth. Happy, sad, neutral, you name it. Shown here is a simple, cute and a little surprised looking (open) mouth. The position is based on where the vertical line is, above the chin.

, The positions of the irises, the circles where the light would be shining on them, the darkness around the lashes. You can change shapes too, rather than sticking to this eye design. Also, we draw on the eyebrows in the top gap above our eyes. Again, these can look different- arched, flat, whatever fits the character's emotion. The first eyebrow starts at the vertical line and ends just passed the corner of the eye. The right starts above the inner corner of that eye and ends the same, just on the opposite side.

, First draw a slightly tilted line upwards to create the ear position. Do this from the line coming left from the chin (which you have already drawn) up to join the upper circle. To draw the ear, start just above the top eye line and go down, round to just below the nose line. Now the ear is done, you can put on the neck. Vertical down- but ever so slightly curving- sketch the left neckline just where the ear ends, and where the ear placement line is. The next line goes just before the chin and is vertical. Finally, put the hair on! What hair you give the character is your choice. Fringe, side fringe, middle parting, even standing upright! Shown here is a messy fringe type style. Normally in anime, you draw pointed parts of the hair and raise the hair further up than the top of the head.

, The character's body shape, position, actions and clothes are totally up to you. With the character facing sideways, draw the shoulders so that the left one is coming down into an arm and the right kind of follows the body.

, The hair can be flowing, in plaits, pigtails, ponytail... like with the mouth, clothes etc there are plenty of choices! When this is sketched, tidy up the lines by erasing guide lines, mistakes and simply messy sketched lines.

, If you want a simpler, tidier drawing skip it. Now we add things like lines for the hair, creases in the clothes, darken pupils in the eyes. Fairly obvious, really.

, All that is left is to darken the line, add colour, and any more finishing touches! Well done at your drawing.

The chin shouldn't be sharp or V-shaped. Anime and manga guys have normal chins, just slightly elongated.;
, The nose and mouth of guys are more towards the bottom of the face. Be careful not to make the nose and mouth too far down, though.


This is in contrast to the features of anime or manga girls, who tend to have their facial characteristics more centered on the face.

, Oftentimes, the eyes of attractive anime guys are narrow and slanted, and the upper lids are heavily outlined (but don't have lashes the way anime girls do).


Bigger eyes tend to suggest youth and playfulness, while narrower eyes indicate an older look, like one of an authority figure.
If you're having trouble spacing out the eyes, remember that eyes are usually an eye's length apart - meaning that you can just measure the length of one eye and then keep about that much of a distance between the two eyes.

, A hot guy can have either short or long hair, which can be either well-kept and groomed, or shaggy and messy. The hair can make them look mysterious or playful. Experiment to see what you like best.

, The shoulders should be wide and strong. Your guy may or may not be muscular, but make everything proportional. Look up references if you're having trouble.


The physique of the guy is up to the artist, but generally, wide shoulders and a narrow waist are two features that make up guys that are commonly seen as attractive.

, The legs should be long within reason and should match the physique of your guy - meaning that you're not going to have a guy with super buff arms, but legs that look like sticks. Make it proportional.

, Many attractive anime or manga guys wear clothes that show off their bodies. Common examples are button-up shirts and jeans. You may want to give your guy some accessories, such as a hat, a belt, or a tie.

, Once you've finished drawing your hot guy, you can erase any extra lines you may have added while sketching and color him in, if you want. You can also choose to add a background to the picture - it's totally up to you!

",How to Draw Like Arina Tanemura," This image shows a nose and mouth, but you don't have to. For a winking eye, just draw a curved line.;
, The bottom eyelid should be at a downward angle, and the top lid should hover above the original oval. On the winking eye, thicken the eyelid, and add things like eyelashes.

, One at the top, and one at the bottom right. with that drawn, draw the pupil. The pupil is simply an oval that is drawn with the bottom erased. Add eyelashes to the open eye, as well.

, Don't draw them all the way around; you only need them here-and-there.

, This can be a little challenging sometimes. You basically want to cross-hatch; going up and down, and then left and right. A few circles never hurt, either. Make sure the pupil is darker at the top than at the bottom. Add zig-zags around the original oval, skipping a few spots (but don't skip too much) and doing VERY short zig-zags around the eye-lights. Thicken the top and bottom lines of the eye.

, Draw it on both sides of the pupil. Color that with a dark shade; but with your regular pencil, not with your colored pencils! That part's not till later. You may need to darken those zig-zags from earlier.

, Shade this in with a medium tone. Shade the remaining space with a light tone.

, Don't pen where the shading in, as that will make it look bad. But pen the zig-zags, eye-lights, and everything else! Erase the penned parts when the ink is dry. But don't erase the shading.

, I chose reds and pinks, but any colors will work. Do the coloring one shade at a time; I start with the darkest part first. So erase the darkest shading (the part at the top) and add your darkest color. Repeat these steps with the other two shades.

, To do eyeshadow, put it in-between the top lid, and the line that's often drawn above it. (See the picture above. You should see hints of blue.)

Draw the nose.,
Draw the mouth.,
This step is quite straightforward.",How to Draw Anime Women," Don't rush into it and try to sketch the whole head without any guidelines or steps. The only thing you'll accomplish is making your anime woman's head look awkward and alien-like.;
, You're going to connect the circle up to this dot, but don't rush ahead to this step just yet.

, This will give the face a fuller look, rather than it just being completely round. If you examine your own face, your face only really starts rounding off at the chin. It would be rather weird if your own face only just passed the forehead and then rounded off!

, This is a woman's face, so the drawn lines should be soft. The chin shouldn't be too pointy; instead, round off the chin slightly. If you want, you can also add  a soft indent about halfway up the face, for the eye socket.

, You don't have to add guidelines, but it will make drawing in the face a lot easier. Simply draw one line down the center and then two lines through the middle of the face, leaving a gap between these two lines big enough to draw in the eyes. The nose will go just under these lines and the mouth beneath the nose. The ears should go on either side of the head, in between these lines. Don't draw in any detail on the ears yet; only draw a slight oval shape.

, In anime women, the neck is usually slightly narrower then the head. For this step, draw two very slightly curved lines coming down off the head.

, For this step, draw two curved, slanted lines off either side of the bottom of the neck. Each of these shoulders should be about the width of the head. After you've done this, you can add in a collar bone if you wish, which is merely two lines slanting inwards into the body, where the shoulder and the neck meet.

, Leave about a centimetre down from the shoulders (enough room for the arms to start nicely at least) and draw two slightly curved lines coming in. This will be the top of the torso.

, For the hips, stop going down and gradually start going out. The hips should be wider on the woman than they would be on a drawing of a man, and the shoulders should be less broad as well. Draw in a mark for the groin so that you know where the legs are going to start.

, This step isn't too difficult––two curves slanting outwards from the chest will do. Don't draw them as circles, or keep them confined the body space you've drawn out, or have them going inwards. Instead, draw two arcs slightly jutting out of the body and curving into the chest.

,, For the thighs on the legs, begin to slant in until they aren't wide. Don't be afraid of how long or short the legs are; just try not to make them too long or short. You want them to in proportion to the body. Once they've slanted into a reasonable size, you can start on the calves.


Never draw the legs or arms as noodles. If you look at your own arms and legs, there is a very distinctive shape to them, they aren't just straight.

, For the calves, start slanting outwards. Try not to make the points too sharp though. Once you've slanted out a little, come down in a nice curve for each leg and end in an ankle. Add a triangle for the foot.

, You can add triangles for the hands for now, as well. If you want, you can draw two lines coming out of the thighs and slightly into the calves for knees.

, Make sure the clothing doesn't sit directly on the skin, and add some nice creases here and there.

, Girls often have longer hair, but short hair is also fine. There are many different styles you can do including but not limited to:


Ponytails/pig tails
Plats
Buns
Flowing hair
Curls
Wavy hair
Short hair
Really short hair.

, As stated above, the eyes go in between the two guidelines you added earlier, next to the ears. There are many different ways to draw female eyes, but in general they tend to be softer. For this tutorial, draw an arc. Draw an oval attached to the top of this arc and a line underneath for the bottom of the eye. Draw another oval inside of the previous one and a little circle in it for sparkle. Shade in the second oval and draw in a little line for the eyelid and lines for the eyebrows.

, This goes just below the eyes and doesn't need much detail. Merely draw a little curve or tick and add a dot for the nostril if you wish.

, This is just a line with a little line curving in or out beneath it, to add depth.

, Using your lineart pen, go over the lines and make them bolder. Color in. Then, using a dark pencil or lineart pen, you can shade using crosshatching or other methods. You can also add any minor details you might have missed before, such as adding fingers and toes to the triangles on the calves and elbows, or detail in the ears.

",How to Draw Anime or Manga Faces3," You can adjust this line to get different face shapes for different types of characters.

, Again, your eyes will vary depending on the character you're drawing. Girls/young children/heroes/protagonists' eyes tend to be larger while boys/ tomboys/adults/ and antagonists have narrow eyes; but it's really up to you. Eyes are one of the most important features of manga, they say a lot about the person and their mood. Drawing the eyes narrowed shows thoughtfulness/ anger, drawing them bigger and rounder with bigger pupils shows surprise. Eyes that are drawn wide open with small pupils shows fear.

, A straight or curved nose, a small mouth. Boys noses are bigger: when showing happiness they're usually high up and rounded, slanted eyebrows show anger, upwards slanted eyebrows show surprise etc.

, This is the fun part! Anime/manga hair is very unique and you can make it however you want.

Keep in mind that fabric resting on a sphere will have a different form than fabric resting on a cube. Whenever you're in doubt, just think of what lies beneath the fabric.;
, Stereotypically, female bodies tend to have an ""hourglass"" shape to them, with long legs and large breasts. This isn't the case in real life - everyone's body is different! However, regardless of the girl's shape, a female body differs from a male body in the sense that a male body is more angular and straight, whereas a female body has a tendency to seem less sharp.

, Clothes are influenced by the body's size and shape. For example, if a small girl were to put on a sweater several sizes too big for her, it would be evident as the sleeves would be hanging off her hands. Chests can also influence the clothing - a large chest size could cause a shirt to not fit properly, requiring a larger size for the girl.

, When clothes or clothing material wrap a person's body they will always show marks to indicate they are covering an object with multiple shapes, movements, or attachments. These marks are what we call wrinkles.

, The type of material used influences the appearance of clothes. Some clothes are soft and thin, others thick and rigid.

, Other clothes are downright unique in form and texture. The material may also vary depending on the time or purpose it was created, such as for historical outfits, modern, futuristic, or fantasy clothing.

, Clothes don't just hang down flat - they move with the person wearing them. Depending on the type of clothing, the material it's made of, the action the girl is doing, and whether wind should be moving it, the clothes will be shifting and wrinkling in different ways.

, Consider what you are capable of drawing as well as how you would like your anime girl to appear. Also keep in mind the personality of the character - a girl who's meant to be dark and mysterious isn't going to be wearing a bunch of frills!

, Depending on the type of school your girl goes to, she may wear different types of uniforms.


The stereotypical sailor fuku that's often seen in anime, also called the sailor uniform or seifuku, consists of a white shirt with a skirt, with a sailor collar over the shirt and a tie of some sort. In anime and manga, most sailor fukus are depicted as having rather short skirts - however, the skirts of the sailor fuku's uniform are actually typically knee-length or longer. They tend to be depicted as shorter because many girls in Japan roll their skirts at the waist, giving the appearance of a shorter skirt. These are most often seen in middle schools, although some high schools use them.
High schools in Japan are gradually switching over to a more Western-style uniform, which consists of a plain shirt, a skirt or pants, a tie, and a blazer. Again, the skirts aren't short - they're rolled up!
Gym uniforms tend to be solid color, usually something such as black or navy blue. The summer gym uniform typically consists of a pair of gym shorts and a short-sleeved gym shirt. The winter uniforms will usually be longer and have a jacket. Depending on the school, the uniform may have the owner's name written on it in kanji or katakana. However, katakana is usually reserved for students with foreign names.
The shoes the students wear outdoors are usually a pair of black or dark brown loafers. However, Japanese schools require students to change into uwabaki, or a pair of soft slippers meant for indoor wear. The appearance of uwabaki differs from school to school, but they can have the appearance of typical slip-on shoes without rubber soles.

, ""Casual clothing"" can be defined as something that you would typically leave the house in, or see most people walking around in - for example, jeans and a sweater in the winter months, or shorts and a T-shirt in the summer months. However, remember that certain people have certain styles, and some styles, such as Lolita fashions, would not be considered casual clothing.


Does she wear cutesy styles? Styles considered ""cute"" are typically clothes that are ""girly"" colors such as pink, purple, and baby blue, with ruffles or frills, as well as bows - whether on the clothes or in her hair. If she's wearing a skirt or dress, it will likely puff out to the sides a bit.
What if your girl is fashion-oriented? There are many different outfit types you could draw her in! Short dresses and skirts, shorts, cardigans or jackets, cute designer T-shirts - the possibilities are endless. Just make sure that everything she's wearing looks good together, or else she'll look more like a fashion train wreck than a fashionista!
If she's a tomboy, you can put her in something like a pair of dark jeans and a video game T-shirt can work wonders. Keep in mind that most tomboys don't put a lot of effort into their appearance, and most of them don't wear skirts.
Try a baggy look. If your girl is a gamer, somewhat of a loner, or just values being comfortable over looking nice, try dressing her in baggy clothes, such as an oversized sweater or shirt and a pair of loose jeans, or an oversized skirt with a baggy top. Shoes that go well with this type of style are brand-name sneakers, such as Converse or Vans.

, Unless your girl just sleeps in her clothes, there are many different ways to have her dress for bed.


Things such as nightgowns tend to hang straight down, especially if the material is somewhat thick. Large shirts tend to do the same, but will move differently than a nightgown - nightgowns will ""spin"" more than shirts do.
Regular pajamas are essentially pants and a shirt. Depending on the type of pajamas, the shirt could be long-sleeved, short-sleeved, a button-up, a flannel, have a print on it, or just be plain. Generally, pants tend to be either short or long, and longer pants are more likely to have prints on them than decorations like ruffles.

, Formal clothing in the West often refers to things such as dresses and tuxedos. However, in Japan, formal clothes are things such as kimonos and are covered in another section.


Typically, anime girls wear longer dresses when they're trying to be formal but not traditional. These dresses can be like ball gowns or wedding dresses - which all vary in types!
In Japan, not conforming is typically frowned upon, but if you want, try drawing your girl in a tuxedo.

, Traditional Japanese clothing are clothing such as kimonos and yukatas. Make sure you know the difference between all the clothing before drawing the clothing, though.


Be wary when drawing a kimono's folds. The kimono is always wrapped left side over right, unless going to a funeral!

, Not everyone likes to conform to society - so why should your girl conform?


You can try the classic ""emo"" or ""scene"" looks. These looks are typically noticed from their artificial and teased hair, along with certain clothing fashions - scene has colorful clothing, while emo clothing is usually limited to things like black, gray, and deep shades of red. Some girls that follow these fashions also have piercings!
The lolita fashion is fairly well known for its large, frilly and lacy dresses, along with its many accessories such as parasols and the over-the-top girliness it portrays.

, Most people don't fight in over-the-top, revealing armor. However, if that's what you want someone to wear, feel free to draw it! Just be aware that the armor needs to be able to move with the girl as she's fighting, so it shouldn't be tight enough to constrict her movement.

, Suitable accessories include hair bows, bangles, rings, necklace, gloves, socks, and more. Anime girls often have a watch or a talisman of some kind. Cat ears are a common addition too. Also, if you're going for Japanese style, a fan is always nice.

, While hairstyles and clothing are not the same thing, a hairstyle can make an outfit look quite nice. For example, a girl who wanted to look ""cute"" could have her hair in pigtails, whereas a girl who just wanted to do something simple may have her hair in a loose ponytail. Mix things up!


Even if your girl doesn't have her hair styled, her hair doesn't have to be boring. She can have wavy hair or curly hair, or be wearing hair accessories such as headbands, barrettes, or a knitted beanie.
If you want, try giving her an unusual hair color. In anime, the hairstyles rarely ever conform to reality, and color is no exception!

Shade In.",How to Draw Anime Eyes1," Then draw another shorter curve opposite the first. Add slightly curved lines down from each end. This is the basic eye. The top curve is typically thicker than the bottom. Notice the mini-line at the end of the top eyelid. This is a characteristic of the anime style.






;
, Add another small circle on the bottom corner. Typically, the top shine is larger than the bottom one. You can add more white spots if you like.








, If your eye is on the left, make the lashes point toward the right side, if it's on the right side, make it point toward the left. Eyelashes in anime are more bold and less feathery than realistic drawings. You can also add smaller lashes on the bottom curve if you like.









Also, draw a thin line slightly above the thick curved line you did in the beginning. This indicates the eye socket and gives the eyes more depth.

, Top to bottom. Dark to light. In the middle of the eye, shade a darker circle, for the pupil.
