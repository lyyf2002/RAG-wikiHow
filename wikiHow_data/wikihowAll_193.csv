Color in your drawing.",How to Draw a Sailor Fuku1," You should already have the sketch of the girl you want to be wearing the sailor fuku. Keep in mind that if she's posing in a somewhat odd manner or if she's in motion - for example, running - the uniform isn't going to hang straight down.


Keep in mind the thickness of the uniform. Japanese schools often have two sailor fukus - the summer uniform and the winter uniform. The summer uniform is much lighter and is usually worn with a short sleeved shirt, whereas the winter uniform is made of a thicker material and tends to be longer in skirt length and shirt sleeve length.;
, The shirt of the sailor fuku often comes down to the hips and will usually have either long sleeves or short sleeves.


If you have difficulty drawing the shirt, break it up by shape - the part of the shirt covering the torso is rectangular, as are the sleeves. Depending on how the girl is posing, you may have to use other shapes to connect the sleeves to the torso of the shirt.
The material of the shirt is close to that of a formal blouse - it won't cling to the girl's features.

, The sailor fuku's skirts are usually knee-length or longer, and is often pleated with medium-sized knife pleats, which are easily drawn with simple rectangular pieces.


The heaviness of the material will affect how the skirt moves. The summer skirt, for example, is lighter than the winter skirt and will move with the breeze easier.
The skirt is high-waisted and does not have an elastic waistband; it zips up the side, and it closes with a hook-and-eye loop. If the skirt is oversized, the girl would have to wear a belt underneath her shirt.

, Typically, the sailor collar is a piece of the uniform that goes over the neck of the shirt and hangs a few inches down between the shoulder blades, rarely lower.


The collar extends out to just before the shoulders. It's quite wide.
The front of the collar can be created with triangular pieces and then be rounded out; the back of the collar is usually just rectangular.
Sailor collars are often depicted with stripes on them. These stripes frequently wrap around the outer ""ring"" of the collar, and sometimes are on the center piece as well.
Some uniforms have ""cuffs"" on the shirt sleeves that are the same material as the collar. These also tend to have stripes on them.

, The tie for the sailor fuku is often less of a tie and more of a handkerchief, which creates the classic knot that's often seen in anime and manga.


The classic tie can be drawn with simple rectangular shapes or with teardrop shapes.
If you're more advanced at drawing, try out drawing the wrinkles in the tie near the knot.

, The uniform's socks are usually knee-length. The shoes are dependent on whether the student is indoors or outdoors, and are somewhat rectangular.


The outdoor shoes are typically a pair of black or dark brown loafers.
The indoor shoes are a pair of ""slippers"" that can vary in their looks. The most common look for the indoor shoes are white canvas shoes with rubber soles. They are kept in lockers or cubbies at the entrances of schools, and are not to be worn outside. Make sure you don't draw your girl wearing her indoor shoes outside, or vice versa!

,, The sailor fuku is often depicted as either white and navy with a red tie, or black and white, depending on whether it's the summer or the winter uniform. However, not all schools stick to this color scheme, and some schools have differently colored collars or shirts. And if you want, color it however you wish! It doesn't have to be realistic.

"
"
Alter the sleeves of the blouse.,
Draw a cardigan, instead of a blouse.,
Sketch different types of ties.,
Change the length of the skirt.,
Test out different types of socks.,
Tweak the stripes on the sailor collar.",How to Draw a Sailor Fuku2," The sailor fuku blouse typically only has two types of sleeves - long and short. However, even with just those two types of sleeves, there are different ways the sleeves can be designed - with buttons, with or without cuffs, slightly puffed, or plain sleeves. Some girls also choose to wear long-sleeved summer shirts and roll up the sleeves, either to the elbow or to turn them into short sleeves.

The shirt can be either long-sleeved or short-sleeved if it's the summer uniform. Typically the long-sleeved shirts are saved by the girls for when it's somewhat colder, such as in the spring months, although they can be worn with the sleeves rolled up. The sleeves of the short-sleeved shirt can be somewhat puffy or be buttoned at the cuff.
The winter uniforms do not have short-sleeved shirts. The fabric of the winter uniform is also heavier, so a slightly oversized winter uniform would have somewhat baggy sleeves.

, Some girls choose to wear cardigans over their shirts, which tend to have longer and somewhat thicker sleeves (though not as thick as the winter uniform itself). Common color choices for the cardigans are tan, white, and occasionally black., The classic tie seen in many anime series and manga stories isn't the only option! There are many varieties of ties and ways to knot them - such as various bows or Western-style ties., Not every school has skirts of the same length, and even skirts from the same school can be of different lengths! Skirts can be longer or shorter than knee-length.

Short skirts resembling miniskirts are common sights in anime and manga. (These come from rolled-up skirts, so the waistband would be thicker due to the extra fabric.)
Extremely long skirts reaching down to the ankles are key traits of sukeban (female delinquents), an archetype that doesn't appear much in the real world now. However, before long skirts were associated with delinquents, some schools had uniforms that used long skirts.

, While most sailor fukus are paired with knee-high socks, some aren't. Drawing shorter socks (such as ankle socks) or stockings are creative ways of altering the uniform.

Stockings are a common choice in the anime and manga world, especially with tsundere characters. To draw these, just raise the height of the socks to above the knee.
Loose socks are common in manga and the kogal and gyaru fashion.

, Typically, the collar has at least one stripe on it, although two stripes is also a common sight. Some schools also have small stripes on different parts of the collar - for example, in the back corner of the collar, but this is not often seen.

If a uniform's collar has stripes on it, as well as collared cuffs on the sleeves, the cuffs may be seen sporting stripes, too. Don't forget about those!

It really depends on how big you want to make your eye, but the one we'll be drawing takes up a good portion of the paper. (We'll erase these lines later, so sketch them lightly!);
, After you draw the shape, erase the rounder area, and a small sized portion of the corner of the eye. It will look like the image.

, This is your eye's iris.

, The circle need not be perfect.

, Because this is a female eye, we want to make the eyes really pop by outlining the eyelids. We can assume this is some sort of eyeliner, or not, as you wish. Let it thicken as it reaches the outer edge.

,, Don't let them touch the pupil, or the circle, but draw them remaining within the iris. The top area of the eye will be darker, with a gradient effect going on as we descend.

, This adds realism. At the outer edge, the lashes are the most thick and as the lashes start to shape in the center, the face the center. With the lashes occurring on the left side, the become shorter and flow more to the left. The lower lash line will have less lashes, but still follow the same idea for both the top and bottom lashes.

, This gives the expression in the face a questioning look. The eye, believe it or not, is fine the way it is, if you prefer it to be more lighter. But if you want to take it all the way, keep on reading.

, We want the top of the eye to be much darker than the lower section. Travel downwards with your pencil, slowly applying less and less pressure. You should barely be using your pencil at the end. Doesn't that look different?

, I lefts a small squiggle on the eyebrow white, as to highlight it. Try this too!

, (Erase any lines we did in previous steps.) By layering the textures onto the outer edge of the eyelid, I attempted to create a smokey eye effect. Really darken the upper half of the eye, for a more dramatic look.

Realize that it might simply be that the person judging your work thinks everything is anime.,
Look for the tell-tale signs that your work is anime: Big eyes, small nose, shiny or large hair.,
If your characters have large eyes, keep them.,

Instead of drawing a generic anime face shape, think of the shape of the face you want.,
Get rid of that teeny-tiny nose.,
Take note of the clothing.",How to Avoid Drawing Anime Style," If so, try telling the person that what you draw isn't always anime, then show them an anime drawing and a non-anime drawing and point out the differences.;

, They're expressive, which is useful in all cartoons.

, Just watch people reacting with their natural habitat. Make notes of how their face is shaped and how their hair has grown. Draw quick sketches if it helps.

, The person you looked at had a square chin? Draw that. Were they ageing and wrinkly? Draw that. If you are drawing a cartoon then make it less lifelike.

, You can take two paths: (in my opinion)look at your subjects nose and just draw it simplified or just get rid of the nose all together. Some cartoonists draw eyes without pupils, some have no ears!

, If you just want cartoon-like clothes, try to stop drawing so many creases and folds. If you want realism, add more.

Take a piece of paper.,
Draw a circle.,
Draw another circle inside the main shape in the corner where you want your light source to be coming from.,
Draw an oval in the centre of the main shape for the pupil.,
Starting at the top of the main circle, and avoiding the highlight and pupil, shade from dark to light, to the bottom of the eye.,
Add additional highlights, if wanted.,
Using a black outlining pen or a felt tip, outline the eye, leaving the shading without an outline.,
Stand back and admire your work.",How to Draw Manga Female Eyes," Make sure you have a flat surface under your paper, otherwise your drawing might appear shaky and messy. If your work surface is rough, try placing a pile of paper under the sheet you're working on to create a smoother surface. Newspaper or a magazine will also work, although the ink from the newsprint might transfer to your drawing paper, so consider having an additional paper layer over the top of the newspaper.;
, Then draw a curved line over the top and on the bottom. This will form the main shape of the eye. Don't worry, your circle doesn't have to be perfect. It should really be more of an oval.


In manga, the female eye tends to be drawn rounder than the male eye, so the circular shape is very important.

, This will be a highlight.

, Just make sure that the highlight is on top, so that it obscures the top right part of the pupil. Shade the pupil in black.


The pupil shapes vary in manga, so find what works best for you but be sure to include the highlight. Sometimes artists have more than one highlight.

, You may want to use a thicker pencil for this step.

, Bear in mind that highlights make the character look more feminine and child-like.


Even though in real life, some males can have equally luscious eyelashes, when drawing the female eye, it is commonplace to emphasize the eyelashes by making them long and thick, as a sign of femininity.
Female manga eyes tend to have a lot of ""shine"" added to them in contrast to the duller male manga eye. Add some extra sparkle to the pupils if wished.

, Erase the pencil lines, again leaving the shading.

, Now try the eye facing the other way, so that you can put a pair of eyes together and continue with the rest of your female manga drawing.

Copying is better, doing so then you have a concept of what you drew. Find a simple character on a manga you like or on the web. More possibly head shots, Make sure they have relatively easy to draw hair. Fan art can be just as good as the originals. Practice drawing the pictures you have found, so you can develop a ""feel"" for manga style.









Things to note:


Eye Styles: This varies greatly, not just between manga, but also between characters in the same series. Eyes are a very expressive feature in Manga, and a character's eyes can tell you all about them.

Proportions: Manga style is all about manipulating proportions ,your character may be anywhere from three to eight/nine heads tall. Compare to a normal human figure, which is generally six or seven.



, Draw the lines for where arms/legs will go and their positioning. Draw the circle for the head first, a line for the spine, a line for the shoulders (a little below the head, so there's a neck), a line across for the hips. It may be easier to draw circles for joints . You're drawing a stick figure. This step is to block out the proportions and figure out what your character is doing; Standing? Sitting? A heroic pose?









More things to note!

Don't feel too worried about your proportions being messed up, more practice then! Usually you can go on and copy more pictures OR copy a page from your favorite manga. They can guide you on how to get an ""active"" drawing.
One day you will realise a style,a way you WANT to draw,a way where the characters look right to you and everybody else. Practice hard for that day to come.



, Add weight and depth to the various parts of your stick figure and you must do it well.










Head: Indicate which way it's facing with a line, and then add the chin and cheekbones. Remember that the chin may be very pointy depending on your style. Shorter cheek and round chin indicates cuteness.
Chest/Torso: Block it in with a circle, or a simple prism - more rectangular for guys, more triangular for girls. Make sure that with girls, the waist is thin, flaring out into rounded hips; while for guys, the shoulders are much wider, and the hips are narrow.
Hips: Can be indicated with a sphere/circle.
Limbs: Should be blocked in with ovals or cylinders, with circles/spheres for the joints.
Hands and feet: Can be left simple for now, though you might want to indicate their positions.

, Still don't worry about details for now, but clean up your lines, and generally just make the figure clearer. A kneaded eraser can come in useful here.








, Start drawing in the clothes, making sure they fit the form of your character. Shonen styles character will have fancy heroic clothes,comedy style has carefree or strange clothes draw the hands and feet, and fill in the, eyes, nose, mouth, hair, etc.








, Erase any other guidelines, and make sure you know which ones you want to keep. Again, this is one place a kneaded eraser comes in handy.








, Practice over and over. Once you are confident,start reference with other popular manga on paneling and story. Then good luck with your manga!

They can help make outlining and drawing on the computer easier. Set up about 4 layers (you can add more later).

, There are different types of anime eyes, however, they all have a shape to them that makes it identified as anime eyes. Search for anime images so you can get an example of what they look like, and use it as a reference. Use a fairly light color to sketch, as you are probably going to outline it in a dark color, and it will contrast. Your sketch does not have to be neat, just neat enough so you can trace over it.

, Use black to outline your eye, making it as neat as possible. You can choose to use the bezier tool, which would give you clean curves, freehand it, or both.

, If you're using the layers properly, only the sketch will erase, and not the black outline.

, Then, use layer 3 to color in the white part of the eye. Use a slightly blue gray to color the shadow the top eyelid casts down.

, First use a base color, and then use a darker color around the edge and in the shadow; the top right/left,(or wherever the direction the light is coming from, see example). You can choose to blend it in, or not. Then, take a lighter version or the base color and apply it diagonally from the shadow.

, Draw your pupil using a dark color, if you did not include it into your outline. Then, add your glint to the eye by using a very light color close to white where the shadow is. Congrats, you're finished!

Try not to overdose your drawing with multiple bones and such., Draw a nose starting to emerge out of the oval of the head of the wolf you've drawn beforehand, and bumps (paws) on the bottoms of the feet. At this point you can even go as far as dividing up toes. This will tend to look awkward if your anatomy structure is wrong, in which case you will need to edit it so it looks right. This is where references come in handy., If the animal is snarling, begin to add elements to depict this. For hair detail, you can tilt your pencil at an angle, and then began adding streaks of nice lines that mimic fur. Some lines darker in areas where shade is present., Erase all the stray marks you added before, that are no longer needed., Go wild!

, Draw four horizontal lines and a vertical line. These are the guides for you to draw the brows, eyes, nose and lips.

, Notice that there are six slanted lines sketched on the feature outlines. These slanted lines are more detailed guidelines for you to know where the exact positions of the features will be drawn. The ears’ guidelines are connected to the line to eyebrows, line to the eyes and line to nose.

,, Normally, people draw necks that are just enough to carry the head but drawing Son Goku’s design is quite different because most of the male anime character designs were drawn with a slender and tall appearance. Since he is, apparently, the strongest anime protagonist of all times, he possesses a muscular body that emphasizes his strength.

"
Learn the basics first.,
Create a mind map of your ideas about the character's appearance.,
Design your pony with its very own hairstyle.,
Think of a backstory.,
Come up with the friends and relatives.,
Create a Cutie Mark for your pony.,
Choose a name.,
Add some personal features.,
Ask friends for some feedback.",How to Create an Equestria Girl," This includes the body structure/anatomy of your pony. For example, what the shape of their head, body and legs will be.
, Some examples are tall, short, muscular, slim or maybe paunchy. Once you've got the main features, try having a deeper understanding of your pony's appearance, such as its eye color and eyelashes., Keep it unique, and don't base it too much on canon ponies. These are ponies that were officially published by the original MLP producers.

First, think of a hair color. Bright colors like yellow, neon blue or hot pink are usually used for cheerful, optimistic characters.
Sketch different hairstyles on your ponies. Figure out what the length of their hair will be, and throw in some bangs! Creativity and imagination will help you get through this step. Don't forget, you can add some highlights onto their hair to make them stand out a bit.

, Make some dot points of their achievements and best moments.

Don't make it too clichéd. Overdoing your character's backstory can ruin other people's interest of them.
Don't worry if your character isn't the daughter of the Princess Celestia or the cousin of Rainbow Dash. A basic, original character can go a long way!
Be creative with this. What has your character done that they're really proud of? Simple things like 'Got into finals of the Nationwide Spelling Bee' can really make your character have their own, true past.

, Take the time to name and develop each of them as well. Each friend doesn't need a bibliography about their life. Maybe just jot down how they met your character and some of their character traits., Re-read the backstory you have made for them. What is their personality? Most cutie marks show what that pony is specifically talented at or what their hobbies and personalities are like. Take the Spelling bee example. This pony can have a pencil and a lined paper for a cutie mark! Imagine what colors would look good against the color of their body., Ponies usually have names that relate to their personality or traits. Fluttershy is shy, Rainbow Dash is fast.

Note that the names don't have to be exactly what your character's appearance shows. It's true that Rainbow Dash has rainbow hair, but with Twilight Sparkle, she doesn't literally 'sparkle' 24/7.
Again with the Spelling Bee example, the name of that pony can be 'Espella Wright' Espella can relate to the word, 'Spell' as well as Wright with 'Write'

, These include scars, piercings, tattoos, etc. How about some favourite things they like to wear? A scarf, necklace, hairclip., It's always good to hear other people's opinion! Enjoy designing your own home-styled ""Equestria Girl""!"

Decide on your machine’s abilities.,
Plan your machine’s appearance.,
Decide on your machine’s pose.,
Sketch your killing machine.,
Draw the final copy.",How to Draw Killing Machines," Its appearance will depend on its talents and strengths. Make a short list of all its preferences and style of killing. For example, does it kill quickly or slowly? Does it prefer to chase down its victims in play daylight or creep around in the shadows? To draw a realistic killing machine, you must decide what type of robot you want.
, Since you are aware of its capabilities and killing style, you can base your robot off of your list. Jot down the weapons and type of armor it will have, as well as any significant features that you want it to have. Decide whether you want your machine to appear human or not.

Be realistic. If your robot prefers to sneak up on its victims, add lighter armor for stealth, as well as concealable weapons. While heavy, chunky armor might seem cool, it will only slow it down and make the killing machine appear less believable.

, Once you have planned out its appearance and style, it becomes easier to sketch your robot. For an action-filled drawing, decide on a pose that will bring out your machine’s style. It will also help your art look unique., Make a rough draft of its appearance and pose. For practice, draw the armor and weapons separately before attempting to place it on the machine. Use references to help your machine appear realistic, but avoid directly copying from images., As soon as you have finished practicing with sketches, start drawing the official piece. Add shading and highlights in the correct areas in order to bring out the killing machine’s beauty. If desired, ink the entire drawing for a professional appearance. You can also color it with coloring pencils or scan it into your computer to digitally color it.

It is recommended that you make a copy of your drawing or trace it onto another piece of paper. That way, you can experiment with coloring without ruining your piece.
Use menacing colors that will intimidate viewers. Experiment with different shades and combinations for the best look.

",How to Draw Kobe Bryant2," Notice that the bottom of the oval looks like an upside down trapezoid while the top of the oval shape is rounded.

, The top line MUST intersect the midway point of the oval shape. The lowest line should be placed at the bottom of the chin. After drawing the top and bottom lines, add two EVENLY SPACED lines between the top and bottom line. At the end of step two, you should have THREE evenly spaced segments between the top and bottom lines (refer to the picture).

, The top four map out the corners of Kobe's eyes, while the bottom two map out the corners of his mouth. Lets look at their relationship. Notice that these dots are leaning towards the right side of the oval. This is due to the fact that Kobe's head is slightly turned. Also, take a second to notice the distance in between the two eyes is equal to one eye length. Finally, notice that the middle part of the space designated for each eye, will line up with the outer corners of the mouth. Now, draw in the six dots.

, Notice that the iris is partially blocked by the upper eyelid.

,


In this step, make the bottom of the nose by drawing three connected, upside down arches. Do not worry about the bridge of the nose yet. After you make the bottom of the nose, draw the shape for the upper lip...... The upper lip looks like a squished McDonald's logo (picture the golden arches squished).
Add the bottom lip. It is similar to a banana shape. Notice that the bottom lip is thicker than the top lip. Now that we have the eyes and part of the mouth done, take a second to notice the perfect square that is formed when you connect the points from the middle of the eye and the corners of the mouth. Make adjustments if you do not have this perfect square.

, Like the bottom lip, these shapes are very similar to banana shapes. They will help us shade the nose later.


Now add in the ears. Due to the fact that Kobe's head is turned; it appears that his left ear is smaller than his right. This, of course is not the case, but draw what you see.
Draw in the lines, stemming from the chin, as well as Kobe's dimple lines.
Draw in Kobe's hairline. Again, due to the turn of his head, you will see more hair on the right side.

Mix your ingredients.,
Don't use a match when lighting it, use fuse to light the powder from a safe distance and enjoy the explosion.








",How to Make Flash Powder," Contact the ATF online, and download their application to be a licensed fireworks maker.









This will make sourcing and purchasing the ingredients much easier, as most U.S. businesses will not risk selling the ingredients, especially if they think you are using it to make a bomb. The liability for them is too great to risk it.












;
, There are U.S. federal restrictions on these items. For example, aluminum powder is limited to two pounds a year without a ATF High Explosives Manufacturing license, and a potassium perchlorate could get you investigated by the Fed and/or the Consumer Product Safety Commission. They mean business.









Search for fireworks supply houses or hobby chemical retailers for sources













It may be necessary to grind the aluminum powder in a strainer in order to work out the lumps.













The powder must be 400-600 mesh (measure of how fine the powder is).














, You can purchase commercial anti-static sprays, or make your own from a 9:1 mixture of water and fabric softener.










Do not omit this step. A static discharge can ignite the powder, resulting in an explosion that could ruin your whole day, or your whole house, or send bits of you flying into the neighbor's yard.













The correct ratio of potassium perchlorate to aluminum for any quantity of flash powder is 7:3.To make a 5g mix (perfectly suitable for a small bang), weigh out 3.5 grams of the potassium and 1.5 gram of the aluminum.ie a 7:3 mix

, Do not stir, crush, press, or stand upon the mix. Though most flash powders are not impact sensitive, it is very easy to make a very, very unstable mixture.









The best way to mix the powders together is to pour all of the chemicals into a ziploc bag, spray it with anti-static spray, and slowly mix the chemicals by shaking the bag. However, there is some debate as to the safety of this method, so if you do use it be sure to spray the bag with anti-static spray in order to reduce the chance injury.













A common method for commercially prepared flash powders is to combine the two powders in a capped plastic bottle and roll it gently between your hands to mix the powders.

Set in the ground and light.",How to Make Sugar Rockets," Buy roughly 13 mm (½ inch) diameter PVC piping from a home improvement store. Cut the pipe into sections, as long as you'd like your rockets to be. 7.5–10 cm (3–4 in) rockets are a good place to start.


Do not replace this with a metal pipe. Sparks from the metal could ignite your rocket and cause a premature explosion.;
, Find a smaller PVC pipe, that just barely fits into your rocket sections. Cut this into short sections, about 6–12 mm (¼–½ in) long. Cut through each section — this allows you to expand the ring outward for a tighter fit. Apply PVC cement to the inner edge of the larger pipe, at one end. Place the smaller pipe inside the larger one, pressing it outward to form a tight fit. Repeat on the opposite end with a second retaining ring. Clamp and wait for the cement to cure, according to label instructions., Purchase unscented clay cat litter from a pet store. Keeping it dry, grind it in a coffee grinder or mortar until it becomes fine dust.


Alternatively, use quick-set cement.
Eventually, you'll be making a cap on the opposite end as well. Grind extra and set it aside.

, Stand each pipe on its end on a stable surface. Fill each one about ⅓ full with the cat litter dust. Tamp the litter vigorously with a wooden dowel or spool that fits snugly into the pipe. This should compress the litter into a hard, clay cap.


Make sure the clay forms a hard surface above the retaining ring. The ring's job is to prevent the clay from sliding out, allowing the rocket to build up more pressure before the cap blows out.
If the litter crumbles and refuses to pack, dampen it slightly.

, Sugar provides the energy that will give thrust to the rocket once burned. Check the ingredients list before buying: most powdered sugar contains a little corn starch, but this will not significantly affect the rocket.If it contains any other additives, look for a different brand.


In some areas, this is sold as confectioner's sugar or icing sugar.
You can start with granulated white sugar and turn it into powdered sugar with a blender, coffee grinder, or spice mill.

, This chemical, KNO3, will provide oxygen to allow for fast, prolonged combustion. Buy this as ""stump killer"" at a garden supply store or home improvement store. Some brands of stump killer contain other ingredients, so check the label to make sure it is 100% KNO3.


You can sometimes find potassium nitrate at pharmacies, farming supply stores, or online chemistry supply stores. For best results, look for it in powdered form.
Keep the potassium nitrate and the sugar in separate rooms.

, Buy a new coffee grinder and label it ""potassium nitrate."" Place it on a cleared counter, far away from all sugar and combustible materials. Fill halfway with potassium nitrate and grind for about 40 seconds, rotating the grinder to make sure all the powder hits the blades.The finer the powder, the more evenly it will mix with the sugar.


Never grind sugar and potassium nitrate in the same grinder, even in separate batches. This can cause a fire or explosion.
You'll need 65g (2.3 oz) for this batch, about a handful.

, Once made, the rockets are at risk of combustion if they come into contact with heat, a spark from a metal object, or a flame. Ideally, you should make the rockets close to the area you plan to set them off. Choose an open area with no passersby. Even when intentionally set off, these rockets can damage surroundings or people when they return to earth.


Check local law for regulations concerning rockets or fireworks.

, Soon, you'll be mixing the two ingredients together over heat. There's always the risk of explosion or fire during this process. Reduce the chance of injury with the following setup:


Remove all clutter and flammable materials from a spacious area, preferably outside. The floor should be made of dirt (with all weeds removed) or concrete.
Set up an electric hot plate or deep fryer with a thermostat control. An electric stove or other heating element without an exact temperature setting adds significant danger.Make sure there are no sources of sparks or open flame in the area. Even metal objects can be dangerous.
Keep a large container of water nearby. A fire extinguisher may not extinguish burning propellant., There's a significant chance that the propellant mixture catches fire and explodes violently. Wear gloves, a face shield, and thick clothing that covers all exposed skin. Do not wear any clothing made from synthetic materials, which can melt onto your skin.


Use a face shield that protects your head and hair as well.
A leather apron and long leather gloves are recommended.

, Using a kitchen scale, measure 65 grams (2.29 ounces) powdered potassium nitrate, and bring it to your heating station. Bring the kitchen scale to the powdered sugar. Measure 35 grams (1.23 ounces) powdered sugar in a new container and bring that to your station. Pour both ingredients into a saucepan or frying pan that you don't plan on using for any other purpose.


For best results, make a double boiler by placing a deep saucepan into a larger pan filled with oil. This heats the propellant more evenly.For your first project, consider using 60g (2.12 oz) potassium nitrate and 40g (1.41 oz) sugar instead. This is much easier to make, but less powerful., This will slow down the firing, which decreases thrust but reduces risk of exploding the rocket prematurely. Mix 15g (0.53 oz) baking soda into your 100g (3.5 oz) of propellant. Use a wooden or silicone implement to stir.

, Place the container of sugar and potassium nitrate on the electric heat source. Heat at 193ºC (380ºF), staying as near to this temperature as you can the whole time.Using a silicone spatula (never a metal one), stir gently to combine the two ingredients and distribute the heat. Failure to stir frequently can cause an explosion. Stir over heat until the whole mixture turns into a thick, light brown paste, similar to peanut butter. This can take up to an hour, but a batch this size will usually be ready in 20–30 minutes.


If the sugar turns dark brown, remove the mixture from heat. Too much caramelization will make the propellant less effective.

, As soon as the hot propellant mixture is ready, pour a little into one of your prepared rockets. Immediately tamp it down with a snug-fitting dowel, making sure there are no air bubbles. Pour more propellant and tamp down until there's roughly 2.5 cm (1 inch) of space left in the tube.If the mixture has cooled too much to pour, transfer the material with a wooden implement.
Leave space between the propellant and the retaining ring.

, Create a second clay cap on top of the propellant, just as you did the first. Tamp down firmly to create a hard, non-crumbling cap. This should extend beneath the retaining ring and lie even with the end of the rocket.


Again, you may use quick-set cement instead. Allow cement to cure before you continue.
At this point, the rocket will move with extreme force if the propellant ignites. Stand back while tamping. From now on, treat the rocket with extreme caution and avoid pointing either end toward yourself.

, It's time to turn the cap you just made into a nozzle, which will create thrust by expelling high-pressure exhaust. It is possible to ignite the rocket by drilling, so use extreme caution. In your fire-safe work area, drill the nozzle as follows:


Clamp your rocket in place and stand to one side. Never put your face in front of the rocket end.
Choose a small drill bit, to make a small hole in the center of the rocket. A smaller hole leads to higher pressure, but this may blow off the cap prematurely. You may need to experiment to find the best results.
Use the slowest drill setting to keep temperatures low. Drill through the center of the clay cap. Stop every few seconds and withdraw to reduce heat and wipe off stuck particles with a dry cloth.
Drill until you penetrate the top cap.

, After you've penetrated the cap, you may wish to create a hollow core in the propellant. This will increase thrust by providing more surface area to combust.Push a dowel or aluminum rod into the propellant, pushing about halfway along the rocket's length.


Your propellant may be too viscous or too hard to create the core. That's fine; the rocket will still work.
Remember, do not put your face in front of either end of the rocket.

, Thread a cannon fuse into the hole you just drilled. Leave plenty of fuse outside the rocket for safety.

, Tape or glue a long, sturdy, wooden skewer to the outside of the rocket. Attach it near the nozzle, with most of the skewer extending beyond it.


You should be able to balance the rocket (just above the ground) on a finger placed just above the nozzle. Move the stick or switch to a stick of a different size until you can balance it., Plant the stick firmly into the ground so the rocket points upward. Confirm that the stick and rocket are stable. Warn everyone in the area. Light the fuse and step well back. Congratulations! You've launched your first sugar rocket.


Preferably, move behind a safety wall after lighting the fuse.

Punch a hole near the bottom of an empty can.,
Insert a 4-inch fuse into the hole at the bottom of the can.,
Put in black or smokeless powder.,
Cover the hole with a disc-shaped piece of tissue paper.,
Gently fill 1/2 to 2/3 of the can with flammable powder.,
Light the fuse, and run back 30–50 feet (9.1–15.2 m).",How to Make Fireworks," You'll want a can that's between 12 and 28 ounces. Most soup or large coffee cans work just fine. You need to make sure that the inside of the can is completely smooth, otherwise the contents of the can won't be propelled smoothly upward.The hole should be about the size of your fuse (usually about 2-3 millimeters).;
, It's easy to find firework fuses at a hardware store or hobby store. The Visco fuse is one of the recommended fuses for home firework displays.


Put the can on the ground once you've attached the fuse.

, You can find this at Walmart or make it yourself. Make sure that the black powder is spread evenly across the bottom of the can. You need enough of the powder to completely cover the bottom in a layer about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) thick.


The best way to figure out how much black powder to use is to find out how much 0.1 ounce per square inch of container bottom. For example, a 6 inch (15.2 cm) diameter will yield about 2.8 ounces.
To make black powder: spruce/pine/fir (SPF) wood, or ""whitewood"" is considered the best wood for making charcoal, and has long-lasting spark trails. You'll need a backyard firepit, or inside fireplace to burn the wood. Fill a stockpot with SPF wood and put it on the fire. It'll take 2- 2 1/2 hours for the wood to reduce to charcoal. You'll know it's done when the flaming gasses stop coming out of the lid. Allow to cool before crushing (usually overnight). One the charcoal is crushed, you're ready to use it., The tissue prevents the flammable powder from mixing with the black powder, which slows the black powder's burn rate. The black powder has to burn quickly so that it builds up enough force to force the flammable powder into the air

, Although this type of firework is named after the milk substitute Cremora, it's actually quite difficult the find nowadays, so people use a variety of substitutes. Make sure it's well sifted and not clumpy.


As substitutes for Cremora, you can try Coffee Mate, Kroger brand creamer, powdered sugar or even a fine sawdust, or wheat flour.
The flammable powder should work as long as it is sifted very fine. If it's clumping, sift it through a wire mesh kitchen colander before using it. That will help break up the large granules and clumps.

, The bigger the can, the farther back you're going to need to be. It's also best to test out a few of these before you show all your friends. That way you'll have a better idea how they work and what changes you need to make and will be less likely to have an unfortunate accident or have anyone get hurt.


Make sure that you put it away from flammable items like dry grass or wood, or your house (or your neighbor's house).

Pour rubbing alcohol into a small bowl.,
Soak a cotton ball in the rubbing alcohol.,
Squeeze out the cotton ball.,
Wash your hands.",How to Make a Fireball1," To start making your fireball from a cotton ball, first pour around ¼ cup (60 ml) of rubbing alcohol into a small bowl. Keep in mind that higher concentrations of rubbing alcohol make a larger and hotter flame, while lower concentrations make a flame that is not as hot but is easier to hold.70% rubbing alcohol is a high concentration. If you can’t find a lower concentration, dilute it to make a mixture that is one part water, 2 parts 70% rubbing alcohol.;
, Place one cotton ball in the bowl of rubbing alcohol, turning it over to soak the entire ball in the liquid. Wear disposable gloves or kitchen gloves if you have them so that the rubbing alcohol does not get directly on your hands., After soaking the cotton ball in the rubbing alcohol, take the cotton ball out of the bowl and squeeze it to release excess alcohol. This ensures that the cotton ball won’t drip rubbing alcohol, which is dangerous when you set it the cotton ball on fire., If you are handling the cotton ball with your bare hands, set the cotton ball down on a plate or counter. Wash you hands with soap and water and dry them to remove traces of rubbing alcohol. If your clothing got splashed by the rubbing alcohol, change any garments that have the alcohol on them as an extra safety precaution.If you did use gloves to soak the cotton ball in the rubbing alcohol, take off the gloves, making sure not to transfer the rubbing alcohol to your hands.
Your cotton ball is now ready to be set aflame!

"
"
Take safety precautions.,
Gather supplies.",How to Make a Firecracker1," Any time you're working with a flammable substance it is extremely important to make sure you don't put yourself, other people, your property, and the natural world at risk of getting burned or set on fire. Plan to make the firecrackers outdoors so that you don't put your house at risk, and make sure children and pets are kept away from the area.









Set up a workspace well away from the house, work shed, and other structures on your property.
Don't work on firecrackers near trees, telephone poles, and other outdoor features.
It's best to set up on a concrete patio or bare dirt. Avoid working with explosives near dry grass or other plants that could catch fire.
Wear goggles to protect your eyes while working with firecracker materials.;
, Firecrackers are made with a shell to contain the explosive materials and a small fuse that you light to set it off. The following materials can be purchased from large department stores that sell ammunition and sporting goods.









One ping pong ball for each firecracker you plan to make.
Thick string, which will be used as the fuse.
A sharp nail and a razor to make holes in the ping pong ball.
Duct tape or another sturdy tape to patch up the hole.
Black powder, also known as gunpowder, which is available where ammunition is sold. It comes in small canisters. Before buying black powder, get familiar with measures you must take to handle and store black powder safely.
Nail polish, which causes the firecracker to make a louder noise.

Cut a shirt into a strip.,
Roll the strip of shirt into a ball.,
Fasten the ball with thread.,
Tie the string at both ends.,
Wrap thread around the ball.,
Secure the thread.,
Place the cloth ball in a bowl of rubbing alcohol.,
Transfer the cloth ball to a clean bowl.",How to Make a Fireball2," You can also make a fireball using a cotton shirt as a base, which will make a bigger flame. First, cut the cotton T-shirt into a 2 x 4.7 inch(5 x 12 cm) strip.Make sure that you are using a T-shirt that is 100% cotton. If you use a shirt that is only partly cotton, it will melt instead of burn.

, After you cut your strip, roll it to create a ball. Try not to roll it too tightly, or else the rubbing alcohol will have a hard time soaking into the fabric. Also try to tuck in any loose ends or edges to make a more regular ball.Keep holding the cloth ball in your hand after rolling so that it doesn’t unravel.

, Thread a large, sharp needle with cotton string. Then insert the needle into the cloth ball, piercing it all the way through the ball from one side to the other.Make sure that the string you are using is 100% cotton.
Hold the ball while you pierce it with the needle to make sure it stays together.

, After you stitch through the cloth ball, tie the cotton string at both ends. Stitching through the ball helps the cloth ball to keep its shape.Don’t break off the string, as you will keep using it.

, After you have stitched through the middle of the ball, take the cloth thread and wind it around the ball to help hold it together and keep its spherical shape., After you have wound the thread around the ball, insert the needle back into the ball and pull the string through the other side. Then cut the string and knot it so that it stays.

, Pour around ½ cup (125 ml) of rubbing alcohol into a bowl large enough to hold the cloth ball. Then take the cloth ball and place it in the rubbing alcohol, allowing it to soak for a few seconds. Use a spoon or other object to turn the ball over in the alcohol so that both sides absorb some of the rubbing alcohol.Do not get any rubbing alcohol on your hands or clothes.

, After you have soaked the cloth ball for about three seconds, use a pair of tongs or tweezers to transfer the ball out from the bowl with the alcohol to a new, clean bowl.


Make the transfer after only a few seconds so that the cloth ball doesn’t soak for too long. If the ball absorbs too much rubbing alcohol, it will become soaked and start dripping. This can be dangerous when you light it on fire.

"
"
Wash your hands.,
Find a clear, safe space.,
Hold the ball with a pair of tweezers or tongs.,
Ignite the ball with a fire source.,
Drop the fireball into your hand.,
Shift the ball from hand to hand.,
Put out the fireball.",How to Make a Fireball3," Even if you are fairly certain you didn’t get any rubbing alcohol on your hands, it’s best to wash them before you ignite the fireball. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. If any rubbing alcohol splashed on your clothes, it’s very important to change into new clothes.


Having rubbing alcohol on your clothes can cause your clothes to get set on fire.

, Don’t ignite your fireball in a cluttered space or around highly flammable objects like papers. Try to find an empty, neutral space like your driveway or inside a concrete garage. Set up a fire extinguisher as an extra safety precaution.


Review how to use the fire extinguisher before lighting the fireball.

, It’s not a good idea to set fire to the ball when it is in your hands. Instead, pick it up using a pair of tweezers or tongs and hold it out in front of you.Clear the bowl of rubbing alcohol away, as it could be a fire hazard.

, Use a fire source, preferably a long reach lighter, to ignite the ball. The ball should immediately be consumed by flames and become a fireball!, After you light the fireball, you have the option of holding it by the tongs or tweezers, or holding it in your hand. If you decide you want to hold it, drop the fireball carefully into your palm, making sure not to drop it on the ground.


If you do drop the fireball, you can try to scoop it up, or just stamp on it with your foot to put it out.

, Though it’s safe to handle the fireball, if you hold it in the same place in your hand, it will become very hot and may burn you. Instead of holding the fireball in the same spot, shift it between your left and right hand.Hold your hands away from your body so that there is no risk of the fireball catching your clothes on fire.
Remember not to panic. It’s safe to hold the fireball as long as you keep shifting it around and keep it away from your clothing.

, Whenever you are done playing with the fireball, close your hand over it. This should cause the fireball to extinguish. Make sure that the fireball is completely extinguished by running water over it. Then dispose of the ball."

Bore a hole in the ping pong ball.,
Make a second hole at the base.,
Make a fuse.,
Fill the ping pong ball with powder.,
Patch the fill hole.,
(Optional) Paint the firecracker.",How to Make a Firecracker2," Use the nail to make a small hole in the top of the ping pong ball. If necessary, you can use a hammer to help the nail puncture the ball.








, Use the razor to cut a slightly larger hole opposite the hole you made with the nail. It should be large enough to allow you to pour the powder into the ping pong ball.









Use a razor with a handle for greater precision. Be careful not to cut yourself as you wield it; the surface of the ping pong ball may be slippery.
If you don't have a razor, use a nail or another item to bore a few holes close together to create a hole large enough to pour the powder through.

, Cut a length of the string several inches long and thread it through the nail hole in the ping pong ball. Pull it through so that the base of the string hangs in the center of the ball, and the end of the string juts out from the ball by an inch or two.









If you have trouble threading the string through the hole, dip it in a bit of melted wax to create a hardened tip, then push the tip through the hole.
For a slower-burning fuse, dip the length of the string in candle wax or beeswax. When you light the fuse, it will burn more slowly before the firecracker explodes.

, Use a small spoon or funnel to fill the ball 3/4 full with the black powder. Don't overfill the ball.









Never smoke or light a flame while handling black powder.
Take care not to spill any black powder in your workspace. If you spill some, clean it up with a dustpan and broom and dispose of it safely.
As soon as you're finished with the gunpowder, close the canister tightly and store it in a cool, dry place away from flammable or combustible substances.

, Use a piece of duct tape to patch the hole, pressing down firmly to make sure it doesn't come loose. The fuse hole should not be covered.








, Use nail polish to paint the outside of the firecracker. Allow it to dry completely.








"
"
Find a safe outdoor space.,
Light the fuse.,
Set the firecracker down and walk away.,
Watch the firecracker explode.",How to Make a Firecracker3," An open concrete lot away from buildings and cars is the ideal place to use a firecracker. Do not set off a firecracker near people, houses, or any other structures that might catch fire.








, Use a match or a lighter to carefully light the tip of the fuse. Don't light the fuse at it's base, or the firecracker may explode prematurely.








, Don't linger close to the firecracker after it has been lit. Set it on a cool, dry foundation - not grass or another flammable material - and quickly walk several yards away.









DO NOT light the fuse until children, pets, and other people are at a safe distance from the firecracker.
Never place a firecracker inside a glass bottle or drinking glass. The glass may break, and the aftereffects could be very dangerous.

, It contains just enough black powder to create a satisfying crack and add an element of excitement to an outdoor party.

Protect your eyes and ears.,
Dress appropriately.,
Use only legal fireworks.,
Store them out of reach.,
Have water on hand.,
Keep children away.,
Set off fireworks only when sober and alert.,
Check official regulations.",How to Be Safe With Fireworks1," Get a pair of safety glasses and earplugs for each person who will be setting off fireworks. These can be found at any hardware store and some drug stores. Improperly used fireworks frequently cause eye damage and hearing loss--nearly 40% of fireworks-related injuries occur to the head area., Don’t wear loose clothing such as long skirts, jackets, or scarves, which can all catch fire easily. But do try to wear snugly fitting long sleeves and pants to protect from potential burns., Shop only at public fireworks stands licensed to sell fireworks. Legal fireworks will have a manufacturer’s label including safety instructions.If you’re unsure whether a roadside fireworks dealer is selling legally, ask an employee to see their license to sell fireworks in the state.


Illegal fireworks are typically named M-80s, M-100s, or quarter sticks. They resemble a cardboard coin tube with a fuse in the middle, and are usually red, brown, or silver.Never buy fireworks from a friend, or someone placing a public advertisement. Even if the items appear professionally made, they could be illegal or on poor condition.

, Until you’re ready to use them, keep your fireworks in a cool and dry place where children can’t get to them.Hot temperatures or damp air can damage the fireworks and make it more likely that they will malfunction.


Try putting away your fireworks in a cardboard box, above or in a high cabinet, or on a top shelf.

, Always have a supply of water nearby in case refuse, vegetation, or clothing catch fire. If you can’t find a safe area near a water hose, fill up several buckets of water and bring them with you to the site. To be extra safe, have a fire extinguisher nearby as well., Forbid young children to handle any kind of fireworks. Even sparklers are known to cause severe burns.Ensure that children, and any other spectators, stand far back (at least 50 feet (15.2 m)) from the area where you’ll be lighting the fireworks.


A 2005 study found that more than half of all fireworks injuries to children under 5 years of age were caused by sparklers., Being short of sleep, or under the influence of alcohol or other drugs can affect your judgment and coordination--two things you really need when setting off fireworks. The night before you plan to use fireworks, be sure to get as much sleep as you usually need to function properly. And before using fireworks, be sure to stay away from alcohol or any substances that tend to slow you down or make you feel tired.

, Do an internet search to learn about what types of fireworks, if any, are legal in your state, province, or country. If you can’t buy a certain class of fireworks in your state or province, it is most likely illegal to use that class of fireworks in your state or province.

Use fireworks outdoors only.,
Find an open area.,
Watch for dry vegetation.",How to Be Safe With Fireworks2," Most fireworks produce fire and smoke, which can burn or set fire to many interior surfaces, and cause suffocation in small rooms. Even garage areas are unsafe, since they typically hold containers of flammable liquids and motor vehicles, which can catch fire and explode if they come into contact with fireworks.

, A flat and wide-open area, with no overhead obstructions such as trees or buildings, will be best for setting off your fireworks. Try to choose an area as far away from residences as possible, to avoid bothering neighbors. And keep cars, gasoline tanks, and other containers of flammable liquids or materials far away from the area where you’ll be setting off fireworks., Don’t set off fireworks in an area covered in dry grass, or overgrown with dry weeds. These can easily catch fire if they come into contact with fireworks. For the same reason, never set off fireworks in a forest, which often has dry leaves and dead wood on the ground.


If there has been a drought in your region, check with your city government about possible restrictions or prohibitions for setting off fireworks.

Follow instructions on the package.,
Use longer lighting devices.,
Keep your head away.,
Be patient when a firework doesn't go off.,
Light one at a time.,
Do not hold lit fireworks in your hand.,
Stand back after lighting.,
Keep spectators away and upwind.",How to Be Safe With Fireworks3," All professionally made, legal fireworks should have igniting instructions on the packaging. Read these carefully, making sure each step is understandable. Take extra care to follow each step for less-typical fireworks such as tanks, boats, and pinwheels.

, Avoid using cigarette lighters or matches to light fireworks, since wicks sometimes emit sparks that can burn your hand if it is too close. Instead, light fireworks with a punk or an extended butane lighter that gives you at least 5 inches (12.7 cm) between your hand and the fuse. Light the fuse only at the very tip to prevent the piece from igniting too soon.If you are igniting fireworks in the dark, use a headlamp, flashlight, or other non-flammable light source to help you see clearly what you’re lighting.

, When lighting aerial fireworks such as rockets, repeaters, and mortars, do not lean over the top of them when lighting the fuse. Fuses have been known to malfunction and ignite fireworks immediately, without any delay. If this happens and your head is near the path of the projectile, you could suffer serious injury.


Never look into a mortar tube. Sometimes wicks burn unevenly and can ignite the shell after a longer-than-usual delay. Don’t approach the mortar or look into the tube for any reason after a shell fails to ignite.

, Wait at least 30 minutes before approaching any fireworks that don’t go off.Wearing utility gloves, place the unspent fireworks in a bucket of water.Don't try to re-ignite any fireworks that don’t go off soon after you light them., Never ignite more than one shell, rocket, firecracker or other fireworks at a time.They are designed to be lighted individually, and any attempt to light more than one at a time could cause them to malfunction.


For example, do not try to twist or tie fuses together, or light one rocket or mortar shell just after lighting another.

, Don't attempt to launch bottle rockets from your hand, or light and throw firecrackers. Always light any fireworks from a flat surface, or in the case of rockets, a pipe or bottle., Most fireworks’ fuses should be long enough to allow you to get at least 20 feet (6.1 m) away from the launch area. Staying any closer increases your risk of getting injured when the fireworks go off. Be sure to clear the area of obstructions, such as tree branches or rocks, that you could trip over when walking or running back from the launch area.

, Ask anyone who will be watching your fireworks display to stand at least 50 feet (15.2 m) away. And pay attention to wind direction. Sparks from live fireworks, or spent but still-burning rockets can be blown into spectators by winds. Be sure to position spectators where the wind will be blowing in the direction they’re facing.For example, if the winds are blowing to the north of the launch area, position the spectators to the south of the launch area.
Don't light fireworks during strong winds. If it’s too windy to ignite your lighter, it’s probably too windy to set off fireworks safely.

Remember to have fuse connecting everything together or have a store bought detonator for them to go off at the right time.,
Determine what is legal: Find out what fireworks are legal in your area.,
Find available fireworks.,
Create your show.,
Set up during the day.,
Wait until dark.,
Be prepared or else.,
Make a good show.",How to Set up a Fireworks Show,";
, Call your local police and fire station, as they will have the answer.

, Write down what fireworks you want to buy before buying them. Contact local stores to find out what fireworks they will be selling. Be sure to also ask the price of each item. Set an amount of money you plan to spend (this might be anywhere from £75 to £250 or about $150 to $500). Try to buy your fireworks 1-2 weeks before the event, so you know you are able to get them.

, After buying your fireworks, you need a rough plan of your show. Scope out your show area and draw a sketch on a pretty big piece of paper. After that put where your fireworks will be in the area. Remember that small items go in front and your biggest items furthest away from the audience. Draw several plans, one for each of your mini-shows. Give a copy to each of your helpers and go over it so they know what to do.

, You'll need a display area. Look for a flat, open area free of dry grass. Once you’ve found that, buy some cheap plywood and set it down on the ground. Figure out what you want your show to be like. You should only fire a few fireworks at a time, and this should last at least 2-5 minutes. Each mini show should have a variety of fireworks; for example, each show could consist of 2 smoke balls at the beginning, immediately followed by two different fountains spread out, then a few bottle rockets and at the end a rocket or two. Once you’ve determined what each show will consist of, put the fireworks back in boxes in the order of your show.

, Let it get fairly dark before letting your fireworks spark. Once you’re done setting up for your first mini-show, make sure the audience is at least 50 feet (15.2 m) back. Have two people light each side of the show in the order you made. Remember, if any fireworks do not go off, let them sit and then douse them with a full bucket of water. And remember, have fun!

, This may seem like overkill, but it can help to have a small butane torch on hand, there is nothing that kills a show like a dead punk. Also if using artillery shells (you will if you want a good show, keep all shells in locations shielded from sparks. If you don't, you could have a catastrophic accident on your hands. Also make sure artillery shells canisters are well secured, do not let one tip one over.

, Make sure you have distractors, These can be used to keep peoples eyes in the air as you light off something big. And lastly, go all out in the grand finale. Last impressions are the most important for a firework show.

Question as a creationist and contrast past events being compiled from rock formations, fossils and inconclusive ""Evolutionary Theory"" versus intelligent design in your understanding of creation by God.,
Examine—natural events in thousands of interdependent systems based ""on"" chance—or what?,
Consider some things that may be characteristics of provable, scientific information: Man-made or Natural, Impersonal, Observed or Tested-observationally and Non-dogmatic.,
Evolution has not been fully tested observationally by proved, repeated biological events; it is certainly a world view of some.,
Believe: If you believe in evolution (not a creator), then (a) something always has existed -- or (b) something apparently came from nothing, and:

Then order came from disorder;
Apparently life came from non-life (and non-life has no genetics or cell division);
Variation is from identical factors;
Intelligence came from no nerve system at all;
Morality from immorality, or from no values concept at all.

,
Conjecture about presuppositions of how can a minute nervous system (as a mosquito) be so all encompassing: was it comprehensive by chance, mere mistakes, accidental mutations, life force itself from and by that source: what source, was it nothing but a ball of hydrogen or undifferentiated mass of energy; what?

,
Look at whether mosquitoes and other tiny creature have millions or billions of interdependent cells that enable interdependent systems so proactive for life but would be formed with exquisite dependencies without any awareness or any plan or any formal sort of logic, really?

,Observe the unobservant processes of evolution that could not realize their own existence, but then are said to have originated life and continued, adding/subtracting by failures (mutations) of the previous genetic system, surviving to breed a new thing, multiplying and thereby passing on, logically, mostly defects of varying degree, combining in such agglomeration that death becomes almost a certainty before ever comes a chance to breed!,
Consider a non-directed process... need it be so?,
Ask yourself how some evolutionists can seriously propose that it was by multiple random failures and chaos that a lifeless, helical chain of chemicals strewn in space with neither semipermeable membrane nor cytoplasm, and, indeed, no cellular environment originated.,
Consider ""natural selection"" which is said to be essential for life and evolution, being due to ""pressure"" (coincidental stuff).,
Evolutionists may determine ponderous questions or accept them as concluded within definitions upon their impersonal, unmotivated theory -- value??,
Examine a limb or wing is presupposed to have started out as a tiny protruding bone or exoskeleton, which then grew out longer in nature.,
Realize that such ""construction"" is much the same case for any type of joint, such as for paws, hands, fingers, articulated joints, and the opposing thumb in more ""advanced"" creatures (""are we mice/or are we man?"").,
Research the few fossils that can claim to be a fossil of an ""in-between"" creature.,
Consider that even if there were intermediate fossils, that could allow for thousands of these life forms in fossils to be evolving at various stages for evolution.",How to Contrast Evolution and Intelligent Design From a Creationist Perspective,";
,


What about self-controlled flight of the smallest gnat or mosquito with amazing ""piloting"" skills—showing very interdependent activity: could that instinctual ability be by intelligent design. ""Was transmitting of instinct by chance?"" Creationists say it was intelligent design not chance.
Mosquitoes avoid imminent danger. ""What danger. Why react if by chance; why phobia, no reason, if no design?""
Precision use of senses for coordinated physical action, simple as crawling or walking or as organized as being coordinated with eyesight""Why is there seemingly quite purposeful actions like motility, travel, feeding, digestion, reproduction, etc. Could that be by purposeful design?"" It is to creationists.

, (These are some expectations of many who propose evolution as fact or theory).

, It is related to the mentioned presuppositions and seems nearly dogmatic. Evolution does not meet science's own standards of what has to be found in order to be highly verified data while considering other viewpoints.

,,,,, Are there no other choices? How can non-designed, intricate inter-dependencies at every level of life be intricately linked through mutual dependency — ""with there being absolutely no driving reason to do so""?, Ask yourself what, indeed, would be the chance of such a contrivance to survive genetically through the eons? How could it ever be possible that evolution not be immune to a sterile, ""random chaos"" driving mechanism? Evolutionists may argue that all non-directed, undesigned, purposeless features get passed on through succeeding generations (presupposing unplanned origins). Whether or not they are beneficial, as there is no awareness of the process by the genetic system, how would the unrelated parts of a body, leg and/or rudimentary brain now all be correlated, by independent mutations-- billions of ""failures"" of the previously existing genetic processes corrupted with deadly ""messes"" from day one. Is it not just as logical that all mutations would be passed on and precipitate a total failure and extinction due to the extreme harshness of the milieu of life? How would anything still be alive at all?

, But, natural selection includes, originally, reproductive genetics from totally non-living material without a reason or known process to begin to truly live with digestion and energy. Modern science hasn't done that (has not formed a functioning, genetic, living cell from basic materials that were not provided by a preexisting life), but ancient dust, water and random stuff could do so?
~ Realize that the thousands and perhaps millions of related, (prerequisite) processes had to exist in exquisite detail, simultaneously before that basic life's previously unplanned formation, could bootstrap its own creation. All spontaneously fleshed out (yet not knowing how or why). It then had to sustain itself all by spontaneous, undesigned/non-purposeful means. Yet, it had to exist successfully (having inadvertently been alive and reproductive by no known means or reason). Then its genetic plans changed, spontaneously, called mutation, ""ie: failure"" of a previous genetics, map/plan, that had worked (""and it was good"").


Study the pressure that brought us into modern life! ""It"" had selected, trillions of times, and ""it"" was good? That it is brainless, thoughtless mother nature: ""invented"" with no ideas; made genetic ""blueprints"" by anarchy, with no form of governance/not even kindergarten level skills, not even finger paint design capability. It just ""used"" sterile lava that had eroded into sterile, lifeless dust plus water, acids, bases, salts, static electricity. Dust, mother earth's chemicals were spilling all over, lifeless stuff, life-free watery, primordial-soup of ""sterile mother nature"" became life, with incredibly, interdependent processes. Life had to ""pre-learn"" self-maintenance, to feed itself, digestion, reproduction, making instincts before there were suggestions. Starting, basically from ""lava-dust soup"", in tidal pond or near warm water vents in oceans, primitive, chaotic stress, pressured to ""form life"". That's the stuff: you see how it worked, chance, from dust to dust; ashes to ashes...

,?, Then joints were mapped by genetics, formed for the upper and lower parts of a leg or wing, while growing longer -- eventually forming an extremity, whether scaled, feathered or furry or not. If that joint were even a little bit wrong or out of place there would be no success, extreme discomfort to the bird/bat/mammal... even if the joint could flex and move.

, In essence, this would require: a nervous system, high symmetry, mobility, balancing capacity and coordination.

, ""Do they clearly link to the next form."", ""Where are these stages to be as conclusive as many claim evolution to be...""

Open your mind to the idea that each crystal has an exclusive 'energy medicine' that can assist you in your life right now.,
Allow yourself to be intuitive to the process of choosing a crystal, instead of thinking too much about it.,
Be specific about your issue before choosing a crystal.,
Ask the Universe just before you are about to pick a crystal 'reveal to me directly, which crystal I need right now to help me (with this issue I am having / working through)'?

,
Let the crystal reveal itself to you!,
Use your hands to feel the energy of the crystals to know which ones you are more sensitive to.,
If you are buying crystals online and can't have the hands-on experience of feeling the energy of a crystal you might want to work with, simply write the name of several crystals you are interested in on pieces of paper.",How to Choose a Crystal That Works for You," Remember, the Ancients have known about the power of crystals for centuries!;
, So 'think less and feel more'!

, So take some time to write down the problem that you want some healing energy assistance with.

,, I know this sounds weird, but after you've asked your question, be open to the crystal you need in your life right now, being more profound than the rest, as if it's jumping out at you.

, You may feel energy pull from the crystals to your palm (like your hand becomes a magnet), this often means this is the right crystal for you.

, Put these in a box and pull out a paper at random. Whatever the crystal is you select, this is the one you will use first.

Make a list of things that interest you.,
Look at how you spend your free time.,
Pay attention to what you think about as you're falling asleep.,
See what piques your interest.,
Figure out what tugs on your heartstrings.,
Let yourself be more affected.,
Be less dismissive.,
Feel emotions instead of trying to escape from them.,
Work on strengthening your relationships with people.,
Spend time with other people who care.,
Go through the motions even if you don't really feel it.,
Be a joiner instead of standing on the sidelines.,
Care about yourself, too.,
Know when you should pull back.",How to Care," Maybe it has been so long since you've really cared about something that it feels like you've lost the ability. But no matter how deep your feelings of caring are buried, they're in there somewhere, and it's time to uncover them. To care is to ""feel concern or interest; attach importance to something,"" to ""feel affection or liking.""By that definition, who and what do you care about? Make a list of anything that causes you to feel interest, concern, or attachment of any kind.


Write down the names of people you feel attachment to—parents, siblings, friends, and anyone else who has a pull on your heart. If you think about the person often, and you'd miss them if they weren't there, you probably care about them. You don't have to love or even like them to care.
By the same measure, write down things besides people you care about. Don't write down the things you should care about, just the things you actually do. Maybe your life is better because you play soccer, or you can't imagine a world without Warcraft. Maybe you care about poetry, or you love a certain movie star. There's no limit to how long your list can be—write it all down, big and small.
Be honest with yourself as you make your list, and don't leave anything out. Maybe you've been conditioned to act like you're ""above it all,"" or to hide the things that make you tick. People will try to tell you what you should and shouldn't care about, but you'll have to learn to ignore them for the sake of your own happiness. And in most cases, sticking to your guns and expressing that you care will eventually win you others' admiration.;
, Still aren't sure what matters to you? Take a look at what you do with your time once all your obligations have been fulfilled. When your homework is complete, the workday is over and the chores are done, what do you usually do? The way you spend your free time can be quite telling. You probably use it to do something you care about.


Do you spend your free time calling someone for a long chat, texting your friends, or writing comments on Facebook? This might show that you care about social connections, staying in the loop, and strengthening your relationships.
Maybe you spend your free time working on your art - writing, music, painting, or whatever moves you. Or perhaps you spend it running, lifting, gardening, or cooking. If it's something you're doing of your own accord, you probably care about it.
What you read about or watch can also help you define your interests. For example, if you read world news every day, you probably care what's happening outside your local sphere. Even the TV shows you watch can point to what you care about. Look for common themes or genres you gravitate toward.

, During the day you probably have to talk over subjects that you don't care about very much. Between making small talk, trying to impress people, and discussing subjects related to work or school, you might be confused about what really drives you. If that's the case, pay attention to your thoughts during the time right before you fall asleep at night. During this private, uninterrupted time, your cares will probably rise to the surface.


Which people do you think about most as you're falling asleep? Whether thinking of them makes you feel good or bad, the fact that they're in your mind means you care about them.
Do you have thoughts about what you're looking forward to, or what you aren't looking forward to about the next day?
Sometimes cares take the form of worries. If you realize that right before you fall asleep you're worried about how you'll perform during tomorrow's presentation, you might be worried because you care so much about it.

, What situations, ideas, stories or concepts elicit a strong reaction from you? What makes you want to learn more, speak up, or help out? Paying attention to things that cause you to an urge to get more invested can help you understand your own capacity for caring.


For example, maybe the sight of your little sister being teased causes you to feel a burning urge to step in and protect her.
Or perhaps you learned that the river in your city is being polluted, and you feel moved to participate in a river cleanup or find another way to stop pollution in your area.
Less serious investments count as caring, too. Maybe you watched a hilarious stand-up routine and fell into a Youtube rabbit hole watching every routine the comedian has ever recorded, or you read a news story about a cat that saved its owner from a fire and clicked over to several more articles on the subject.

, When you care about something, you have an emotional response to it. It makes you feel happy, excited, nervous, guilty, afraid, sad, or something else entirely. You might be the type to have very subtle emotions, or maybe they're big and overwhelming. Either way, they're like signposts pointing to what you care about.


Depression has been described as feeling like you just don't feel anything or care about anything—you're empty.If this is how you feel, and you're trapped in a state of not feeling or caring, look into getting treatment for depression. With proper treatment, you'll be able to experience emotions and caring once again.

, Engage with the world and let it make an impact on you instead of brushing things off or being dismissive. When you acknowledge that something matters to you, you open the path to caring about it more deeply. Sure, it might be cooler to act like you just don't care. But when you ignore how much something means to you, you're losing an opportunity to gain wisdom from the situation.


Sometimes taking things personally might mean you have to be outside the norm. For example, maybe a group of people in your English class never do the required reading. They think it's ridiculous to waste time reading novels, and they sit in the back of class chatting and texting instead of paying attention. If you care about getting a good grade, and you see the value in studying literature, you'll have to be brave enough to do your work and pay attention in class, even if it doesn't win you points with your classmates.

, Are you sarcastic a lot? Is your default response to something new you learn usually dismissive or cynical? You aren't alone. But think about the most interesting people you know—the self-assured ones who know where they're going in life. They probably all share the quality of being earnest and positive when they discuss what they care about. Instead of trying to hide their passions behind a veil of sarcasm, they proudly display what makes them tick.


Don't be afraid to try new things. Instead of instantly dismissing something new to you, give it a chance to move you.
Instead of acting like you don't care about things, try talking proudly about what drives you. Frame what you care about as something to show off instead of something to hide.

, Caring doesn't always feel good. In fact, it can feel downright lousy, like when it comes in the form of guilt or sadness. But letting yourself feel deeply—even when you emotions are painful—is what caring is all about. As a reward, you'll have better relationships and be more engaged with the world around you.


For example, it might be tempting to ignore the feelings of sadness you have about your grandmother who is in a nursing home and loves when you come to visit her. But when you let yourself care, when you have the courage to deal with the sadness and go visit your grandmother, you won't regret your decision to follow your heart.

, Some of your most important cares are probably related to people in your life. Caring about people is what drives relationships forward and makes them fulfilling. Sometimes just spending more time with people close to you can influence how much you care about them. The better you get to know them, the more you'll care about them.


In romantic relationships, people often hold back emotionally because they're afraid of being hurt. No one wants to be in the position of caring more than the other person. Caring takes courage. It requires putting yourself out there, even if you're not sure what you'll get in return.

, You can learn a lot about caring by spending time with other people who do. Surround yourself with people who are caring and helpful, rather than people who are callous or self-centered. Watch how caring people interact with others and approach new situations, and emulate their behavior. Once you start caring, you'll find it comes more naturally to you.

, If you're really out of practice, you might have to fake it til you make it. Sometimes just going through the motions of caring will put you in the right situation to develop feelings about something until you actually do start to care. This isn't to say you should pretend to care about things just because other people do, or pretend to care about something you actually can't stand. But in some circumstances, it's OK to practice caring in hopes that you'll start feeling something soon enough.


Going through the motions can put you in closer proximity to something or someone you normally wouldn't have the chance to get to know very well. For example, maybe you don't feel very strongly about your next door neighbor, but you shovel her driveway when it snows, just to be nice. After awhile, the polite conversations the two of you have, which were sparked by your courtesy, could lead to a truly caring relationship.
Going through the motions can also help you learn more about something, leading you to care. You might think you don't care at all about biology, but you're doing your best in class so you can get a good grade. After studying hard and engaging in class discussions, you might find that the subject is actually compelling to you.

, It's really hard to start caring about something when you're watching instead of participating. Every chance you get to try something new or get more involved, try saying ""yes"" more often than ""no."" You never know where your positive attitude will take you. You might discover hidden talents and passions you never would have known were there.

, If you have bad self esteem, you might need to start your mission to care more by valuing yourself first. Caring about yourself means treating yourself with kindness and being concerned about the way your story ends up.


Practice self-care on a daily basis to keep yourself in good physical and mental health. Do things every day to help you feel less stressed out and more self confident. Many people find that simple things like eating wholesome food, getting some exercise and treating themselves every once in a while make life feel more positive overall.
Set goals and stick to them. Part of caring about yourself means caring what happens in your future.

, It's possible to open your heart too much and find that it gets swamped, abused or manipulated. Sometimes we feel the pain too much and want to help others without taking into account our own well being. It's important to know when to pull back a little. If you find that you're devoting all of your energy and time to something you care about, with little left over for yourself or other important things, it might be a good idea to devote less time to that particular obsession.

, If you are single you can skip to the next step, but if you have a spouse and children you will need their approval for you to go. You may prefer to leave them in your native land while you set things up for them in the foreign country, or you may want them to come with you so you can face the challenges together. Do not sugarcoat or rush your family into making this decision, and only go if everyone agrees to it.

, Make sure to thoroughly read up on the culture and customs of the place you will be going. Know what language(s) you may need to learn and what the popular religion of the region is.

, Local pastors in your area may agree to pledge money to help support you. Your denomination may also be able to provide funds to help you stay for a long period of time in your chosen foreign area.

, Unless you plan to work as well as be a church planter, you must have money to stay for any length of time. Even if you do plan to work, you will still need funds for the plane trip, baggage fees, a place of residence when you arrive, transportation, and church building. You will need to overestimate the cost of everything. Do not count on receiving donations, for many churches forget after several months. It is best to be self-sufficient, if at all possible.

, While you are saving money, consider the other things necessary to living in a foreign country. Begin taking classes to at least familiarize yourself with any foreign languages you will encounter. Learn basic, practical, and religious phrases that will help you thrive. Also think about what will happen to your home and car. Do what is appropriate to deal with these issues, whether it be selling most of your belongings or packing them up to put in a storage bin.

, Visit an ethnic restaurant  to get a taste of foreign fare. Try visiting a church of the predominant religion. Make an effort to learn everything you can so that you can accomplish your goal.

, When you feel that you have raised enough money to keep you in the field for at least a starter time or hopefully longer, you can begin your final preparations. Notify your distant family, go for a check-up at the doctor's and dentist's office, and pack all necessary belongings in a suitcase. Make long-term arrangements for any pets you have, or find out what is necessary for them to travel with you.

, Take a break and thank God for allowing you to make it this far in your journey of becoming a foreign missionary.

, As soon as you get out of the plane, find an ATM in the airport. You may live in a country that uses a different currency than the one you are used to handling. Make sure you know the exchange rates so that no one rips you off.

, Make sure your passport has been stamped in all the right places and that you have the correct visa. Know when you will have to come back for another one.

, Make sure the driver either uses a meter or work out the price before you get in the vehicle or get your luggage in the vehicle. Have the driver take you to either an available hotel or your pre-arranged house.

, Renting is a good option as long as you know the laws of the country you are now in and have a physical piece of paper you and the landlord signed in agreement to rent. If the house is big enough you might even be able to hold church in a spare room for awhile before purchasing a bigger building.

, If you live in the capital city or a large city, you should know the location of your country's embassy. Find the local market and learn where to purchase drinking water. Make sure you are polite and friendly, but do not hesitate to stand up to someone trying to rip you off. Dress a bit on the conservative side until you know how comfortable the people are with your native dress.

, If you did your research well and are interested in earning a living, try to find available work. Individual countries have their own requirements, and you will need to find out what sort of jobs you are qualified for.

, If you do not speak the language proficiently, you may need the services of a translator for any sort of gathering which you speak at.

, If you try and live a clean and decent life, in most cultures people notice. They will be intrigued by your foreignness and charmed by your attempts to learn about their culture. Try to keep your talk centered around God, thanking him for your good health, etc. Answer their questions honestly, and respond appropriately within your cultural situation.

, Let the Lord guide your every move until you have enough people to meet regularly every week. You do not have to meet on Sunday.

, Congratulations, you are now a foreign missionary.

, Whenever you become conscious of a negative thought passing through your brain, just pause that thought. You can even visualize as if there is a ‘pause’ button somewhere near to your right ear and just press that button and pause the thought!

, Replay that thought in your mind. Suppose the thought was ‘I don’t think I will win this contract,’ just replay that thought again in your brain. Here also you can visualize a ‘Play ‘ button next to the ‘pause’ button!

, While the thought is ‘paused,’ ask yourself, ‘Is this what I want?’ You will get an answer from your brain ‘NO.’

, Ask yourself, ‘what is it that I want?’ Then the brain will say, ‘In fact I want the contract to be won.’

, Reframe the need statement in the present tense as mind operates in the present. You can reframe this as “I am winning the contract, come what may,”

, Now you press the ‘Play’ button and hear the sound “I am winning the contract, come what may.” Replay this statement again and again and again. While you are driving to the client’s office to sign that contract, let this statement be played continuously in your brain.

Plan in Advance.,
Choose a Theme.,
Create a Logo.,
Diversify Activities.,
Include Down Time.,
Make Meals Fun.,
Rent a Projector.",How to Coordinate a Spiritual Retreat," The sooner you set your dates, the sooner you can encourage your community members to save the date.;
, Choosing a theme is the foundation for planning your entire event, yet there are almost unlimited choices. Consider your community, and what would be the most beneficial and timely topic. Then build your activities around this central theme.

, One way to unify the participants is to have t-shirts or some other item custom-made, which includes the name, logo and date of your event. This makes a wonderful (and relatively inexpensive) keepsake for attendees, and immediately helps to garner interest from future participants in next year’s event.

, Certainly, you will need some fun icebreaker activities to help participants loosen up and get to know each other. But it’s also wise to include activities that deepen the experience.

, In order to truly create a cathartic group experience, participants need “down time” for rest and unstructured recreation. Allow breaks to facilitate the development of social bonds, during which time participants can break off into impromptu small groups, participate in various sports, or simply spend time alone to reflect and sit with their thoughts.

, If possible, take measures to ensure that participants get the opportunity to enjoy meals with different people, as opposed to staying in their usual cliques at mealtime.

, For a truly memorable experience, rent a projector to help display inspirational images, to assist the speakers with visual aids, or to recap photo memories captured throughout the weekend.

Understand freemasonry basics.,
Be interested in character building and morality.,
Separate the hype from the truth.,
Contact your local Lodge.,
Accept an invitation to meet with the Freemasons.,
Begin as an apprentice.,
Proceed to the Fellow Craft degree.,
Become a Master Mason.",How to Become a Mason," Freemasonry was founded by men who shared a commitment to supporting each other in friendship, fellowship and service to mankind. For thousands of years, men have found spiritual and philosophical fulfillment as members of the fraternity, which still operates on the same core values. In order to become a Freemason, it is necessary to meet these requirements:


Be a man.
Have a sound reputation, and be well-recommended by your peers.
In most freemasonry jurisdictions, you must believe in a Supreme Being, regardless of your religion.
Be over the age of 18 years.;
, The Freemason motto is ""better men make a better world."" Freemasonry stresses honor, personal responsibility and personal integrity, and offers the following to its members:


Monthly or bi-monthly gatherings at Freemason lodges, which are often in churches or public buildings. In the UK most of the lodges are purpose built.
Teachings on the history of Freemasonry etc.
Encouragement to live for the good of all mankind, and ideas for practicing good citizenship and acting with charity and love.
An invitation to participate in the ancient rites of Freemasonry, including a handshake, the rituals of initiation, and freedom to use the Masonic square and compass symbol.

, Books like The Da Vinci Code have perpetuated the notion that Freemasonry is a secret society with designs on taking over the world. Hidden symbols are said to be scattered around Washington, DC and other cities. The truth is that Freemasons are not part of any such conspiracy, and people who attempt to join Freemasonry hoping to gain access to secrets are not approaching the fraternity with the right intentions.

, The easiest way to begin the initiation process is to contact your local Masonic, District or Provincial Lodge which is usually listed in the telephone book or it's probably easier to web search and say you are interested in membership. There are a few other ways to start the process depending in which part of the world you're applying to, it's probably best if you start locally. The process will start from there:


Find a Freemason. Many Freemasons proudly display the Masonic symbol on bumper stickers, hats, and clothing or ring. They are happy to talk to people who wish to find out more information.
Some jurisdictions require that potential members approach the brotherhood of their own accord, but others allow members to issue invitations. If you have been invited to become a Freemason by a known member, feel free to take the next steps.

, After your petition has been reviewed, you will be called to the Lodge for an interview with a group of Freemasons who form an Investigative Committee.


You will be asked questions concerning your reasons for wanting to become a Freemason, your history, and your character.
You will have the opportunity to ask questions about Freemasonry.
The Investigative Committee will spend a week or two contacting references with regard to your character and conducting a backward check. Alcoholism, drug abuse, abuse of family, and other issues may be grounds for denial. In some countries, this investigative process can take years.
The Lodge's members will vote on whether to accept you.
If you are accepted, you will receive and invitation to become a member.

, To become a Freemason, you must proceed through the process of obtaining three symbolic degrees. The Entered Apprentice is the first degree, and introduces candidates to the basic principles of Freemasonry.


Moral truths are impressed upon new candidates by the symbolic use of building tools.
Apprentices must become proficient in one catechism before they can move on to the next step.

, The second degree continues to instill in candidates the principles of their new membership, especially their close association with the arts and sciences.


Candidates are tested on their mastery of knowledge learned as an apprentice.
Candidates must memorize a second catechism to complete the degree.

, The Master Mason degree is the highest degree a Freemason can earn, and the most difficult.


Candidates must demonstrate proficiency in the values of Freemasonry.
Completion of the degree is celebrated with a ceremony.
In the US, the average time elapsed from the initial petition to the Lodge to receiving the Master Mason degree is four to eight months.

Learn the role of Baha'i Faith's Central Figures: The Bab, Baha'u'llah, and 'Abdul-Baha.,
Pray and meditate for guidance and strength.

,
Act on your conviction.,
Declare your faith by contacting the Baha'is in your area and tell them you want to be a Baha'i.,
Join a study circle.,
Strive to follow the Baha'i laws.",How to Become a Baha'i," Become familiar with the central principles by visiting , by reading Baha'i books, or by talking to Baha'is:


The purpose of the Baha'i Faith is to unite all the peoples of the world in one universal Cause, one common Faith. Baha'is believe that all humanity was created by one God and all are members of one human race.
To be a Baha'i means to follow the teachings of Baha'u'llah, the Prophet-Founder. Baha'is believe He is the Promised One of all ages, and that His teachings enable humanity to build the peaceful and prosperous civilization which has been promised in prophesies of many religions.
The Baha'i Faith has an administrative order including elected nine-member assemblies at the local, national, and international level.
Baha'u'llah has revealed laws that Baha'is are expected to follow. These laws include daily prayer and daily reading of Baha'u'llah's  Writings.
A key tenet is the independent investigation of truth; each individual is responsible to discover the truth for himself. This pertains to the process of becoming a Baha'i.
Contact Baha'is in your area and ask them to speak with you. You may ask what activities are in your area so you may participate in Baha'i Community life.
Join a study circle - a small group of people who gather to learn. Baha'is have these in many country and often follow a curriculum called Ruhi, which means ""spirit.""
Ask Baha'is for literature or buy books online, or check your library. Baha'u'llah and the New Era is a great introduction.;
,, If you have reached a decision to join, carry it out with conviction.

, The requirements for becoming a Baha'i include believing in the Bab and Baha'u'llah, and agreeing to abide by Baha'i laws. To vote and participate in the administrative order and to directly help build the Kingdom of God on Earth, one enrolls one's membership.


If they do not know you, the Local Spiritual Assembly may wish to ask someone to have a brief conversation with you about the Baha'i Faith to make sure you understand what your enrollment means.
In many countries, you will be asked to sign a card and provide your address and phone number to enroll. This helps the community keep track of who is a Baha'i and may be required by the laws in that country.
Enrolling in the Baha'i Faith is free; contributing sacrificially toward Baha'i Funds is a sacred obligation and privilege for every believer. The amount is left to the individual, is private, and will never be questioned.

, This is not compulsory but is a great way to learn more about living the Baha'i life. You may join a study circle before you decide whether to become a Baha'i. It is useful to start with Ruhi Book 1 which covers the importance of praying daily; and what is the soul and the afterlife.

, Baha'u'llah writes, ""The first duty prescribed by God for His Servants is the recognition of Him Who is the Dayspring of His Revelation and the Fountain of His laws...It behoveth every one who reacheth this most sublime station, this summit of transcendent glory, to observe every ordinance of Him Who is the Desire of the world. These twin duties are inseparable. Neither is acceptable without the other.""


Gradual changes to conform one's conduct to Baha'i laws is helpful. If a law is difficult or confusing, you may consult a Baha'i friend or ask the Local Spiritual Assembly for help.

Draw what you see.,
Draw as often as you can.,
Make a rough sketch.,
Elaborate on your sketch.,
Add touches of realism.,
What you need to start out.,
Keep your work.,
Try a timed gesture drawing.",How to Draw," Start with simple objects (like the classic bowl of fruit) or common objects and progress to more complicated subjects — an intricately shaped table, for instance, or people's faces. The better you get at drawing real-life objects, the better you'll eventually be at putting ideas on paper.


For example, let's say you get an idea for a comic book character. You can imagine every detail — the expression on their face, the emotion in their eyes, the pose that represents who this character is — but if you haven't been practicing with faces, eyes, and poses, you'll have a hard time drawing this character on paper in a way that matches with the image you have in your head.
Instead of going big or elaborate in the beginning, focus on the small and simple. Take a bowl of fruit, or a house, or a mountain range, and practice replicating these objects with just a pencil. Draw different versions of the same thing. If you're drawing a mountain range, for example, do a little evaluation of your first drawing. Figure out what's right and what's wrong, or have a friend tell you which parts of the mountain look unnatural or need improvement. Once you have a list of the things you can improve on, draw the mountain range again. This time, improve on the parts you didn't draw well the first time. If you want after a few weeks and your drawing skills improve, draw the same picture again. See how much you've improved!
Think of yourself as a chef. When a chef learns a new recipe, he often spends days or weeks only cooking that recipe. It makes for pretty boring eating, but he's able to perfect his dish by the end of the week. Don't get discouraged when your dish doesn't come out perfectly right away. It takes a while to get things right.;
, The more you practice, the better you'll get. Even when you're concentrating on something else but your hands are free (being on the phone is the perfect opportunity to doodle) take a piece of paper and a pencil and start drawing basic shapes.


Practice with basic, elemental shapes in the beginning. These basic shapes will form the basis of many harder shapes as you continue drawing. Mastering them will make your journey going forward more meaningful and productive.
Draw circles, squares, triangles, rectangles, etc. Challenge yourself progressively by making these shapes as perfect as possible. Then challenge yourself some more by drawing variations of a shape: different sizes of circles and squares, different kinds of rectangles and triangles.
With enough repetition (and crumpled sheets in the recycling bin), you should reach a point where you could comfortably draw most shapes. To heighten this basic skill, draw curves and curls as well. Try doing springs and spirals and various loops, curlicues and garlands, paying attention to the consistency of your curves.

, If you're drawing a tree, don't draw one leaf at time. Otherwise, it's easy to get caught up in drawing one section of the object and forget about the ""big picture"" so that you end up running out of room, or, more often, your drawing ends up looking unattractively imbalanced.


Use light, repeated strokes. Keep things loose, and don't worry about mistakes. You're trying to get the general idea right, not a perfect facsimile. Compare, adjust, and improve what you ultimately have.
If you're drawing a real object, cross check what you have on paper with the original object. Make sure that the sizes of the shapes relative to each other are as accurate as possible.
Imagine what you want the tree to look like ultimately, and make a light sketch with a pencil. You can draw an outline of your intended drawing, or you can draw its ""skeleton"" (as is often done with drawing bodies).
A great method is to imagine the basic shapes the object is made of. In other words, break the object apart in your mind. A tree, in most cases, is an oval or triangle centered on top of a cylinder. Draw both shapes in 3D so that you can fill in the details later, while maintaining the proportions you want.

, Use heavier/darker line to bring out the parts of the drawing you need, and use an eraser to take out the lines you don't need. Add details, bit by bit, making sure to frequently step back and look at your drawing as a whole to make sure it's coming along the way you want it to. Learn and experiment with several techniques, which can enhance your ability to express ideas through drawing.


Draw with shading. Shading means the differences in light and color. Think about the way the light hits an object and which parts of the object are light or dark as a result. This can add luminosity, intensity, and depth to a drawing.
Picture a bowling ball in the foreground and the sun, right as it's beginning to set, in the background. Since the sun is close to the horizon, the light is going to be hitting the bowling ball from a very low angle, as opposed to high angle (where the sun would be at around noon on a sunny day). This means that in order to capture the light hitting the bowling ball, you're going to need to shade the top of the bowling ball lighter than the bottom, because the sun won't hit the bottom directly.
Practice with the shadows. If you want to get very realistic drawings, study the way that light reflects from objects, including the shadows that it leaves. Shadows can be almost mirror images of the object, or they can be stretched out, diagonal, and distorted. Pay attention to the type of shadows that the sun makes in real life, and try to duplicate that in your drawings.

, Even if you ultimately want to draw cartoons or caricatures, you'll need to know what makes an object appear realistic in your drawings. If you want your drawings to appear more life-like, then mastering these practices is key.


Familiarize yourself with perspective. Perspective is the idea that things that are further away appear smaller, and things that are closer up appear bigger, very true. If you are drawing a large object (such as a building) or a complicated scene (such as a neighborhood), it's especially important to understand perspective, unless you want your drawing to appear cartoon-like. Focusing on perspective when drawing small, simple objects (a cube, a stack of books) is an excellent exercise in drawing.
Get to know proportions. Proportion is the way different parts of an object relate to each other in terms of size. Proportion can affect how realistic the drawing is perceived to be. Use measuring techniques like a grid method or tick marks for accurate proportions. Altering proportions — by exaggerating some aspects and minimizing others — can convey unique ideas, or represent a certain style of drawing. Characters in caricatures and anime, for example, have exaggerated eyes or proportionally large faces. Experiment with getting proportions of objects and people right before you turn them on their head.
Play with color. Color adds a different dimension to a piece. Contrast, blending, saturation, and color schemes make some drawings more lively, or more realistic, or abstract, depending on how the color is applied. If you're interested, start mixing watercolors and acrylics. Blend unlikely colors and see which new ones come up. Photocopy some of your drawings, play with different colors, and see how the end result changes depending on which colors you use.

, For the beginner, sketch paper will probably work best; very smooth paper will give you better detail, but ""toothier"" paper holds the graphite from your pencil better.


Pencils come in a scale of hardness, from ""hard"" pencils, like H, to ""soft,"" like 9B. Hard pencils are low in tones, which means the ability to go from light to dark. Soft pencils, on the other hand, have lots of tones, meaning the pressure you put on the pencil affects the lightness of the line. Try sketching with a 6B or an 8B, a relatively soft pencil, so that pressing down the pencil harder will create darker tones.
Once you're ready, try drawing with charcoal. Charcoal comes in a compressed stick or in pencil form. Harder charcoal produces a gray tint, while softer charcoal smudges easier. Use charcoal in the same way that you'd use a pencil. Charcoal, however, can be more expressive than pencil. Use it to capture sweeping gestures and motions, or use it to create deep shading. If you plan on painting a canvas, charcoal can serve as a great outline before you put paint to canvas.

, Make a place where you can put all of your drawings, or keep it all together in an art journal. Doing this will help you review your progress. The more you get used to drawing, the more you'll be able to see what your flaws are and determine how to correct them. Also, as you continue drawing, you'll develop your own personal style. It's always interesting to look back and see how your ability to express yourself has grown. Don't let yourself down. When you practice you can make it perfect.

, If you find yourself struggling with proportion, annoyed that your poses are stiff and worst of all making and mistakes that your conscious mind knows better not to do, this is a great way to break that cycle. Get a kitchen timer. Set it for five minutes. Choose a subject that's not going to move like a silk rose, something a little challenging that you're fond enough of it to draw it more than once. It helps if you really like the subject. Using a soft (B grade or 2B or 4B, any of the B pencils) pencil, try to sketch it within five minutes or two minutes. Set a specific time period no longer than five minutes. When the buzzer goes off, stop even if it's not finished. Try again on a fresh part of the page.


Each time you try to draw something within five minutes, you'll observe something different about it and concentrate. You'll be correcting mistakes without bothering to go back and erase them.
This method is especially good for drawing people since it's not hard to get a friend to pose for a two minute ""gesture sketch"" as opposed to making them sit still for an hour.
Once you have done gesture sketches of a subject, giving yourself a longer time like fifteen minutes will feel like you have forever to get it right. You'll probably finish before the time is up. This is very good practice for being able to draw outdoors when the light can change in half an hour.
Try drawing your cat or dog while it's sleeping in short gesture drawings. Two minutes is about as long as a sleeping animal holds still before it rolls over or moves in its sleep.
Try drawing something simple like a pencil. Things that are common and easy to draw. Practice the object you chose a few times until it looks right. Then, once you think it looks right, go on to a harder thing such as a human face.

Define ""single-minded"": It is an adjective meaning: 1) Determined 2) Having one overriding purpose or goal.,
Know that there are good forms of ""single-mindedness"" and bad forms.,
Practice the common methods and some not so common methods to develop your power of focus:


Creating the environment is step 1.",How to Be Single Minded," 3) Steadfast; resolute. Now let's define ""focus"". 1) The concentration of attention or energy on something. The opposite of this would be ""absent-minded"", ""scattered"", or perhaps just ""distracted."";
, Here's the difference.


The bad single minded: When one becomes so preoccupied with a task that they lose all grip with their daily responsibilities and accountability to others, this is obviously a form of self delusion. We often label these personality types as ""self-centered"" or ""self obsessed"", carrying a negative connotation. Often people that are mentally ill or mentally challenged will be seen doing the same movements over and over. This is hardly the ""single-mindedness"" we are after.
The good form of ""single-minded"" is the ability to block out distractions and erroneous thoughts in order to concentrate better. Your desire to become more single-minded will enable you to finish projects with more efficiency in less time.

, If it's a task where you are seated at a desk then you will need to clean the desk area and become more organized. At that time a new project starts with a ""clean slate."" Let's suppose you are trying to quit smoking. Create the environment to allow this to be possible. In other words on your quit date the house and car you occupy need to be ""smokeless"" in every way. No ashtrays, lighters, etc.
The power of ""intention"". This is a slightly different perspective than mere goal setting. Intention means on the deepest level figure out exactly what is you intend on creating, then affirming this to yourself and visualizing an approximate end result, i.e. being a non-smoker, finishing a work assignment, writing a college thesis, etc.
Set and setting. In other words ""where"" are you most likely be able to focus or accomplish your goal? With what external conditions around you are tolerable to your concentration abilities? For example if your intention is to be a non-smoker then you are more likely to succeed hanging out in a local gym, vs. the local bar. If you are trying to finish studying for college exams, you may want to create privacy vs. the kids running around and playing in your study space.
Set small steps and short term goals. Do this in writing in outline form. Breaking down the steps can help the mind from not getting overwhelmed.

Start by reading the epistemological works of Locke, Hume and Kant.,
After your research, it is necessary for you to take up a neutral position; to be unassuming and to leave behind all your previous beliefs of reality and knowledge.

Ask questions like, what is knowledge?,
Write down your thoughts in a notepad and try to find arguments that support your opinion and ones that disapprove.,
Continue this process.

,, How can we Know anything for certain?

, It is better to give your work to someone else, to find arguments to disapprove your opinion.

,, It is still necessary however to know the major schools of thought, these are:


Empiricism which states that all knowledge derives from the senses and not from God or reasoning, although reasoning can produce true belief.
Rationalism states that some knowledge can be derived a priori or through reasoning. It can also be innate or born with, such a thing is commonly referred to as intuition.
Constructivism which states that all knowledge is constructed in the sense it is determined by human perception, values and other socio-cultural reasons.
Skepticism is a school of thought that basically states that the external reality if there even is one is unknowable.

A posteriori knowledge is knowledge that is known by experience (that is, it is empirical, or arrived at afterward).

Draw a hollow circle with a light line.,
Choose a light source for this sphere.,
Begin shading.,
As you move towards the light source, fill the circle with less and less pressure, heavier on the dark area, lighter on the light area.,
Use your finger or a tortillon to blend the shading and add a shadow.",How to Draw a Shaded Sphere," You can use a compass or trace a round object or circular template to get a clean circle.;
, The light source in this example is on the upper left, somewhat in front of the page (or behind the viewer).

, Start opposite the light source and move inwards. The darkest area will be furthest from the light source. Create circles or partial circles of equal value (darkness).

, You can leave a round spot nearest the light source the color of the white page.

, Notice how the circle now appears spherical, with depth.

"
"
Gather the materials you need to draw the sphere.,
Trace your circular object on the paper.,
Choose where your light source will be.,
Fill the sphere with very light shading.Avoid pressing too hard with your pencil while you shade, as this is your first layer of shading.,
Smooth the shading with a cotton ball or tissue.,
Add more shading to areas of the sphere that the light source minimally reaches.Gently shade again around most of the circle, making darker shading on the sides of the sphere where the light source cannot reach.,
Repeat smoothing out the shading with a cotton ball or tissue.,
Darken the outer edges of the sphere, particularly on the bottom and opposite side of the light source.The light source cannot reach these areas, so naturally, they should be darker.,
Smooth the darkened shading again.Maintaining a smooth-looking sphere is important in order to help it look realistic.,
Make the crescent edge opposite the light source the darkest.This is the final shading step, creating the core shadow.,
Rub your cotton ball or tissue over the dark crescent at the bottom to smooth it one last time.This will help to blend the core shadow into the rest of the sphere.

,
Clean up the edges of the sphere by erasing any smudges that escaped the edges.",How to Draw a Sphere1," This is a basic method for drawing a sphere, so minimal materials are needed.Sketch pad or paper
Pencil
Cotton balls or tissues
Circular object;
, You can use a small bowl, a glass, a mug, or another object with a circular shape or base.Tracing the circular object allows you to focus on shading the sphere rather than on learning how to draw a perfect circle.

, Once you decide the angle from which your light source will come, draw an arrow toward the circle from that direction.


You will later leave an untouched spot on the sphere, below that arrow, to signify the highlight from the light source.

, You will add additional layers of darker shading in later steps.


Leave the circular or oval-shaped spot untouched, below where the arrow points from the direction of the light source.

, Gently rub over the light shading, taking care not to smear the graphite out of the edges of your circle.Remember to leave your highlight spot untouched, so also take care not to smear graphite into that area.

,


This shading is called the mid-tone. Around the middle of your sphere, you should have about medium tones of shading.

, Again, take care to avoid smearing the highlight spot and smearing outside the edges of the circle.,


As you get further from the light source, the shading should get darker. However, they should not be as dark at the space directly below the sphere.

, Use your cotton ball or tissue to do this.

,


Shade the border moderately dark, and taper it into a crescent shape before tapering off on the other side. Keep this darkest area of shading close to the bottom edge of the sphere; it should be no more than ½ centimeter in thickness.

,, You might also have stray line marks that went outside the edges. Take care not to erase anything within your sphere."

Prepare your materials on your desk or table.,
Place your egg cup upside-down on the paper.Keep it close to the middle of the page, if possible, to give yourself enough room on all sides.,
Trace the outline of the egg cup with a light line.,
Decide the direction of the your light source.Your light source will come from either the top left or the top right.,
Mark a light guideline, with a ruler, from your light source to a spot about 1 centimeter inside the circle.,
Draw a small oval shape around the point you just made 1 centimeter inside the circle.,
Place your egg cup over the circle so that the opposite edge of the light source can just be seen.This refers to the bottom edge of the circle opposite from the light source.,
Trace the curved edge of your egg cup from one side to the other in a light outline.,
Repeat Steps 7 and 8 above, moving closer to the middle of the circle, three more times.You should now have four eclipses, made by the egg cup, on the bottom edge of the circle opposite the light source.,
Freehand a few more mid-tone outlines on the side of the circle close to the light source.At this point, the egg cup is too big to make smaller mid-tone outlines.,
Shade the bottom-most eclipse as darkly as possible.This is the eclipse that is dedicated to being part of the core shadow, so it needs to be dark as you can get it with your pencil.

,
Shade the proceeding eclipses gradually lighter shades.As you work your way upward, toward the highlight oval, each eclipse should be somewhat lighter than the next.,
Blend the tones together with a blending tool, a cotton ball, or a tissue.",How to Draw a Sphere2," There are several things you will need to help you draw a sphere with this method, so be sure to have everything within reach.Sketch pad or paper
Pencil
Egg cup
Ruler
Blending tool, cotton ball, or tissue

,


Remember that one side of your sphere will have the core shadow, which is the darkest part of the sphere, where the light source cannot reach.

, When you lift the egg cup, you should be left with a perfect circle on your paper., The opposite side of the light source is where the core shadow will be.


For a shadow that emerges from the left side of the sphere, your light source should be in the top right corner. Conversely, for a shadow that emerges from the right side of the sphere, the light source should be in the top left corner.

, Lightly mark a point when you reach the 1 centimeter mark. Then, draw an arrow in the corner down toward the circle, showing the direction of the light., That point is the center of the highlight, meaning that the interior of the oval will not be shaded later., Aim to leave about ½ centimeter between the original circle and the edge of your egg cup.

, The space you just created will be part of the core shadow of the sphere, the darkest part where the light source cannot reach.The shape can be described as an eclipse. Keep this in mind as you read further instructions.

, These eclipses should take up approximately half of the circle.


They will be used for mid-tone, or gradual shading of the sphere to help give it its 3D appearance.

,


Lightly draw them in freehand form, using the shape of the small oval (i.e. the highlight spot) and expanding outward until you have three increasingly large ovals.
It is acceptable to leave a gap between the largest oval and the middle-most eclipse from the egg cup.

,,


When you get to the highlight spot, it should be completely untouched.

, Work your way over the whole sphere, gently blending the different shading tones together so that they seamlessly taper from light to dark.Work from the lightest part—the highlight spot—to the darkest part to avoid pulling led from darker areas into lighter ones.

Collect the materials you will need to help you draw a sphere.,
Set up your spherical object as a model.Place it on the table or desk in front of where you are sitting, and be sure that a light source is hitting it from one side.,
Draw a picture plane around the edges of your paper.This is a simply a border that sits about 1 centimeter in from the edges of your paper.,
Sketch the boundaries of the sphere.,
Indicate the horizontal and vertical axes within the boundaries.,
Compare the width and your height of your axes.,
Draw the contour of the sphere using the boundaries you made in Step 4.,
Sketch transitions from one plane line to the next to make curves.,
Clean up the edges of your contour with your eraser.Once you have made all of the contour lines on your circle, you need to clean up and thin down your circle.,
Decide where you want your light source to be.,
Draw a curved line on the opposite side of the circle from the light source.,
Erase the horizontal and vertical axes after you draw the curved line.,
Shade in the occlusion shadow.This is the small shadow just below the sphere; in the previous methods, we called it the core shadow.,
Fill in the form shadow.,
Continue shading from dark to light, working your way from bottom to top.You will have a highlight spot where your light source is, so as you work your way to the top, remember to leave a spot untouched.,
Leave the highlight spot near the light source on the sphere.,
Blend in the shading so that the tones merge together.",How to Draw a Sphere3," This method is a bit different in that you use an actual sphere, placed in front of you, as a model while you draw.


A spherical object
Sketch pad or paper
Pencil
Kneaded eraser
Blending tool, cotton ball, or tissue

, This will help you to see the highlights and shadows of the sphere.

,


You do not need to use a ruler for this, although you can if you would like to do so.

, This can just be an approximation, as you will measure the boundaries later.Sketch four very light, short lines in an open square shape. They should not connect with each other; rather, they should signify the four sides of the square.
The lines need to be extremely light so that they are easy to erase later when touching up your drawing.

, Lightly sketch the axes so that they just barely intersect with the boundaries you drew.You can use comparative measurement to do this, meaning that you can create the size of your boundaries and axes by comparing the size of your model sphere to your pencil. Hold your pencil vertically so that it covers the sphere from top to bottom. Hold the tip of the pencil at the top of the sphere, and place your thumb on the pencil where it hits the bottom of the sphere. Lay your pencil on your paper without moving your thumb. Compare this height to the vertical axis you drew on your paper and adjust accordingly, if you choose. Repeat the process, except now measure the width of the sphere. Compare it to the horizontal axis you drew and, again, adjust accordingly if you would like.

, These should be as close to the same in length as possible.Using your pencil, place it along the vertical axis with the tip at the top. Just like before, place your thumb at the bottom of the axis. Now, turn your pencil horizontally and compare that distance to the horizontal axis. Adjust the axes if one is longer than the other.

, Imagine that the edges of your sphere were made up of a series of planes, made up by several short, straight lines. Begin drawing the edges of your sphere this way, with a contour.Add a first series of contour lines, in the suggested shape of an octagon. These lines will just barely intersect on the ends.
Then, draw a series of smaller contour lines within the first set. This new set does not need to intersect, as they are adding to the rounded shape of the contour.

, Where the contour plane lines do not connect, draw a small curved transition line to connect them.These help add to the circular shape you are creating.

,


Flatten your kneaded eraser to help you do this. It will make a thin, flat edge so that you can cleanly erase the stray marks and thickness of your new circle.

, Draw an arrow from the direction of the light source, down toward the circle. This indicates where your highlight spot will be.

, This curved line will connect the transitions of the axis you drew.If your light source is in the top left, then the curved line should follow along the lower right side of the circle. Visa versa, if it is in the top right, then the curved line should be placed along the lower left side.
This curved line is the start of the core shadow.

, Now that the circle and start of the core shadow are drawn, the axes are no longer needed., The light source cannot reach this spot; therefore, it is very dark.


Keep this very dark shadow limited to the bottom of the sphere, with each edge tapering off just as it starts to creep up the sides of the sphere.

, Between the curved line you drew and the edge of the sphere, shade in all of that space to a medium darkness.Smooth the shading with a blending tool, a cotton ball, or a tissue when you are done shading the area.

,


As you move toward the top of the sphere, you will shade in what is called a half-tone. This is a lighter shading than what you did on the lower half of the sphere, opposite of the light source.

, As you shade toward the light source, be sure to leave a circular or oval-shaped highlight spot.


The shading all around the highlight spot needs to be very lightly done to reflect that the light source reflects off of that area.

, Using your blending tool, cotton ball, or tissue, gently rub the shading from light-to-dark to blend the tones together and smooth the appearance of your drawing.


Remember to go from light-to-dark so that no excess graphite is smudged from dark areas into lighter ones.

Draw another on the left side.,
Repeat the previous step for the third cute.,
Outline your drawing by using a black pen or maker.,
Color the cubes blue, yellow and red.",How to Draw Interlocking Cubes,";
, this should look like it is part of the first cute you've draw. Do so by drawing a square for its front side. Then, add 2 shapes in form of an “L” on top and to the right of the square.

, Place it on top of the two previously drawn cubes. Create the third cube by drawing a diamond shape and then two “L” shapes on the front and left side of the diamond.

Draw two perpendicular lines.,
Label the intersection of the coordinates, i.e.,
Mark off both sigma ""x"" and sigma ""y"" to some scale on the Normal Stress axis on your drawing sheet.,
Divide the tangential force acting on the body by the area to calculate the shear stress on the body.,
Draw a vertical line from ""J"" towards the positive (upwards) side and mark on it the value of the calculated shear stress.,
Join points ""D"" and ""E"".,
To find the values of the stress on a plane at any angle from the axis of the force, draw a radius CP at twice that angle, the angle being measured from the radius CE.",How to Draw a Mohr's Circle," They're like axes in the 'x' and ""y"" coordinate systems but here, you call them stress coordinates. The horizontal line will represent  the Normal Stress coordinate and the vertical line will represent the Shear Stress coordinate.;
, the origin, as ""O"". Assuming that the external force in one of the directions ( say ""x"" direction) is F1, convert it to a stress by dividing the force by the cross section area normal to it. Usually the dimensions will be available for you to calculate the stress. Similarly calculate the stress in the mutually perpendicular direction also (i.e. the ""y"" direction). You can call these stresses sigma ""x"" and sigma ""y"".

, Follow the convention that all tensile stresses are in the positive direction i.e. to the right of the origin and compressive stresses are in the negative direction, i.e. to the left of the origin. Call these points ""J"" and ""K"". OJ then represents sigma ""x"" and OK represents sigma ""y"".

, Remember that, for a body subjected to a shear stress, there must be an accompanying shear stress in the opposite direction on the opposite face. These stresses will form a couple.


For the body to remain in equilibrium, an opposite couple will automatically develop. This is called the complimentary shear i.e. every clockwise shear couple will be accompanied by an anti-clockwise shear couple when a body is subjected to simple shear. You will also follow a convention that clockwise shears are positive and anti-clockwise shears are negative. Correspondingly, the area above the horizontal Normal Stress axis, is positive and the area below it is negative.

, Call this point ""D"". Similarly,draw a vertical line (downwards) from ""K"" and mark on it the same value of shear stress. This is downwards because the complimentary shear stress will be opposite to the main shear stress couple. Call this point ""E"". Note that the value of shear stress and the complimentary shear stress will be the same because it is a complimentary couple.

, This will cut the horizontal axis, OJ, at some point. Call it ""C"". Draw a circle with ""C"" as the centre and CJ as the radius. This is called the Mohr's Circle.


Mark the points where the Mohr's Circle cuts the horizontal axis as G and H respectively (G being the farthest point on the axis and H the nearer or negative cutting point).

, Drop a perpendicular from ""P"" to the horizontal axis at ""Q"". Join OP.OQ  represents sigma N i.e. the normal stress at the plane, OG the maximum stress in the body, OH the minimum stress in the body, and PQ represents the shear stress on the plane.OP represents the resultant stress on the plane. Similarly the stresses on any plane can be measured by choosing point P appropriately.

Gather your supplies.,
Cut your paper for folding.,
Connect the ends of two strips.,
Fold your paper to add layers.,
Include more strips for more length.,
Check to see your bracelet fits and trim unneeded ends.,
Link end to end to finish your bracelet.",How to Make a Paper Bracelet1," You'll be cutting paper into narrow strips and then taping these together in a pattern to create your frilled cuff. You can use different colored paper to make your cuff more colorful, or add designs of your own to it with crayons or markers. It goes without saying that you'll need scissors and paper, but including these, you'll also need:


Crayons or markers (optional)
Paper (normal size; 2 sheets)
Ruler
Scissors
Tape;
, Depending on how long or short you want to make your cuff, you'll need between four and eight strips of paper. Use your ruler to measure your strips equally to give your cuff a polished look, and then cut the strips longways.


The thicker your strips, the thicker your frilled cuff will be.
Be careful when working with thin strips; these can tear more easily.

, Take two strips by the ends and layer one over the other. The edges should be even with no overlap and should form an L shape. Now you can use your tape to join the strips together.

, Begin with the bottom paper of the two. Take it and fold it so that it crosses and folds over the layered ends that you've taped together. Crease the fold where it crosses the layered square of your two edges.


Repeat this motion with your other strip, which should now be sandwiched between your bottom strip of paper.
Continue this pattern, alternating folds between your strips one at a time.

, When you begin to run out of paper you can simply add another strip to the ends of each of your starting strips. Tape the ends of your new strips to your starting strips and continue folding.

, Stretch your frilled cuff bracelet out at various points throughout the folding process. Hold it against your wrist or lay it on top of your wrist to check its length. When you are satisfied with the length:


Trim the ends of your bracelet so each lines up evenly.
Tape the loose ends together so your bracelet doesn't come unfolded.

, Bend the bottom squares of each end together to form a circle. Then, using your tape, connect the bottom tabs of both ends to complete your frilled cuff.

Pre-fold each strip.,
Slide one strip into another.,
Fold the tail of the bitten strip.,
Repeat tail folding on the reverse side and fasten.,
Insert a fresh strip and continue to fold.,
Continue folding by adding a strip to your new loop.,
Join the ends of your weave together.",How to Make a Paper Bracelet2," Though you will make this bracelet through folding, you'll have to cut strips of paper in a 1:4 size ratio first. This means if you cut strips one inch (3 cm) thick, you'll need the strips to be four inches (12 cm) long. Along with your paper and scissors, you'll also need:


Binder clip or tape
Crayons or markers (optional)
Paper (normal size; multiple sheets)
Pencil
Ruler
Scissors

, Smaller strips will make a more delicate looking bracelet, while larger strips will be thicker and more sturdy. With your ruler, measure out equal strips from your paper that follow a 1:4 size ratio. For example, ½ inch (1.5 cm) wide strips should be two inches (6 cm) long.


Depending on how long you want to make your bracelet, you will need between 16 and 22 strips.
Decorate your strips with your own designs to add your personal flair!, First fold your each of your strips in half longways, then fold each vertically in half down the middle.This will help speed the bracelet making process along. Each strip will lock together using this pre-folded pattern as the base. , Each strip should open at the bend to form a crocodile mouth. Have one of the crocodile mouths clamp down on the other, and slide the clamped strip so that it is even with the bend of the one biting.

, The bitten strip will want to get away, so it's going to bend its tail to try and escape. Bend the top, open end of your bitten strip so that its outside edge meets and is even with the closest edge of the biting crocodile mouth. Then fold the tail so that it lies on top of the biting crocodile mouth., Turn your strips over and fold the bottom outside edge of your bitten crocodile mouth so that it is even with the biting crocodile mouth, then fold it to lie on top the biting croc.


If you let go, your folded tails will spring apart. Fasten these so they stay on top the biting croc with either a binder clip or tape., Open end first, slide your new croc strip into the loop until it is about half way through. Then, the same way you folded the bitten croc, fold the bottom and top parts of the ""mouth"" even with the outside edge of your weave and then on top of it. You should then be able to tuck the ends inside a pocket formed by your first two strips.Folding your open ends into the pocket formed by the first two strips will fasten your strips together without another binder clip or piece of tape.
You may want to leave a little extra space on the fold side of the croc-strip, as more loop space can be easier to work with, especially for children.

, Open side first, slip another strip into your loop. Again, you will fold the outside edges parallel with the horizontal section of your bracelet weave. Then fold that on top of the weave, tucking the loose ends into the pocket formed by the weave of your bracelet.


Add more strips to your loops until your weave is long enough to fit your wrist.
The design formed by this weave should be staggered, shaped similarly to stairs., When your bracelet is long enough, you should connect the ends together. Do this by carefully removing your clip or tape, using one hand to hold that end together. Thread the open ended side of your last strip into the loop at the very beginning of your weave. Use the same pattern as before:


Fold the tail so its outside edge is flat to the outer edge of the weave.
Fold that on top of the weave and tuck the remainder into the pocket.
Do the same for the other side of the croc mouth.
Add finishing touches by drawing with markers or crayons.

Assemble your bracelet weaving necessities.,
Cut your paper for weaving.,
Create two 20 inch strips with tape.,
Begin your weave.,
Create a solid V. Fold the outside strips, strip one and four, inward so each is parallel to strips two and three.,
Weave your strips together.,
Continue your weave.,
Tape and fasten loose ends together.",How to Make a Paper Bracelet3," This paper bracelet uses extra long strips woven together to form a regular shaped band. You'll need scissors and tape to create your extra long strips, as well as:


Paper
Pencil
Piece of ribbon or twist tie
Ruler
Scissors
Tape

, To weave your bracelet, you'll need four thin strips of paper that are ten inches (25 cm) long and ¼ inch (½ cm) wide. First measure out these lengths on your paper with your ruler and mark the outline with your pencil. From there it should be a simple task to cut your strips free with your scissors.


You might want to use different colored paper to create a unique design in your bracelet., You'll need to combine two of your strips together to do this. Connect each strip end to end with tape. You might also use glue, but if you do, allow your strips to dry completely before weaving, as weak glue could cause your strips to come apart., Take one of your 20 inch strips and lay it horizontally in front of you. Take your other strip, and thread it under and around your horizontal strip to create a V shape. Starting left to right, number each strip with your pencil from one to four.

, Begin with four, folding it over three and aligning it with strip two. Do the same with strip one: fold it over two and align it with strip three.

, Adjust strip one so that it comes in front of strip four and aligns with strip three. Then fold strip three over strip one so it is parallel with strip four. Take strip two under strip four and then above strip three so it is in line with strip one.


Your strips should now be arranged in the following order from left to right: four, three, two, one., Fold your first strip over the second so it is side by side with strip three. Weave strip four under strip three but over strip one so it comes alongside strip two. Repeat this pattern until your bracelet is long enough for your wrist.At this stage, your strips should be in the following order: three, one, four two.

, When the weave of your bracelet as at the right length for your wrist, you can trim the loose ends to equal lengths and then tape along the end to prevent your weave from coming undone. Then:


Use a ribbon or a twist tie poked between the strips of your weave to connect the beginning to the ending."

Cycle through the color gamut using a graphical program.",How to Make Interesting Fractals," There are many factors to consider when choosing a program, including the variety of algorithms you can use to create your fractals, the quality of the images, the richness and complexity of fractals, the number and range of colors to use, and the amount of manipulation you can perform on your fractals. Perform a search online for fractal programs, or pick from the comprehensive list at FractalFoundation.org, which also provides descriptions of each program.

Open and run your fractal program to begin making a fractal.;
, This is the coarse tuning. Your program will likely have many formulas for you to choose from, including formulas that add onto or enhance more basic ones. Choosing a formula will generate an image of the basic fractal. Experiment with different formulas to see what your options are., You should be able to choose your own custom colors for different parts of the fractal. Choose colors you like and that go together well to make your fractal interesting and beautiful., Zooming in will magnify the fractal so that you can see small parts of it in more and more detail. Continue zooming until you get an image you like., Draw out the fractal so that it is as large as your screen resolution, eg 1280 x 1024. Position it to get just the right framing of the image., Adjust the parameters available in the program that control how the image is drawn, such as filters, renders, transforms or whatever they are called. Also, try the Julia version. This is the medium tuning., Adjust the colors in the fractal using the tools provided by the fractal program. This is the fine tuning., This process smooths out the jagged diagonals and makes the fine details look more coherent. It makes curves smoother by averaging out their trajectories and smooths the colors by using intermediate shades where there may only be sharply distinct colors in the original image. Draw the image larger in each dimension by a factor of 4, eg draw the image as 5120 x 4096 pixels if you want the final image to be 1280 x 1024 pixels. Naturally, this will take 16 times as long as rendering the normal-size image. Some people sharpen the image after anti-aliasing, as it can look a little soft, but this is a matter of taste.You may find that the new image is much smoother and less speckled than the original. Do give this a try at least once, as you may be surprised by the difference., The image produced by your fractal-generating program will be colored randomly. The colors may be bold or dull, they may look harmonised or not, they may not be to your taste. Almost every fractal program allows you to alter the colors of the fractal produced. However, the color controls tend to give unpredictable results and require you to render the fractal anew. This takes time, which is always a scarce commodity.

Alternatively, perform your post-processing in a graphical program, such as Photoshop or ACDSee.You can cycle through the possible colors by gradually altering the hues in the entire image. To do this in Photoshop, use Image -> Adjustments -> Hue/Saturation and move the hue slider through every value, both right and left of the centre. Save the images that appeal to you. Then hit control-I to reverse the colour values and repeat the process.The idea is twofold: to obtain better colour combinations as well as to highlight different aspects of the fractal's structure. Not only can a dull-looking fractal become striking, but new structure can be revealed. It will give you ideas for what to zoom into - areas that suddenly become interesting after colours or light/dark have been changed.

Simply by estimation, imagine a ""Point A"" and a ""Point B"" of the line.,

This does not have to be perfect. Do not stress over the accuracy in location.

,


Always draw softly the first time. There will always be an opportunity at the end to go over your drawing in a darker color.
There is no need to erase the mess around the straightest of the lines. It will only make the line look awkward and broken.
It is okay if your lines make random turns or are rough. They are only guides for when you will draw over them with a darker color.

,, Simply follow the most centered line that appears best. Erase the pencil.


Your lines will most likely be quite close. In this case, allow your pen to take the path that seems the most correct. The penciled lines are most commonly used to keep from going off the path.

Collect all the materials you will need.,

Spread the paint or ink evenly on a flat non-porous surface.,
Press the design on your potato into the paint.,
Press the paint covered design onto the surface you wish to stamp.,
Create a pattern with your stamps.,
Let the paint dry.",How to Make a Stamp1," Begin by picking out a firm potato that is large in size. You will also need to get a knife, some paint or ink, and an item such as paper to stamp on.


While it can be fun to simply stamp on paper, consider purchasing screen printing ink and a piece of clothing, a canvas tote bag, or a dish towel to print on. With these you can make a creative present or a fun new item for yourself.
Instead of a potato you can also use a cork from a wine bottle or a large eraser to make your stamp. Using one of these items will create a stamp that you can use on more than one occasion, while the potato stamp will not last long. These items, however, will not give you as large of a stamp surface as the potato will.;
, Make sure that you cut straight through the center of the potato. It's important that the cut is smooth and flat, so that the stamp will sit flat when stamping.








, Start with a simple design, like a star or a heart, that does not have a lot of interior cuts. It's easier to trim the outside edge of the potato.








You do not need to cut very far into the potato, just deep enough so that the surface is no longer flush.
The design that will actually appear when you use the stamp is the part that you do not cut away, so keep this in mind when cutting.
A good way to successfully cut out your design is to draw it out on the surface and then cut away all areas that are not drawn on.

, If you have a brayer already, use it to spread the paint or ink out evenly. If you do not have a brayer, simply use a knife to spread the paint or ink out as evenly as possible. It does not need to be perfect but should be pretty thin across the whole surface.








, Set the design down directly into the paint. Put a little pressure on the potato but don't exert yourself. The goal it to cover the entire surface of the potato stamp but not to get so much paint or ink into the cuts you made that it builds up to the surface and will transfer when you stamp.









If you think you applied too much paint or ink and the cuts you made are full of it, take the time to dig most of it out with your knife. If all else fails, you can rinse the potato off under a faucet, wipe the excess water off with a towel, and start over with applying your ink or paint.

, Be sure to set your potato stamp directly down on the surface you are stamping on. Try to keep the stamp level while setting it down. Put a small amount of pressure onto the potato stamp but you don't want to press too hard.









If you are stamping onto a relatively non-porous surface, such as a piece of paper, you will have to put very little pressure. If you put too much it could smear the design. If you are stamping on a porous surface, such as a piece of fabric, you can push a little harder.
Remove the stamp in the same manner that you applied it, lifting straight up in order to avoid smearing your design.

, While it's perfectly fine to apply just one stamp, try making a repeating pattern or design.







, It's important to let the paint dry before disturbing the image you have stamped. If you are impatient, try using a hairdryer to get the paint or ink to dry faster.

Collect your materials.,
Draw a design onto your rubber block or linocut block.,
Cut out your design using your craving tools.,
Place paint or ink on the non-porous surface and use your brayer to level it out.,
Press the surface of your design gently into the paint.,
Lift your stamp up and make sure the surface is covered with paint or ink.,
Press your stamp onto the surface you are printing on.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Stamp2," You will need to acquire a rubber block or linocut block, some paint or ink, a brayer, linoleum carving tools in a variety of shapes, a non-porous surface to spread ink or paint on, and an item to print on.Most of these items can easily be found and purchased at any craft store.

, For your first project, try making your lines at least a quarter inch thick. This will make cutting our your design easier than if you had very thin lines.









The lines you draw will be what actually appears once you use your stamp. This means that you will be removing all of the surface that has nothing drawn on it. Keep this in mind when drawing your design.

, Remember that you are cutting away the negative space, in other words all of the surface area that was not drawn on. This may take some time, depending on your design, but it's important that all the negative space is below the surface of the block.









Cut down deep enough so that, when stamping, a buildup of ink in the negative space does not accidentally transfer to the surface you are stamping onto.
Utilize the various shapes of carving tools you have. Small straight edged cutters are good for detail work, while wide rounded tools are good for taking away larger pieces of surface area quickly., You should not need to apply much paint to the surface. Simply apply enough paint or ink so that a thin layer of paint can be spread out in a space a bit larger than the surface of your stamp.









For a multi-colored stamp design, put dots or stripes of several colors of paint or ink on your non-porous surface and smooth them out with the brayer so that they meet each other and create a solid thin layer.

, You need to cover the design completely with paint or ink but avoid getting a lot of paint into the negative space.








, If there are voids where ink or paint should be but isn't, simply dab a bit of ink onto those areas with a paper towel or your finger.

, Remember to set the stamp directly down onto the surface, keeping the stamp horizontal and steady. This will alleviate the danger of smearing your design.


Keep in mind that if you are printing onto fabric the paint or ink might bleed through. Protect the surface underneath with a piece of cardboard or several pieces of newspaper.
Lift your stamp straight up and off then let your print dry completely. If you are impatient you can use a hairdryer to dry the ink or paint quickly.

Send it!",How to Make a Postcard," To make sure your postcard won't get destroyed in the mail, choose a sturdy type of paper, like cardstock. The postcard you make should be about the same thickness as a regular postcard. If you're afraid the paper you have is too flimsy, you can glue more than one piece together to make it sturdier.









The USPS specifies that postcards must not be thinner than .007"". Postcards thicker than .016"" are considered letter weight and will require a more expensive stamp.You can use any color paper that you want, as long as the address will be clearly visible.
Blank notecards are a good choice - you can buy them in white or any other color, and they come in the right sizes.;
, Take a ruler and measure out a card between 3 1/2 and 4 1/4 inches high and between 5 and 6 inches long.Carefully cut out the card, making sure it's not lopsided or irregular in shape. The USPS won't send a postcard that isn't rectangular.








, Now your piece of paper will start looking more like a postcard! Use a straightedge to help you create a straight line down the center of the back of your card. The space on the left side of the line will be reserved for your message, and the space on the right side will be reserved for the address of the recipient.









There's no reason the line has to be drawn directly down the center of the card. If you want more space to write a longer note, scoot the line toward the right side of the card so you have more room on the left.

, On the right side of the center line, draw three horizontal lines. This is where you'll write the recipient's name and address. If you want, draw a box in the upper right hand corner where the stamp will go.








, Now comes the fun part. Gather up the art supplies you want to use so you can create a one-of-a-kind picture for the front of your postcard. You can draw directly on the postcard, but don't feel limited to just using pens and pencils. Here are some fun supplies you could use to decorate your card:








Newspaper clippings
Magazine clippings
Photos
Construction paper
Inks
Paint
Ribbons
Sequins
Glitter
Glue

, If you can fit it within your 4 x 6"" (or 3 x 5"") card, it works. Use your art supplies to decorate the card however you'd like. You can draw your version of a classic postcard or create something original and extraordinary for your recipient. Here are a few ideas:









Glue a photo you took to the front of the card. Decorate it with a fun border using colored paper and glitter.
Make an original drawing of something you saw on your trip that reminded you of your friend.
Cut out words from a magazine and make a word collage on the front of the postcard.
Use ribbons to make a basket-weave pattern or another abstract design.

, This step will help protect the front of your card in the mail. It's especially important if you used materials other than pens and pencils to decorate the card. Get mod podge or another clear craft sealant and use a paintbrush to paint it over the front of the card. Allow it to dry for a few hours before you finish your card.









Don't cover the back of the card in sealant, or you won't be able to write on it.

, Use the space on the left hand side of the back of your postcard to write a personal note to your recipient. Inside jokes, funny drawings, and well wishes will make your postcard fun to receive! You can also draw a border around the back of the postcard or include little embellishments in the corners. As long as the address will be clearly visible, you can fill the space however you choose.








, On the right side of the card, write the recipient's name, followed by his or her full address. Make sure to include the zip code.








, Affix a postcard stamp to the top right corner of the back of the postcard. Postcard stamps are a few cents less expensive than letter stamps.

, Begin with the larger areas first, and work smaller towards the details.

, It is the most popular paint for this, because it dries nice and bright, and it is also waterproof. Water colours are not waterproof, and dry in a dull soft way. You can also use household paint if your creation is quite large. Again, allow paint to dry between applications.

, These can be done using waterproof marker pens, wool for the hair (or fur!) and clothes. Beads, string and other household items can be added if applicable.

Do some origami.,
Decoupage a memory box or journal.,
Do some papier-mâché.,
Make your own greeting cards as a more personal alternative to store-bought cards.,
Make paper toys.,
Create paper art.",How to Use Paper Creatively1," Origami is the Japanese art of paper folding, and with it you can make an enormous range of things out of a simple sheet of paper. You can make paper cranes, butterflies, ""fox-puppets"", and much more. Some awesome origami projects to try include:


A traditional origami swan

A paper rose for a loved one
An origami bunny - that's just cute!
A frame to display photos or pictures
An origami samurai helmet could be lots of fun!
A paper box or origami star box to hold small gifts for friends and family

Origami paper claws to add life to a Halloween costume;
, If you have papers that have significance to you, such as pamphlets, tickets, stubs, photos, receipts, and letters, you can use those papers to create a box where you can keep jewelry, memorabilia, or any other items you want. Just get the object that you want to decorate, arrange the paper in an artful way that you think looks nice, and then decoupage away!


You can even introduce other materials like paint, glitter, and other objects (like buttons or fake flowers) in order to make it look eve more special. Some items may need to be attached with hot glue.
You can also use those memorable papers in a scrapbook, if you don't want to destroy them. Just get a photo album with slots that the paper can fit into or a plastic sheet that holds it in place. Just be careful to keep it away from moisture, otherwise the album can actually damage the paper!

, This is when you combine torn strips of paper or newspaper with a sticky substance like glue or wallpaper paste and apply it to an object or mold it into shapes. Once it has dried it will harden and so can be used for many different things. Beware though, this can get a little messy. There are loads of things that you can do with papier-mâché, including:


Vases
Light switch covers
Seashells
Masks
Pencil holders
Trinket boxes

, Card making a good opportunity to try new paper crafting techniques such as pop-up making.


The most basic card making involves taking a regular sheet of paper and folding it in half. You can then decorate the blank card with paint, crayons, markers, or other materials.

, While there are books with templates to make paper toys such as robots, you can make the following with just a plan piece of paper:


Cootie Catcher
Paper Football
Paper Planes and Boats

, You can create either 2D or 3D paper art. We're not talking origami here! These are artworks that are like drawings, except instead of drawing shapes and coloring them in, you create the shapes from paper.


For 2D paper art, use paper in different colors and cut out each different part of your ""drawing"". If you're making a face, for example, you'll need to cut out the eyes (possibly in several different colored pieces), the nose, the mouth, the skin of the face, the hair (again, probably in different pieces), and other details. The more pieces you cut out, the more detailed you can make your piece.
For 3D art, you'll cut out thin strips of paper, about the width of 2-3 spaghetti noddles, and place them on their sides on another sheet of paper. Fold, bend, and spiral them to create different shapes in outline.

Start drawing!,
Play a paper game.,
Play football.,
Play Battleship.,
Play Dots and Boxes.,
Make a paper gun and start a war with your friends!",How to Use Paper Creatively2," Grab a pencil or some colored pens and just start doodling! Express yourself and draw whatever inspires you. You could try drawing less realistic things like cartoons and manga, or perhaps draw something in the room or a friend or family member. A really nice way to use the paper would be to go outside and just draw what you see. Once you have finished you can proudly display your artwork, perhaps in your new origami frame!

, Think tic tac toe is the only paper game out there? Think again. There are other games you can play to occupy time when all you have is paper and pen.


Try Haikai (Collaborative Poetry Game).
You could also make your own paper puzzles such as sudoku.

, You can also play paper football. Simply fold the paper into a small triangle or roll it into a ball and then start flicking it around. You might also want to make goal posts, depending on how much paper you have.

, You can actually play the classic board game using just a sheet of paper (and a partner!). Draw out an 11x11 grid and label one side with letters and the other with numbers. Plot your ships and then start playing. Just don't cheat!

, Draw a grid of evenly-spaced dots, perhaps around 20 dots x 20 dots. Now, each player takes a turn drawing a line between two dots. Whoever draws the 4th line of a box claims that box. Whoever has the most boxes when the grid is full wins!

, You can make a paper gun using paper, scissors, and a rubber band. With this weapon in hand, you can start an office war or start a game with your friends. Just be careful not to hit anyone in the eye!

Recycle the paper.,
Write stories.,
Curl your hair using paper!,
Practice your handwriting.,
Try a science experiment.,
Play math flowers.",How to Use Paper Creatively3," Did you know that for every ton of paper, 17 trees live? Recycle paper that you are done with, even if it has pencil-marks on it. Just because you don't have a use for the paper, doesn't mean it should just be disposed of! If you recycle it, it can be reused and turned into many different useful products without being wasted. You could also recycle paper by using it to make more paper or turn old junk mail into paper beads.

, Paper is for story-writing! You probably already know that. Grab a pen and bring your imagination to life! Get thinking of some ideas and characters, and make sure to have a beginning, a middle and an end to your plot. Have fun and make sure not to strain your hand too much! Once you're done you could show it to friends or family for some feedback. Congratulations!


Don't feel up to writing a whole story? That's totally okay! There are a number of different writing forms you could try out, including:


Poetry and Haiku

Short stories
Your very own magazine

Comics



, Start off by wrapping your hair in the desired shape with brown-bag paper, in the way that you would use a curling iron. You can set it by doing this technique when the hair is wet, applying hardening or setting sprays, and then sitting under a dryer. Afterwards your curls will be very soft and much healthier because you avoided applying direct heat. Enjoy your cute, Eco-savvy hairdo!

, You can use the paper in order to practice your handwriting. Most people can stand to have nicer handwriting, but you can also use it to practice changes in how you write, stylistically, as well. Master a new signature, come up with your celebrity signature, or even try your hand at calligraphy!

, You can do a couple of different science experiments with paper. This might sound boring, but it can actually be really fun! Try invisible writing with lemon juice (it will magically appear when you hold it over a toaster!) or try to see how many times you can fold it. You can even try the classic tablecloth-pull magic trick with a sheet of paper instead of the cloth!

, This is a fun game that will also help you build your math skills. Draw a circle for the center and then however many flower petals you want. The more you have, the more challenging it will be. Write a number, any number you want, in the center and in each of the petals. Now your challenge is to make the petal numbers equal the center number. Add, subtract, multiply, and divide in order to make a math equation for which the center number is the solution!

Store your scrapbook in a dry environment.",How to Make Homemade Scrapbooks," Scrapbooks showcase photos, memorabilia, and stories that are united by a theme. The theme may be very general, like a family photo album, or incredibly specific, like a wedding album. It is important to settle on a theme before you purchase your supplies and/or start crafting. Your theme will inform the amount of material you will include, the type of album that you will use, and your color scheme.General themes may include: family, children or an individual child, pet(s), and extended family members.
Specific themes may include: wedding, birthday, school year, sports season, vacation, holiday celebration, and pregnancy/baby.;
, Once you’ve selected your theme, think about the stories you want to tell and preserve. Take a moment to jot these stories down—you write down keywords, brief descriptions, or complete tales. When your list is complete, look over the items and decide how you want to organize these stories.


Will you tell the stories in chronological order or group them by sub-topic?
How many pages will you devote to each story?, Before scrapbooking, you will need to edit your selection of photos and items several times. During this process, don’t be afraid to be extremely selective.


Gather a collection of photos and items that are directly related to your album’s theme.
Sit down at workspace with the organized list of stories, your photos, and your memorabilia.
Sort the material into categories based on the stories you wish to tell. Place the pictures and memorabilia inside labeled folders or envelopes.
Go through each folder or envelope and take out any memorabilia or photos that do not pertain to your narrative., After you’ve settled on a story list and sorted through your images and memorabilia, it's time to settle on a color scheme. Peruse the aisles of your favorite crafting store for cardstock and embellishments that complement your theme and stories. While you’re shopping, pick up any tools you may need to complete the scrapbook.


To achieve a cohesive look, purchase paper and embellishments, like stickers and stamps, from the same line and color-families.
Buy acid-free, lignin-free and buffered cardstock. This paper will help to preserve your handmade scrapbook.
Purchase pigment-based ink pads and pens. Search for ink that is waterproof and fade resistant.
Pick up reposition-able and removable adhesives. These products allow you to move items around the page with relative ease.
Shop for a paper trimmer, several pairs of scissors, and/or cut-out templates, if necessary., Scrapbooks are not one-size-fits-all. Select a size that will accommodate your theme, the number of stories you want to tell, the amount of material you intend to use, and the number of embellishments you wish to include.


The most common size is 12 x 12 inches. This size is ideal for anyone who wants to fit several images, pieces of memorabilia, writings, and/or embellishments on a single page. It is also great for general albums.
The 8 ½ x 11 inches album is ideal for scrapbookers with slightly less material and embellishments to work with. You can fit one to two pictures per page. This is a great size for vacation, school year, child, or pet themed scrapbook.
Other common sizes include 8 x 8 inches, 6 x 6 inches, and 5 x 7 inches. These are perfect to give as gifts or to use for a very specific theme. You can fit 1 picture per page.
As you shop for an album, pay attention to the type of binding used. There a three general types of bindings: post-bound, strap hinge, and 3-ring binders, or D-rings. Each binding method allows you to move pages around, remove pages, and add additional pages., Prior to cutting and adhering your material to a page, devote time to creating a few potential page layouts. In addition to creating a cohesive look, pre-planned layouts will save you a lot of time and prevent you from wasting materials.


Remove a few pages from your album.
Experiment with the position of photos, memorabilia, designated journal spaces, headings, captions, and embellishments.When you find a layout you like, jot down any relevant dimensions (like photo size) and take a picture of the layout to use a reference.

, Choose a story from your list and pull the file of pictures and memorabilia. Remove a page from your album and select one of your pre-planned layouts. Place the pictures, memorabilia, and embellishments onto the page. Adjust the items until you are happy with the layout.


Since you have not cut or glued anything yet, you can always switch to a new page layout if needed., After finalizing your page layout, you may confidently start to alter your photographs and memorabilia. Take your time trimming, embellishing, and adhering your items.


If you need to crop an image or piece of memorabilia, lightly mark your cut lines on the back of the item with a pencil. Use a pair of scissors or a paper trimmer to cut the item down to size.
If you want to draw attention to an image or item, consider matting it. Use paper, fabric, ribbon or pre-cut photo mats to create a border.
After cropping your items and creating borders, use an acid-free glue to affix the photos or memorabilia to the page., Titles introduce your audience to the story you are telling. The title for each page or narrative should be brief, yet descriptive. To create the title, you may use:


Pens
Stamps
Stickers
Stencils
Computer and printer
Cut-outs, Without descriptions, images and memorabilia have little meaning. Collages of items and images are transformed into meaningful narratives by captions and journal entries. Devote time and page space to crafting descriptive captions and thoughtful journal entries.


Captions may include: names, dates, locations, and brief descriptions.
Journal entries may include: anecdotes, quotes, poems, lyrics, and longer descriptions of an event.
Use your list of stories to help you compose your captions and journals.
Before adding a caption or journal entry to a page, plan out what you are going to write. Revise your writing and fix any typos.
You may handwrite your captions and journal entries or print and adhere them to the page., After adhering the primary items to your scrapbook page, you can dress up the page with embellishments. Embellishments are used to add glitz, dimension, texture, and/or interest to your scrapbook pages. These decorative elements are optional and should be used sparingly. Types of embellishments include:


Stickers
Stamps
Ribbons and fabric
Cardstock paper
Cutouts, In order to preserve your photos and memorabilia, it is important to protect each page of your album. Page protectors are essentially plastic sleeves. They are sold in a variety of sizes and binding styles. Once your page is complete and dry, protect it from dust, dirt, and fingerprints by slipping it into a page protector.


Purchase page protectors that match the size and binding type of your album.
You may choose between a top-loading or side-loading page protectors.
You may select a non-glare or clear finish., Insert your completed scrapbook pages into your album. As you complete more pages, you may rearrange the narratives to fit the storyline of your album. This allows you to work on stories out of order., In order to preserve your scrapbook, you must carefully consider where and how to store the album. The ideal storage space is cool, dry, clean, and consistent. Place your album in a flat, preservation-quality box.


Do not store your album near radiators and vents or areas of your home that is prone to leaks."

Take apart an empty tissue box to make your template.,
Pin your fabric pieces together.,

Trace your template onto your batting.,
Cut your fabric and batting out.,
Cut ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) long slits into the corners on the tissue slot hole on both pieces of fabric.,
Sandwich the batting between the two fabric pieces.,
Sew across each side flap, from upper corner to upper corner.,

Pin the side flaps together to form a box.,
Sew the flaps together using a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance.,
Fold a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) wide bias tape all the way around the bottom of the box.,
Topstitch the bias tape down, ⅛ inch (0.32 centimeter) from the inside edge.,
Use your tissue box cover.",How to Make a Tissue Box Cover1," Use a box cutter or craft knife to cut out the bottom of the box first, and discard it. Then, cut the corners straight down using a sawing motion. Flatten your box so that you get something that looks like a + sign.Pull the plastic out from the tissue slot, if there is any. If your tissue slot is an oval, you might want to stick masking tape across the sides and bottom to make it a rectangle.;
, Choose two types of fabric, one for the outside of the tissue box cover and one for the lining. Pin them together. You will be tracing and cutting everything all at one time. This way, you can be certain that everything will be even.

Choose a nice fabric for the outside, such as patterned cotton, linen, or even curtain/upholstery fabric. Choose plain cotton or muslin fabric for the inside.

, Add ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowances to the inside corners. Keep the top, bottom, left, and right edges flush against the template. Finally, trace inside the tissue slot hole, add a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance., Trace the entire template first, including the tissue slot hole, then take the template off. Next, trace ¼ inch (0.64 centimeter) inside the corners; these will be your new cutting lines and will help reduce bulk. The top, bottom, and side edges should still be flush with the top, bottom, and slide edges on your template., Keep the fabric pieces pinned together as you cut them, then remove the pins when you are done. This way, both pieces will match up. Cut the batting separately., Make the slits at 45°. You will eventually be folding the edges in, and these slits will allow you to do so., Place the lining fabric down first, right-side-down. Place the batting down on top of it, making sure that it is centered. Finally, place the outer fabric on top of it, right-side-up. Pin everything in place., When you look down on top of your tissue box cover, you will see a rectangle, with another rectangle sticking out on each of the four sides. These four rectangles are the side flaps. Use your sewing machine to topstitch across the top of your tissue box cover, right where the side flaps connect to the top panel. This will help the batting fold nicely.

Use a thread color that matches the outer fabric, and a bobbin color that matches the lining.

, Flip the tissue cover so that the inside fabric is facing you. Fold each of the tissue slot edges in by ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter), and pin them in place. Don't worry, you won't see the hems when you are done., Fold the beginning and end of your bias tape under by ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) to hide the raw edges. Start pinning the bias tape at one of the corners. Remove the old pins as you go, and use them to hold the bias tape in place.

Choose a color that goes well with the outside fabric. It can match the print, or contrast it.

, Sew ⅛ inch (0.32 centimeter) away from the inside edge, and remove the sewing pins as you go. Backstitch at the start and end of your sewing to prevent the thread from unraveling., Fold the bottom and left flaps together, and pin them together. Repeat for the remaining flaps until you get a box shape. The seams should be on the same side as the inside fabric.

The batting is cut smaller than the fabric pieces. You won't be able to pin it; try to keep it sandwiched between the inner and outer fabric pieces.

, Remove the pins as you sew. When you are done sewing, snip the seams at the corners to reduce bulking, and turn the tissue over right-side out.

Again, the batting is cut smaller. You won't be able to catch it with your needle. This is fine because it reduces bulk.

, Secure the bias tape with sewing pins. As before, fold the beginning and end of the bias tape under by ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) to hide the raw edges.

Match this color to your first bias tape color.

, Match the thread color to the bias tape, and remove the pins as you go. Do this for both pieces of bias tape.

Backstitch a few times at the start and end of your sewing. This will prevent the thread from unraveling.

, Slide it over the top of your tissue box, and pull the first tissue out through the slot."

Measure your tissue box and add your seam allowances.,
Cut your fabric and interfacing according to your measurements.,
Pin your interfacing to the wrong-side of each fabric panel, and iron it in place.,
Draw a 2 by 3-inch (5.08 by 7.62-centimeter) rectangle in the middle of you top panel.,
Pin the other piece of fabric to the top panel.,
Topstitch along the lines that you drew, then cut the rectangle out.,
Cut the rectangle out, about ⅛-inch (0.32-centimeter) from the stitching.,
Turn the panel inside out, and press it with an iron.,
Pin the fabric in place, then topstitch around the rectangle hole as well as the outer edges of the panel.,
Sew the side panels together with the right sides facing in.,
Pin the top panel to the side panel loop, and sew it in place.,
Trim the seams at the corners down to ⅛-inch (0.32-centimeter).,
Turn the bottom edge up twice to create the bottom hem.,
Topstitch the hem down.,
Turn your cover right-side out.",How to Make a Tissue Box Cover2," Add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) to the length and width of the top panel. For the side panel: add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) to the width, and 1½ inches (3.81 centimeters) to the height.If your box is a square, then you only need to measure one of the side panels. If your box is a rectangle, then you need to measure one of the shorter panels, and one of the longer panels.

, Choose a nice, medium-weight fabric, such as home decor fabric or quilting cotton. Pin your fabric and interfacing together as you cut them. This way, you will save time, and ensure that everything is even. Here are the pieces you need to cut:4 pieces of fabric and interfacing for the side panels.
2 pieces of fabric and 1 piece of interfacing for the top panel.

, Each of the side panels will get a piece of interfacing. Only one of the top pieces will get interfacing; the other one will be bare., Take the top panel that has the interfacing on it, and turn it so that the interfacing is facing you. Draw a rectangle in the center of it. Use a ruler to measure from the edges of the fabric to ensure that the rectangle is centered., Flip the top panel over so that the fabric side is facing you. Place the other (bare) top fabric piece on it, right-side-down., Turn the top panel over so that the interfacing is showing and so that you can see the lines you drew. Sew right on top of the lines., Once you are done, cut little slits going towards the corners. This will prevent bulk and bunching., Take the bare piece of fabric, and pull it through the rectangle. Now, you should have a top panel that is fabric on both sides with interfacing sandwiched inside. Smooth the fabric out, then iron it flat., Sew around the hole first, then remove the pins, and smooth the fabric towards the outside edges. Pin the fabric in place again, and sew around the edges of the panel, using a ¼-inch (0.64 centimeter) seam allowance.

Remove the pins as you sew.
Iron the entire panel once again when you are done. This will help ""relax"" the stitching., Use a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. Start sewing ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) down from the top, and sew all the way down to the bottom edge. This will allow you to attach the top panel.

Press the seams open when you are done.

, Make sure that the bare, non-interface side of the top panel is facing you. Use ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowances. When you get to the corners, do not sew all the way to the edge of the fabric; instead, stop ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) away from the edge. This will help create nice, crisp seams.Sew each of the four sides separately; backstitch at the front and start of your sewing to prevent the thread from unraveling.

, Each corner will have three seams. Trim these seams down at an angle where they intersect to create a fine point. This will help further reduce bulking., Turn the bottom edge up by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) and press it flat with an iron. Turn it up by another ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), and press it flat again. If you need to, pin the hem in place., Sew as close as you can to the inside folded edge. Be sure to use a thread color that matches your fabric, and to remove any sewing pins as you go., Your tissue box cover is now ready to use. If you'd like the edges to be nice and crisp, press the cover flat at each side seam, and iron it flat."

Start with a piece of regular paper.,
Gather additional materials.,
Prepare your workspace.,
Apply oil to the paper with your paintbrush.,
Use a paper towel to absorb excess oil.,
Allow your paper to dry overnight.,
Use a pencil to create your tracing.,
Transfer your tracing to drawing paper.,
Preserve your tracing paper.",How to Make Tracing Paper," This paper will become your tracing paper, so you’ll want to start with a sheet that’s already fairly thin. Regular printer paper works well for this process., You’ll need a few more items before you begin making your tracing paper. Fortunately, most of these materials should be available around your house. You’ll need:


One tablespoon of oil in a cup. You’ll be applying this oil to your paper and may need more than a tablespoon depending on the size of the paper. Ideally, use vegetable, coconut or baby oil. Olive oil is thicker and may oversaturate the paper.A large, thick-bristled paintbrush to apply the oil.
Newspaper, cardboard or a plastic container.
Paper towels or a washcloth.
A hair dryer (optional).

, Find a flat surface such as a table or desk to work on. You’ll want to make sure it’s protected since you’ll be working with oil. Before you start, place some newspaper on your workspace.


The oil may drip or accidently spill, so it’s a good idea to cover the entire surface with newspaper.
Alternatively, place your paper on a piece of cardboard or inside a large plastic container.

, Gently paint the entire surface area on one side of the paper. The oil will soak in as you work and you should notice the paper becoming thin and transparent.Paint past the edges of the paper to ensure you’ve applied oil to the entire sheet. You won’t have to worry about making a mess as long as your workspace is protected.
You only need to apply one thin coat of oil to the paper. Dab your paintbrush on the side of the cup before application so the oil doesn’t pool up. The paper will become more transparent as it starts to dry.

, You might find it hard to gauge how much oil you’re applying to the paper. Pat both sides of the paper with a cloth or paper towel if the paper seems too wet when you’re finished.

, The oil needs to dry completely before you can use your tracing paper. This may take up to 24 hours, but if you don’t want to wait as long you can use a hair dryer to speed up the drying process. Once the paper dries completely, your tracing paper will be ready to use!


Sunlight will help the paper dry more quickly, so put your tracing paper by a window., A soft, finely pointed pencil works well on tracing paper.Tape your tracing paper to the original print or drawing. When you’ve finished tracing, leave one side taped to the print and examine the original image. This method makes it easier to realign your tracing paper if you need to make changes.

, Depending on your project, you may want to transfer your finished tracing to drawing paper. To accomplish this, use a pencil to darken the back of the tracing paper after you’ve finished your tracing. Place your tracing paper over the drawing paper and retrace your lines using a sharp pencil. The graphite on the back of the tracing paper will create the final image on your drawing paper.


Mechanical pencils retain a hard point and will work best for transferring your tracing.
You may need to touch up your final image after you transfer your tracing onto drawing paper. Be sure to hold onto your tracing in case you need to use it again.

, Tracing paper can smudge and rip easily, so you’ll want to make sure you store it properly. When you’ve finished using your tracing paper, wash your hands to prevent smudging. Keep your tracing paper separated from other projects in a dry location.


For extra protection, wrap your tracing paper in glassine, a transparent, glossy paper used to preserve prints and drawings. "

Roll some crepe paper into a small ball.,
Cover the ball with yellow crepe paper and secure it to a wire stem.,
Wrap yellow embroidery thread 9 to 10 times around two fingers.,
Pull off the looped thread and cut it.,
Spread the floss across a strip of double-sided tape.,
Wrap the double-sided tape around the base of the ball.,
Cut crepe paper into rectangles for the base of the petals.,

Secure the a leaf stem to the main stem.,
Secure the next two leaf stems, spacing them 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) apart.,
Finish wrapping the tape around the main stem.,
Finish shaping the flower.",How to Make Crepe Paper Peonies," The ball should be about the size of a marble, a blueberry, or your thumb. Yellow crepe paper will work the best for this, but you can use white as well., Place the ball on top of a green, wire florist's stem. Cover it with a small square of yellow crepe paper. Wrap and twist the crepe paper around the ball to secure it to the stem, just like wrapping a lollipop. Set the stem aside when you are done., Place the end of your yellow embroidery thread across your index and middle finger. Wrap it 9 to 10 times around those fingers, like making a pompom or tassel.Choose a color that matches your yellow crepe paper.

, Slide the looped thread off of your fingers first. Cut through the top and bottom loops with a sharp pair of scissors. You will now have 18 to 20 short strands of embroidery thread. Keep them all together., Cut off a strip of double-sided tape that's long enough to hold your pieces of embroidery thread. Set it down onto a smooth surface, like a metal tray, wax paper, or parchment paper. Spread the cut threads across the tape to make a fringe. Make sure that the bottom ends of the threads are aligned with the bottom, long edge of the tape.If you don't have enough threads, cut more using the same technique as before.

, Press down on the threads first to make sure that they are stuck to the tape. Peel the tape off, then wrap it around the base of the ball, where the twisted part is. Make sure that the threads are on the outside and pointing upwards.Don't worry if it looks messy now; you will be covering this up eventually.

, You will need 10 strips of 2½-inch (6.35-centimeter) long and ¾-inch (1.91-centimeter) wide crepe paper for the small petals, and 10 strips of 2½-inch (6.35-centimeter) long and 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide crepe paper for the large petals. You can use white or pale pink crepe paper.Try to use 180-gram Italian crepe paper if you can. It is much thicker than regular crepe paper and easier to stretch and sculpt.
For something more realistic, consider making 5 of the small petals pale yellow., Make each petal shaped like a tear drop with a wavy, rippled edge along the top.If you want to, you can add a small tab to the bottom of each petal to make it easier to secure to the stem.Stack several sheets of paper at once while cutting. You can also make a template out of cardstock or thin cardboard and use that instead.

, Take a small petal, and make little upward tugs along the top edge to create a ruffle. Gently pull the side edges apart at the center to form a cup shape. Do this for all 10 small petals., Take a large petal, and pull the side edges apart to form a cup shape. Do this for all 10 large petals. You can add a ruffle to some of the top edges, but leave some unruffled for the outer petals., Apply some hot glue to the tabbed part of your first, small petal. Press the tab against the wire stem, just below the stamen ball. Wrap the edges of the tab around the stem so that it doesn't stick out.

If you made some pale yellow petals, start with one of these., Overlap each petal slightly, so that the side edge of the first petal is touching the inside of the next petal.If you made any pale yellow petals, start with these, then move on to the white or pink ones.

, Each layer needs to have 5 large petals. If you made some large petals ruffles, start with these, and finish with the unruffled ones., Make them skinny and oval shaped, with pointed tips. To make the leaves easier to secure to the stem, add a small tab at the bottom of each one., Add a bead of hot glue to the tabbed part of the leaf. Press the tab against the stem, just below the bloom. Continue glue leaves all around the base of the bloom; you may not end up using all of them.

Have these leaves pressed up against the base of the bloom.

, These leaves should be shaped a little like a bird or T-rex footprint, or like three fingers making a W symbol. Do not add tabs to these leaves., Draw a short, vertical line of hot glue down the center of one leaf, right at the base. Quickly press a new wire stem into the glue. Repeat this step for the remaining two leaves. Your leaf stems are almost complete., Take your first leaf stem. Wrap green florist's tape around it, starting at the base of the leaf. Continue wrapping for 4 inches (10.16 centimeters), overlapping each later slightly. Tear off the tape, but don't trim the wire. Repeat this step for the remaining two leaf stems., Start wrapping at the base of the bloom. Continue wrapping the tape, overlapping each layer slightly, for about 4 inches (10.16 centimeters). Tear off the tape, and leave the bottom of the stem intact., Place the a leaf stem against the main stem, just below the bloom. Make sure that the taped part of the leaf stem is sticking out, and the bare part is against the main stem. Secure the leaf stem to the main stem with green florist's tape. Wrap it around both stems for 4 inches (10.16 centimeters), then tear it off., Place the second leaf stem right where you finished wrapping, about 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) below the first one. Secure it to the main stem in a similar fashion. Wrap for 3 to 4 inches (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters), then add your final leaf stem.Make sure that the taped pat of each leaf stem is sticking out.

, When you reach the bottom, tear the tape off. Cut the excess wire stems off with a pair of heavy-duty wire cutters., At this point, your flower is essentially done. The petals will all be clumped together, like a closed flower. If you want to make the flower look fuller, gently pull down on the petals to open the bloom up.The leaf stems will be pointing upward. If you want to, you can gently pull down on them so they stick out of the stem at different angles."

Create two openings.,
Create a frame for a screen.,
Add a translucent screen.,
Demonstrate your camera.",How to Make a Shoebox Pinhole Camera1," On one of the box’s smaller sides, use a pin or needle to punch a round hole that is roughly 0.8 inches (2 mm) in diameter  in the center of the box’s side. On the box’s other small end, use a pen or pencil to trace a rectangle with a border of about a half-inch to an 1” (1.27 to 2.54 cm) between the edge of the outline and the edge of the box on all sides. Use a utility blade to cut along the outline., First, measure the inside dimensions of the shoebox’s smaller ends. Use a pen or pencil to trace an outline of these dimensions on a sheet of cardboard with the help of a ruler. Use a utility blade to cut along the outline. Slide the cardboard cutout into the shoebox, covering the larger opening. Use a pen or pencil to trace the outline of the opening on the cardboard inside the box. Remove the cutout and cut along the new outline to create your frame., Lay your cardboard frame on top of a sheet of translucent plastic. Trace the outside of the frame on the plastic with a pen or marker. Remove the frame and use scissors to cut out the plastic. Lay the plastic cutout over the cardboard frame and staple them together along each side of the frame. Insert your screen inside the shoebox once you are finished so that it covers the large opening.A plastic shopping bag will suffice as cheap, ready-at-hand material for your screen.

, Set your shoebox camera on a flat surface. Aim the pinhole end at a well-lighted object. Cover the shoebox with a large black cloth. Pull the cloth black to uncover the pinhole. Drape the cloth protruding from the other end over your head. Block out as much ambient light as possible so you can see the well-lighted object projected through the pinhole onto the translucent screen inside your shoebox.This is a very basic device, so even objects that are well lit still appear only very dimly on your screen. However, it still demonstrates the basic principle of how an analog camera captures images on film if you use your hand as a shutter.

Make your box as light-proof as possible.,
Create a film holder.,
Make an aperture.,
Load your camera.,
Take a picture.,
Develop your film.,
Assess your image.",How to Make a Shoebox Pinhole Camera2," Reduce the amount of ambient light that it might create. Open the box and hold it up to a light source. Use duct tape, electrical tape, or any other kind that is opaque to block out any light creeping in through any cracks or splits. Spray-paint the box black, both inside and out., Measure the inside dimensions of one of the box’s smaller ends. Use a ruler and a pen or pencil to trace an outline of these dimensions on a piece of cardboard. Add an extra inch to two sides to create wings. Cut out this outline with a utility blade. Fold the wings back so that you can stand your film holder up inside the box. Spray-paint this cardboard cutout black as well to keep the inside of the box as dark as possible., In the center of one of the box’s smaller sides, cut a small square hole, roughly a half-inch by a half-inch (1.27 cm x 1.27 cm). Now cut a slightly larger square from a roll of tin or aluminum foil. Tape this foil square over the hole. Be sure to secure all edges so no light creeps into the box from around the foil. Use a pin, needle, or thumbtack to poke a hole in the foil. Finally, stick a small strip of electrical tape over your aperture to use as a shutter.Tape your foil to the inside of the box so the electrical tape doesn’t rip it off the box when you open your shutter.

, Do this is a dark room. Remove a sheet of photographic paper from its box and tape its edges along the film holder, with the paper’s glossy side facing the aperture. Insert the film holder back into the box with the paper facing the aperture. If needed, paper-clip the wings to each side of the box to keep the film holder in place. Replace the shoebox’s lid and seal the edges with electrical tape to keep light out. Double-check that the shutter is still in place before leaving the dark room.When putting the film holder back into the shoebox, use the photographic paper’s longest side to determine how far away from the aperture it should be placed. For example, a 4x6 sheet of paper should be placed 6” away from the aperture.

, Set your shoebox on a flat surface well away from anything that might disturb it. Aim the aperture at the object whose image you wish to capture. Lift the shutter and expose the film. Close the shutter over the aperture again after 30 seconds.When you use your camera for the first time, use it in a setting with controlled lighting so you can replicate the shot later.

, In a dark room, fill one plastic container with developer, fill another with water, and fill a third with fixer. Remove your photographic paper from your camera and place in the first container. Agitate it in the developer for a couple minutes. Once an image begins to emerge, transfer it to water. Once you have rinsed it, place it in the fixer. Let it sit for 5 minutes and then hold under running water for 15 minutes to rinse off the fixer., Learning how long to expose your photographic paper will require some trial and error. Plan on taking a series of test pictures of one object in a controlled setting. Once you have developed your first picture, note how light or dark it is. If the image appears too light (or doesn’t appear at all), increase your exposure the next time around. If it appears too dark (or is totally blacked out), decrease your exposure.Note that your developed image will be in negative, meaning that something that is black in real life will appear white, and vice versa.

Cover the hole.,
Add a “screen.” Cut out a piece of plain white paper that is roughly the same size as your foil.,
Cut a square viewing hole.,
Use your box.",How to Make a Shoebox Pinhole Camera3," Fetch a roll of duct tape, electrical tape, or any other type that is totally opaque. Open your shoebox. Hold it up to a light source to see if any cracks, joins, or holes are permitting light to enter the box from the outside. If so, cover those areas with tape to keep all unnecessary light out. Do the same with the cover to the shoebox.

, Use a pencil or pen to trace a 1”x1” (2.54 cm x 2.54 cm) hole on one of the box’s smaller ends. Place it near the edge of the box’s bottom, but leave about a half-inch of space between the hole and the edge so you don’t accidentally tear the edge when you make your cut. Use a utility blade to cut the hole along your outline.For safety’s sake, always have the sharp end of the blade facing away from you in case it slips.

, Cut out a piece of tin or aluminum foil that is slightly larger than your hole. Cover the hole from the inside and tape the foil’s edges to the inside of the box. Use a pin, needle, or thumbtack to prick a very tiny hole in the foil. Aim for the center.Make sure the foil is pulled taut when you tape it. Otherwise, you may end up only pushing the foil with your pin or needle instead of poking a hole through it.

, Place it inside the box, directly across from the foil, in the exact same position along the box’s other smaller end. Tape it in place along its edges. Close the box with its cover once you finish.When the foil end is aimed at the eclipse, the sunlight should penetrate the foil through the hole you poked and then strike the piece of paper that you just taped up at the opposite end, just like a film projector aimed at a theater screen.

, Trace another 1”x1” (2.54 cm x 2.54 cm) outline to cut along one of the box’s longer sides. Use your utility blade to cut the hole out. Peer inside and make sure you have a clear view of the white screen.If you placed both the foil and the white screen near the bottom of the box, you can judge the best angle for viewing the screen from the top before closing the box.
If the lid to your box is totally detachable, you can also use other lids to cut new viewing holes if your first attempt does not provide a good view of the screen.

, Seal the lid with opaque tape to keep any more light from creeping into the box. Just before the eclipse begins, aim the foil end of the box at the sun. Check its shadow to make sure the box is lined up perfectly with the sun. As the eclipse begins, peer into the box through the viewing hole. Look for a circle of light projected onto the white screen. Track the moon’s shadow over this circle of light as the moon passes between Earth and the sun."

, Make sure to add the camera, the outline of the screen, and the home button. Again, add details like the little square on the home button to make them look realistic. Use pictures of real iPhones as references so that you know what to draw.

, Use wide tape like boxing tape so that it fits the screen. This gives your screen a glossy look, but it will also become an important part of protecting the paper phone when we get to changing screens later.

, Draw a detailed representation of the iPhone lock screen on it. Print a picture to be the background image, or use plain paper and colour it so it looks real. Add details like the amount of battery left,

, This will help protect the paper screen when you take it on and off.

,, The reason why you are not drawing your lock screen on your iPhone is so that it looks like it actually works when you change screens, instead of just having one screen.

, Draw a detailed home screen on it. Include any apps or other details you want, and color it in so it looks realistic. Again, stick a piece of tape on the paper to allow for easy sticking and un-sticking.

, This will allow you to stick and unstick it easily, so that you can swap out which screen is on your iPhone.

, The more screens you have, the more realistic your iPhone will be and the more it will be able to do. Swapping them in and out often will make it feel like your iPhone is actually working.

Find a box that catches your eye.,
Make a box.,
Put a lock on the box.",How to Make a Memory Box1," This box can be made from plastic, cardboard, metal, wood – or any other sturdy material. The box can be plain and simple, or rich and ornate. Poke around at thrift shops, antique stores, and estate sales. Look for boxes at junkyards, dumps, and recycled building centers. Try to use a box with which you feel a special connection.Always be on the lookout. You might notice the box laying on the sidewalk on your way to school, or stuffed into the depths of your garage, or jutting out of a dumpster behind your apartment complex.
Consider using a suitcase, or an old lunchbox, or a shoebox. The ""box"" can be any container that holds your memories.;
, You can craft a simple box from paper, or you can make a sturdier box out of wood. The box should be large enough to hold all of the ""memories"" that you want to save. Plan ahead: you'll probably want to put many more things in here! In general, try to build something at least as large as a shoebox or an old-fashioned hatbox.

, You don't need to lock the box up, but it might make your memories feel a bit more secure. You can build a lock into the box, if you want to get crafty. Otherwise, you can use a combination lock or a simple keyed lock to seal the lid to the rest of the box. Think about what you'll be putting in here, and consider how much you would care if anyone else looked through it.

"
"
Decide whether to decorate the box.,
Stick something inside the lid.,
Personalize the outside of the box.,
Label the box.",How to Make a Memory Box2," If you want to keep the box private and discreet, then you probably don't want to do much with the outside unless you plan to hide it somewhere very safe. On the other hand, you might want to personalize your memory box so that it very clearly belongs to you. Think about the purpose of this box, and think about the sensitivity of the memories that you'll be putting into it.


If you are making a memory box for someone else, then you'll want to decorate it with their needs in mind. Think about whether this person would want a colorful, heavily decorated memory box or a plain, discreet box.
Consider that people might be less likely to snoop into the box if it looks boring and ordinary. On the other hand, personalized decoration can be a signal to stay away. People might open an ordinary-looking box thinking that something else is inside it.

, Tape or glue pictures or photographs that mean a lot to you. Perhaps you have a treasured note from a friend or relative. Perhaps there is a sticker, or a concert ticket, or a postcard that you want to see every time you open the box. If you use tape, then you can change out these ""featured memories"" for other meaningful items as you live your life and make new memories.

, Consider painting the surface: in solid colors, or with a more detailed picture. You can make the design simple, or you can make it a colorful swirl of personality. Get creative! This box is yours to design.


Use glitter and rhinestones to add sparkle and flair to the outside of the box. Cover the box in chalkboard paint so that you can write on it with chalk. Glue ceramic tiles and/or mirror shards to the surface to make a mosaic.
Try gluing or sewing fabric to the surface of the box. If you're into furry things, attach fake fur to the outside. Use a floral print, or flannel, or denim – anything that says something about your personality! You can cut swaths of fabric from old clothes, curtains, blankets, and other textiles.

, Try writing your name or the ""theme"" of the memories directly onto the box in paint, pen, or marker. You can also cut out letters (from paper, cardboard, wood) and glue them on. Consider printing the words onto a sticker using a printer or a label-maker. If you want to make it clear that the box is private, make a tag that says ""Property of . Do not open!""


Make a memory box for a specific trip or time. For instance, you might make a memory box to preserve all of your photos, letters, and items from summer camp, or from the past year at school, or from a memorable trip that you took."
"
Place memories in the box.,
Continue to fill the box.,
Make a box for a friend or relative.,
Keep the box somewhere safe.",How to Make a Memory Box3," You can fill the box with personal treasures that relate to a specific trip or time, or you can loosely reserve the box for any meaningful items that come into your life. This is a space for anything that you want to save. You don't need to fill the box up yet!


Fill the box with old letters, notes, and birthday cards. Fold up and save any words that people have written to you. Later, you'll read back over these words and cherish the connections that you've made.
Store photographs of special times. If you don't have any physical photos, you can print them from your computer, or you can save them to a flash or USB drive and put the drive into the box.
Keep art, broken things, and found objects. Perhaps you want to preserve the picture that your best friend drew for you, or the remnants of your favorite charm bracelet that broke, or a special rock that you found on the beach.

, As time goes by, save the meaningful things that you find or receive. Put these items into the box for safekeeping. You never know when you'll want to dig them out and relive the past.

, This can be a great way to commemorate a friendship: with items that remind your friend of shared memories. A memory box can also be a great gift to a parent or grandparent. As people grow older, they have more and more memories to look back upon – and it can be very rewarding to have a lot of those memories stored in one place.


If you have a relative with Alzheimers or another memory impairment, a memory box can be a great way to help him or her keep in touch with the past., If you feel secure doing so, you can simply place the box on a shelf in your room or your closet. If you want to keep the memories a bit more secure, you might place the box in a dresser drawer, or under your bed, or in a secret compartment that only you know about.

Decide what kind of love box you want to make.,
Find a basic box.Pick any box.,
Assemble your crafts materials.,
Decorate the exterior.,
Add a surprise to the inside of the lid.,
Figure out what defines your relationship.Again, there are countless permutations that might inform the way your love box looks.,
Buy a thoughtful gift.,
Do something creative and put it in the box.Write a poem.,
Enclose photos and souvenirs.A love box is meant as a way for both people in the relationship to reflect.,
Present the completed love box to your boyfriend.",How to Make a Love Box for Your Boyfriend," At the end of the day, a love box needs to carry an individual character, indicative of you, your boyfriend, and the weird, wonderful connection you share together. Think of things that mean a lot to the both of you. How did you meet? If there's a certain big interest you share, like music, that might be a good place to start when it comes to designing your love box.


If you met him at a sporting event, for example, you might decorate the box with footballs and references to whatever game you met at.
For another example: If you met him through your mutual appreciation of classic progressive rock, you might adorn your box with references to Genesis and Van der Graaf Generator. This example may be transposed to fit any genre.;
, Ideally, it should be small enough to feel intimate, but just big enough to fit the things you want inside of it. Especially if you're looking to decorate the exterior a lot, you're going to want one that's plain. Otherwise, you can always dress the outside with glued construction paper, and work from there.


If you're really the arts and crafts type, you can even try your hand at creating your own box from scratch. Wood and cardboard are recommended sources to work with.
Plastic tupperware actually works quite well for a box, though it's recommended you tape black construction paper around it to make the inside contents a surprise.

, The sort of materials you'll need to make your love box will depend entirely on what you want to do with it. Here are a few things that you'll probably need regardless:


A pair of scissors.
Some construction paper.
Pens and/or pencils.
Tape and/or glue.

, Decorating the exterior is a lot more enjoyable if you have a clear idea where you want to go with it. Do the basics first; cover the box with construction paper, and move towards accessorizing once you've got the basics down pat. Don't be afraid to get creative! The exterior will be your boyfriend's first impression with the love box, so you should make sure it makes a strong impact on him before he even peruses its contents.


Don't go overboard with flair; going the extra mile with accessories may seem like a good way to show your boyfriend how much you love him, but it might make the box look like a crowded mess!

, When your boyfriend finally opens up the love box, the first thing he's going to see is whatever's on the inside of the lid. Some people might not even consider the potential of having something on the inside lid, but your love box should take advantage of that potential. There are many things you could tape or glue on the inside lid. Make sure it's something that feels especially meaningful to the two of you. Here are a few examples that might fit:


A picture of the two of you.
A love letter, explaining the purpose of the box and how much they mean to you.
A list of things you love about them.
An abstract doodle intended to convey your timeless passion.

, How long have you two been together? How old are you? Where, when and how did you meet? There can be no step-by-step process for defining what makes your connection unique; take some time to figure out what you love most about your boyfriend, and find an artistic way of expressing that.


Put your talents to best use. If you're a great writer, writing a poem or a fictionalized interpretation of how you met might be a great way to decorate the inside lid. If you're a great artist, a small painting might do just the trick.

, If you don't think your homemade items are enough, it might be extra sweet to go out and buy a gift. Keep it small but meaningful. Boyfriends are sometimes difficult to buy worthwhile presents for, but offering a gift in a new love box will make it feel that much more special.


For instance, if your boyfriend's really excited for a show, pick up a pair of concert tickets and hide them at the bottom of the box.

, Paint a picture. Write a cute letter by hand. Draw a portrait of him. The possibilities are endless. Strut your stuff, show off your creative talents. Whatever you're best at, you should capitalize on when filling up your love box. Your boyfriend is sure to be impressed!

, One of the best way to do this is to enclose things that will spark memories. If you have any photos you took together early on in the relationship, add them into the box. If you have any souvenirs (like concert tickets) of things you've seen together, put those in too.


A great love box isn't a one-off deal; you'll be able to add more things to it over time as you experience more things together.

, Make sure you have somewhere quiet and intimate you can present the gift to him. Depending on the amount of content you've packed into making it, it could take a while to digest it all, and you don't want any interruptions putting a damper on the experience. Sit next to him, and watch as he looks at the gift. Chances are he'll love it.


If you want to go the extra mile, you can gift wrap the love box.

Prepare strips of paper to weave your basket.,
Weave the base of your basket.,
Fold up the strips sticking out the sides of the basket.,
Weave a strip of colored paper between the now vertical strips of the base, folding it to fit around the corner of the basket.,
Repeat the above step with another strip of the same color.,
Finish and polish off your basket.,Done








",How to Make a Paper Basket1," Use three sheets of 8.5"" x 11"" construction paper. On the sheet of paper to become the base of your basket, draw a horizontal line 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) from the top and another one 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) from the bottom. These lines will help when laying out the base. Then cut the paper lengthwise into strips .5"" wide.









Choose one sheet of a neutral color of construction paper like brown, black, or white. This will be the base of your basket. The other two sheets can be any color of your choice. This will form the decorative sides of your basket.;
, Lay out 8 strips of paper (the color you've chosen as the base) next to each other so that the lines on each strip are face up and form one continuous line. Starting at the top line, weave another strip of the same color through the strips you've laid out, over one strip and under the next. Center the strip horizontally with respect to the strips you laid out. Using another strip of the same color, weave it through the strips in the opposite way from the first one, so that this one will go underneath the strips that the first one you weaved went on top of. Then slide the strips together, making sure the edges line up.









Repeat with a total of eight strips.
The finished base should have a 4"" x 4"" woven square that fits just inside the lines you drew on each strip. In other words, you should have a square that has eight strips sticking evenly out 3.5"" on each side.

, Each side should come up to the same height.









It can be helpful to put a 4"" x 4"" box or block of wood in the center of your basket and fold the strips up against this block. This will make the next steps easier.

,









You will need to use approximately one and a half strips to make it all the way around the basket. You can simply tape or glue the two pieces together. Try to place the connection so that it comes on the inside of the basket and is hidden by a strip from the base. This will give your basket a clean, seamless look.
Weave the strip all the way around the basket. When the two ends meet, tape or glue them together, hiding the tape in the same way.

, Make sure to alternate between going under and on top of strips, so that you create a checkerboard pattern with the strips from the base.









Keep repeating until you reach the top.

, Tape or glue the ends of the base strips to the top woven strip. Then tape or glue a slightly wider strip of the base color to the top of the basket on the inside, laying it on top of the vertical strips. Add a similar panel on the outside of the basket, securing it to the inside one as well as the outside of the basket.









If you want to add a handle, simply tape or glue each end of a long strip of paper to opposite sides of the basket before you add the top panel.

Roll newspaper into tubes.,
Use a circular piece of cardboard to form the base.,
Use a second piece of cardboard, identical to the first, to finish the base.,
Fold the rays up and begin weaving.,
When you come to the end of one tube, attach it to the next one by sliding its end inside the next tube.,
Continue weaving until you near the top of the rays or reach the desired height of your basket.,
Fold over the rays to finish the basket.,Done

",How to Make a Paper Basket2," First, cut a sheet of newspaper into quarters vertically - this does not have to be precise. Then place a wooden skewer at one corner of a sheet of paper. Place it at a slight angle so that the rolled tube you will end up with is longer than the sheet of paper itself. Then roll the paper around the dowel, making sure to keep it tight. Once you have finished rolling, put a drop of glue on the last corner to hold the roll together.


You will need many tubes of paper, so repeat this process for each.
In place of a wooden skewer, you can use a thin knitting needle, a 3mm dowel, or anything similarly long, narrow, and round.







, This can be as large or small as you want your basket to be. Glue paper tubes to the cardboard so that they radiate away from the center in rays. Make sure to use an odd number of tubes for this.


You will need to use more rays for larger bases. The closer together the rays are, the tighter your weave will be.







, Glue this piece of cardboard to the first so that the paper tubes are firmly pressed between the two pieces.


Leave a heavy weight on top of the base while it dries to make sure that everything is nice and secure.

, Fold a new paper tube over one of the rays and glue the folded end to the working end. Then weave the tube in and out of the rays, over one and under the next. Make sure it sits snug as far down as possible - at first on the base, and later, on top of previously woven tubes.


As you weave, the rolled tubes will flatten out. This will make your basket stronger.

, This will essentially make one long tube that will form your whole basket.

, When you're ready to stop weaving, fold the end of the tube you're weaving with over a ray and glue it to itself.

, Cut each ray about an inch past the top of the basket. Then:


For each ray that stands on the outside (the last tube you wove past the ray went to the inside of the ray), fold the end over the basket and glue it to the inside of the basket. Use a clothespin to hold it in place while the glue dries.






For each ray that stands on the inside (the last tube you wove went outside the ray), fold the end over the basket. Instead of gluing these to the outside, tuck the end inside the woven basket at the second row from the top, securing it in a way that makes it fit into the weave of the basket.

Place the lid on the container.",How to Make a Money Box1," You’ll want a container large and sturdy enough for your particular purpose that includes a plastic lid, like a can of nuts.


Empty the container of its contents.
Wash and dry the inside.;
, Make sure the lid is sitting so that it’s resting flat against the cutting surface for stability.Find the largest coin you have (like a quarter or half-dollar). Using the coin as a guide, trace the outline for the slot opening with a permanent marker or felt-tip pen.

, Using the outline you traced, cut a hole for the coin slot with a craft knife.Be extremely careful when using the craft knife, as it’s quite sharp. If a child is doing the project, perform this step for them.

, Using the same coin, test the slot you’ve cut in the lid to be sure it’s big enough.


If the slot is too small, carefully use the craft knife to trim the edges until it’s the right size.

, Using a flexible measuring tape or ribbon, measure the container so you can wrap it with the right amount of paper or fabric.


Measure the circumference of the container; write down the measurement, adding one or two centimeters for overlap allowance.Measure the height of the container and write it down.

, This is what will turn your can from a boring food container to an attractive, personalized money box.


Choose or cut out a piece of paper or fabric large enough to wrap all the way around the container.
Lay the paper or fabric face-down on your cutting surface.

, Using the height and circumference measurements you wrote down, use a ruler to draw a rectangle of the same height.


Use the circumference (including the additional centimeter or two) for the width of the rectangle.

, After tracing out the rectangle, cut it from the paper or fabric using the outline as a guide.Once the rectangle is cut, wrap it around the container to make sure it fits properly. If it’s too large, trim it down to size. If it’s too small, begin again with a new piece of paper or fabric.

, Before securing the paper or fabric to the container, lay it down right side up and write or draw any of the decorations you plan to use.


It will be significantly easier to perform this step while the paper or fabric is lying flat than when it’s wrapped around the container.

, When you’ve finished adding any desired writing or drawings, flip the fabric or paper upside down.


Spread a thin layer of glue over the entire backside.
Slowly and carefully wrap the paper or fabric around the container, smoothing it with your hand as you go.
The paper or fabric should ideally overlap, but if it doesn’t and a small strip of the container is visible, cover it with a ribbon, a strip of colored paper, or another decoration.

, After the paper or fabric is secure, add any additional decorations you may want.


At this stage, you can add decorations like buttons, ribbons, jewels, etc. Use hot glue if the decoration is heavy or won’t stay in place with regular glue.

, Finally, place the lid with the coin slot on the container.


When the glue is dry, your money box will be ready for use.

This particular design mimics the look of a tiered wedding cake or a stack of gifts.


Choose three gift boxes (or whatever number you prefer). The boxes you choose can be square or round, depending on your own preference or the wedding theme.
The boxes should be in descending size, in order to create what will appear to be a stack.

, The box you choose is up to you; the top box will be easier for people to see, while the middle box will be larger.


The placement of the slot depends on how you're decorating the box and what you think will be more visually pleasing.
Use a ruler and marker to trace out a rectangular shape either on the lid or side of the top box or on the side of the middle box. The rectangle should be slim but both long and wide enough to accommodate long envelopes.
Cut out a neat rectangle shape. Use a craft knife to cut out the rectangle shape to form an envelope slot. A craft knife is preferable over scissors, which will leave ragged edges.

, Use a ruler to measure length and width or each side of each gift box.Write down the dimensions of each.

, Using the measurements for reference, lay the paper or fabric upside down on a flat surface.


Trace the dimensions of each side of each box onto the paper or fabric. If necessary, label the outlines so you’ll know which box they belong to.

, Position the paper into a diamond shape in front of you, and then fold each corner into the center of the X. Again, make sure they meet perfectly for your box to turn out exactly symmetrical.


Having it in a diamond shape in front of you is important for the purposes of this tutorial. Corners will be referred to as “top,” “bottom,” “left,” and “right.” Keep the paper in front of you in this shape to make it easier to follow along.

, Open up the top and bottom flaps, leaving the two side flaps tucked into the center. Then, fold each one into the center again, the straight vertical line of the edges matching the straight vertical line of the center.


You should be looking at an oblong shape with a point at the top and a point at the bottom.

, You should see a diamond shape in front of you with vertical lines every couple of inches. Leave the top and bottom triangle flaps (two of the first folds you made) pointing towards the center. You need to now cut these flaps.


Fold lines should be going down the center of the right and left sides of each triangle. Cut the triangles on these lines until the triangle stops (when the pretty paper ends). This forms two new triangles on the sides of each main triangle (what is now a house shape).

, You know those two main triangles you just snipped on either side? Take the base of both (the house-shaped part) and fold the tips (the roof) in.


Fold it into the original fold line, where the flaps first met the center. You’re essentially taking the “house” and separating the “roof” from the base with a fold.

, Take the two intact triangles on the sides and fold them in. Then take the smaller triangles (on the sides of the folded-over houses – the ones that came from the snips you made) and fold them over the larger triangles. They should be folded all the way until the cut stops.


You can see now that these are the creases of your box – the sides are starting to form.

, The side flaps have a fold in the center that turns them into a triangle and a square, if that fold were to separate them. Just glue down the triangular tip into the center of the original X.


You can use Mod Podge, a glue stick, or regular white school glue – just make sure you don’t get it all over the place and wind up with a sticky mess.

, Where the tips are glued down, lift the sides up – you’ll see that they form the sides of the box (because they’re glued, they’ll kind of be coming up on their own anyway). Once those are up, take the top and bottom flaps and wrap them over, their tips meeting the center as well.


Wrapping the top and bottom over the sides and having their points meet in the center will form all 4 sides of the box – now it all just needs to be adhered together.

, Everything that rests on the bottom of the box – in the triangles between the lines of the original X – should be glued down. This will form a square bottom and 4 upright sides. In other words, half of a gift box.

, What you just did was the top half of the box, and naturally it needs to be a bit bigger than the bottom. Take the same size paper you just worked with and cut off ⅛” length-wise and width-wise.


Then, all you need to do is repeat. The two sides, when finished, will fit snugly together into a beautiful, sturdy gift box.

Get one piece of 9” x 9” stiff craft felt and one piece of 6.25” x 6.25” stiff craft felt.,
Make a series of slits for the box bottom.,
Make a series of slits for the box top.,
Crease the “tabs.” Everywhere you see a triangle shape is a tab.,
Bring the sides of the box up with tabs on the inside.,
Do the same for the box top.,
Glue the tabs to the sides and voilà.",How to Make a Gift Box3," Some craft felt is very, very expensive. You’d never think felt would cost a pretty penny, but it can. Skip that aisle and go for the stiffer, cheap version that most craft supply stores have, too. You need it to be stiff anyway.


This shape of box has a taller bottom half and a shorter lid, hence the size discrepancy between the two sheets of felt. Of course, you can adjust these dimensions how you see fit.

, The box bottom is the sheet that’s 9"" x 9”. Grab that sheet and your scissors. When you’re finished, you’ll be left with a sort of plus-sign, with triangular tops and bottoms. Here’s how:


Make cuts on the sides forming two 3” flaps that are 3” deep in the center of the paper. In other words, make a 3” inch cut at inch 3 and a 3” cut at inch 6 on either side.
On the tops and bottom, make lines at 3” and at 6” going all the way down to the center, where the flaps you just cut stop. At this point, you’ll have a cross or a plus sign shape.
At 1.5” inches on each side of the top and bottom lines, cut diagonally into the center, where the flaps stop. You now have a plus sign that looks triangular on the top and bottom.

, Grab your other sheet of felt – the one that’s a bit smaller. This shape is similar, but has slight, important differences. With your scissors in hand, here’s what to do:


On the sides, at 1.5 inches from the top and at 1.5 inches from the bottom, make a 1.5” deep cut.
From the corners, cut diagonally until you meet the other cut you just made, removing little triangles from the edges of your square piece of felt.
You’ll see a fatter plus sign (fatter than the one you just made, that is), also triangle-shaped at the top and bottom.

, There are two on the top and two on the bottom. Crease it at its base to make it stiffer and easier to assemble.


You’re essentially turning this odd shape into a plus sign, with little triangles on the left and right of each of the strips on the top and bottom.

, Take each “side” and fold it into the center. You’ll see how the very center of the felt sheet is a perfect square – that’s the bottom. You’ll also see that you now have 4 sides around the bottom – the sides of your box. Bring those up with the tabs on the inside.


When you bring the sides of the box up, the top and bottom tabs should be on the inside of the right and left sides of the box. These are the connectors that will join the sides together.

, Take your smaller piece of felt and follow the same directions. Crease the “tabs” on the sides of the top and bottom of your felt. Do you see the shape of the box and how to do it? It’s the same idea, just a slightly different size.


Fold the sides into the center, making the bottom distinct from the sides of the box.
Lift up all the sides, making sure the tabs on the top and bottom are on the inside of the right and left sides.

, You’re holding in your hands two box halves that are ready to go once you glue them together. You can use whatever you have on hand, though hot glue is easiest. Just dab a bit on the center of the tabs, making sure not to squeeze it outward and all over the sides of the box.


Let it dry for a few minutes, holding the tabs to the sides of the box. Then place the box top over the base of the box and marvel at your handiwork.

Cut the greeting card in half along the fold.,
Trim ⅛” along the short and long sides of one half of the card.,
Score 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the edge on all sides.,
Fold both in along the score lines.,
On the short ends of the cards, make two small cuts.,
Put a small dab of glue on the outside of the newly formed tabs.,
Fold up the sides with the tabs on the inside.,
Repeat for the other card half and you’re done.",How to Make a Gift Box4," For the purposes of this tutorial, we’ll be working with a standard, rectangular greeting card. A square card works, but different dimensions apply.


If the card has writing on it that you want to cover up on the inside, simply glue down a piece of paper over it. It will be the bottom of your box that won’t be seen once filled.

, This will be your box bottom. It needs to be just ever so slightly smaller than your box top as the box top needs to fits over it.

, This makes a sort of tic-tac-toe shape, where the center row is wider than the top and bottom. Do this on both halves of your greeting card.


If you don’t have a paper cutter, you can use a ruler and a bone cutter or even an empty ballpoint pen. Essentially this just ensures a perfectly even fold line.

, Rotating around and around, fold on each score line like it’s going to be a side of your box (which it will). Do this on both halves of the card.


Do your best to fold perfectly straight along the lines. If the folds are off, your box won’t be even and it likely won’t fit together as well as you’d like.

, Since we’re dealing with a rectangle shape, place it in front of you the long way – you’ll then make cuts on the right and left. Make these cuts where the score lines intersect. Again, the cuts should be on the short end of the card halves.


There should be two on each side – an inch from the bottom and an inch from the top. This calls for 8 cuts (4 for each half), which creates four “tabs.” These are how your box halves will fit together.

, Just a small dab will do it; too much and it’ll flow over the tab and into your box. Make sure it’s on the outside (the pretty side), as the outside will connect to the inside of the bigger flap. Do this on each card 4 times.


Alternatively, you can use double-sided tape. Try to stay away from regular tape as this adds bulk to the sides of your card and can keep it from fitting together and looking clean and put-together.

, Along the creased score lines, fold up the sides of each half of the card. Make sure the tabs are on the inside of the box, with the glue between the tab and the other flap.


Press the tabs into the side and hold them for a few seconds, holding them together. Make sure the tabs directly line up with the edge of newly-formed box.

, With glue on the tabs, fold up the sides, forming the box half. Press the tabs into the side of the box, securing them together with the glue.


Place the box top over the box bottom; it should fit snugly. The only task left is to fill it!

Get some cardstock paper.,
Use a ruler to draw a cross shape on the paper.,
Add an extra square to the bottom of the cross.,
Add flaps.,
Cut out the cross shape with a pair of scissors.,
Fold the left and right sides of the cross upwards.,
Fold the longest part of the cross (two squares) upright.,
Fold the top square of the longest part of the cross over.,
Tape or glue all six sides of the cube together.,
Admire your cube.",How to Make a 3D Cube2," It's important that the paper is thick enough that it will hold its shape and will not bend if you fill it with an object. You also don't want it to be too thick, which will prevent you from being able to make crisp folds. Generally, 110 pound cardstock will work as long as you are not filling it with anything heavy.









Depending on your project, you might want ornamental paper or plain white. You can also decorate the paper or decorate the finished box.

, The cross should be composed of a square in the center with four squares adjacent on all sides.









These squares will fold up to form the sides of the box.

, Make sure you have enough space on the paper to put it there.









This will be the top of the box.

, These should be on the sides of the top, left and right of the cross, leaving the joint two squares at the bottom as they are.









These flaps will be used as joints to secure each side of the cube, and you can choose if you want to glue them inside or outside of the box to determine whether you will see them on the final product. If you can make them neat and even, the final product will look better.

, Be sure to cut outside the lines of the flaps and do not cut any of the lines connecting the squares.









Once the whole thing is cut out, you will be able to fold and then secure the right places to form a cube.

, This should make a right angle.









Be sure to make nice, crisp folds. You can use your fingernail to ensure that the folds are crisp.

, This should also form a right angle.









Again, crisp folds look best on the finished product.

, This forms the top of the cube.









Hold these in place while you fold the other sides to meet it.

, If you use clear tape or glue on the inside of the box it will look more seamless, but you can also quickly tape the outside with clear tape or even washi tape.









Be sure that you secure the seams from one end to the other with glue or tape, and not just a small dab of tape in the center, especially if you plan to fill the box with candy or other small objects.
Save the seam on the top of the box for last and only seal it up if you are not planning to place anything inside the box. Otherwise be sure you fill it before you seal it!

, In the end you should have a six-sided cube.

Now that you have the hang of it, make one for all of your friends!

Make boxes for gift giving.,
Try 3D boxes for a unique Advent calendar.,
Use them as light boxes for photography.",How to Make a 3D Cube3," This is the most common use for handmade 3D boxes, and adds a personal and unique touch to any gift. It works best for small and lightweight gifts, as the boxes can become unwieldy as they get too big.

You can use decorative paper for more ornamental boxes. Use printed paper, such as cardstock made for scrapbooking, or create your own unique paper by water-coloring designs on cardstock, allowing it to dry flat, and then using it to create boxes.
Hang them from a Christmas tree as decorations with a surprise inside. Glue or tape a loop of string inside the box as you are sealing it, and use the loop to hang it from the tree.
Make boxes of progressively smaller sizes and nest them together like nesting dolls, with the ""real"" gift inside the smallest box. This would be a cute way to present someone with a piece of jewelry-- maybe even an engagement ring!

, If you celebrate Christmas (or if you want to adapt the Advent calendar tradition for your own holiday or birthday month for a loved one), you can make one box for each day leading up to Christmas in the month of December.

Traditionally, there are 24 small spaces on an Advent calendar and each one is either filled with a scripture reference to look up or with a small candy, or both.
Make 24 3D boxes of the same size. You can make them of decorative holiday cardstock or you can paint them yourself. Don’t close the tops yet! On the tops of the boxes, write the numbers 1 to 24 in a calligraphy or other fancy print to suit your style.
Glue the 3D boxes together with the tops unsealed and facing up. You can glue them in any configuration that looks nice to you or fits your space. You might try 8 boxes long by 3 boxes wide, or 6 boxes long by 4 boxes wide, or 12 boxes long by 2 boxes wide: whatever you prefer! You can even glue them together in one long line and then place the whole thing atop your mantle or down the runner on your table for a decoration.
Place a small trinket, toy, gift, candy, or scripture reference inside each box and then close carefully with a small amount of clear tape. On each day of the month leading up to Christmas, you or your loved ones can open the box with the corresponding number.

, If you blog or sell items online, you know how frustrating it can be to try to take a simple yet attractive photo of a small object, from a plate of food to a tube of lipstick. Using an open 3D box as a lightbox for your items can be a great way to get good shots.

Make a solid white 3D box but instead of sealing it, cut off one side so that it is open. Place it on its side so that the open side is facing you.
Place a small object inside the box toward the back. Since you can make 3D boxes in any size, you can make a bigger box for a bigger object. You will need to be able to light the whole box to get a good picture.
For a very small object in a small box, the flash from your camera should be enough to fill the box with light. For bigger objects, set up a small lamp near the light box to shine inside as you take the pictures.

,, Measure for both width and height. Transfer measurements to your fabric using the measuring tape and fabric pencil. Repeat this step until all four sides have been measured and drawn on the fabric.

, Before you cut lay the fabric next to the inside of your box to make sure that you are correct with your measurements and the fabric strip will fit the space and provide some overhang.

, Don’t over glue, but make sure you have enough so that it doesn’t move.

, Don’t glue the remaining three to five inches or overhang.


Glue the side to the inside of the box and allow the overhang piece to lay over the top. You will glue that into place last.
Repeat until all four sides are glued into place.

, You'll need to cut the fabric for the narrow ends, the long sides and the lid, as follows:


Measure the narrow ends of the shoebox, allowing for an equal overlap around the edges of 5cm/2 inches width and 7.5cm/3 inches to the depth. Using this measurement, cut two squares of fabric.
Measure the sides of the shoebox, making the length just slightly short of the full side length and allowing for an overlap of 7.5cm/3 inches for the depth of each side. Using this measurement, cut two rectangles of fabric.
Measure the lid. The measurement should be the same as the lid plus double the depth of the lid's sides. Cut a fabric rectangle to this dimension.

, Attach the end fabric pieces first. Ensuring that the fabric piece overlaps equally all of the way around, adhere it to the first end with fabric glue. At the corners, cut into the fabric to make vertical slits that will allow you to fold the fabric down around the corner. Spread the glue into the areas of overlap, then press down all the overlapping edges of the fabric, sticking the side overlaps first, then the top and finally, the base overlap.


Be sure to smooth out the fabric as you go.

, Check that the overlap is equal. Glue the fabric to the sides, ensuring that the overlap is glued inside the box and under it.


Be sure to smooth out the fabric as you go.

, Place the fabric facing wrong side up onto a flat surface. Apply glue to the shoebox lid, then carefully place it down onto the fabric, taking care to ensure that there is even overlap all of the way around the lid. Turn the lid over and smooth out the fabric. Cut the corner edges into a slit to make it easy to fold over the fabric. Then glue the overlap pieces over the sides and tuck them under to complete the cover.

, Once dried, add embellishments if using, such as gluing on a bow, some buttons or drawing a design on the fabric with fabric markers or paint. Alternatively, simply leave the covered shoebox as it is.

",How to Make Popcorn Boxes," Decide what your colors will be so you can buy materials that fit the theme.








, If you are making less than 20 popcorn boxes, you may want to choose materials to print at home. Larger projects may benefit from buying cardstock and using a pre-made plastic template or printing at a local print shop.








, There are a number of excellent popcorn box templates on the Internet and in stores.









If you want to offer different sized popcorn boxes, or have the option for a future project, order a plastic popcorn box template. You can find this template at papercrafttemplates.com/Box-Templates/ for $8.99. The sturdy, reusable template can save you time and gives you many more chances for customization with your choice of cardstock.
Print a 1-page popcorn box template like the one above. This box design is simple, and it allows you to bring with different colors of cardstock, or cut it out and make a template that you can trace onto other cardstock.
For a printer and design friendly option, go to onecharmingparty.com/tag/popcorn-box/. This pre-designed template is striped, with blue and white stripes. Print it onto cardstock, cut it out and increase the professional look of your party.
For a popcorn box that is striped and says ""popcorn,"" go to http://ideas.homelife.com.au/media/pdf/feb09/A4-popcorn.pdf This box will help distinguish the food from other favors. It prints on cardstock in green and white.

, If you are going to print the boxes from a pre-designed template, buy a package of white cardstock at an office supply store, craft store or on the Internet. If you want to customize your box by tracing a template, buy sheets of 12 by 12 inch (30.5cm) cardstock at your local craft store.









Consider purchasing 2-sided cardstock for use with a plastic template. You can have a patterned side and a plain side that the person will see as they eat their popcorn.

, You will either print or trace it onto cardstock.









Print your template, if you are using a pre-designed box. Make sure you have enough printer ink in your printer. Load the cardstock into your paper feed, as you would with normal paper.
Trace your popcorn box shape onto the cardstock, if you are using a plastic or hard paper template. Use a pencil to trace the outside portions. If you are using the version from papercrafttemplates.com you will need to trace 2 of these shapes. If you are using the template from Lavender's Blue Design blog, you will only need to make 1 template with cardboard to make the whole box.

, Whether you are using a printed version or a traced version, you will see that the inside areas of the box need to be scored for easy folding.









Place the piece of cardstock on a flat craft table. Use a bone folder or paper scoring wheel to trace the inside edges of the box and the flaps that glue the box together. Make sure you are scoring your paper on the correct side, the side that will fold in.

, Be as precise as possible, so your box will fit together well. Ensure you do not cut any of the scored lines, only the outside edges.








, If you are using the 2-piece design from paper craft templates, you may not be able to do this until you have glued 1 of the flaps.








, Apply durable craft glue to the flap. Align the opposite edge of the paper. You can bring the opposite side of the box down so that it is flush with the table's surface to ensure you are aligning the 2 pieces properly.









Press firmly on the glue flap with your fingers. Affix glue to the other glue flap, if you are using a 2-piece template. Align it and press to form your box structure.

, Make sure the bottom flaps are scored well and will fold easily into the box.








, Fold the bottom in, so that the flaps insert into the inside of the box.








, Reach your hand into the center of the box and press the flaps against the side of the box, using your other hand to create a firm surface.








, Allow your boxes to dry according to the glue's product specifications before serving popcorn.

Decide what to store.,
Evaluate your available space.,
Plan for future needs.,
Choose your container.,
Cover your container.,
Decorate your craft box.,
Make compartments.,
Label your storage.,
Determine if you need dividers.,
Decide how to organize tiny craft supplies.,
Store your box or tins.",How to Make a Crafts Box," You may need simple storage for basic craft supplies or individual storage boxes for different crafts. Separate your supplies into piles according to craft so you can establish what size and how many containers would be best. Within a craft you may want to separate small and large items.Determine if you will need compartments within your storage box. This would be handy for beads, buttons and small craft eyes to name a few.;
, Once you have decided how many craft boxes you will need, look around and decide where you will store your crafts. You will need to store your craft box(s) in a convenient location. You can put your box(s) in a closet as long as it is easy to reach or on an open shelf near the desk or table where you work.


Numerous boxes will probably have to be stacked so make sure you have a good and easily accessible place in mind.

, If you are actively pursuing new crafts, you may want to plan your coordinated storage now. Make one or 2 extra boxes so as your interest and supplies increase, you need only to label the existing containers. You will be glad to have them handy while you’re working on new projects.

, Even if you have a very small budget, you can still have stylish, organized crafts. You can use things you already have around the house like shoe boxes or popcorn/cookie tins. A shoebox with a detached lid works great for easy access. You probably have different sizes and most are pretty durable. If you have a boot box it makes a great option to store more items or larger items.Cookie tins are great for smaller craft supplies like ribbons and embellishments.
A large popcorn tin can hold a lot of yarn or bulky items.
Don’t forget to look around for old cigar boxes or lunch boxes. They are a great size for smaller basic storage.

, You will need some Kraft paper or the unprinted side of a brown paper grocery bag, pencil, scissors, glue and markers or a label maker for a basic craft box.


If you are starting with a shoebox, wrap your shoebox with the paper to hide the branding on the box. You can wrap like a gift with the lid wrapped separately. Use a paintbrush to apply a thin layer of glue to the box so the paper will stick. The glue applied with a paintbrush will help your paper be smooth. You can wrap the box or trace the sides of the box, cut out the paper and glue it to your box. There are excellent videos online to guide you in wrapping your box.Covering your tin can be done by cutting a circle of your paper and gluing it to the flat part of the lid. Measure the side height of your tin and the circumference with a flexible tape measure. Cut a strip of paper to glue around the side of the tin. If your tin is already attractive you may decide to just add nice labels to the existing decor of the tin., You may choose the simple look of brown Kraft paper or you may want to go all out with style and include paint or other decorations.


For a simple natural look, wrap the outside of your box with a natural raffia bow. The natural fibers of raffia will compliment the simple craft paper and you will love the added touch.You can add felt cutouts and pompoms to be whimsical. Glue things, from glitter to seashells, to your box in a pattern or in a more creative way. You will love adding a personal touch to your box.
Painting is another way to personalize your box. You can use any craft paint and you don’t have to be an artist to add a great personal touch. The possibilities are endless.Use pictures or favorite postcards on your box. You will love the trip down memory lane as you choose photos and and glue them to your box. This way, your craft box will double as a memory box.

, If you have different items you'd like to put in your crafts box, you may want to separate them so they don't get jumbled up. An easy way to do this is to include a jewelry tray insert in your box. This will probably work best in a square box, like a shoebox.


You could also take pieces of cardboard and glue them perpendicular to the bottom of your box. On one side you could place one type of craft supplies, and on the other you can include other items.

, Now that you have taken time to get your crafts in order, you will want to label what is in your box or boxes. Some people like broad labels like “sewing supplies” while others want to spell out exactly what supplies are in the box or tin. You can use a handy label maker like a P-Touch if you have one for clearly printed labels to stick on. Many crafty people like to use a marker and label the box with artistic flair.

, If your craft objects are not too small, you may not need any dividers. You will have everything in one place. Put larger things at the bottom of your container. You will be able to easily see what you have if smaller things are on top.

, Separate your pieces to determine how many smaller containers you will need.


You can go to a dollar store and purchase 2” x 2” (5cm x 5 cm) see through food storage containers with lids. They often have a multi pack for $1. These are great for small pieces and you can see what is in the container.
Purchase inexpensive small trays, also available at dollar stores, to put in the bottom of your box to separate different items like scissors, glue and markers.
Peel labels off soup cans and line your box with open cans for such things as paint brushes, markers, scissors and rulers. This works well if you can store your craft box on an open shelf without a lid.

, If your boxes and tins are very colorful, you may want them out on an open shelf as they can double as decor. You may want to put your boxes in a kitchen cupboard if you often craft at the kitchen table. You can store your crafts on a closet shelf but be sure the boxes are easily accessible.

Crochet a box cover.",How to Decorate a Box," With fabric, spray glue, scissors, a ruler, and a pencil, you can create a box that matches just about anything. If you have any scraps of fabric from leftover projects or even a favorite t-shirt that's wearing out (or you could spring for something fancy at a craft store), you're almost set.


Cut your fabric to fit your box. Mark where the bottom of the box should be, spray glue the bottom, and set on the fabric. Cut a line along the sides of the long edge of the box. With your spray glue adhere that to the long side and the cut flaps to the short side. Repeat for the rest of the sides. And you're done! Unless you have a lid -- you can repeat the process so it matches or just leave it alone to accentuate the contrast.;
, If you want to get creative (think outside the box, if you will), use buttons to give your box some oomph and texture. Different-sized buttons of varying hues of a color family create a fancy, put-together look, but different shapes and different colors works, too. All you need is your grandma's stash of buttons and a hot glue gun!


Be careful with the hot glue gun and use it sparingly -- you don't want your box to covered in little transparent blobs with a button here or there.
If you don't like the base colour of your box, cover it! Use fabric, paper, or just color it with paint or markers.

, If you're feeling particularly creative (or romantic), paper roses are easier to make than you think. Just using paper would be fine, but with a few snips, the roses will spring up like weeds. Paper, scissors, and glue are the only materials you need. To start:


Take a piece of paper and draw a spiral. Have the lines be far apart if you want larger roses (it'll be cute if you have different sizes).
Cut out the spiral along the lines.
Glue the edges of your spiral together, overlapping slightly. It creates a natural petal-like shape that looks just like a rose!

, With a bit of modge podge or rubber cement, your box can be practically blinding. You can totally do intricate designs and different colors, too. If you have a few hours to let it dry, this is a great method to create something really eye-catching.


Let's say you want to do stripes in three colors. All you have to do is modge podge whatever area you want in your first color, apply your glitter/sequins, etc. and let dry. Then modge podge the second area, let dry, and repeat for the third! Try getting detailed with your designs. Loop de loops, anyone?

, If you have pretty much any type of paper and some white school glue, decoupage is the way to go. Imagine the box covered in pages of your favorite book, cute wallpaper, sheet music, or even ironed tissue paper or gift wrap? It'd practically be the focus of your entire room!


With a 1:1 ratio of white glue to water, all you need to do is spread the paste on your box, apply a layer of your paper, and repeat until you have the look you want. If you like, top it off with a seal of varnish or lacquer. Tada!

, You probably already thought of this one, huh? What do you have stashed in your craft drawer? In just a few minutes' time you could wrap it with ribbon, draw your next masterpiece, or slap on some stickers to make it uniquely you.


For markers, you'll probably want to use the permanent kind. The kind kids use in schools can wash off and might wear off over time.

, To make your box more elegant, choose a textile like lace (maybe even a strand of pearls if you're feeling fancy!). You can either modge podge the entire thing, use that same decoupage paste, rubber cement, spray glue -- heck, pretty much anything that adheres without leaving a colored residue. Try overlapping lace designs to create some texture and intricacy.


Try cutting your lace into shapes beforehand. Even if the entire box is covered in lace, designs on top can pop out, giving it dimension and pizazz.

, If you have a steady hand, contact paper may be the absolute easiest way in the world to jazz up even the most boring of boxes. It's backed by a sticky layer, meaning there's no gluey mess for you to deal with at all! Take a gander at your local home improvement store's shelving section. And maybe you could redesign the inside of your cabinets to boot!


The only thing you have to careful about is overlap and bubbles. This method is similar with fabric:

Center the box on the paper.
Cut a line going outward from the long edge.
Adhere the long, cut side to the long side of the box, folding the flaps around.
Bring up the other sides, repeating the same motion.



, Let your inner artist shine, you know? Acrylics will work best for most standard boxes. It's a flat surface and there's no pressure to have your box be the next Mona Lisa, so have at it! Even an abstract mashing of bold colors in no real design would be beautiful.


Just make sure you paint only one side at a time. You don't want to prop up the box to see the blank side only to realize you've ruined what you just spent an hour working on!

, A nice gift is great, but a nice gift with a personalized box is doubly thoughtful. Take your new ideas and put them to good use! It's a gift they might not be able to use forever, but the box they sure can.

, And as for that closet of yours -- imagine if it were something you actually wanted to look at and wasn't a complete eyesore. No more relegating yourself to being surrounded by plastic tubs. Get to sprucing up your closet already!

, If you're lacking in the pretty paper department, newspaper can be surprisingly classy, especially if it's just black and white. Bust out the white glue and decoupage skills and redo all of your boxes -- they'll match but yet all be unique.

, If for some odd reason the texture of your box is wonky and glue and paints don't easily adhere, why not crochet a box cover? You're really just crocheting a larger box to put over this box, but it serves the same purpose. It can also protect any special boxes you have that you don't want to fade in the sunlight or get ruined by little hands.

Choose your paper.,
Fold the paper vertically in half.,
Fold each side of the paper to the center crease.,
Fold the entire paper in half lengthwise.,
Fold each short side to the center crease.,
Fold each corner.,
Fold the flaps from the middle down over the triangles made in the previous Step.,
Pull up on the two flaps.,
Make any finishing touches.",How to Make an Easy Paper Box1," For this method, rectangular paper works best. If you are making a gift or a party favor, use brightly colored and/or patterned paper. If you are simply practicing your paper folding skills, use some scrap paper instead.;
, If using patterned paper, make sure the pattern is on the outside. Unfold the paper again.Make sure each fold is creased well. You can crease the folds with your fingernail, a coin, or some other small, hard object.
If you're using cardstock or another kind of thick paper, you can use something called a ""scoring tool."" This can be a very dull knife, an empty ballpoint pen, a bone folder, or an embossing tool., Take the edge and line it with the center crease. Once again, the pattern should be on the outside. Unfold the paper. It should now be in quarters sectioned widthwise.

, The pattern should be on the outside. Unfold the paper once more. It should now be in eight equal sections.

, You are doing the same thing with this new lengthwise center crease as you did in Step 3.


This will give the new side four sections. The paper should now have 16 sections in all.
Do not unfold your paper this time. Keep in folded lengthwise.

, Line the corners up with the nearest lengthwise crease. The folded corners should each form right triangles with their bases flush with a lengthwise crease. You should end up with an uneven octagon.


A strip of paper should be between the center creased edges and the edge of the newly folded corner, creating a flap.

, This opens the center of the paper so you can see the center crease inside the box.


This flap will be seen from outside the box. If you are making a gift or decorative box, you might consider using two-sided patterned paper for additional ornamentation.

, You can grip them by the creases in the middle. You should now have a complete box.


You may have to re-crease some of the folds to make your box stand more securely.

, Use some scotch tape on the corners if you would like them to sit flat. Decorate the bed of the box with markers or pens if you want to. If you're using it to hold a gift, write a surprise message to your giftee that will be covered by the item.

Flip the paper over and fold the edges to the center crease.,
Fold the bottom left corner to the third crease towards the right.,
Fold the bottom right corner of the flap to the top edge.,
Fold the bottom right corner upwards to meet the edge of the flap.,
Insert the newly made section into the flap below.,
Tuck the pointed tip in.,
Repeat Steps 6-10 with the opposite end.,
Lift each flap.",How to Make an Easy Paper Box2," Starting with a rectangular sheet works best. As above, the paper you pick will depend on the box's purpose. If this is a gift or a decorative item, use patterned or brightly colored paper. If it's just for practice, use scrap paper.








, If using patterned paper, make sure the pattern is on the inside. This is in contrast to Method 1, so be sure to pay attention. Unfold the paper., Make sure the pattern is on the inside. Take the outer edges and fold to the center crease. Unfold the two creases you just made.









The paper should now have four vertical sections. At this point, the paper is still half folded, so you should only see two of them and no pattern.

, The paper should now have flaps, with the pattern of the paper visible.









Each flap should be three layers folded on top of one another in a Z pattern.
Do not unfold the paper.

, When the paper is face down, you should see only the center crease and the two lengthwise edges. Fold the paper towards the middle crease so that it lines up with the two outer creases. Unfold partially so that the outer creases return to edges.









There should be two lengthwise sections before unfolding and four lengthwise sections after.

, Line up the bottom outer edge with the crease.









The new triangular section will have a flap in the middle of it.

, This should create a new flap in the shape of a symmetrical trapezoid.








, The bottom right corner will be on the other side of the third crease.









The newly made section will be triangular with a point at the end. The top should have a flap.

, Lift the newly folded section and carefully slip into the flap on the section beneath it. The flap and the folded triangular corner will be visible.








, Take the triangular corner and fold underneath the flap. You may need to re-crease the folds.









You should have a straight edge along the bottom. The newly folded flap section will be in the shape of a trapezoid. It will sit with its parallel sides flush with a second larger trapezoid.

, It may help to turn the paper 180 degrees before you begin.









When finished, the two sides should mirror each other. The paper should now be in the shape of an oblong octagon.

, This should complete the box by creating four standing sides. You may need to reinforce the crease to get the sides to stand better. As with Method 1, you may want to decorate the bed if it's for a special occasion.

Choose your paper.,
Fold the paper in half diagonally, then unfold.,
Fold each corner into the center.,
Fold two parallel edges to the center.,
Fold the shorter edges to the center.,
Unfold the paper partially.,
Lift the paper by either of the central widthwise triangles.,
Push the two creased triangles back inward.,
Fold the remaining triangle into the box.,
Repeat Steps 7 through 9 with the opposite side.",How to Make an Easy Paper Box3," Think about the purpose of the box. If this is a gift or a decorative item, use patterned or colored paper.


For this particular Method, square paper should be used. Origami paper is ideal for a gift box. Make sure your paper is completely even on each side. Either use square paper, or measure and cut the paper so each side is the same size.

, If using patterned paper, make sure the pattern is on the inside. Turn the paper 90 degrees and repeat this step. You should now have four sections. , You should start with the paper patterned side down, folding each corner to reveal the pattern side of the paper. The plain side should be covered up now. Your paper should now look like a smaller square made up of four identical triangles.








, The newly folded sections should be folded down on top of the corner folds you just made in Step 3. The paper should now be a rectangle. When folded completely, you should see only two rectangular flaps that meet at the center.








, The folds should be made over the ones created in Step 4. The shape will now be an even smaller square. The only visible pieces at this point should again be two rectangular flaps that meet at the center.








, Rotate Stop unfolding once you have the square made up of triangles that you made in Step 3. Fold two parallel edges back towards the center on the already creased fold. There are two sets of edges to choose form, but they are identical. You are not making a new fold. Let them sit vertically, as these will be the beginnings of your box's sides.

, This should partially unfold one shorter end of the rectangle. Don't use too much force to avoid tearing the paper. You may need to re-crease any edges that aren't crisp. You should now have three outwards-facing triangles, two of which with a central crease. The base of each triangle forms three sides of the square that will make up the next side of your box.








, Pinch the central creases together to invert the triangles and push them down. Push inward on the creases and line the triangles against the central crease of the new side. The paper should start folding, lifting the new side up.







, This last triangle's base will be the crease that will create the inner lower edge of this side. After folding in, the last triangle should now be in the bed of the box, creating a square with three other identical triangles.








, All four triangles should fit perfectly into the bottom of the box. Your box's bed will look like the square made up of four triangles in Step 3. If you want the triangles to stay perfectly flat, you may need to tape them down.

Gather your materials.,
Print off a pillow box template.,
Cut out your template.,
Score the fold lines.,
Fold your box in half along the center fold line.,
Fold and glue the tab.,
Assemble the main part of the box.,
Fold the curved edges inward to finish your box.",How to Make an Easy Paper Box4," Unlike the previous boxes discussed, you will need to do some cutting and gluing. Don't let this intimidate you; pillow boxes are actually the easiest type of paper box to make. It's best to use cardstock or another type of thicker paper for these boxes. In addition to paper, you'll need scissors, a ruler, and glue.You will also need a scoring tool if you use cardstock., Find a template you like online. You can pick a minimalist pattern or an elaborate one.


You can even print out a blank template that you can decorate yourself. If you choose to decorate the paper, do so before you start folding. Decorating an already-folded box is both difficult and runs the risk of collapsing it.
You can also print a blank template directly onto decorative paper., Using your scissors, carefully cut along the lines designated by the template. A standard pillow box template has two parallel straight sides and four curved sides. They look similar to a wide hour glass. Some may be more elaborate, but they still tend to keep a ""pillow"" shape.

, For straight fold lines, line your ruler up next to the marked edges on the template to guide you. The curved fold lines will be trickier, since you'll need to freehand them. Gently run your scoring tool up and down the lines until an indent forms. Don't be so rough that you cut through the paper., If your template is meant to face outside (such as most decorative ones), flip your paper over first.Fold inward to keep your design facing outward. Use your ruler again to guide you if you have trouble.

, Fold the second straight line inward. The skinny flap will be what holds the box together. Flip the box back over and apply glue evenly on the tab.

, Fold the box in half again, decorative sides facing out. Tuck the flap under the far edge of the box. Line up the flap so that its crease is now flush with the far edge. Place your box in a heavy book while the glue dries to seal the edges., Once the glue has dried, gently fold the round scored lines down towards the center of the box with your fingers. They should now form two parallel sides each shaped like a pointed oval.Because of their concave shape, the edges should hold together without any additional glue. If you used thin paper, though, glue may be necessary.

",How to Make an Origami Flower1," For this flower, you will need 2 6""x6"" squares of origami paper and tape. One of these pieces of paper will form a stem, so you may want to choose a brown or green sheet. If you do not have 6x6 origami paper, then you can use a regular piece of paper. Make it into a triangle and cut the rest off and then you have your 6x6 piece of paper.






;
, Lie it on the table pattern or color side down. Fold the paper in half diagonally to form a large triangle. Fold the bottom left corner to the bottom right corner, making a smaller triangle. Reopen this smaller triangle.








, Take the left corner of the triangle and fold upwards from the center crease. This corner will extend beyond the edge of the original triangle and be at approximately the same height as the top corner. Repeat this fold on the right side. Try to make this fold symmetrical to the fold on the left side. Set the flower aside.








, Fold the paper in half diagonally. Unfold the paper and position it so it looks like a square diamond.








, Match the right edge of the paper to the center crease, making sure the bottom corner is also aligned. Repeat with the left corner. When you are done, your paper should look like a kite.








, Be sure the bottom point is precise and sharp. The seam in the middle should be tight.








, Repeat with the upper left corner. The seam between these two flaps should also be tight.








, Fold the left side over to the right side matching all of the edges. The shorter, fatter triangle forms the leaf.








, Take the leaf and gently pull it out and away from the stem.








, Cut a tiny piece of paper off the bottom of the flower. Stick the tip of the stem into the hole.









Tape the flower to the stem to prevent it from falling apart.

, Fold from left to right, and reopen. Then, fold from the top down to the bottom. Your paper should be a rectangle.








, The crease in the center of the paper will lift. All four corners will meet at the bottom. You should now have a square diamond shape. Flatten your diamond shape. Make sure there is one top flap on the left side and one top flap on the left side.








,, This will form a fold that looks like a kite. Flip the diamond over to the backside, and repeat the folds you made to the front side.








, Grab the top tip of the kite. Pull and fold it down approximately 3/4 of the way down the kite. With your thumb and forefinger, squeeze the center of the flower to make the crease firm.








, Arrange the side petals until they are in the position you want. Adjustments can be made to any of the petals by pinching the base of the flower near the stem.

, Begin with one corner, pulling it all the way toward the center point and lining it up with the guideline-creases you made earlier. Once everything is lined up, fold and crease.









Try to get the tip as close to center without going past it.
Do not unfold.

, Once each corner is folded you should be left a smaller square. This is a ""blintz fold.""








The ""blintz fold"" is the foundation for many origami projects.

, Bring each corner all the way to the center point of the square, and line-up the corners, edges and guidelines just as you did when you first constructed the base.








Make sure the folds are on the top of the blintz base when you begin.

, When you are finished, you should end-up with another square.









You are essentially performing a series of blintz folds on a single piece of paper.

, As you did with the previous step, fold each corner of the paper inward toward the center, lining up all edges and corners.









Work each corner one at a time and be patient.

, Once again, you will be folding the corners to the center point so that you are left with yet another, albeit smaller, square.








At this point, the paper may be very difficult to fold.

, This time you will only be folding a portion of the corners inward. Make a fold that includes approximately 10-20 percent of the corner.








, The object should know resemble an octagon with irregular sides.








, Keeping the object oriented so that you can see your most recent folds, feel around the bottom of the square for the top layer of flaps. Gently pull-up each flap one at a time, working around the smaller partial folds you made in steps five and six. Repeat for each flap








You will be ""inverting"" a fold with each petal. This is the hardest part of the process.
Move slowly and gently, and try not to tear the paper.
You may have to slightly ""unfold"" the lotus to get the petals to come up. When you're finished, the flap you grabbed from the bottom should be nearly vertical.

, Again, grab the flaps on the bottom and gently lift them up, ""inverting"" the fold so that they petals open on the opposite side.








, Grab the remaining flaps on the bottom and gently fold them upward. These petals will be closer to horizontal than vertical, and they might be the most difficult ones to fold without tearing.

Decide on box size(s) and how many you'll want to make.,
Taking the shelf space measurements you wrote down in the step above, subtract about 1/4 or 1/8 inch (6.35mm or 3.17mm) from the height and width dimensions.,
Plan out the dimensions for your boxes and determine how to minimize waste when cutting the foam core boards.,
Using a yard-stick or other long ruler, measure out and mark the foam core boards with a pencil.,
Use the X-Acto knife to cut the foam core boards.,
Once you have all five sides of the box cut out, use the duct tape to connect the four sides to each other and then add the bottom on last.,
Use the dimensions of the front-side of your box and cut the thinner poster board to this size.,
Now comes the fun part!,
Measure and draw out a template for each book spine on the poster board fronts so you can plan everything out.,
Plan on one book in the center of the box to be 1"" (2.5cm) wide and make it about 1/2"" (1.27cm) shorter than the others.,
Once you have your plan in place, select which papers you want to use for each book spine.,
Measure out the width of the first book on the scrap-book paper adding about 1/4"" (6.35mm) on both sides that will get folded under to glue to the poster board.,
Using a ruler held against the back of the piece of paper lined up with the fold line, press down on table to get a straight crease across the strip.,
Draw out your title design on the folded paper.,
Apply glue to the backs of the folds and apply to the poster board front panel aligning the outer edges as best possible.,
Begin working on the third book by skipping every other book and glue them down as you finish them.

,
Go back and do the remaining middle books.,
Once all the glue is dry, attach the faux book to the box you made earlier by gluing it on.,
Cut out the finger hole in the foam core board above the short center ""book."",
Your finished box should fit perfectly into your shelf space and easily pull out using the finger hole/notch.

",How to Make a Box With Faux Book Spines to Hide Stuff Inside," Let's say you want to make a single box for each of the 12 cubbies in a cube-shelf. Determine the height, width and depth measurements for the space(s). Another thing you'll want to consider is what colors the book spines will be. Consider going with all browns and black or gray shades that coordinate with just about anything and would also look like antique books. But don't be afraid to go more colorful - this could result in a really modern or fun look!;
, This will allow wiggle room for the boxes to easily slide in and out of the shelves. The depth measurement can also be adjusted so your 'books' sit further back on the shelf and not right up to its edge, especially if you plan to make the 'book' spines more three dimensional. Reduce the depth by about 1/2 inch (1.27cm) if you want a bit of a ledge and know you will make some spines more three dimensional than others.

, The dimensions used in this example are shown here. (Keep in mind the depth of the foam core as well - two panels equal about 1/4 inch (6.35mm) in this case.)

, Be as precise as possible so that all the edges will line up and result in square corners. 

, Be sure to have a cutting mat placed below the board and use the edge of the ruler as a cutting edge guide if you're not good at free-hand cutting.

, Use the X-Acto knife to get clean corners and cuts on the tape.

, This will become the base for attaching the book spines to.

, Pick out which titles you want to be displayed together on each box front. They can be themed or completely random. For authenticity, try finding out the page count of each of your titles so the book thickness will be realistic - otherwise you could end up with a very ""abridged"" version of War & Peace! See the ""Tips"" section for more ideas on selecting book titles.

, Don't make any books skinnier than 3/4"" (2cm) though as smaller sizes become increasingly difficult to work with the later steps. Try to plan out how the actual spine should look so you have a nice variety of styles and fonts across the books. (Search online for images of ""antique books spines"" for design ideas.)

, This allows you to have a finger hole to pull the box out of the shelf. This is essential if you're making them fit snug and won't have a way to grasp the sides of the box.

, Try to pick colors that go with the title (a black cover for Dracula makes a lot more sense than a pink one!).

, Cut out this shape.

, Repeat this step for the other fold.


Now use your fingers to crush the fold as flat as possible.







,


Then go over it with pen or marker to finalize it. Be careful not to smudge the ink and give it a minute to dry before touching again.


,


At this point you may want to place a weight or two on top to keep the paper from lifting up (you can use the duct tape rolls for this).


,, For these you may may want to cut your paper a bit wider than the space left so they curve out a little and give you a more three dimensional effect on the spines. Keep gluing them until all the books are done.

, Don't get stingy with your glue here, you want this to stay put!

, Be very careful with this step so you don't ruin all your work on the book spines.

",How to Make a Dollar Bill Rose," Fold the first dollar bill in half and then curl the top corners, as shown. Only curl the edges—not the entire bill.









Curl one edge of the folded bill inward and the other edge outward. The curls allow the bud to begin taking shape.
Hold the bill between the edges of your fingertips to get the right angle on the curl. Holding the bill between your thumb, index and middle fingers will help you get the right look.;
, Fold the bill in half on an angle (so the money looks like a “V”). Then curl the edges.









Instead of folding directly in half, fold the bill in half but with each side coming up on an angle (so it looks like the letter “V”). You should be able to see the backside of the bill.
Curl the bottom part of the bill edges inward using your fingertips. Use the same technique you used to create the curls for your bud.
Curl the top part of the bill edges outward using your fingertips. Be sure you don’t go too far outward––just a subtle curl is adequate.

, This will help your flower take shape.









Open the bud bill and place the floral wire inside the fold. Make sure the wire is even on both sides so the bud bill is in the middle.
Gently bend the wire so that it snugly holds the bud in the middle. You should end up with the bud being held in the middle and wire now basically folded in half.
Twist the wire ends to join the two pieces as one (this forms the stem). Hold the flower by the bud and then twist and wind the wire downward.
Fluff the bud by exaggerating the curls. Slip your finger between the layers of the folded bud and try to round out the bill so it looks more like a bud.

, Use the same technique you used with the bud. Use individual wires or pipe cleaners to wrap through and around dollar bill petals. Make sure the wire is the same length you used for the bud.









Use floral wire or pipe cleaners to encase each petal inside the wire. Approach wrapping the bills the same way you wrapped the bud by sliding the wire through the bill fold and bending the wire downward.
Fluff the petals and reshape to look more like actual rose petals using your finger. Curl round the outward edges—try to make each bill petal unique (like an actual rose).

, Hold the bud in one hand and then arrange the petals around the bud. Hold the flower close to the bills so you have a good handle on how the flower will appear. Arrange and rearrange until the flower resembles a rose.









Twist and wind all floral wires together so they form one large wire. Hold the top of the flower and twist the wires in a downward until you reach the bottom/end.
If you didn't use pipe cleaners, wind floral tape around the wires and cut the wire to an appropriate length using wire cutters (if necessary). Begin by wrapping the floral wire around the top of the wire, toward the top of the flower and work your way downward.

, Look at the dollar bill rose the same way you might a real flower and add leaves so that they look natural.

Lay your A4 paper horizontally and fold the top left corner down to make it even with the bottom of your paper. You should now have a folded triangle shape with a rectangle shape on the right.
Cut or rip the rectangle portion off. Unfold your paper, and you’ll have a square.
If you are using origami paper, start with the colored side of the paper facing up.;
, Place your paper on a flat surface and position it so it resembles a diamond. Fold it in half both ways diagonally.


Take the top corner and fold it down to meet the bottom corner. Then make a crease on the fold.
Open the paper back up and repeat this fold with the other end of the paper, folding from left to right.
Open the paper back up and rotate it 90 degrees. Now fold the top down on a horizontal fold and crease. Repeat folding one more time with a vertical book fold., Fold your triangle in half on a vertical fold from left to right. You should now have a triangle with two flaps at the right corner and one at the left.


Your paper should look like a right-angled triangle with the left crease and base forming a right angle.

, Collapse the top layer, pressing it down. This is called a squash fold.The trick is to hold the bottom right layer down with one hand, while folding down and creasing the balloon flap with your other hand.
The portion of paper you just folded should look like a diamond.

, Now you’re going to repeat the squash fold on this side of the paper. Your paper will look like a square with a triangle attached to it on the left.


Pick up the top left flap of the triangle that’s sticking out. It should look like a shark fin when standing up with the points of your diamond on each side.

,


This is a variation of what’s called a balloon fold., You should now have the single crease of your paper at the top with the open end at the bottom.


There should be two flaps at the top and bottom of your paper, with two other folded flaps sandwiched in the middle.

, Your top layer should resemble a long diamond shape. This diamond shape is made from two folded isosceles triangles on top of an equilateral triangle pointing downward.Once you have creased the folds, then unfold fold the corners back.

, Perform another squash fold. This squash fold will look slightly different with two flaps sticking out at the bottom. Use the creases you made in the previous step to guide your squash fold.


Open the pocket up with your finger and fold, creasing the edges. Use your free hand to keep your paper in place.
You should now have a kite shape.

, You’ll have to repeat these steps three more times with the other three layers. This part can be difficult so take it one fold at a time starting with the opposite side of the paper from your first fold.


Once both side of your paper have the same kite fold, grab the top flap that you haven’t squash folded on the left side of your paper.
Pull it up and squash fold it, creating another kite fold.
Once you have folded the left side over. Flip the paper over again and repeat.

, You should now have a solid crease point at the top of your paper with four points at the the bottom. Two on each side. Your paper should look like an upside down kite. Fold the tip of the kite down so it meets the four points at the bottom, then unfold.


If you don’t have two points on each side of your paper, fold the flaps over until they are evenly divided.

, Fold the sides to the middle to form a diamond shape instead of a an upside down kite shape. Crease and unfold to reveal your kite shape once again.

, You should see an opening at the base of your triangle which is forming your upside down kite shape. Lift the mouth of the are up and fold it back, using the creases you’ve just make.


This is sort of like the squash fold from before.
You should now have another kite shape on as the top layer. This one should be right side up.

, Once again, you should see an upside down kite shape with the base of a triangle triangle flap opening downward. Repeat the previous sets of folds on this side.


You should end up with another right side up kite shape like you had on the other side of your paper.
Repeat these folds on all the sides of your paper that have the triangle opening and upside down kite.

, Rotate your paper so you now have one point at the bottom of your paper and four flaps at the top, two on each side.

, Then fold the top layer of each flap inward towards the center line.


repeat this step on each side of your paper with the triangle flaps.

, You should have one creased point on the bottom of your paper with four open points at the top.


You should only see two smooth, flat sides now on the side of the paper facing you, and facing the table.

, Use a pencil or your finger to curl these flaps down.


Once you have folded down the first two flat-sided flaps, fold your paper over to reveal the second two flat-sided flaps. Repeat the process.
You may have to play with the already curled flaps when you fold the sides over to prevent these flaps from flattening.

, Bring the bottom edge of the paper up to meet the top edge. Crease the fold with your fingers, working from the center outwards.


In the origami world, this is known as a ""valley fold,"" because it creates a little valley in the paper Almost every origami project begins with a valley fold or its opposite, the mountain fold, which creates a ridge., When you open the fold, you'll see the crease you've made running right through the middle of the paper, creating a horizontal line.


Orient the crease horizontally, with the red side down.

, Line up the bottom edge of the paper to meet the horizontal crease in the middle. Crease the new fold with your fingers.

, Bring the top edge of the paper to meet the lower horizontal crease.Crease the new fold with your finger.

, Now there are three horizontal creases in the paper making four equal sections., Make sure your paper is oriented so that the three creases you created in the previous step are horizontal, with the red side down. Take the bottom edge of the paper (The side closest to your body) and drag it up across the surface of the paper until it meets the crease that is closest to the top. The crease you are trying to get the bottom edge to meet with is located one fourth of the way down the paper from the top.Crease the new fold with your fingers or a bone folder.
If you've done the fold correctly, the area between the crease in the middle of the paper and the crease three-fourths of the way down the paper has been split in half with your new fold.
You can unfold the crease you just made to make sure you did it right. However, make sure to fold it back into place before moving on to the next step.

, Take hold of the bottom-right corner (as made by the bottom crease) and make a small diagonal fold at a 45 degree angle. The corner should fold upward so that a small portion of the right edge of the paper aligns with nearest crease., You should see four horizontal creases. Of your four original areas, the one second from the bottom should be divided in half by one of these horizontal creases. Additionally, in this same area, you should see two small diagonal creases on the right side.Of these two diagonal creases, one should be going up at a 45 degree angle from the horizontal crease, and the other down at the same angle.

, Using a pen or pencil, draw lines along your creases., Turn the paper so that the top becomes the bottom. Then, repeat steps 7 through 10., Turn the paper one quarter of a turn, then repeat steps 2 through 10., Turn the paper another half-turn, then repeat steps 7 through 10., With the red side still down, take the lower right corner and bring it to meet the upper left corner. Crease the fold with your finger., Open it up to reveal a new diagonal crease., Rotate the paper 90 degrees and repeat the previous two steps., Open it up to reveal two diagonal creases that form an ""X"" through the paper., In each corner of your paper, you should now see a small square that is divided by a single diagonal crease. Take hold of the top left corner and fold it inward, creating a crease that is perpendicular to the original diagonal crease.The corner of your paper should align with the bottom-right corner of the small square.

, You should now see a small ""X"" in the top left corner. Draw a line along the new crease., Take the bottom-right corner and bring it up so that the point of the corner just touches the new line you drew in the previous step.This should create a new crease that runs parallel to one of the lines making up the big ""X,"" specifically the one running from bottom-left to top-right.

, Unfold and draw a line along the new diagonal crease., Turn the paper 180 degrees and repeat the previous four steps.You should now see three lines running parallel from the bottom-left corner of your paper up to the top right.

, Now turn the paper 90 degrees and repeat steps 5 through 9 (of Part 2).When you are done, you should have three parallel lines running from bottom-left to top-right and three running from top-left to bottom-right.

, As in step 5 of Part two, fold in all four corners. You should not need to make any new creases to do this.The end result will be an octagon.

, The red side of your paper should now be face up., Along the bottom edge of your paper, you should see a small creased triangle. It has a crease down the middle, making it look like two smaller triangles that share a vertical side.

If you have trouble finding it, look for the triangle's right-most corner. The triangle's right-most corner is in the spot where the bottom edge of the paper, which is horizontal, meets the bottom-right edge of the paper, which is diagonal.
If the small triangle isn't there, check to make sure you did step eight of part one correctly.

, If you don't know what an inside reverse-fold is or forget how to do an inside reverse-fold, follow the steps belowFold the center crease of the triangle you located in the last step gently inward, creating a small valley fold.
At the same time, fold the two diagonal sides of the triangle outward to create small mountain folds.
This should result in the small triangle creating a small ""notch"" in the side of the paper.
Then, create one more mountain fold along the crease extending from the tip of the triangle.
This is called an inside reverse-fold., In what was once the bottom left corner, you'll need to fold another notch of a slightly different shape.Directly to the right of the small triangle (The one you just made an inside reverse fold with) is another crease. It runs parallel to the right side of the smaller triangle, and is perpendicular to the side of the octagon.
Push gently inward along this crease to create a valley fold.
Then, as before, push the sides of the triangle gently outward, creating small ridges.
Finally, create one more valley fold, pushing inward the nearest horizontal crease that runs parallel to the horizontal side of your new ""notch.""This last crease should run out to just past the center of your paper, creating one side of the small square in the center that you can see marked out on the reverse side.

, Turn the paper 90 degrees and repeat Steps 3 and 4. Do this for the 3 remaining sides., Now that the basic structure of your rose is in place, it's time to start working on the petals. As your first step, you'll need to add a valley fold the outside edge of each one.You'll see that, if you look a your rose from above, it has four long valleys extending out from a square in the center. On the right side of each of these is a large, flat surface. Grasp the edge of this surface and fold it inward.
Specifically, grab the three sides of the outside edge and fold them in such that a small tab shaped like a trapezoid is formed., Looking at your rose from the side, you should now see that you have four shapes that look like triangles with one corner chopped off (along the area you just valley-folded). Protruding from the base of each of these you should see a small triangle of the white side of your paper. Fold in the right-side point of each of these ""chopped-off"" triangles.Draw an imaginary line straight up from the bottom point of the ""white"" triangle, and make a valley fold along it., Unfold the valley folds you just made to the tips. Then, reverse fold them such that each tip disappears inside the rose.If you've done this correctly, the white triangles should no longer be visible.

, Your ""chopped off"" triangles should now look like they have two points chopped off: one on the left and a tiny one on the right, created by your reverse folds. You'll now fold up the tiny ""chopped"" side at a 45 degree angle from the base of the ""chopped"" triangle (i.e. the edge of the paper)., Unfold the valley folds you just made, and then reverse fold along the same lines, folding the tiny triangle you created in the previous step inside the rose at all four points., Your ""chopped off"" triangle should now have reverse folds at each ""chopped"" edge. These will allow you to make a small valley fold, horizontal to the base of each triangle, folding the resulting tab outward. Do this to all four petals., Bring the petals together to create ""legs."" For each set of petals, pull them close together such that the right-side one sits just behind the left-side one. Press down on the creases to hold them in place. The result should be four pointed and fairly sturdy legs.If you've done this right, you should be able to see little or no white-side surface on the legs when looking at your rose from the side.

, Turn your rose over such that you are looking down into the white interior. Then, one by one, fold down each of the triangular legs.Insert the ends into one another such that you close off the opening of the rose., The square that you are looking down on will become the top of the rose., The square on top of your rose should be divided into four quadrants by creases. With your finger, gently push in each quadrant, leaving in place the ridges that form an ""X"" over the top of the square., Place a finger into each of the four quadrants around the ""X"" and gently rotate.This should give the top of rose a more swirled, organic feel, as opposed to the hard lines of the ""X.""

, With a pair of tweezers, grab the center of what was once the ""X,"" and slowly but firmly continue to rotate, being careful not to tear the paper.As you do this, the center of the rose will sink inside, creating a more realistic look.
This may take several tries to get right.

, Using two fingers, take each petal by the point and roll it toward the center, then release. This will create nicely curled petals., If you want to add an origami stem, start with a fresh piece of paper, preferable green.

, Valley fold the paper, from corner to corner, creating two triangles, then unfold., Create two more valley folds, folding the left and right corners in toward the center crease, creating a kite shape., Fold the corners in again toward the center crease. Then do it one more time. You should now have a very skinny kite shape., Flip your stem over so that the edges of the paper all face hidden, then fold the bottom point up to the top one., Now, fold the stem in half along the vertical axis., Fold the outer part (which will become the leaf) of the paper outward, away from the inside (stem), creating two diagonal creases. Then, reverse fold the leaf out and away from the stem. It will have crease in the center., Put the pointed end of the stem through the small hole in the underside of your rose where the ""legs"" all meet.

Gather your paper sealing materials.,
Know your options for wax.,
Prepare your paper.,
Apply your wax.,
Use the dip method for application.,
Examine your seal.,
Warm and cure your waxed paper.,
Maintain your seal.",How to Waterproof Paper1," You can apply a seal by rubbing your document with normal household candle wax, although a more complete seal can be accomplished using a dipping technique. To seal your paper with wax, you'll need:


Normal candle (or beeswax)
Metal pot (optional; dip technique)
Paper
Tongs (optional; dip technique);
, In a pinch you can use the wax from normal household candles, and you can even use scented ones for a unique scent. Colored candles can tint your paper, giving it a fun and creative touch.


Classically, paraffin has been used to waterproof clothing, canvas, and other items.However, you should use paraffin in a well ventilated place, and be aware that it is fossil fuel derived and poisonous if ingested.
A nontoxic wax sealer intended to unwaxed items, like beeswax or Otter Wax, is a great option for consideration., You will need to lay your paper on a sturdy, flat surface that is dry and free of dust or grime. You don't want to stain your paper before it's sealed against the elements! Clear any clutter out of your way so that your work area is free and clear.

, You should test your wax on a separate sheet of scrap paper before trying the paper you want to preserve. Different kinds of wax will have different levels of softness, so by rubbing your wax on your scrap paper you'll be able to judge how firmly you'll need to press for the best application.You should do this over all over the document you wish to seal, on the front and back until it has a slick, waxy feel.


You may need to rub softly many times in a row to get your wax to stick to the paper, or you may be able to press the wax firmly into the paper to apply it in thick swatches.Be careful not to rub too hard or you might rip your paper.

, Rubbing can take time and can sometimes leave an incomplete seal on your paper. Beeswax, however, can be melted in a pot or crock pot so you can dip your document right into the wax. Use medium heat until the wax is in a liquid state. If you are using your fingers, you should be careful not to burn yourself while dipping the paper.


Dip your document quickly into the beeswax to seal it. Use a pair of tongs to completely immerse the document.
If you are using your fingers, dip the document in parts. Hold your paper by the dry end until your seal is firm and cool. Then you can turn your document and dip the other portion into the wax., The wax will be bonded to the surface of your paper now, and will protect it from moisture, grime, and even dust. Where the wax has not bonded, your paper could still get wet and damaged. Take your wax and cover any spots that you missed, or even places where the wax seal looks thin.


Use your fingers to test the wax. Especially for lighter wax that bonds clear to your paper, you'll be able to easily feel missed spots, which instead of smooth and waxy will have a bumpy texture, or the texture of paper.

, This is the best way to get the closest, tightest bond between your wax and document. You'll need to warm your wax, gently smoothing it as you do, with a heat source, like a hair dryer. Be sure you do this to both sides of your paper.


Use moderation when heating; you don't want the wax to drip off completely, you only want to soften it so that it works further into the fibers of your paper.
If you use a different heat source or an open flame heater, like a creme brulee torch, use extreme caution. The last thing you want to do is start a fire and lose your document forever.

, Although the wax will keep your paper safe from the elements, over time your wax seal can wear away. Heat can melt your wax seal, so you should keep this document out of the sun and away from heat. But, outside of heat and light, your wax seal will protect your document for as long as your seal is maintained.


Resealing your document is as easy as rubbing another application of wax on top of whatever wax remains on your document.
Wax sealed documents that undergo regular handling and wear will be more likely to rub off wax. These should be checked every few weeks for a thin or worn away seal.
Wax sealed documents that are kept from light and heat and handled with care can maintain a seal of a year or longer.

Dip your paper into the alum solution.,
Allow your document to dry.",How to Waterproof Paper2," To waterproof your paper, you will be making a solution that will alter the surface of its fibers to change its absorbency. This will make your paper not only waterproof, but also more durable. You'll need:


Alum 8 oz (found in the spice area of grocery stores or online)
Castile soap 3¾ oz (grated)
Water 4 pt
Gum arabic 2 oz
Natural glue 4 oz
Flat tray (deep) or wide mouth bowl
Tongs, When you have treated your paper with your solution, it will need to hang to dry. Clipping your piece of paper to a string or clothesline will be suitable for it to dry. However, droplets of this solution could possibly do damage to flooring or fabrics that aren't intended to be waterproofed. Be sure any droplets land in an appropriate receptacle, on a drop cloth, or onto newspaper., To mix your ingredients properly, you will need your water to be slightly heated. When your water is warmed, mix your ingredients into the water one at a time.

, You will need to stir your ingredients until your solution is an even blend of all its parts. Be sure not to overheat your water during this time; the water can get hot but should not boil.


The stirring process may take several minutes. Be patient and mix all ingredients thoroughly.

, You should remove your solution from the heat and let it cool for a short time. While the solution is still warm, pour the mixture into a large flat tray with deep rims or a wide mouthed bowl. These will make dipping your paper into your solution easier.

, Use your tongs to hold the paper, and dip it into the mixture, coating it completely. Don't allow the paper to remain in the solution too long, just long enough to coat the paper front and back.

, Once coated, remove your paper and hang it from a string or line. You can also use a wire cooling rack covered in wax paper to dry your paper. The wax paper will prevent your counter from any negative reaction to the solution.

Apply your solution.",How to Waterproof Paper3," You will need to combine pale shellac along with several other ingredients to create your sealing solution. These ingredients can be bought at craft stores or a pharmacy and are as follows:


Pale shellac 5 oz
Borax 1 oz
Water 1 pt
Flat tray (deep) or wide mouth bowl
Tongs, You will need to allow your paper to dry after you treat it with your solution, but errant drops of shellac can possibly do damage to your flooring or fixtures. Allowing the paper to hang dry over newspaper is a suitable way to dry your waterproofed document.You might also consider a wire drying rack with wax paper place underneath.

, Bring your water to a temperature just below the boiling point, as you would when poaching or scalding a food in water.Introduce the ingredients one by one to the water, stirring thoroughly until the solution is even., The bonding process of your ingredients may have left some impurities in your solution. The more impurities in your solution, the cloudier it will be, so you should strain your solution through a fine mesh. If your solution looks relatively clear, you can strain it right into your tray or wide mouthed bowl.Cheesecloth or muslin are excellent choices for straining your solution, if you don't have a fine sieve available.

, Now that your shellac sealant is in a bowl or deep tray that allows for easy dipping, take your paper in your tongs. Dip the paper quickly, but completely, in your solution, and then allow your paper to dry at your drying station."

Hang the paper to dry.",How to Tie Dye Paper2," Choose a pan large enough to also hold the paper you plan to dye. Don't worry if you aren't sure how many grounds to add, you can always add more to strengthen the coffee as it steeps.







, Allow the water and coffee grounds to steep at least five minutes. If the resulting liquid isn't dark enough, add more grounds and allow it to steep a few minutes more.








, How long you allow the paper to steep is completely up to you, depending on how dark you want the paper to be stained. Various projects could require paper to steep anywhere from five minutes to overnight.









If you would like to create symmetrical stained designs, fold the paper into squares, triangles or strips before placing it in the liquid.

, Wait until the paper is just a shade or two lighter than what you desire, then remove it from the coffee. The paper will darken a shade or two more as it dries.








, You can clip it to a clothesline or a curtain rod. Be careful as you handle the paper, since it will be more fragile while it’s wet. Drying time can vary based on the type of paper and where it's hanging. You can test it with your hand to know when its fully dried.


If you're not satisfied with the shade once the paper dries, simply repeat steps 3-5.

To create a symmetrical design, fold soft absorbent papers into halves, fourths or eighths. Hold a marker down on the top layer until the ink has soaked through all of the layers., You can get the paper wet by spraying it with or dipping it into water. When the marker gets wet, it will bleed and blur, resembling tie dye. You want the paper to be wet but not dripping.

One tray larger than your paper, with raised edges.
A second tray or bucket larger than your paper, filled with water.
A clothesline or drying rack;
, Alum is a ""mordant,"" meaning it causes color to set on the paper. Without it, the marbling will be faint and blurry. To make enough alum for several dozen sheets of paper, stir 1 tbsp (15 mL) alum into 1½ cups (360 mL) warm water until completely dissolved, at least two minutes.Buy pure aluminum sulfate from an art supply store or online. Do not use alum sold as a spice. This is usually a related chemical compound that may damage the paper.
Keep alum out of reach of children. It is not dangerous to handle, but can dry the skin and irritate the nose when inhaled. Wear gloves or wash hands after handling, and avoid inhaling the powder.

, Wipe the alum mixture over the sheet of paper with a sponge in a couple long strokes, covering the entire sheet without soaking it. Mark the untreated side with a pencil to avoid confusion. Lay the paper flat with the treated side up, until dry (roughly 15–30 minutes)., Liquid starch is available in the detergent section of your grocery store. Pour it to about 1 inch (2.5 cm) depth. Let the liquid settle before you continue, and avoid bumping the tray.


This is by far the easiest option to set up, but most experienced marbling artists use other materials. See below for alternatives if you get poor results from starch, or if starch is not available in your area.

, This will break the surface tension, and remove dust and air bubbles. Pop remaining bubbles with a pin.

, Arrange a small cup or dish for each color of acrylic paint. Use an eyedropper or paintbrush to transfer a drop of paint to the liquid starch (or a small, separate test dish of starch left until still). Most brands and colors will sink, in which case you should add marbling gall to that container of paint. Vegetable oil is a cheap substitute, but may leave your paper a little greasy.Stir in one drop at a time, testing in between, until a drop of paint float on the surface and spreads out slowly. Stir in more if the drop rapidly spreads to more than 3 inches (7.5 cm).


Old-fashioned ox gall will not work with acrylic paints. Use a detergent-based marbling gall that does not contain animal products.This is also sold as surfactant or dispersant.
Test each color separately, and test before each marbling session. Changes in temperature and humidity can change the amount of gall required.

, Once all your paints are prepared, add drops directly to the large tray of starch. For individual drops, use an eyedropper or paintbrush tip. To scatter many drops at once, use a tight bundle of plastic straws, flicked over the surface. Repeat with several colors, until they've spread across the whole surface of the liquid.


For your first few projects, start with a dark base layer and use no more than four colors.You can get a different shades of the same color by mixing slightly more gall into the paint.

, You can use any thin object you don't mind getting messy, such as a small paintbrush or toothpick. Drag this through the liquid, just under the surface, to create swirls and points. To create parallel patterns, use a cheap, wide-toothed comb or a plastic fork.


Too much stirring will cause the colors to blend and become murky. Stop if you notice the borders between the colors becoming less distinct.

, Hold the paper by opposite corners, with the alum-treated side down. Lower the center of the paper to the center of the starch tray. Once it touches the surface, quickly lower the rest of the paper, until the corners you are holding reach the surface. Tap the corners gently to make sure they touch the surface.If you drop the paper all at once, air bubbles may get trapped underneath and leave uncolored areas on your paper.

, The paper is now decorated with color, but also covered with a thin layer of starch. Immediately peel it off using the corner, and move it to the bucket of water for rinsing. Depending on how well your paint adhered, you may be able to gently shake the paper under the water level until the starch is removed. To reduce risk of washing off the color, rinse the paper with a gentle trickle of water from a faucet or sponge.

, Hang the paper over a clothesline or drying rack, colored side up. Once dry, the paper will be permanently marbled. Repeat with several additional sheets of paper. Create a new decoration. once the starch surface is looking mostly clear., You can use any thick liquid, called a ""size,"" instead of the starch. For this traditional and popular choice, combine 1 tbsp (15 mL) carrageenan powder and 4 cups (950 mL) water, then blend for about 30 seconds until combined. Cover in plastic and refrigerate for 8 hours, to form a bubble-free liquid with the thickness of syrup or buttermilk.You can use it after 3 or 4 hours, but the bubbles may cause defects in your patternIt can last in the fridge for about a week.
If the tap water in your area is very hard (mineral-heavy), you may need to use filtered water.

, Many book binder use methyl cellulose, which is cheaper than carrageenan but trickier to use. Buy methyl cellulose labeled ""cold water dispersible"" online, in a book-binding supply store, or in a large crafts store.Stir it into boiling water, then combine with ice water to make a mixture that sets within 10 minutes and lasts indefinitely., Specialized marbling inks may be designed to use with a specific liquid, so check the label before buying. If you're getting vivid colors and sharp lines with the paint, there's no need to switch. You can also use other types of paint, but you may need to change the liquid they float on and/or the gall you mix them with. Here are some examples:


Oil paints mixed with turpentine, floating on water.Watercolor paints mixed with oxgall, floating on carrageenan

, Japanese suminagashi ink will float on plain water, making the whole setup much easier.This typically creates thinner ring patterns, rather than the saturated colors seen in Turkish or European marbling.

, Experienced marbling artists often use ""combs"" or ""rakes,"" which are lengths of lumber with nails hammered through them. This allows for more symmetrical effects, dragging the nails through the pattern in a straight line.

",How to Turn Construction Paper Into Colored Normal Paper," Fold it up and crumple it in a messy manner, but don't rip it. When you find your paper covered in fold marks, you are ready for step two. The reason you have to crumple it up is because it is easier to manage it.;
, Then, using extreme carefulness, squeeze out excess water and uncrumple the paper. The crumpling now not only makes it easier to manage but it also prevents the running water from pushing a hole through the paper. Blow on the paper just a little bit.

, Place it so it completely covers the paper and sit on the object. Also, make sure you execute this action on a flat surface, otherwise the finished product will be uneven. Repeat with the other side. Continue doing this until the paper is noticeably at least a little drier and very flat. Do not continue because you see fold marks-they should be there, but if they are so deep that the paper looks kind of messy, do continue.

,, Put it over the paper so that a bit of the top shows, then carefully press down and slide slowly across a small table. You will probably need to place the object back in its original position to continue and prevent ripping. It is not necessary to repeat with the other side. However, you may do so if you wish.

Gather used paper.,
Shred the paper.,
Soak the shredded paper.,
Blend the soggy paper mixture.",How to Make Recycled Paper1," The texture and color of the old paper that you repurpose will directly inform the quality of the ""finished"" recycled paper. You can use printer paper, newspaper, (clean) napkins and tissues, photocopier paper, wrapping paper, brown paper, lined paper, and even old envelopes.Remember: the paper will shrink and contract through the soaking and drying process, so you will need to find much more scrap paper than the amount of recycled paper that you want to create. The more


As a general rule of thumb, 4-5 sheets of newspaper should produce two small sheets of recycled paper.This ratio may vary depending on the type and thickness of the paper that you pulp.
If you want your recycled paper to be ""plain"" with a consistent color, be mindful of the variety of scraps that you use. If you use mostly white paper scraps, for instance, your finished product will more closely resemble a standard piece of printer paper.;
, Rip up your paper scraps into small, fairly equally-sized pieces – the finer, the better. If the pieces are large, then the finished product will be jumbled and chunky. Try putting the pages through a shredder, then grinding or ripping the shredded pieces into even smaller bits., Place the finely ground-up scraps into a dish or a pan, and fill the container with hot water. Stir the mixture to ensure that all of the paper is thoroughly soaked. Leave the paper to stew for a few hours, stirring occasionally.


Consider adding a few tablespoons of cornstarch after a few hours to firm up the consistency. This step is not mandatory, although some recycled paper crafters swear by it. If you add cornstarch, stir it thoroughly into the mix, and add a bit of hot water to aid the soaking., After a few hours, place two or three handfuls of the soggy paper mixture into the blender. Fill the blender about half-full with water. Turn on the blender in short bursts to break up the paper into mush. When the paper is ready to use, it will have the mushy texture of cooked oatmeal.If you don't own a blender, then shredding and soaking should suffice. However, this added act of mechanical pulping will make your finished product much smoother.

Procure a screen.,
Fill a pan with pulp.,
Lay the window screen into the pan.,
Put the screen on a towel to drain.",How to Make Recycled Paper2," You will use this device to strain the wet pulp, filtering the water from the clumps of paper. When the paper mush dries onto the screen, it will gradually congeal into recycled paper. Thus, it's important that the dimensions of the screen match the size of the paper sheet that you want to create. A cut-out piece of window screen is ideal here – roughly 8 inches by 12 inches, or as large as you like.Try to fit a border around the screen to hold in the pulp. An old wooden picture frame will do, but you can also glue or staple thin pieces of wood around the outside of the screen to make your own ""frame.""
If the screen is made from metal, be sure that it is not rusty. The rust may stain your paper.

, Use a dishpan, a baking pan, or a wide, shallow bucket. It should be at least 4-6 inches deep. Pour the pulp into the pan until it is about halfway full. Then, add water until the mixture is 3-4 inches deep. The pan should be mostly full, but not so much that the addition of the screen will make the pulp-and-water mixture spill over., Slide it into the bottom of the pan so that it lays beneath all of the water and pulp. Gently slide the screen back and forth through the mixture to break up any clumps. Then, lift the screen straight up. The pulp should be spread evenly in a thin layer on top of the screen.


Alternately: lay the screen into the bottom of the pan before you add the water and pulp. Then, pour the paper pulp over the screen. When you lift the screen out of the water, it should still sift out the pulp from the liquid.

, Make sure that the paper-side of the screen is facing up and away from the towel. The sifting process alone will not strain out all of the moisture. The pulp will still need at least another hour to drain. Leave it to dry, and do not disturb it.

Squeeze out the excess water.,
Lift up the screen and turn it over.,
Peel the paper from the sheet.,
Test it out.",How to Make Recycled Paper3," After an hour has passed, lay a piece of sheet or another thin fabric on top of the pulp on the screen. Then, press down firmly on the sheet with a dry sponge to squeeze out all the excess water from the paper pulp. The goal is to transfer the paper from the screen to this sheet. The sheet should be flat, clean, dry, and unwrinkled so that it is a suitable mold for your paper., The paper should release onto the sheet. Lay it on a flat surface to dry overnight, or for a few hours at minimum. Keep it in a warm, dry place.


Try not to place the drying paper under direct heat, or very close to a powerful heating source. This might cause the paper to crinkle and dry unevenly.

, When the paper pulp is dry, carefully peel it away from the cloth. You should now have a sheet of dry, firmly-pressed, functional paper! If it works, you can use the same equipment to produce as much recycled paper as you like., Write on the paper with pencil and pen to gauge its quality. Figure out whether it is absorbent enough; whether it is clear enough to see the words; and whether it will hold up as a durable and passable sheet of paper. If you plan to make more paper, take notes on this batch so that you can improve your product next time.


If the paper grit is too rough, it's probably because you didn't grind up the pulp finely enough. If it's falling apart, then you may not have used enough water to bind the paper fibers together.
If the paper is too colorful (to the point that it's difficult to see the words that you write,) then you may need to use more consistently-colored source paper. Try using all white paper next time.

Allow the paper to dry.",How to Make Papyrus," Papyrus paper is created from the Cyperus papyrus plant, which is a light but strong reed. You can obtain one by contacting a papyrus plant nursery. There are other options if you can’t find the plant. You can also make the paper out of wide grasses, like river reeds.Papyrus plants can be purchased online. You can also ask your local nursery if they carry the plant.;
, About one foot of papyrus plant will make a large piece of paper that will be nearly two feet in length. Cut off as many stalks as you will need to make the amount of paper you want. The cuts must be diagonally made. Then, cut the tips of the papyrus. You will not use the tips, which are the thinner, grass-like end of the plant. Use strong scissors or pruners.

, Only the inner part of the plant is used for the paper. You will need to remove the outer green part of the plant. Use a sharp knife and slice down the length of the plant until the entire outer layer is removed. The inside of the plant should be a white or slightly greenish color.You can also use scissors if you don’t have a sharp knife available.
Have someone help you with the peeling process if you are uncomfortable with using a sharp knife for slicing.

, Use the knife you used to cut off the outer portion to cut the inner layers of the papyrus plant (pith) into thin strips. Hold the plant in your hand and cut towards you vertically. Make sure that all of the strips have the same size and thickness. The best strips typically come from the center of the plant. The lowest quality comes from the outermost layers.It is also an option to cut away from your body if you don’t feel comfortable cutting towards your body.
You can cut the strips into smaller pieces if you want to make smaller sized paper.

, There are some natural glue-like chemicals within the plant that need to be released before you can turn it into papyrus. Let them soak in the water for at least 72 hours. Three days, however, is ideal for soaking. Try to lay them out flat in a tray of water to soak. Set the tray in a place where the water won’t evaporate quickly.The strips should turn flexible and transparent.

, The pattern doesn’t matter at this point. Just lay them out flat and make sure they don’t overlap. Your countertop or a sturdy table will work., Grab a rolling pin and use it to roll the strips flat. The rolling pin should be squeezing the water out of them and flattening the strips into sheets.In the past, papyrus strips were pounded with a hard object to remove the excess water.

, Lay the strips on the cloth. Get a dry sheet of linen cloth or felt. Then, begin to weave them together. You want to create two layers of strips, with the top layer strips being perpendicular to the bottom layer strips. It should resemble a placemat. The strips should slightly overlap one another to prevent the papyrus from falling apart later.Cover the papyrus strips with a second sheet of linen cloth once you have weaved them together.

, Make sure that the wooden boards are somewhat heavy. The pressure is necessary to flatten the papyrus strips together. Once the strips have been placed between the boards, press them together. Lay the sandwiched papyrus sheet on a flat surface and allow the wooden boards to flatten the sheet using gravity. You can put heavy books on top of the boards if the boards aren’t very heavy.

, You should do this every few hours. Be careful when removing the wet linen. Peel it off of the papyrus gently. The drying process should take approximately 72 hours. , The paper may not be completely flat after you remove it from the wooden boards. Put the paper under a stone slab for up to six days to make it completely flat. The time under the slab will also allow the sugar within the papyrus to seal together.If you are pressed for time, you can use the rolling pin to flatten the paper.

, This step isn’t absolutely necessary, but it will make the papyrus look nicer and more finished. Use a shell or smooth piece of ivory. Any type of shell that is smooth and without ridges will do. Rub the shell or ivory over the sheet of paper until it appears to be shinier than it was.A smooth stone will work as well.
Do not rub with too much force or you could rip the paper.

, The sheet may be larger than you want when it is finished. Use a razor, scissors, or paper cutter to cut the papyrus into smaller sheets. Measure the sizes you are cutting so you will have multiple sheets of the same size.


You can make a notebook out of the sheets of paper you’ve just made.

, Use newspaper to cover the table or whatever surface you’re planning to make the paper on. The process can get messy, especially with children. This will make cleaning up easier. Once the surface is covered, place a paper towel on top of the newspaper. The paper towel will be the base layer of the papyrus., Use ½ cup of glue. Any type of liquid white glue will work. Then, pour ½ cup of water in the bowl. Mix the contents with a spoon until a runny consistency is created.Pour one full cup of glue and water if you plan on making two sheets of paper.

, You will need to use two brown paper lunch bags. Tear the bags into ½ inch wide strips, but the strips should be long. Tear the strips as long as you want the paper to be. You can use your hands to tear the strips, or cut them with scissors.You should use four brown paper bags if you plan to make two sheets of paper.

, Dip each strip individually. Try to keep the strips as flat as possible when dipping them. Make sure the strips are fully soaked with the mixture., After you dip each strip in the mixture, lay them next to each other on top of the paper towel. You should lay them out vertically. The strips should be slightly overlapping., Once the first half off the strips have been laid out vertically, begin laying out the second half of the strips. Lay the strips out horizontally and on, Press the paper with your hands once all of the strips have been laid out. Smooth out any excess air or glue bubbles. Continue doing this until the paper is smooth and flat., Keep the paper on top of the paper towel and newspaper while it dries. It should take about eight hours to dry. Once it has dried, carefully peel the paper off of the newspaper."

Choose a spot to work near the kitchen sink.,
Ventilate the room.,
Supervise children.",How to Singe Paper1," This way you can drop the paper into the sink if the whole sheet suddenly catches fire. If you prefer to sit while you work, set up a large baking sheet on the table to catch the paper if you need to drop it.Keep a glass of water handy if you’re not working near a sink so that you can quickly douse any flames that get out of control.;
, Since you could potentially create strong fumes if you’re burning paper with any type of coating on it, open windows and doors to provide air flow while you work., This is a fun activity for kids to participate in, but they should not do it without adult supervision. Explain some of the dangers involved, and instruct them to drop anything that starts burning out of control onto their baking sheet or other fire-proof surface."

Hold the paper beside the flame for singed edges.,
Hold the paper above the flame if you want singed holes.,
Douse the flame with water or by blowing on it.",How to Singe Paper2," Any piece of paper that’s shiny or very bright white probably has a coating on it. This makes it more aesthetically pleasing for printing purposes, but makes it more difficult to achieve a natural, singed look. Choose a piece of paper that’s designed for painting, watercolors, or charcoal drawing and has fibers that you can clearly see., Either can be used to the same effect, but don’t use anything more powerful, such as a butane torch. This will simply be too powerful a tool to use on paper., Slide the edge of the paper back and forth through the flame a few times until it’s glowing, but don’t let it actually catch fire., Holding the paper about 1 inch (5 cm) above the flame, allow the heat from the candle to rise and burn a hole in your paper. Pull the paper up as soon as you see a hole starting to form, since it can spread quickly.Move the paper slightly closer if you’re not seeing any burning.

, If you blow on it, be sure you’re not blowing embers toward anything flammable. It’s ok to sprinkle some water on it and then lay it flat to dry, since the water spots will contribute to an aged appearance."

Place your paper on a heat-resistant surface.,
Rub the edges of the paper with lemon or lime juice.,
Hold a heat gun near the edge of the paper.,
Heat the paper until the edges begin to look burnt.",How to Singe Paper3," Use a baking sheet or a stone cutting board to hold the paper while you heat it. You won’t be using an open flame, but heat guns can reach very high temperatures so it’s important to still take safety precautions., The more lemon juice you dab on, the greater the burn effect you’ll get later, so use as little or as much as you want. You can use the side of a lemon or lime slice to rub it in, or just squirt some of the juice onto the paper and use your finger to distribute it., Heat guns are relatively inexpensive and can be purchased at most craft or hardware stores. Always hold it at a 45-degree angle about 2-3 inches (5-7 cm) away from the edge of the paper.Since you’ll be blowing hot air at the paper, you may want to put on an oven mitt and hold down the opposite side of the paper with one hand.

, The longer you heat one spot, the darker it will become. This process will not be as instantaneous as using an open flame, so be patient. Try moving the heat gun a little closer if you’re not getting the effect you want."

Make your fake money.,
Create multiple copies.,
Cut your bills out.,
Add a band around the bills.",How to Make Fake Money," This mixture will be used to stain the paper so that it has a more ‘warn-money’ look. Use about 3 tablespoons of coffee (all though a little more or a little less will not really make too much of a difference.) You can also add a few drops of green food dye to give you paper a more olive-y look.









You can also use tea to dye your fake money. Make a pot of black tea--it doesn’t matter what kind so long as it is black tea. Brew it for a bit longer than you normally would brew drinking tea (so let it sit for five or more minutes.) The extra time will make the tea a bit darker in color.;
, Make sure to evenly coat both sides of the paper so that there is a more uniform color throughout your money. However, try to dip the paper as quickly (and evenly) as possible to reduce the chance of potentially ripping the paper because it is too soggy.








, Make sure none of the pieces are overlapping (which means you may have to do one piece of paper at a time.) Place the paper and plate in the microwave and heat the paper for 20 seconds. Take it out and test it--if it is still damp, place it back in the microwave for another 20 seconds.









If you would prefer not to use a microwave, you can simply let the paper air dry. Lay the paper out flat on something that you do not mind getting wet (such as on a baking sheet.) You could also hang the paper up on a clothes line.

, There are two ways to do this. You can either print out images of currency, or draw them onto the paper yourself. Be aware that while printing images of money will look more realistic, there are certain limitations you must abide by so that you do not break the law. Your printed fake money can only be one-sided and less than three-fourths the size of real currency.









To print your fake money: Place your dyed paper into your printer. Select the image you would like to print and print it out. Know that it must be three-fourths the size of a real dollar. Learn how to resize images on the computer here.


To draw the details: Use real money as a reference. Choose the amount of currency you would like to create and place it in front of you. Trace around a real dollar to create the outline of your fake dollar so that it is the right size. Draw the details of the front of the dollar onto your fake dollar.

, Use a scanner to duplicate your drawing or printed-out money. Make sure to load the scanner/printer with your dyed pieces of paper.









If you forget to load the printer with your dyed paper, you can dye the paper you printed your images on by dipping them back in the coffee mixture and putting them in the microwave again. Be aware that the ink used to make the details of the money may run if you do this.

, Now that you have multiple bills, cut them out with scissors. You could also use a paper cutter to ensure that your bills are all cut the same size and that the cuts are straight.








, Only do this if you are wanting to create a stack of fake bills. You can purchase cash straps at office supply stores or banks. If you do not want to buy them, you can use thick rubber bands. Write the name of a fake bank (or a real one even) on the wide rubber band.

Gather Your Materials.,
Separate the candle wick from the wax.,
Ground the wax into finer pieces.,
Melt the wax using the parchment paper.,
Open the parchment paper to see if you have enough.,
Apply the wax to your paper.,
Make the wax smooth.,
Place between paper towels to cool.,
Flip and repeat.",How to Make Fireproof Paper1," It is best to start with paper that you have already written on, because normal writing implements do not always write easily on wax paper. You will also need wax that you can melt down, and some basic tools to treat the paper with wax.


Wax, or candles
Parchment paper
Scissors
A sealable sandwich bag
Hammer or mallet
Iron and ironing board
Cloth towel and paper towels;
, If you are starting out with candles rather than just wax, you need to get the wick out. Use a hammer, knife, and/or other household implements to chip into the wax and extract the wick. It is ok, and even preferable, if you have to split the wax into a lot of small pieces, since you will eventually melt them. Having more small pieces creates more surface area, making the melting process faster.


You don’t need a large amount of wax. Start with a tea light or votive, or that leftover half of a taper candle on the kitchen table.

, Put the wax in the plastic bag and seal it. Tap it gently with the hammer to break it into smaller pieces. Placing it in the bag will ensure that pieces of wax don’t go flying all over the room!

, Put the towel on the ironing board. Then, place the pieces of wax on one half of the parchment paper. Fold the paper once so that the wax is encased inside like a sandwich, and place it on the towel. Use the iron to melt the wax.


Make sure you keep the iron moving. Just as with clothing, leaving it on one spot too long will burn or damage whatever is under it. Parchment paper is flame resistant, but not completely non-flammable.

, The wax should have enough surface area to cover your paper. If it doesn’t, add more wax, close the paper, and iron it again. Repeat this until you have enough wax., Place the paper you want to make flame resistant on the wax. Fold the parchment paper back again and iron for a few seconds. The heat will help the hot wax bond to the paper. Add more wax if necessary.

, You want the paper to be as smooth and flat as possible – unless you are adding texture for an arts and crafts project. Feel the wax to see if it is smooth. If not, place it back in the parchment paper sandwich and use the iron to press the wax flatter and outwards off the paper. It should be easy to guide the wax toward the edges of the paper, so make sure you are not hovering for too long over one area.

, You are done with one side now. Put the newly wax-coated paper between two pieces of paper towel to help it dry in a clean location. You don’t want particles from your kitchen table or elsewhere to become a permanent feature of your flame resistant paper.

, You will want both sides of your paper to be coated with wax. It will be much more flame retardant if no dry paper is exposed. After you are happy with the coat on one side, repeat the process on the opposite side.

Light the flash paper on fire.",How to Make Flash Paper," Before you begin working with acids, it’s important to wear the proper protective gear. Wear long sleeves that cover your arms as well as chemical resistant goggles, gloves, and apron. You also should have access to a fume hood that you can work under., Bring all your supplies into a well-ventilated laboratory and place them next to the fume hood. Set up a bowl of baking soda in the case of an acid spill. Sodium bicarbonate neutralizes acids and makes spills less harmful and dangerous.Make sure that the fume hood works before you begin working.
In case of an acid spill, pour the baking soda over the spill. You will see bubbling, which means that the neutralization is taking place as gaseous C02 is released. Test the pH of the spill with pH paper. Once it’s between 6 and 9, it’s safe to wipe the spill with a sponge and wash the material down the sink.

, You can create flash paper out of tissue paper, toilet paper, or even a cotton T-shirt. Just make sure that whatever paper you use is 100% cotton. Cut out however many sheets as you want into roughly the same size as a business card., Under the fume hood, pour concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid into a 1 liter (0.26 US gal) (4.2 cup) pitcher in a 5:4 ratio (5 parts concentrated nitric acid to 4 parts concentrated sulfuric acid). Make sure that you have enough liquid to eventually submerge the paper.Stand outside the fume hood, with the beakers and acid inside the hood. Place your gloved hands inside the fume hood and do all your work at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) in from the hood opening., To mix the two acids together, hold the pitcher and lightly swirl it with a slight motion of your hand. Do not shake the acid or swirl it vigorously, as this can cause the acid to splash., Take one of your strips of paper and drop it into the pitcher of acid. Use a glass stirring rod to poke your paper in the water until it is completely submerged. You can do all your sheets at the same, so keep adding and submerging the sheets with the glass rod until you have added all your paper., After you have added your last sheet, wait 15-20 minutes for the paper to fully absorb the acid. By the end of the wait, tissue paper or regular paper will be off-white, while toilet paper will be slightly brown., While you are waiting for the paper to soak, fill a wide 1 liter (0.26 US gal) (4.2 cup) beaker or pitcher halfway up with water. Make sure that the beaker is wide enough to fit the papers. Place the beaker of water next to the pitcher of acid., Use a pair of forceps or tongs to lift up one of the pieces of paper out of the acid. Keep the paper poised above the pitcher of acid until it stops dripping. Once the paper stops dripping, carefully drop the paper into the beaker of water. Repeat this process for each of your strips of paper, making sure that they stop dripping before you transfer them.You are now done with the acids. Neutralize the acids by pouring baking soda into the beaker of acid, waiting until the bubbling stops. Then turn on the water and pour the neutralized acid down the drain. Run the water for a few more seconds, then turn it off.

, Leave the pieces of paper in the water bath for about five minutes, using the glass stirrer to occasionally stir the papers. If you are using toilet paper, you should see the paper turn from brown to off-white., Bring the water beaker to the sink. It’s not necessary to work under the fume hood anymore, as you have finished working with the acids. Carefully pour the water out of the beaker, using the glass stirrer to push back the paper so it doesn’t escape from the beaker. After you empty out the water, turn on the sink and pour about the same amount of lukewarm water back into the beaker.What you are essentially doing is washing the paper to get off excess acid.

, Repeat the process of draining the water, then filling the beaker back up two or three more times. This will effectively flush the paper., Take the papers out of the water bath one by one with a pair of tongs, pausing over the beaker until they finish dripping. Then place the papers side by side on a folded sheet of paper towel. Leave the paper on the sheet of paper towel to dry overnight, or for at least 8 hours.


Make sure that they aren’t overlapping so that they can dry quicker.

, After the paper has dried, fill a 1 liter (0.26 US gal) (4.2 cup) beaker with a 1 ML solution of sodium bicarbonate. Then place each piece of paper as you did with the water bath in the sodium bicarbonate.If you notice bubbling, take the beaker to the sink and pour out the sodium bicarbonate, holding the papers back with the glass stirrer. Then add water like you did before, adding it and emptying a few times.
Wait for the paper to thoroughly dry, either overnight or for 8 hours.

, Fill pitcher with enough ethanol to submerge the papers, then add the papers as you did for the sodium bicarbonate. Let them soak in the ethanol for 15-20 minutes, then take them out, waiting for them to stop dripping, and place them on a fresh folded sheet of paper towel., When you light the paper on fire, you want to be in a safe environment with no flammable objects around. This could be a laboratory or a neutral environment like on the pavement of your driveway. Bring the papers that you dried, matches, and a flame-proof container like a baking tray or measuring cup, as well as a fire extinguisher.

, First make sure that the flash paper is completely dry, because the trick won’t work if it is still partially wet. When you have checked that it’s dry, use a pair of heatproof tongs or forceps to hold up the piece of flash paper over the flame-proof container., Light the match, then hold it up to the flash paper. You will see that the paper immediately catches fire, then starts to quickly burn down without producing any ash or residue!After you finish playing with your flash paper, put any additional pieces of paper in a safe location like a drawer or envelope, as they are extremely flammable!

Look for flame retardant chemicals.,
Get boric acid powder and borax.,
Mix the solution in the bucket.,
Test the solution.,
Apply your solution to the paper.",How to Make Fireproof Paper2," The easiest and cheapest way to chemically coat your paper with flame retardants is buying it rather than making it. There are sprays and chemicals available at home improvement stores and on the internet. Follow the directions on the packaging for coating paper.


Avoid products that have noxious or toxic chemicals. Since you will likely be keeping this paper in your home, confining chemicals in your living area may be hazardous to your health. Do not buy products labeled ‘poison,’ ‘warning,’ or ‘danger.’, If you want to make your own flame resistant coating, you can do it with a couple chemicals. You can find boric acid powder in many insecticides and repellents. Borax is available by itself, as it is often used as a ‘detergent booster.’You will also need a gallon bucket and some warm water to mix the compound. Finally, get together a towel to test your solution and a clean paintbrush (or spray bottle) to apply the solution.

, Put 50 grams of boric acid powder and 60 grams of borax into a half gallon of hot water. Use a stirring implement like a wooden spoon or stick to dissolve the powders into the water. It is advisable to use an implement you can immediately throw away. You certainly shouldn’t use an implement you cook with., Put the rag or cloth into the bucket and soak it thoroughly. Hang it outside to dry and wait until it is completely dry. When it is dry, hold a flame under one of the corners. The cloth should turn black, but if it burns, you did not add enough powder. Play with the amounts of each chemical you added to get a combination that works.


Use a fresh cloth every time you tweak the measurements.

, You will need to soak the paper thoroughly with the solution to make it flame resistant. Use the paint brush, spray bottle, or other implement (use your imagination) to make sure you cover every inch of the paper with plenty of solution.


You can even try soaking the paper in the solution. Put it in a tray and submerge the paper, as with developing and printing photographs.

Choose paper that looks antique.,
Decide how big the map will be.",How to Make a Pirate Map As a Prop1," Pirate treasure maps should seem old, if not ancient. In older times, paper was often made in more laborious ways than today, by hand. As such, it looked uneven and was often textured. If you have the time to make your own paper, this would be an excellent paper choice. Other than that, you could choose high quality, textured paper (like linen paper) or even very light card.;
, The size is completely up to you and how you wish to use it. If it's to be in a play, it'll need to be large enough for the audience to see it from a distance. If it's for decoration, it can be smaller, as people will likely move closer to peer at it. Be guided by what you intend to do with it.

Fold the first piece of paper into thirds like you would a letter going into an envelope:








Beginning with the backside of the paper facing up on a flat surface, fold the top third of the paper down to create a horizontal fold. Crease well.
Fold the resulting shape in half, creating a horizontal fold. Crease well.;
, Fold the right bottom corner up so the bottom tip meets the top of the paper, making a diagonal crease. Crease well.









Fold the left top corner down to meet the bottom of the paper, making a diagonal crease. Crease well.
You’ll have what will look like a square in the middle of the paper, flanked on each side by triangles (which will be facing opposite ways--one facing the front, one facing the back)., You should then have two identically folded pieces of paper.









Now you can begin to join them together to form an origami menko.

, Lay the first piece so it’s oriented horizontally with the triangle folds facing up towards you.









Lay the second piece over the first, but oriented vertically with the triangle folds facing up towards you.

, Grasp the right flap of the first piece and fold it vertically along the right edge of the second piece. Crease well.









The tip of the flap of the first piece will touch the top left corner of the square in the center of the second piece.

Whatever you choose, it should be sturdy and thick.Origami Paper. This is paper designed for origami artwork. It should fold easily, and you will have a wide range of options for color. On the other hand, this is a little more expensive than regular paper, and may only make a wallet large enough for coins and small notes.
Paper Bag. If you are looking for a larger and more durable wallet, you can use a medium-sized paper bag from the grocery store or other shopping trip. You will need to cut a square out of the bag, but you will have much more flexibility in wallet size.;
, Start by laying the paper with the side you want facing outward down on the table. Make a good crease in the center, then unfold, back side facing out. This won’t be a final fold, just a mark in the middle for your next step., You will now fold the paper into fourths by folding each side into the center crease. Once you have done that, open the paper back up. You should have three creases, and the paper evenly divided into four parts., These edge of these folds should line up with the folds you made in the last step. Make sure you get all four corners., They should be symmetrical. You should now have two flaps, with folded corners. Once you are done with these folds, flip the paper over., This fold should be about 1/3 of the way down. A good rule to follow is to make sure a full triangle of the paper’s back side shows.


As you are adding extra folds at this point, you may want to use a ruler or something else to help flatten the paper and keep the folds nice and tight., This is the last step to your origami wallet. You’ll take the bottom part of your paper and fold upward to hold everything together.Fold the up the bottom part of the paper. This fold should slightly overlap the other flap. Crease the fold well.
Insert the bottom triangle corners slide into the top triangle corners. You should be able to see a diamond showing the backside of the paper, with each of the corners in the color of the outside.

, Use the first crease you made to fold in half and finish your wallet. Now you’ll be able to slide cards and coins into the pockets, depending on how big of a wallet you were able to make.Once you are finished, you can also decorate the outside with drawings or stickers to help make your wallet ever more personal, or to remind you what is in there.

Understand the risks.,
Set the paper under a towel or cloth.,
Set a clothes iron to a low heat.,
Press the iron into the towel.,
Make adjustments if necessary.",How to Flatten Crumpled Paper2," Ironing a piece of paper under a towel or cloth will make it flat, but the wrinkle and crease lines will usually still be visible. If you use steam or lightly wet the paper, as described near the end of this section, this may remove the wrinkle lines, but also increases the chance of fading colored ink or tearing the paper.


If your paper is valuable or irreplaceable, try this method with a test piece first, or use the safer, but slower, pressing method.

, Smooth out the paper as flat as you can with your hands, to avoid setting the folds and creases in further. Lay a hand towel, pillowcase, or other heat-safe cloth over the paper, to protect it from the direct heat of the clothes iron.

, Starting at the lowest setting is recommended, to minimize the chance of damaging your paper. Too much heat can dry out the paper, making it brittle and yellow.

, Once the iron has warmed up, press it against the towel and move it across the surface, just like you would iron an item of clothing.

, After about a minute of ironing the towel, lift the towel and look at the paper. If it is not yet flat, you can turn up the heat one setting and trying again. If the paper is already warm to the touch, leave the iron on a low setting, and instead lightly dab or spray the paper with a small amount of distilled water before you iron again. This helps remove the wrinkles, but can increase the risk of tearing.


Do not apply water to a paper surface with watercolors, chalk, or other water-soluble materials.

Store materials in a preservation envelope.",How to Flatten Crumpled Paper3," Archivists and conservator-restorers are professionals who specialize in preserving historical artifacts, including paper. They should be able to flatten and preserve all paper materials at a high quality, including watercolors, old or fragile paper, and other objects that can be difficult to safely flatten at home.


Search online for document archival services in your area, or ask a librarian for hep finding one.

, As mentioned in the other methods, wetting the paper, or ""humidifying"" it, can help remove wrinkles caused by torn and displaced fibers. Archivists often use special tools and extreme care to increase the humidity of the paper significantly. If you are brave, and have a few test pieces of paper to try out first, you can try to mimic some of these at home before pressing your paper. One of the easiest might be the ""Horton Humidifier"" method. Place the rolled-up paper in a plastic cup, open to the air. Place the cup in a plastic garbage can, add water to the bottom of the can, and close the garbage can lid.This can cause mold growth on the paper, which is difficult to treat at home. Some archivists use anti-fungal chemicals such as thymol or ortho-phenyl phenol, but these materials can be highly dangerous to the user and the paper if used incorrectly., Pressing the paper flat is usually effective, using vices or clamps in addition to heavy objects if more pressure is needed. Another method, which can be used alone or in addition to pressing, involves the use of glue. By gluing the paper to another surface, using a special glue that will detach easily when dry, the paper will be kept in place as it dries, instead of curling or stretching when one portion of it loses water and shrinks.Even archivists find it difficult to control the size change of paper after wetting. While barely noticeable for an individual sheet of paper, a stack of papers, papers glued or taped together to form a larger piece, or a bound book can feel noticeably different or uneven., One archivist's tool is widely available for commercial sale. Purchase archival-quality plastic envelopes to keep your important documents, family history, and other papers safe for decades if not centuries, protecting them from moisture and ultraviolet light.

Position your laptop.",How to Make a Paper Laptop," To make a paper laptop, you should get two pieces of paper or cardstock in the color and size you want your laptop case to be. You also need two pieces of white paper, a piece of cardboard, a ruler, scissors, glue, clear tape, a pen, and markers or colored pencils.If you want a decorative laptop case, get patterned paper instead of plain.;
, Now that you have your materials, you need to decide what style you want your computer to be. One one of the sheets of paper, draw the logo of the computer brand you want to make. For example, draw an apple if you want it to be an Apple computer or the word Toshiba if you want a Toshiba computer.


If you aren't sure of the logo that you want, do some research to find exactly what the top of your favorite brand of laptops looks like. That way, you will be as accurate as possible.
If you are using patterned paper, draw the logo on the side that has the pattern on it. That way, the pattern will look like a laptop case., Now that you have a base, you need to make your desktop. Take one of the white sheets of paper and hold it up to the paper you just drew the logo on. If they are the same size, measure and mark a one inch margin along each side of the white paper. Cut the one inch off of each side of the white sheet. Then, draw or attach the pictures you want to use as your desktop.


Try using a real desktop screen of a laptop as a guide for your screen. Draw a colorful background, desktop icons, and the menu bar across the bottom.If you can't draw, find a photograph to use as a desktop background and cut out pictures that look like desktop icons.

, Take the other white sheet of paper and hold it up to the other colored or patterned sheet of paper. Measure and mark a half an inch on each edge of the white piece and cut away the excess. Then, draw the outline of a laptop keyboard across the its surface. Make sure you draw the keys in proportion to the size of your paper. If you can't do it by hand, try gently laying the paper over a real keyboard and pressing the paper against the keys to make indentations of the keys on the paper. Then you can trace over the indents left behind.


You can buy letter stickers and put them inside the key shapes you made. This will make all the letters look the same and look more like a real keyboard.If you want a more polished look, you can also print out a picture of the keys of a keyboard instead of drawing it. Just make sure it is the same size as the rest of the laptop so it will match., Since your laptop doesn't have its own support structure to keep it vertical, you need to make your laptop a stand. Using the piece of cardboard, fold the cardboard into three equal strips. Unfold it again and bring the edges of the cardboard together, making a triangle shape. Tape along the edge to make the triangle sturdy.

, Now that you have the piece of paper or cardstock with the your chosen logo on it and your desktop screen, you need to make them one piece. Take the desktop picture you created and apply glue around the back edges and across the middle. Center it, glue side down, on the back side of your laptop cover. Press the desktop picture down, gently smoothing out any bubbles with your hands., You now need to take your second piece of colored or patterned paper and attach your drawn or printed keyboard to it. Turn over the keyboard and apply glue around the edges and across the middle. Center it in the piece of colored paper, then gently lay it down and smooth out any bubbles. In the top corned on either side, draw a power button on the surface.If you don't want to draw the power button, you can print out a picture of the power button and glue it to the paper just like you did the keyboard.
If you want your laptop to be a little more sturdy, you might try adding cardboard to your laptop. Glue a piece of cardboard to your top and bottom. Then, glue an additional piece of paper in the color or pattern you chose over the other side of the cardboard so it doesn't show through. Then glue the desktop and keyboard down., Now that you have a screen and a keyboard, you need to attach the two to make your laptop complete. Take the two pieces and align the long sides. Make sure the screen and keyboard sides are facing up. Place a piece of clear tape along the edge where the two pieces meet. Flip the two pages over and place another piece along the same edge on the other side., Turn the papers back over and fold them along the edge with the tape. Turn it so the side without tape is facing you. Take the stand you made earlier and place it directly behind the taped edge of the laptop. Open up the laptop as you would a real laptop, resting the top screen against the stand to make the stand stay up. Your laptop is complete.


If you find that the taped edge is too flimsy, try adding another piece of tape to both sides to strengthen the hold.

You can use any color paper that want, but remember that Yoda is green. If you would like a green Yoda, use green origami paper.;
, Measure 4.25 inches (10.8 cm) up from the bottom of the paper. Mark the spot with a pencil. Then fold and crease the paper where you have the pencil mark. Fold the bottom part of the paper up.

, About an inch from the top of the bottom part that you just folded up, make another pencil mark. Then, fold the top of the paper back along that line. You should have two folds about an inch apart with one fold coming from the top and one fold coming from the bottom.

, You will now be looking at the unfolded side of the paper. Make a small mark at the top of this side right in the middle. Now make another fold along that line to create a zig-zag pattern in the paper. Then, flip the paper back over to the original side.

, This double pleat will become Yoda's eyes. To make it, draw a small line about .25 inches (0.6 cm) down from the top of the fold. Make another small mark at the bottom of the first fold you made. Make another fold along that line to create a pleat in the paper. Then, flip the paper over again and do it once more.


A pleat is made by making two folds close together.

, You’ll want to repeat steps three and four, but at the bottom instead of the top of the paper. You don’t have to do the step to make the eyes again Begin the pleat about 1 inch (2.5 cm) up from the bottom "

, The next step is to fold the ears out. Find the corners that you tucked inside those pleats you made earlier. Unfold them so that they're sticking out.

, Now you need to fold down the head. Fold down the top of the paper so that the double crease you made earlier is on top of the creases you made after your third and fourth pencil marks.

It's best to use origami paper that is green on one side and brown on the other. You can get this at any craft store. However, you can continue the process using any colored paper - the Yoda just might not be colored correctly. It will still have the right shape.

, You want to fold them so that their edges line up with the edge of the green line. Make a crease, then unfold them. , Using the creases you made in previously as guidelines, tuck the corners in between the two sides of the paper. This will create two flaps, which will later become the ears.

, Then, fold the bottom up one inch so that there is an inch of brown showing at the bottom of the green. , You're undoing the step where you folded the bottom up one inch. Fold it back down. The goal is to make a new crease that is different from that fold. Do not use the same crease you created the first time you folded the bottom up one inch. Create a new crease as close to the first crease as possible. This will create a zigzag shape.

, Fold the paper up so that the bottom edge almost touches the top edge. Crease well.

, Fold the paper down just above the crease left over from step 5 when you made the zigzag crease.

, Fold the left corner down and into the middle. Repeat with the right side. , Find the triangle flaps of paper in the center. Fold them so that they stick out. Turn the paper back over and then you’re done! Feel free to draw on a face or round out his head if you wish.

Fold your triangle into thirds.,
Cut your paper into a new triangle.,
Begin cutting your snowflake.,
Carefully unfold the paper.",How to Fold a Snowflake2," A good size to start with is an 8.5”x11” piece of paper. Cut the paper in half—making the cut across the width rather than the length. Now from these two pieces, you want to cut squares. This will give you snowflakes that are 5” across.


To make a perfect square, simply fold one corner across the paper so that one of the sides lines up perfectly into an isosceles triangle. Trim the excess paper., Take your square and fold the bottom right corner to the top left corner to make a large triangle. Fold this larger triangle in half to create a smaller triangle., Place the point toward you. Take the top right corner and fold it straight across in the triangle. Instead of folding in half this time, fold it in thirds. Once you fold the right corner over, fold the left corner over as well. Your ending product should look like an upside-down cone with a small triangle missing from the top.


If you have a protractor and want to be precise, each third will be a 30 degree angle.

, With your paper folded in thirds, cut the top of the paper off at an angle. Do so in a way that all the layers on the top are now even. You’ll once again have a smaller triangle than you had before., Cut away shapes from the sides of the paper. Small triangles are easiest to start with, but adding more complex shapes to different parts of your triangle will make for a more interesting snowflake. Feel free to cut the shapes out of the bottom of your cone shape to alter the edge of your snowflake. Cutting the tip off will add a shape in the middle., Your snowflake is finished! If you want to make any adjustments after you unfold it, you can. If it’s not sitting flat, put in in between the pages of a book or a stack of magazines. Tape them to your windows or hang them around the house to showcase your beautiful 6-point snowflake.

Take into account your printing needs.,
Get to know the paper weight.Choose the right paper weight, or thickness.,
The brightness rating.,
Adopt an eco friendly method.,
Know your requirement.",How to Choose Paper," Consider the purpose of your usage and the kind of printer you own. Do you mostly print personal e-mails or use it prepare materials for official usage on an in jet or laser printer. Do you print heavy-coverage documents, like signs and flyers? Do you do double-sided printing? All these factors are involved when in comes to choosing the right paper according to your needs.;
, At 20 pounds, standard paper is an economical choice that’s perfect for everyday printing and copying.. Mid-weight such as ,22 to 24 pounds provides crisper images and less show-through hence, making it ideal for customer-facing documents and double-sided printing. And the heavy-stock ones are perfect for sturdy signs and flyers. They are also ideal for vivid colours and flawless finish.

, The brighter the paper, the crisper your letters and images appear. Especially the colour and monochrome ones. Ratings of 98 or 100 provide the biggest factor.

, Be environment friendly and choose recycled paper. Don't worry about the quality it is just as high as the non-recycled ones. Look for FSC logos as they are the eco-friendliest of all. The Forest Stewardship Council certifies that the pulp used to make the paper came from responsibly managed forests.

, i.e, order the correct amount by knowing the terminology. A “ream” has 500 sheets, and there are 10 reams in a case. And consider buying by the case as You’ll save money, and you’ll never have to worry about running out.

Remove excess water from the paper.,
Remove the paper from the screen.,
Peel the paper off the screen slowly.,
Set the paper out to dry.,
Repeat the above steps to make additional sheets.",How to Make Paper," To make paper, you will mix pulp and water, then pour it onto a piece of window screen. Here are some different options for starting:



Frame method: Stretch a screen over a wooden frame (an old picture frame works well, or you can build your own) and staple it or nail it to the edges. Nearly any fine screen or sieve with holes about 1 mm small can be substituted for the window screen. The screen should be pulled as tightly as possible. Make sure the frame is large enough to hold the size of paper you wish to make. Additionally, you'll need a basin, bucket or pan that's larger than the frame.

Pan method: Purchase a deep, disposable aluminum pan from the grocery store, or find a deep casserole dish. Cut out a portion of screen that's the same shape as the bottom of the pan, but slightly larger.;
, Newspaper may be the easiest source to start with, but you can also use old print-outs, notes, phone books - just about any un-waxed paper product.Keep in mind that the color of the papers you use and the amount of dark ink on them will affect the ""grayness"" of your creation. Avoid using any glossy or shiny paper - it won't work as well.


Paper can also be made entirely of grass and leaves as well, in fact, that's how most paper was made until the 20th century! You must cut the vegetation in small pieces, soak it in caustic soda to ""digest"", strain it, and blend it to a pulp. Then pour it on the press. After it dries, you can proudly say, ""This paper contains no trees!""

, Remove plastic, staples and other contaminants. Especially if you're using junk mail, your paper scraps are likely to contain plastic from envelope windows. Try to remove such impurities as thoroughly as possible.

, Don't spend to much time on this step, but do break up the paper into smaller pieces. A few rips per paper should be enough.








, Put the smaller pieces of paper in a container (such as a bowl or cup) and cover them with water. Let them soak for 30 to 45 minutes.









If you want to make colored construction paper,use paper with the least amount of dark ink, use a lot of ""pulp"" and use liquid food coloring. The resulting paper will most likely be opaque on one side and bright on the other. Depending on your intended use, either side may be suitable, but the bright side will probably be better for writing.
If you want to have whiter paper, half a cup of white vinegar can be added to the pulp mixture.

, Now that the recyclable paper is more wet and pliable, you can start the process of turning it into pulp - a thick, gooey, slightly watery substance that will eventually become your new piece of paper. Here are two possibilities:










Blend the paper. Rip the paper into tiny bits, and place it all into a blender until it's about half full. Fill the blender with warm water. Run the blender on ""slow"" at first, then increase the speed until the pulp looks smooth and well-blended - approximately 30 to 40 seconds - just until there are no flakes of paper remaining.

Mash the paper. If you have a mortar and pestle (or something similar, like the end of a rolling pin and a sturdy bowl) available, you can mash up the paper by hand. Work a handful at a time, and aim to get the pulp so that it's similar to the consistency of watery oatmeal.

, The basin should be a little wider and longer than your frame and approximately the same shape.









If you're using the frame method, fill the basin and add the pulp before you dip the frame.
If you're using the pan method, put the screen in the bottom of the pan before you add the water and mix in the pulp.


, The amount of pulp you add to the water will determine the thickness of the paper, and while you want a dense suspension of pulp to fully cover your screen in the next steps, you don't need to make the whole tub into sludge. Experiment a bit. The thickness of can be changed from paper to cardboard depending on the amount of water added to the pulp.








, Try to pick out any clumps; the smoother and finer your mixture, the more uniform your end product will be.








, If the paper is going to be used for stationery, stir 2 teaspoons of liquid starch into the pulp mix. The starch helps prevent ink from soaking into the paper fibers.









If you don't add starch, the paper will be highly absorbent, and your ink will likely bleed quite easily. If this occurs, briefly soak the dried paper in a mix of water and gelatin and re-dry.


, Place your wooden frame into the pulp, screen-side down, then level it while it is submerged. Lightly move it side-to-side until the pulp on top of the screen lies fairly uniformly flat.








, Slowly lift up the screen until it is above the water. Drip-drain it over the basin. Wait until most of the water has drained from the pulp, and you'll see the beginnings of a new piece of paper. If the paper is very thick, remove some of the pulp from the top. If it is too thin, add some more pulp and stir the mixture again.








, After you've lifted the screen out of the basin, you'll need to remove the extra water from the pulp. Depending on the method you chose in Step 1, here's how to do it:










Frame method: After the water stops dripping (or nearly so), gently place a piece of fabric (felt or flannel, preferably) or a piece of Formica, (smooth-side down) in the frame on top of the ""paper"". Very gently press down to squeeze out excess water. Use a sponge to press out as much water as possible from the other side of the screen, and periodically wring out the sponge.

Pan method: Lay a cloth towel out on a flat surface, and put the screen (with the paper on it) on one half of the towel. Fold the other half over so that it's on top of the paper. With a clothes iron on low setting, gently iron over the towel. You should see a little steam from the paper coming up.

, Once the paper is a little more dry, you can lift it from the screen. You can gently press out any bubbles and loose edges at this point.









Gently lift the fabric or Formica out of the frame. The wet sheet of paper should remain on the fabric. If it sticks to the screen, you may have pulled too fast or not pressed out enough water.
You can press a drying sheet of paper by placing another piece of fabric or Formica on top of it and gently pressing. This will make the resulting paper smoother and thinner. Leave the second piece there as it dries.

, If you find that it's not coming off easily, try ironing it underneath the towel again.

, Take the piece of paper and lay it out to dry on a flat surface. Alternatively, you can speed up the drying process by using a hair dryer on the low setting.









Peel the paper off the fabric or Formica (frame method only). Wait until the sheets of paper are thoroughly dried; then gently peel.

Ironing (optional): When the paper is damp, but safe to move peel the fabric/Formica from the paper and then use an iron set on high to dry the paper quickly and give it a nice shine.

, Continue adding pulp and water to the basin as needed.

",How to Age Paper Using Tea," You can use anything from fine papers to scrap booking papers to plain white copier paper. If the paper is extra thick, it may take longer to stain.

, The process will render the paper rugged and uneven, and the ink will not distribute well on the page.

, It will add to the appearance because the creases will mimic handmade parchment or vellum. Do not do this step if you want your paper to lie very flat for your project.

, Place the tray on a very flat surface, or the tea will puddle in a lower corner.

, Preheat your oven to the lowest setting, approximately 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93.3 degrees Celsius).

, Pour it into a bowl.

, The more tea bags you brew, the darker your stain will be. Wait between 5 and 20 minutes to remove the tea bags and begin tea staining.


The hotter the tea is, the more orange it will appear. Many older parchments have a slightly burnt orange hue. An orange spiced black tea may also create a warmer hue.

, Apply it unevenly to the paper in order to make an older look.
Apply the tea with 1 of the tea bags. Make sure the tea bag is not too hot before using. Brush it over paper, while allowing some places to be wetter than others. This will give a look of uneven aging. If the tea bag starts to come apart, throw it away and use another.
Pour the tea directly onto the paper. Pour slowly and stop when it starts to pool. Make sure you don't pour too much. Tilt the cookie sheet so that all areas of the paper are in contact with the tea. This is the best method if you want to do a few sheets at a time, because you can set pieces of paper on top of each other and it will soak through.

, If it has not, apply it again with your method of choice.

, Blot up any areas where the tea has pooled. If there is too much liquid in 1 area, it may create a hole when you attempt to use the paper.

, This will make the sharp edges look worn. You can rub other areas of the paper if you want to create holes.

, Bake the sheet for 5 to 6 minutes. Take it out just as the paper starts to curl very slightly.

, Loosen the edges from the cookie sheet with a fork or spatula while it is still warm. Lay it on another flat surface to cool.


You can also allow the tea soaked sheet to air dry. It will take about 45 minutes for a piece of copier paper to dry. Make sure you weigh the edges down with pebbles or utensils, or the paper will curl.

,, The rule is one tea bag per paper.;
, Which means, don't overfill it to the top or give it so little the teabags can't float.

,,, The teabag has to be cool enough for you to touch it without a problem.

Iron the paper dry.",How to Dye Paper1," Pull on a pair of rubber, vinyl, plastic, or latex gloves. Cover your work surface with a cheap, plastic tablecloth or some newspapers. This will keep the dye from staining your hands and your work surface.


If the dye spills, wipe it up immediately with rubbing alcohol.
It might be a good idea to wear an apron or old clothes that you don't mind possibly staining.;
, The more water you use, the lighter your dye will be. It might be a better idea to start off with ½ cup (120 milliliters) first, do a test swatch, then add more water as needed.

, Stir the solution with a spoon or skewer.If you are using liquid dye, shake the bottle first.
Don't add salt or vinegar., The tray needs to be big enough to fit your paper. You can also use a baking dish or a rimmed baking sheet., Choose thick paper, such as watercolor paper or hardcover book pages. Set the paper into the tray, then press down on it with your hands so that it sinks into the dye.If you are working with expensive paper, consider doing a test swatch using a scrap instead.

, Allow the excess dye to drip off of the paper. Don't worry if the paper looks dark. It will lighten slightly as it dries.

, Sandwich the dyed paper between two stacks of paper towels. Gently press down on the paper towels to absorb the excess dye., Cover your ironing board with a thin cloth. Place the dyed paper on top of the cloth. Cover the paper with another cloth. Turn your iron to the lowest setting. Pass the iron over the paper.This will help keep the paper nice and flat as well.

",How to Dye Paper2," Brew coffee in a coffee maker or tea in a large mug. You can also brew loose-leaf tea or tea bags for 10 minutes. If you are using loose-leaf tea, be sure to strain it through a fine, mesh sieve lined with muslin cloth.Black tea is the most common, but you can experiment with different types of tea as well, such as hibiscus.
The coffee can be hot or cold.

, The tray needs to be big enough to fit your paper. You can also use a baking dish or a rimmed baking sheet instead.

, Press it down under the liquid with your hands. Tap it gently to get rid of air bubbles., The longer you let the paper soak, the darker the color will be.

, Hold it over the tray so that the excess liquid can drip back. Do not wring the paper. You can crumple it later to create an aged effect.

, Set the paper down on a stack of paper towels. Place another paper towel on top of it, and pat it gently to soak up any excess liquid. Keep patting the paper with clean paper towels until most of the liquid had been absorbed and the paper is damp.

, You can dry the paper with a heat gun, a hair dryer, or an oven. The heat gun/hair dryer will give you a smoother finish. Begin by setting the paper down onto a baking sheet, then do one of the following:Blow dry the paper with a heat gun or hair dryer. Alternate between blotting the paper with a paper towel and flipping it over. Wipe the baking sheet down if it gets wet.
Dry the paper in the oven at 200°F (94°C) for 5 to 10 minutes.
Create an aged effect by crumpling the paper halfway through the drying process. Flatten the paper out, then dry it the rest of the way.

So that your fireworks look bright and festive, and to get this effect you'll want your origami paper to be brightly colored on one side and white on the other. You'll need 12 square sheets of paper. For the best arrangement of colors, you might use two sheets each of the following:


Red paper
Orange paper
Yellow paper
Green paper
Blue paper
Purple paper
Folding bone (for sharp creases; optional);
, A folding bone is a tool that is used in paper crafts to help make sharp, crisp creases while preventing strain to your fingers.To use a folding bone, press it firmly along the lines of your folds. Some homemade folding bones can be fashioned from:


A metal spoon
An old credit card
A flat paperweight

, Arrange six of your sheets into a stack, taking care to line the papers up evenly. Lay the papers so that the white sides are face up, and then turn the stack so that the squares of paper form a diamond shape in front of you.Then:


Fold your papers vertically so that a crease runs from the top to the bottom corner, then unfold and smooth.
Fold your papers horizontally so that a crease runs from the left to the right corner, then unfold and smooth., A blintz fold draws the four corners of your paper to its center, folding the outer edges to create a smaller square.To form your blintz fold:


Take a corner and fold its tip to the center of your paper where your first two creases cross.
Repeat this until all four corners of your paper have been folded so the corners meet in the center.
Unfold your blintz fold and smooth your papers.

, First, reorient your paper so that it lies before you on the table as a square and not a diamond. Then, take the top of your paper and fold it even with the bottom of your paper and crease the fold, then unfold., The top and bottom edges of your paper should be in line with your previous, horizontal fold that halved your square paper. The top and bottom edges of your paper should meet along the middle.Crease your folds, then unfold the paper.


Rotate your paper so that the horizontal folds you just made are vertical.

, Take the top of your paper and fold it a small distance until the top edge is even with the first diagonal intersection where your X crease crosses the outside of your diamond shaped crease.Fold the bottom of your paper similarly, until its edge is also even with the first diagonal intersection where the X crease crosses the diamond shaped crease.
Turn over your paper so the colored side is face up.

, The creases running from corner to corner and forming an X shape on your paper should be folded once again so that these are crisp, strong folds. Then turn your paper over.At this point, you should rotate your paper to return it to the orientation where three horizontal folds run between the left and right sides of your paper.

, This shape is known among paper crafters as a waterbomb base.The current orientation of your paper should be so that your X crease divides your paper into four quadrants, you have three horizontal folds from running from left to right sides, a diamond shaped crease, and two outside vertical creases from top to bottom.Take your left and right quadrants and:


Tuck the paper inward, toward the center. The folds that you have previously made should allow the paper to collapse into the shape of a triangle.
Crease your waterbomb base sharply., A squash fold is where you fold your paper up into the air and then smush it down to form a crease that often reveals some of the opposite side of the paper's color (in this case, white).Along the inside of your triangular waterbomb base, there should be creases in the shape of an upside down triangle. From the downward facing point of that inner triangle:


Pull the bottom edge of your waterbomb base up so that the downward facing point of your inner triangle is touching the upward point of your waterbomb base.
As you pull the bottom of your paper toward the top, you may need to pull the corners of your triangle inward.Turn over your paper and repeat the process.
At this stage, your paper should be a solid triangle shape on top, with two ""legs"" at the bottom of the triangle that are unconnected.

, The creases you form here will turn into locks that hold your papers together into a single design. Use a squash fold by lifting the bottom of one leg of your paper so that it's bottom folds in line with the bottom edge of the base of the triangle at the top of your paper. Repeat this process with the other leg of the same side of your paper, then turn your paper over and then perform this fold again.
The squash fold you use to crease your locks will create small triangles that have points facing out to the left and right.

, After you have creased the folds of your locks, you'll need to unfold these so that your paper returns to its previous shape: two rectangular legs and a triangular top. Repeat the unfolding process on both sides., When you fold your second set of six sheets, be sure you start with the color side up instead of the white side up. When you complete this phase of your origami firework, you should have six folded papers with color facing outward and six with the white side facing outward.

, If you have been folding your sheets individually, you won't need to separate your papers, but if you have been folding six at a time, you'll need to separate these to move forward. Stack your finished, folded papers into like piles, one with the colored side out and the other with the white side out.Be sure your colors correspond between piles. If the first color of your colored pile is red, the first color of your white pile should also be red (on the inside)., You should fold the top triangular part of your paper along its base so that the triangles face outward to form wings. These will be inserted into your colored papers., To find the pocket on your colored paper, slightly open the outer flaps of paper on the ""legs."" This is the pocket into which you will insert the white flap of your other paper.You will also need to:


Using your right hand, hold together the outer flaps on the legs of one side of your white paper.
Then fold down the top triangle part so that it forms a flap that you can insert into the pocket of the colored paper., Once you have successfully inserted your white flap into the colored pocket, open the ""legs"" that you've been holding together with your right hand on the other side to expose the other flap. Now you can fit the second flap into your next piece of colored paper.Lock your white and colored papers together until all 12 pieces are connected.
The bottoms of your linked pieces of paper should be even.

, Now you can fold the right two flaps of your outermost white paper to reveal the next paper in the series, which should be colored. Then fold the top of your paper down so that the flat top edge is even with the base of the now inverted triangular shape.This should form the same left and right outward pointing triangles that you folded when you creased your lock folds.
Fold all of your lock creases for each paper, starting from one end and skipping the end white paper., You should spread out your now connected and locked together papers to make connecting the ends easier. Put the end white papers final flap into the pocket of the colored paper at the other end of your paper chain.Close the two outer locks by rotating the paper so that the inside is facing outward.
Once you have locked all the individual parts of your firework together and have rotated the inside out, your firework should be complete.

",How to Make Paper Magnolias," You will need one yellow strip and one white strip. The strips should be about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide.You can also use tissue paper instead.;
, Have the fringe stop about ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters) from the opposite long edge. Try to make the fringe as fine and narrow as you can., You can bend it over the edge of a table, skewer, pen, dowel, straw, etc. Leave the white fringe straight., Roll one of the narrow ends of the yellow fringe a few times into a tight tube first, with the curved edge sticking inward. Hot glue it to the top of a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) Styrofoam ball., Move the fringe downward as you wrap it so that it forms an overlapping spiral. Stop when you are about 1/2 to 2/3 of the way down the ball. Cut the rest of the fringe off.Hot glue a little bit at a time so that the glue doesn't set too fast.

, Start wrapping and gluing the white fringe where you ended the yellow one. Wrap the fringe in a downward, overlapping spiral. Stop at the bottom of the ball, then cut off the excess., Make sure that the white side is facing down, and the yellow side is facing up. Press it just far enough down so that it is secure, but not so far that the wire sticks out.


If you can't find a wire stem, you can paint a wooden skewer green, and use that instead.
Don't use a pipe cleaner; it's too fuzzy.
Don't use the wire that comes on a spool. It's too thin and flimsy.

, Make the petals about 7 inches (17.78 centimeters) tall and 2½ inches (6.35 centimeters) wide.Make sure that the grain goes with the length of the petal, not against it, otherwise, your petal won't stretch right. Your petals should look like they have vertical stripes running through them.If you can't find crepe paper, use regular paper or tissue paper instead.You can make the petals all the same size, or make them three different sizes. Make sure that each set has three petals., Gently stretch the middle part of the white petals. You want a bowl or cup shape. Leave the top and bottom ends of the petals intact.If you are using regular paper or tissue paper, you won't be able to stretch it. Instead, curl the top of the petal inward with a pen or brush handle., Arrange three petals, cupped side facing in, around the wire stem, just below the fringed ball. Wrap florist's tape around the tabbed, bottom part of the petals to secure them to the wire.If you are using different-sized petals, start with the smallest set first., Off-set each layer of petals, so that the second row of petals is between the gaps on the first row. The third row should be even with the first row. When you look down at the flower, there are no gaps showing.Each layer should have three petals.
If you are using different sizes for the petals, save the largest ones for the last row.

, As with the flowers, the grain needs to go down the length of your leaves. You want the leaves to look like they have vertical stripes.If you can't find green crepe paper, you can use regular paper or tissue paper instead.

, Gently stretch the leaves at the center, just as you did with the petals. Stretch them just far enough to get a pod shape, with the top and bottom ends pinched.If you used regular or tissue paper, you don't be able to stretch them. Instead, curl both of the side edges inward with a pen or brush handle. Next, fold them in half lengthwise to make a crease.

, Place two leaves against the stem, just below the petals. Wrap some florist's tape around the bottom point of each leaf to secure it to the stem. Don't tear off the tape yet.


The leaves can be right next to each other, or straight across from each other.

, Overlap the tape with each turn so that the wire does not show. Stop when you are about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) down. Tear off the tape.

, Hold the bottom of the leaf against the stem. Secure it to the stem with florist's tape. Don't tear off the tape just yet.

, Wrap the florist's tape around the stem until you reach the bottom. Overlap the tape with each wrap as you go so that no wire is showing.

, Crease the fold, then unfold the paper.

, There should be eight total triangles, and 2 triangles in each fourth of the paper. Anyway, there should be a fold starting from the left side of the paper all the way to the right side of the paper. Not a vertical line, not a diagonal line, but a horizontal line. It doesn't matter which way you place the paper. There should be a line from exactly left to right on the paper. If you didn't crease hard enough, you may have trouble identifying this line. But if you creased correctly, this line should be easy to spot.

, Next, bring both parts of the horizontal line together, forming a 3D figure.

, Push one of the triangles down on a flat surface, then bring the top triangle down on the bottom triangle. Keep on pushing until both triangles come together into one triangle. You should not be able to push the top triangle further down into the bottom triangle.

, Well, you are going to make more flaps! Before you make more flaps, you should see a crease in the center of the triangle, giving a right part and a left part to the triangle. Get hold of the right part of the flap, then fold up that flap to meet the crease in the center. After that, get hold of the left part of the flap, then fold that flap to meet the crease in the center.

Finished!",How to Make an Origami Airplane3," You want to use lightweight paper as you be surfing your glider on a wave of air rather than throwing it like an airplane. 







, In addition to a piece of paper, you will need the following:









Pair of scissors.
Three metal twist ties
Scotch tape
Ruler
Pen

, Here is an example.









Using scissors, cut one of the two large triangles along the outer black lines. Save the second triangle to give to a friend so they can make their own origami hang glider.
Cut a small notch along the thick black lines at the base (longest side) of both triangles.

, Make sure the template is flat against your paper and there are no wrinkles or folds. Use four pieces of tape to secure the template, one at each point and one in the center of the base of the triangle.









Once the template is secured, cut around the outer edges of the triangle making sure it remains connected to the underlying paper.

, The dotted lines indicate where you will fold the paper. They are separated into two categories and labeled on the pattern:









There are three valley folds. One line runs parallel to the base, and the other two are located at each end of the first line.
There are three mountain folds. One bisects the top edge of the triangle, and the other two run parallel to the sides of the triangle.
Have the template facing you at all times so you can orient yourself according to these folds.

,, Fold the base inwards over the ruler. Gently unfold the paper so the fold remains loose.








, Start with one side and then do the other. Keep these folds loose for now.









Once these have been folded outwards, pinch the mountain fold at the top of the triangle.
Pinch along all three mountain lines, stopping at the end of the lines or where they intersect with a valley fold.
Make sure the folds are crisp and symmetrical.

, This forms the vertical stabilizers at the back corners of you glider.








, The ends of the wings can bend up or down. Both wings must be up to fly, otherwise the glider will nosedive when thrown.








, At this point, your glider is back heavy, which will cause it to roll back-over-front when thrown.








,









Cut out the square labeled 'Front Weight Stabilizer'. Use this to cut-out a square from the same piece of lightweight paper you used to build the glider.
Cut away the plastic covering on the metal twist tie until it is just a thin, metal wire. You can do this by cutting along the wire and scrape-off any remaining covering with your fingernails.
Place a small piece of tape (no more than 1/2 inch) on one end of the wire. Tape the wire to one of the corners of your paper square.
Place the paper square on a thick book so the corner with the wire is at the edge of the book. The wire should extend out from the edge of the book and have no support.
If the wire tips down, then it is too heavy. Use scissors to cut-off small pieces of the wire until it only slightly tips.
If the wire is perfectly balanced, it might be too light. You can make it heavier by adding tiny pieces of tape to the end not attached to the paper.

, You will need to attach the wire to the nose of the glider.









Turn the glider over so the side with the template is facing down.
Attach a small, square (ca. 1/2 inch) piece of tape to one end of the wire.
Tape the wire so it exactly follows the fold that forms the nose of the glider. Attach it so the corners of the tape match-up exactly to the front edge.
Turn the glider over and refold the front so the crease supports the wire. It is okay if there is a slight bend to either side of the fold. This gives the glider strength.

, The curvature of the wings is known as camber, and influences lift in planes or gliders by forming the airfoil. Folds that are too tight create too much camber, and this destabilizes the plane.









Place the plane in the cover of heavy book.
Push the vertical stabilizers down so they are not damaged.
Close the cover and press down for 5 to 10 seconds.
This will improve the camber by creating a more gentle curvature.

, Place the plane on a flat surface and measure the angle between the surface and the back flap.









If this angle is less than 20 degrees, increase the angle by bending it slightly forwards. #*Check that the angle on both ends is equal.
Refold the vertical stabilizers so they form a 90 degree angle with the body of the glider.
Separate the template from the paper if you haven't already. Bend the end of the wire up until it forms a small hook. Be careful not to tear the paper or disturb any of the folds.
Use the wire hook to pick-up and carry your glider.
Do not pick-up your glider from the back. This can damage the vertical stabilizers or the back flap of the glider, known as the elevon which is important for roll and pitch. Use scissors to cut along the curved line in the back, and cut-off the pointed tips of the stabilizers along the solid black line.

, Hold the glider in the center with you thumb and index finger. With the nose of the glider pointing slightly down, gently drop it.









Walk behind your glider and gently wave a piece of cardboard that is at least 1.5 by 1.5 feet underneath it. This will help keep your glider in motion.

, Enjoy your glider.

Fold your paper over in half vertically.,
Fold the left and right corners inward to meet the crease.,
Flip the paper over.,
Fold the left corner over to meet the right.,
Hold the banger at the bottom corner.,
Bring the banger down fast to make a noise.",How to Make an Origami Banger," These instructions were made for a standard piece of A4 printer paper, 8.5 x 11 inches (216 x 280 mm) in size. You may use larger paper instead (such as A3) for a louder sound. , If your paper is the same color on both sides, you can make a small mark on one side to keep track. This shouldn't be necessary for this project, but it's a useful technique to know about when making origami out of regular paper. , Once you're done, unfold it so that the paper is laying flat again.


At this stage, the orientation of your paper doesn't matter, but you want to make sure that you are making a valley fold. When you unfold the paper the crease should look like the bottom of a valley

, Once again, after you have made a crease, unfold it.


You should now have two creases in your paper when it lays flat, creating a cross in the center.

, Rotate your paper if necessary so the short side faces you. Now fold the top corners into the vertical centerline. Your folds won't reach the horizontal crease. Think of it like you’re folding a paper airplane.

, Just as before, fold the corners on the other end of your paper into the centerline. You should now have two folded over triangles with a space of flat paper in the middle.

, Your origami banger should now be lying flat on the table with two folded triangles on either side of your paper and a lane of flat paper running vertically down the middle.

, Now you want to fold your paper up along the horizontal centerline.


If done correctly, you should now have a trapezoid shape with a long, flat bottom, and a smaller flat top to it.

, Position the trapezoid so the short side is facing you. Fold the top left corner inward to meet the vertical center crease. Fold the top right corner inward to meet the crease as well.These corners should stick out past the short side of the trapezoid, meeting to form a diamond.

, Pick up the paper and turn it over on the table, from left to right. There should be two flaps of paper on top that do not quite meet the bottom corner of the diamond.

, Fold the left corner over to the right, creasing along the same centerfold. You now have an origami banger, which looks like a triangle.

, Hold the bottom corner between your thumb and finger, with the longest side of the triangle facing you. Make sure you are only holding the two outer layers of paper, not the flap inside.

, Hold the banger above your head. Swing your arm down as fast as you can, snapping forward with your wrist at the same time. The inner flap of the banger should pop out into a ""balloon"" in front of the banger, making a noise. It may take a few tries to get this to work. If you're having trouble getting this to work, try tugging the innermost flap out a tiny bit.
To re-use the banger, just gently push the paper back in. You might need to experiment with the positioning of the flap.

,
Push the left and right sides together to form a diamond.,

Fold in half at the center.",How to Make an Origami Book1," Counting the front and back of each sheet, this method will make a sixteen-page origami book. Start by taking the 8.5”x11” piece of paper and folding it in half “hamburger style.”This means folding along the 11” side, leading you with a 5.5”x8.5” paper.;
, Take the folded piece of paper and fold it in half one more time in the same direction.This will leave you with a very narrow paper approximately 2.75”x8.5” in size.

, Now that you have marked those two creases, you want to unfold the paper entirely. The unfolded page will be 8.5”x11” again, and it will have creases separating the paper into four rows., With the page still fully unfolded, you want to turn the direction 90 degrees and fold the paper in half again but “hot dog style” this time.The folded sheet will be 4.25”x11”.

, Just like you made the second fold in the same direction with the “hamburger style” fold, you want to do it again with the “hot dog style” fold.When you fold the paper in half again, it will be roughly 2.125”x11”.

, Now that you’ve made these two fold, unfold the paper completely until it’s 8.5”x11” again.This time the creases will form sixteen evenly sized little rectangular boxes across the page.

, With all of the creases made, you’re ready to start forming the paper into a book. Start by folding the paper along the very first “hamburger style” fold so that it is 5.5”x8.5”., Turn the spine of the folded paper toward you and use a pair of scissors to cut the creases that run perpendicular to the spine of the fold.There should be three such creases and you want to cut each halfway down the paper.


The halfway point down the paper will be easy to see since it’s where the next crease that runs parallel to the spine intersects along the creases you’re cutting., With the three cuts along the creases done, open the page again. It will now be the 8.5”x11” page but with two slats in the middle of the page.

, With the page open, turn it so that the slats in the page look like an equal sign, and then make a perpendicular cut along the pre-existing crease in the equal sign.This will form four separate flaps in the middle of the page.

, Once you have made the flaps, fold the flaps outward toward the edge of the page.There will be pre-existing creases at the edge of the flaps from the earlier folds, and since all of the rectangles earlier were of an equal size, when you fold the flaps over, they should be roughly flush with the edge of the page.


When you fold the flaps back, there will be a gap in the middle of the page that makes it look a bit like a window., With the flaps still folded over, you want to turn the entire page over.This will put the flaps side of the page facedown on your work table.

, Take the top row of the paper and the bottom row of the paper and fold both of them in toward the center of the page.After you make the folds, the page will be the same size as though you had folded it “hot dog style,” which is 4.25”x11”.

,, Lift up the paper off the table and push the two ends of the paper toward each other without folding it.When looking at it from the top, this will make the middle section bow out along the pre-existing creases into a diamond shape.

, As you continue to push the ends toward each other, the diamond shape will get smaller and the ends you’re holding and the bowed out ends will form an X shape., The pages will be sort of fanned out as though you had opened a book the entire way until the covers touch. To finish the book, you simply need to fold from the center as though you were closing the book."

Inflate the waterbomb.,
Fill your waterbomb with water.",How to Make a Waterbomb," The obvious choice is to use origami paper. If you don’t have any, just cut a square from regular printer paper and color it with a crayon of any color. For added water resistance, you could use wax paper.








Coloring printer paper with crayon will leave a waxy layer that helps the paper better withstand water. Just be sure to color the side that will become the inside of the water balloon, as that is the side that will be in contact with the water.;
, Fold the top left corner to meet the bottom right corner. Crease along the line and open the paper back up. Now, fold the top right corner to the bottom left corner and crease again. When you open the paper up again, you will see that you have a creased “X” inside your square paper.







, First, turn the paper over so that the middle of the paper is sticking up (this happens because of the “X” that you creased). Fold the paper in half from top to bottom. Crease along the centerline. Rotate the paper 90° and repeat.







, Fold the paper along the creases you have made. This will give you an origami triangle base. This is the starting point for creating a waterbomb.







, Take the corner flaps on the top side of the triangle and fold them up to the center. Flip the triangle over and do the same with the back side. You should now have a folded square.







, This will put your square in a diagonal position with the top and bottom corners as points on the centerline. This orientation makes it easy to distinguish the respective corners of your square. This will allow you to fold the square to make pockets., Fold the side corners toward the center. The tip of each corner should touch the center line. Flip the square and repeat this process on the opposite side. You should now have pockets along the edges of these folds.







, You will start by folding down the top flap to make a small triangle. Then, insert the point of the triangle into the flap. Fold down and crease along the edge of the flap. Repeat this with the other flap on this side of the paper.








Only one side of the pocket is open. Make sure that you are folding the correct flap so that it will go into the open side of the pocket.

, Flip your paper over. Fold the top flaps down into triangles, and then fold the points into the opening of your pocket. Crease along the edge of the pocket.







, Find the hole at one end of the waterbomb. Blow into this little hole to inflate the waterbomb. The end product should be a cube of paper with an opening at the top.








If you used wax paper, this step is a little difficult, so you may want to stick a straw in the hole.

, Use a dropper or a straw to carefully fill the waterbomb through the hole. Avoid overfilling it, as this could distort its shape and mess up the waterbomb. Also, try not to get water on the outside of the paper. This will help your waterbomb last as long as possible.

, Fold the last triangle so it overlaps the top triangle and tucks under the bottom triangle.








, You can color each triangle a different color or create a pattern. If you're using the spinner for a game, you can draw an arrow in one corner so that it will land on someone when it's spun.








, Use your hands to set the spinner in motion on a flat, smooth surface, like the table or floor. To help it spin even faster, you can fold it along the triangle lines to create a slight point on the bottom.

Fold the excess length of the covers.,
Slide the front and back page into the cover folds.",How to Make an Origami Book2," Using standard 6”x6” origami sheets, this book will be quite small. For something you can actually write in, you may want to use larger 12”x12” sheets. Begin by folding all four sheets in half.The pages in the book will be 1/4 the size of the sheets you use.

, With all four sheets of origami paper folded in half, cut along the creases.You will end up with eight separate sheets that are twice as long as they are wide.


3”x6” if you’re using standard size origami sheets.

, Take the first of the eight sheets and fold it in half “hot dog style.”This will leave you with a sheet that is now 1/4 as wide as it is long—1.5”x6” for a standard sheet.

, You want to fold the same sheet in half again, but this time along the opposite axis.You will once again have a sheet twice as long as it is wide but 1.5”x3”.

, Take the top half of the previous fold and fold it in half but make the fold back on itself.To do this, take the edge of the top piece and fold it back so that it is flush with the spine of the fold from step 4.

, This step is the same as step 5; however, it is for the bottom portion of the paper. The bottom part of the paper from the fold in step 4 will stick out farther than the top after you folded it back on itself. Fold this bottom portion back on itself the same as you did the top portion.After this fold, the paper will be a 1.5”x1.5” square (for standard size sheets) with accordion folds that give the sheet a W shape when looked at from the top., To make more pages for the book, you will repeat steps 3-6 for a total of seven of the sheets you cut in half earlier. A total of seven sheets will provide ten pages in your finished book.You can simply discard the eighth sheet from the earlier cuts.

, Once you have all of the page pieces folded, you need to arrange them. For this step, you will look down at the top of the pieces so that they all have a squiggle W or M shape. Arrange them in a line so each proceeding piece faces the opposite direction.Looking at it from the top, the pieces will look like one long squiggle of MWMWMWM.

, Take the last section of the first piece and the first section of the piece after it in the line and fit the latter section inside the former section by slipping it into the fold created in step 3.You will repeat this step for all five over page pieces until they form one long connected accordion chain.Though optional, using a glue stick to attach the overlapping portion of each page section will add a bit more strength to the finished product., With the pages done and all connected, you can now make the covers for the book. Begin by taking the final full sheet of origami paper and cutting it in half.Since this page will make the covers for the book, you can use a piece that is a different color or that even has a design.

, Take half of the page you just cut and fold the top and bottom edges of it toward the middle of the page.You want to fold it “hot dog style,” so the width of the sheet gets smaller rather than the length.


If you want to make sure the cover is slightly larger than the pages, don’t quite fold the edges exactly to the middle. Instead leave about a 1mm gap.Definitely make sure that if you chose designed paper, the design faces out.

, Take the section of pages and squeeze it down, so it is fully compressed, and then place it in the center of the cover piece. You can make sure the piece is centered by folding the covers piece (which will be long) around the pages and making sure the two ends come together evenly.Pinch a small crease on each side of the text block where the spine meets with the cover., The front and back cover will both be too long, but don’t cut them. Instead make a small crease where the covers reach the edge of the pages. Makes a fold along this crease for both the front and back cover., The folds you made to form the cover in step 11 will form a small slot. Once you’ve folded the excess length of the covers inward, you can use the first and last pages of the page section as a tab and slide them into the slots in the front and back covers respectively.Though not necessary, you can strengthen the book by using a glue stick on the tabs to glue them to the inside of the slots in the covers.

A file folder is a perfect medium to hold and fold paper. If you don’t have a file folder, try to avoid using material that’s not too flimsy or too hard. It is more difficult to create precise folds with materials like cardboard.

, Outline the dimensions 8.525″ x 11.025″. We recommend using these dimensions for folding printing paper (standard printing paper dimensions are 8.5″ x 11″). It is important for the brochure dimensions to be slightly bigger to avoid adding too much pressure on the triangular folds in step 5.

, Use the dimensions 3.5″ for panel A, 4″ for panel B, and 3.525″ for panel C. It is important for panel B to be wider than the side panels to avoid overlapping the folds. Also, we recommend to take advantage of the crease on the file folder – because there’s already a pre-developed fold, we used the crease as a division between panels A and B.

, Use the outline of the rectangle that you drew using a ruler as a guideline. Do not throw away the file folder scraps yet! Use the remains for step 5 to create your pocket folds.

, Use the remaining folder scraps to create the brochure folds. One way to draw them is by placing the scraps over the brochure corners to outline the fold edges. The best way to maintain straight lines is by using a ruler. If tracing is an issue, we recommend to use the dimensions: 1″ x 1″ x 1.5″.

, The hypotenuse side of each triangular fold should face the inside of the tri-folder. Also, make sure to only tape on the edges of the brochure, not on the inside. These triangular folds will be used to insert and keep the paper in place. Make sure to use enough tape to avoid scabbing the paper in the sockets.

, Voila!

, Make sure to flatten out the paper for a more precise fold.;
,, Ta-da!

",How to Make a Paper Car2," You will be drawing something that looks like an upside-down T. Start with a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) tall, 8-inch (20.32 centimeter) wide rectangle at the bottom of your page. Find the center, then draw a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) tall, 1-inch (2.54 centimeters) wide rectangle right above it.Make sure that the two are touching, just like an upside-down T.


You can make your car out of printer paper or construction paper, but cardstock will be much better.
The bottom rectangle will make the sides of the car. The top rectangle will make a curved roof, like in a buggy.

, Cut out both rectangles as one piece. Snip the left and right corners of your bottom rectangle off. You want them angling towards the top, vertical rectangle. These will make the windshield., Start by drawing a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) square in the middle of your bottom rectangle. Use the sides of the square as your folding guideline. Keep the side flaps bent so that they are 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) apart. You should have something that looks like a box., Hold the two side flaps 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) apart. Bring the tip of the top rectangle towards the side flaps. Nestle it right between them, so that the bottom corners touch.Secure everything together with a strip of tape.


For a neater finish, put the tape inside the car instead.
You want the side edges of the top flap to be aligned with the slanted edges of the side flaps.
The top rectangle will create an arch, like in a buggy. For a standard car, pinch it just above the side flaps.

, You can trace these circles using a compass or bottle caps. These will be your wheels. To make them even sturdier, you could use thin cardboard instead., Start by coloring your wheels black, then adding grey or silver hubcaps. Paint your car, if you wish, then draw some doors and handles on the sides. Finish off by adding on a front and back windshield.


Add some more details, such as decals, headlights, or even a driver!
You can paint or draw the details on. If you use paint, let the car dry before moving on.

, Use a hole puncher on the car and a needle on the wheels. The holes on the car should be about ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) from the bottom edge, and 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) apart. The holes on the wheels need to be smack in the center.Don't use a hole puncher on the wheels. The holes will be too big.
If you don't have a needle, you can use a toothpick or an awl. Be careful, however!

, You will need two toothpicks: one for the front set of holes, and one for the back.Trim down the toothpicks until they are ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) long on each side of the car.


Paint the toothpicks black first for a more realistic effect.
If you don't have any toothpicks, you can cut down some skewers or use lollipop sticks instead. You may have to make the holes on the wheels bigger, however.

, Slide the wheels onto the toothpicks—make sure that the hubcaps are facing out. Don't worry if the wheels don't rotate on the toothpick. The toothpick will rotate in the holes on the car instead., The wheels should fit snugly onto the toothpicks. If they are loose or falling off, slide a small bead over each end of the toothpick. Secure the bead with a drop of glue, if needed.If the bead is a different color from the hubcap, you can paint it grey or silver to match.
If you can't find any small beads, try a bit of hot glue instead.

Fold in half from the bottom to the top.
Fold again from right to left but don't press the fold very hard.
Unfold the last fold and rotate the paper.
Fold the right side of the paper to the bottom line in the middle then do the same to the left side. This should now look like an house.
Turn over. Fold down outside corners.
Fold the top 2 flaps down. You'll end up with a triangle.
Fold in half and you are done.
Make sure you have enough pieces for the model. You'll need:

around 27 white pieces (made from rectangles of paper with dimensions of 2.5 cm x 5 cm)
around 344 yellow pieces (made from rectangles of paper with dimensions of 6 cm x 9 cm)
around 72 black pieces (made from rectangles of paper with dimensions of 6 cm x 9 cm )
around 246 blue pieces (made from rectangles of paper with dimensions of 6 cm x 9 cm).



, After you finished to make the pieces, start assembling the base. For this you will need 48 pieces. You will notice that each piece will have two legs and two pockets.


To assemble them you will put the leg of one into the pocket of another, but you must make sure to keep them alternating like bricks so that each new piece you put on is resting on two different pieces. So to put it another way, grab one piece and take the right leg and insert it into the left pocket of another piece. With the left leg of the first piece, place it inside the right pocket of a third piece.
Continue adding pieces on top then on bottom until you have used all 48 pieces in: 24 on the top row and 24 on the bottom row. Now that you have this line you must connect the two ends together so that you now have a ring.

, Now this step is where things start getting really fun. Add 3 more layers on top of the first 2 layers that formed the base. Every row will need to have 24 pieces.

,


On the 6th row you need to put the pieces in this order: 5 yellow pieces, 7 blue pieces, 5 yellow pieces, 7 blue pieces.
On the 7th row you need to put the pieces in this order: 6 yellow pieces, 6 blue pieces, 6 yellow pieces, 6 blue pieces.
Continue like this until you have 7 rows that are made with yellow and blue pieces.

,,,,, You can make them or print them; then cut them out and glue them on top of your origami pieces.

,


For one hand you will need 5 black pieces and 12 yellow pieces. Use the same interlocking 3D method that you did above.
For one leg you will need 7 black pieces and 5 blue pieces.

Carefully squish the ball inward to form a more perfect circular shape.",How to Make a 3D Origami Pokéball," By looking at an example of how a proper model of an origami Pokéball should look, you will be able to gain a better sense of how to create your own.;
, The first step in the entire process is to make all of the pieces beforehand for convenient use. In order to do so, you can figure this out in How to make 3D origami pieces, or you can follow this explanation:

Take one of the squares of the paper and hold it in your hands with the longer side kept to the bottom. Fold this in half, bringing the bottom of the paper to the top.






Fold again from right to left in a light-weight fold.






Unfold the last fold made and flip the paper sideways. Fold the right side of the paper to the bottom line in the middle. Repeat the same step with the left side.











Turn paper over and fold down the outer corners of it.






Fold the two visible top 2 flaps down. The shape resulting is a triangle. Fold this in half and one piece should be officially done.







, You'll need:

approximately 47 black pieces for the poke ball-lining layers.
approximately 244 white pieces for the bottom of Pokéball structure.
approximately 221 red pieces for the top of Pokéball.

, Take notice that each piece has two extending sides and 2 pockets for which they will be able to build upon each other.

, You must make sure to keep them alternating like bricks so that each new piece you put on is resting on two different pieces.






So to put it another way, grab one piece and take the right leg and insert it into the left pocket of another piece. With the left leg of the first piece, place it inside the right pocket of a third piece.







,,,,, Start small from the bottom and gradually have the pieces shape themselves outward.

,


The ball should look like this from the side, becoming larger as it approaches the middle.







, After the white-half of the ball, begin the middle-lining portion with both black and white pieces.

,, After completing one full layer of the black pieces, the ball should look like this.

, Once the black middle-lining has been made, continue the process with the red pieces. This should just be like creating the white-half of the ball, except now you will be making it backwards.

, Do so by forming a circle instead of a layer like so:

,,,, Now, you are fully equipped to catch some 3D origami Pokémon!

Find a flat surface for optimum fold quality.,
Lay the piece of paper in front of you on the surface carefully.





,
Hold one edge of the paper onto the folding surface firmly, but without damaging it.,
To press down on the folded side of the paper, bring your finger to the top of the bend in the paper.,
Good job!",How to Fold Paper in Half," If you want to get a good fold, you must make sure the paper is even, doesn't have any cuts, wrinkles, or wet spots.



;
,, Lift the other edge of the piece of paper about one inch off of the folding surface. (Be careful not to rip it.) Carefully pull that corner over to the opposite side of the paper. Make sure the corners line up. You will notice that if you let go of the corner at this point the paper will go back to normal.





, Carefully apply downward force onto the bend by sliding your finger down the bend, and be sure not to rip the paper with your fingernail. Ensure a good crease by going over the fold with the back of your fingernail (still being careful not to rip it). If you have done this correctly, your paper should be symmetrical, and it should seem half the size of the original unbent paper.

,, Turn the paper over and fold in half into a triangle. You should see the back of your paper. You should see the diagonal creases create ""valleys"" and the perpendicular creases create ""mountains"".








, Allow the valley creases to come together in the middle. By flattening two opposite sides, you should find yourself with a square that is open on the bottom. Make sure your square is rotated so that the opening is on the bottom, as shown in the video.








, Then, repeat this action on the left, so that the top looks like a kite.








,, In doing so, you return to having a square with an opening facing down.








, Bring the outer edges to the middle and flatten, so that you have a diamond.

, Take one of these and pull it out to the side. It will form a flap on the side of the first two layers of paper. It will look like the fold you just made and the fold between the corner of the square and the center make a triangle.

, The resulting mass should look like a square with triangles on top and bellow it. Alternatively, it looks like two trapezoids next to each other.

, The folded mass should look like a six sided figure with the two long sides of the square on the left and right and the four sides of the triangles on the top and bottom.

, This will fold both the square and part of the triangles.

, At this point the left and right sides should be much longer then they were before.

,, By doing this, you will make the section of the paper that was these triangles into a trapezoid shape.

, By doing this, you will pull a large triangular area of paper out from inside the folds of the paper. The resulting shape of the paper looks like the structure you started with along with two large triangles at its left and right side.

, The paper should look like two identical five sided shapes.

, Take the three corners that do not face the center of the paper in each of the five sided shape and fold them to the center of the five sided shape. This center should be easy to spot as not only are there lines intersecting to the center but also there are creases where you are going to fold. The resulting shape should look like two squares side by side.

, For the right square take the rightmost side and fold it into the center.

, The resulting shape should look like a small trapezoid and rectangle in the center of the paper.

, This will give the paper its three dimensional shape and result in your paper ship.

Then you can move on to more decorative paper which is more prone to rip.You can start with either a square-sized or letter-sized (8.5” x 11”) to make your star. The result will be the same.;
, If you’re using a square, fold along the middle so two opposite edges meet one another. For the letter-sized paper, fold it “hot dog,” or along the vertical axis so that the two longer edges meet one another.

, For your folded square piece of paper, make a mark (a dot, dash, or “x”) on the left side (one of the shorter sides) ⅓ of the way from the top edge. For the letter-sized paper, you’ll make a mark on the middle of the left edge (again one of the shorter edges). Regardless of which size of paper you’re using, you’ll use this mark to coordinate your folds.

, Crease the paper well once you’ve made the fold. This fold should create two smaller triangles within the figure, along the left edge, one above and below where the corner has met the mark.

, Take the bottom left corner and fold it over the diagonal edge of the lower triangle made by the previous fold. What you should have now is the same figure as you ended up with in the previous step, but with the lower left triangle flipped over its diagonal edge.

, The rightmost edge should now be running alongside the leftmost edge. What should left will look a bit like an ice cream cone; a long acute triangle with a right triangle on top (if using letter-sized paper). If you used a square piece, the long acute triangle will be topped by multiple figures.

, For those who started with a square, trim the long acute triangle to make it equilateral triangle (with equally sized edges). Those who began with a letter-sized piece of paper, cut from the midpoint of the right edge of the long triangle up to the top left corner or the triangle.

, The piece trimmed off in the previous step will form your star. Unfold it gently to avoid ripping the paper. Left should be a five-point star with a slight 3D effect from its folds."

Do not attach both edges of one side together (as demonstrated in the third picture above). If you'd like, glue the edges together for lasting stability.

,,,, However, only fully attach one strip to begin the base.

, Before securing the strip to the next leg of the second tetrahedron, weave the strip through the center of the first tetrahedron and attach.

At this point, if one of the tetrahedron is help upside down, the model will resemble an hourglass.

, The second tetrahedron should be “on its side” in the center of the first.

Fold the strip along the edge of the pentagon.,
Gently pinch the corners of the pentagon.",How to Fold a Paper Star2," Start with a letter-sized piece of paper and trim a strip a half inch wide. Lay it flat, vertically, on a table in front of you.


Avoid thinner paper like gift wrap or wax paper as this method will require a bit more handling of the star.

, At the top of the strip, make a knot by creating a loop and drawing the end through; only devote the last inch or two of the strip to this knot. Measure first with a ruler before knotting. Make the loop by curling the strip behind itself, pass over the front to the right and around the back and through the loop made.


Tighten (gently) and leave only about a ¼-inch tag out of the loop. Once the knot is made, flatten it gently with your hand.
Once done, tuck the tag end into the pocket formed by the knot. This should form a small pentagon at the end of the strip.

, First fold the strip over the edge of the pentagon which it meets. The result should be a smaller strip with the same pentagon atop it. After every fold, a different edge of the pentagon will meet the strip.


Continuing folding in this way until there’s only a short bit left, about ½ an inch. Tuck this short strip into one of the creases of the pentagon.

, Using your thumb and index finger, pinch each of the five corners of the pentagon. These will narrow the edges into points, creating your “lucky star.” Once all the corners are pinched, you should have your star."

Tuck the remaining triangles.",How to Fold a Paper Star3," If you’ve only got letter-sized paper (8.5”x11”) available, you can make it into a square with folds and a pair of scissors. With the paper laying vertically in front of you, fold the bottom right corner towards the top left of the paper until it forms a triangle.What was the bottom edge should now be flush with the left edge; there should remain a rectangle on top of the triangle formed. Cut this rectangle off with scissors.

, Crease the fold well and open it up once you’ve folded it. Use the remaining crease line as a marker and cut along this line, making two rectangles from the square.


These two rectangles will be manipulated exactly the same, but mirrored. Eventually each rectangle will come to form two points of the star.
For a more distinct finished star, use two different colored pieces of paper to make two rectangles to continue on from this step.

, First fold each rectangle “hot dog” style along the vertical side (meeting the two longer sides). Fold them again in half “hamburger” style, having either short edge meet.’


Unfold this last fold to have two thin rectangles with a visible crease line horizontally through the middle.

, Take the lower half of the left triangle and fold it to the right, forming an “L” with a right angle. Do the same to the right rectangle, but fold it to the left, creating a “J.” Then do the same to the unfolded sides of both rectangles, folding them to face opposite the already folded portions.


Each rectangle should end up as two squares connected by a slanted rectangle.

, For each square (four total) on the two figures, fold them in half to make a triangle each. Fold them such that the corners folded in towards the slant face towards one another. Once all squares have been folded into triangles, you should be to flip the figure lengthwise and have it look the same.

, Along the edge which meets the slanted rectangle, fold the triangles to make a right angle. Fold them to be perpendicular with the surface you’re using, with the slanted rectangle lying flat. Fold them flat to make the crease very distinct.

, After the last step, your two figures should remain mirror images of one another. Flip the right one upside down so that its folds point towards the surface you’re using. This flipped figure should look like two isosceles triangles.


Then place this flipped figure on top of the left one. There should now be an idea of what the star will come to look like; each triangle forms a point of the star.

, First, fold the right triangle of the lower piece (the one on bottom) under the top triangle of the top piece. Then do the same with the left triangle of the lower piece and the triangle closest you on the top piece. The two triangles just folded should form the top and bottom points of the star.


Once completed, flip the whole thing over.

, Fold them both towards the center of the star, tucking them under the folds formed in the last step. Once both have been folded, what remains should be your ninja star."

Make your own origami paper.",How to Choose Paper for Origami," Before you get to folding, consider how large or small the design you’re trying to make needs to be. Complex, impressive pieces may benefit from added size, which means you should use a sheet of paper that is larger and can be folded more ways. On the other hand, smaller paper forces you to work meticulously, and results in stunning, delicate shapes.Origami paper can come cut as large as 30”x20”, and as small as a mere 1”x1” for challenging miniature pieces.;
, Your origami doesn’t have to be made from dull white paper. Take color into account when deciding on a design. Origami paper can be found in a multitude of color combinations, with products like duo paper which has a different color on each side. Other papers feature brightly-colored patterns and embellishments, each presenting unique possibilities.Different colors will suit different projects. For instance, an origami strawberry can be fashioned from red and green duo paper, while a lotus may look best in one tasteful pastel sheet.

, For an interesting visual element, look into papers that have textures that make them stand out among conventional types. Certain types of washi, or traditional Japanese origami paper, are woven from plant fibers and are characterized by a soft, slightly wrinkled consistency. These papers can give completed projects an added degree of visual texture and appeal.Other types of textured paper like momigami (a leathery paper made from the bark of the mulberry tree) and foil paper highlight surface detail while also manipulating the way light hits the contours of the design.

, Not all origami paper comes in squares. See what sorts of new objects you can fold using circular or triangular paper, or any number of other unorthodox shapes. Working with alternative shapes requires you to view your project from a fresh perspective and changes the types of techniques you’re able to employ and designs you’re able to create.Some techniques may be altered drastically when using oddly shaped papers, as there may be more or fewer precise edges and corners to aid in folding.

, Washi is a term that simply means “Japanese paper” and is usually used to describe the basic type of folding paper used to make origami shapes in Japan and overseas. Washi is made to fold easily and maintain its shape, and since it’s a no-frills type of paper, it will probably work best for standard usages and beginners learning the ropes of origami. Washi comes in a square, standardized size and can be purchased in most craft stores around the world.Washi is the most common type of origami paper and will be the go-to choice for most projects.

, Named because of its coloration, duo paper is a basic paper type that features a different color on each side of the sheet. Choose duo paper when you’re folding shapes that benefit stylistically from a certain color scheme (such as red and green for a rose), or if your purpose is to make the design more intricate by incorporating different layers of color.Care must be taken to fold duo paper correctly, as misalignments will be made more visible by the contrast in color.

, Chiyogami is another conventional Japanese origami paper. In most cases, it is basic washi, only bearing classical Japanese artwork, prints and patterns. Chiyogami paper is more elaborate in appearance than other varieties, and is an available option should you wish to learn traditional Japanese shapes and folding styles.There are many traditional origami papers bearing classic Japanese aesthetics. In addition to basic chiyogami, there is yuzen, a particular variation of chiyogami that features prints inspired by popular fabrics from ancient Japan; momigami, fashioned from mulberry bark and known for its leathery texture; and shinwazome, a thick, brilliantly adorned paper with embossed patterns that is often used for more extravagant projects.

, Lend a little shine to your art by picking up some foil paper, which has a standard folding paper on one side and a thin layer of metallic foil on the other. Foil origami paper is sure to catch the eye as your designs sparkle with a gold, silver or ruby glint. The foil will also help preserve your folds, as the pliable metallic layer holds a crease that won’t spring back out of place.Another additional benefit of working with foil paper is that it allows the handler to fashion smooth curves in their designs that easily maintain their shape.
It will be hard to hide mistakes made with foil paper, as the paper will remain crinkled even after it is smoothed out., Paper is everywhere, and all of it could become beautiful origami in the right hands. Return the art to its ultimate simplicity by folding any sort of paper you come across, including newsprint, magazine pages, card stock and wrapping paper. This way you’ll never run out of supplies, and your projects will take on a intriguing, homemade vibe.Working with found paper reinforces the original spirit of origami, which is a form of art that can be practiced anywhere at any time with most any materials.
Not all found paper types will fold with the same degree of success. Copy paper can be found anywhere, is sturdy and holds a crease well, but is too thick for more detailed designs, while newsprint and other similar materials is thin enough to allow for more complex folds but creases stubbornly, and is usually quite weak and therefore prone to tearing.

, Not all origami paper is limited to solid, conservative colors. Modern alternatives include wild patterns like chevron and animal prints such as leopard, tiger and zebra. Choosing one of these eye-catching paper design will allow you to infuse a little contemporary flair.Because patterned papers are printed in a certain directional configuration, they may be best for simpler designs. In complex shapes, the print may run together and be disorienting to the eye.

, Unlike traditional washi, which is cut to a specific set of dimensions, many modern origami papers come in multiple sizes that give the handler much more control over the scale of the design. Some papers can be quite large, allowing for oversized, statuesque pieces, while smaller variants are used to produce elegant miniatures.Vary the dimensions of the paper you use to have many different sizes of origami to put on display.
You can also cut found paper to whatever specifications you prefer if the size of a premade paper won’t do.

, Incorporate some of your own personality into your next origami project by designing your own paper. Take a standard piece of washi or duo paper (or another preferred kind if you’re an experienced folder) and decorate it by hand using freehand linework, vibrant colors of even personalized text excerpts. When you’re finished, you’ll have a one-of-a-kind piece of paper art to show off.The number of ways you can design your own origami paper is limited only by the depth of your imagination.
Try composing a note or holiday card to a loved one and giving it to them in the form of origami.

Cross the ends of the strips and pull one end through the loop that forms. If you want the color from a particular end of the strip, tie the knot at the other end. Don't twist the paper, just loop it.
Gently tighten the knot, then gently pull the knot without creasing or squeezing the strip of paper.
When all the edges are in contact, press it down and crease. You should have a pentagon with a long end and a short end sticking out.

, If there's a little more than a pentagon width, you can tear it off or fold it under and tuck it in.








, The result should be a fatter pentagon. Fold so that the color you want faces out, if the two sides of the strip are different.

Garden decoration: These origami pinwheels look pretty in the garden. They'll last until it rains, or keep them sheltered.
Cards: Glue the origami pinwheel to cards. Either draw a stick or glue on a thin stick to create a 3D pinwheel effect on the card. Or be imaginative and use the pinwheel to create other designs on the card, such as a windmill, a Ferris wheel, etc.
Festive decorations: Tie a row of origami pinwheels together along a piece of string or ribbon and hang for festive effect. Try using different colors of paper for best effect, or use colors that are themed to the occasion.
Gift boxes: Attach an origami pinwheel to a gift box as the ""seal"" or as a design feature. Pinwheels could also be attached to gift wrapping paper for a 3D effect.

",How to Make an Origami Cube with 6 Squares," Fold the paper in half diagonally, making sure to be crisp and accurate and crease along the fold.;
,, Fold the top edge down to the center so that the edge rests along the line from the previous fold. Do the same with the bottom edge so that both edges of the paper meet in the center. Then open the sheet of paper again.


The paper should now have one line going diagonally across and three horizontal lines dividing the paper into quarters.

, Fold them to the line from the last step, the horizontal line closest to the top. The corners will make a right triangle when properly folded; the bottom of that triangle should sit on the horizontal line, and the diagonal line from the first step should cut the triangle exactly in half.

, Repeat the same motion as above: bring the top corner of the paper down to the horizontal line, and fold it so that it forms a triangle whose base sits on that line. However, this time you will have an obtuse rather than a right triangle. The base of this triangle should be the same crease that was the hypotenuse of the right triangle, above.

, After this step, the overall shape of the paper should be a rectangle half the size of the original square. However, there should be triangular holes from where the corners were folded over.

, This time, use one of the other corners - if you folded in the top right and bottom left corners in the previous steps, this time use the bottom right corner. Bring the corner to the top center of the rectangle, forming a right triangle as tall as the rectangle.

, Pick the corner opposite the one you just folded - the only corner that has not yet been folded - and mirror the last step with this corner, bringing it to the bottom center of the rectangle. The fold should form another right triangle adjacent to the one from the previous step.

, Unfold the two triangles you just folded.

, Using the bottom right corner again (the one you just unfolded), refold the exact same fold, but this time, rather than folding it on top of the flap of paper from the double-folded corner, slide it underneath.

, Refold and the top left corner to the center, but this time tuck it under the flap from the double-folded, bottom left corner.


Your paper should now be in the shape of a parallelogram, with each corner folded into another so that the whole piece holds together.

, The back should be smooth (no papers tucked in anywhere) and should have two lines cutting it in half, one horizontal and one diagonal (parallel to the sides).

, The bottom right should be one of the ""pointy"" corners (an acute angle). Fold it to the top right corner, so that the tip meets the angle of the top right corner (an obtuse angle). Essentially, you're folding the vertical side in half, but since it's a parallelogram, not a rectangle, it looks like you're folding in a corner. The bottom of the triangle created by the fold should sit at a right angle to the vertical sides of the parallelogram.

, Fold the top left hand corner to the bottom center. The paper should now be a perfect square.


Unfold the last two folds you made so that the sides stick straight out from the square base, rather than laying flat atop it. Each of these will form one side of the cube, with the two triangles sticking off at right angles serving to connect each side to the rest.

, You started with six squares of paper, so you should have six folded squares in total.


Different color paper was use in this example to clarify the visual instructions. Multiple colors of paper are not required.

, One piece is perpendicular to the other, with one pointy end lined up with the slot in the top center of the other piece. Both pieces should be face down, so that the corners want to fold in to the table you're working on rather than out into the air.

, Make sure to choose the appropriate corner and slot so that the squares at the center of each piece are now positioned perfectly next to each other. The diagonal line on the bottom triangle of the white piece should perfectly line up with the diagonal line going across the center of the red piece.

, It should also be face down and even with the center of the red piece. The diagonal corner of the blue piece should be parallel to the diagonal line pointed out in the step above.

, The two diagonal lines pointed out above should now meet to form just one diagonal line going from the corner of the red square to the corner of the white triangle, with the blue triangle sitting along the line. The three squares at the center of each piece should be lined up in the shape of an L with the red at the corner, so that the red square borders the other two and the white and blue squares only touch at one corner.

, The white corner is the end of the diagonal line referred to above. Slip it into the nearest blue pocket. This will create a half cube, formed by three squares which all border each other. Each side should also be half its original color and half the color of the piece that got tucked into it. The figure will now be 3D, so that it can no longer sit flat on the table.


When you position the cube with one side on the table, the leftover corners should form diagonal halves of the last three sides of the cube.

, From this position, you can easily add the next side.

, Make sure it's lined up the right way. The top triangle will line up perfectly with the triangle from the earlier piece of the same color so that those two triangles together will form a square on one of the other sides left to be filled. The other triangle, the bottom one of the piece you're putting in, should tuck into a fold on a side already in place.

Lay your rectangular paper flat in a horizontal position. Take one corner of the paper and fold it over until it meets the opposite edge, forming a triangle. You should have a triangle shape and and a rectangular portion left over. Remove the rectangular portion of the paper by tearing or cutting it.

Origami paper also works well, and is easier to fold.
If you are using the same color paper to make your ninja star, you don’t need two pieces of paper. You can simply cut two rectangles from one square piece of paper.;
, Press down on the fold to make a crease. Then unfold the paper.









If you are using paper that has one colored side, start with the color side facing down.
If you are using the same color paper, you may want to draw a different design on each piece of paper, or make some markings to help you differentiate.

, You should now have four rectangular pieces of paper. You will only need two rectangular pieces to make your star. This article shows two differently colored rectangles to make things easier, but you can use the same color rectangles if you wish.









If you are using different colored paper and currently have four rectangles, put two of them aside. You can save them for making a second ninja star.

, This is called a book fold.If you’re using computer paper and want to make a smaller ninja star, you can shorten your folded rectangles by cutting or tearing part of the paper off.









Keep in mind that the more paper you have, the easier the ninja star will be to make.
Make sure that both folded pieces of paper are the same length.

, Then, unfold. This fold will create a crease to use as a guideline, making the next folds easier.









You should now have two folded rectangles with a valley fold running horizontally in the center of each., Make sure to fold the two pieces of paper opposite one another.

, One piece of paper will now have the triangular flaps facing upwards while the other will have the flaps facing downwards.








, Rotate the (blue) paper so that it resembles a “Z” shape with the flaps pointing up. Place the (orange) paper with the flaps pointing down on top. The two pieces of paper should be perpendicular to one another.









Your two pieces of paper should be making a cross.

, Take the tip of each (blue) triangle portion that’s pointing up and tuck it into the top pocket of the (orange) paper.








You should see two pockets on the top piece of (orange) paper that you can slide the triangles of the (blue) paper into.
Once you fit the tips of the triangles into the pockets, press down on the edges to create a crease to hold everything in place.

, Repeat the process fitting the remaining two (orange) triangles into the (blue) pockets.









The order in which you fit the tips in doesn’t matter, but you may have to shift your paper around slightly to get everything in place.
If you're finding it difficult to slide the paper in, try pinching the sides of the pockets to open up space.

Hooray!",How to Make a Modular Origami Stellated Icosahedron,";
, If you use origami-paper, make sure the pattern-side is outside and will be visible later.

,, This is often called a cupboard fold, or book fold.

,, Make sure to fold over both 'doors' of the cupboard fold.

,, Remember to fold over both 'doors' of the cupboard fold. This makes a parallelogram.

,, You will end up with a small square.

,,, You've made your first unit!

, If you have three different colors of paper, make ten of each color.

, The surface of the stellated icosahedron is made up of a number of pyramids (in fact, if you take the regular icosahedron - a solid with twenty triangular faces - and make each face the base of a triangular pyramid, you get a stellated icosahedron). So we start by using the units to make a series of connected pyramids. To get a more simple idea of this complex cube you are now going to build, just think of an only 12-faced regular pentagonal dodecahedron (a Platonic solid), and imagine each of its 20 vertices (5 at the top, 5 at the bottom and 10 around in-between) will be replaced by a pyramid. With 30 units you will shape together those 20 pyramids.

, The triangular ends of each unit are called 'tabs', and the square in the center of the unit contains 'pockets' made up by the cupboard fold that goes along the diagonal. Begin by putting the tab of one unit (pictured in orange below) into the pocket of another (pictured in yellow).

, Congratulations - you made your first pyramid!

, Continue by taking a new unit (orange in this case), and put its tab in the yellow unit's second pocket.

, Tada! You now have two adjacent pyramids.

, If you are using three unit colors, make sure to never put the tab of a unit into a pocket of another unit of the same color. This ensures a regular, colorful pattern on your stellated icosahedron.

, You may need to feel your way around a bit to make sure that you never end up having to put a tab into a pocket of the same color. Don't worry if you do - you can carefully prise your units apart and rearrange them until you find a proper arrangement.

, The last unit is tricky - you'll have to make sure that both its tabs go into pockets, and both its pockets are filled by the two remaining free tabs. Proceed with care.

, You now have a fully formed, colorful, stellated icosahedron.

;
, After the first fold, make another fold, this time folding widthwise or “hot dog style,” so that the longest sides of the dollar bill meet up together.







, Open up the fold that you just made, keeping the first fold intact. You should see a section of the bill sticking up that looks almost like a pocket. Stick your finger in this “pocket” and push the sides over to flatten it, then use a finger to push the tip of the crease (located near George Washington’s face) to fold the crease inward. Doing this should make a triangular fold downward.







, Once you have made the triangular folds on one side of the dollar bill, flip the dollar bill over. Then repeat the process of pushing the “pocket” flat and making the triangular fold, just on the side of the bill.







, After you make the triangular folds on each side of the bill, flip the top fold over so that instead of seeing the complex fold pattern in the bill, you see a smooth portion of the bill shaped like a pentagon with a crease running down the middle. Flip the bill over and do the same on the other side.








The pentagon should have the face of George Washington at the top point.

, Once you have formed the pentagon, fold up the bottom half of the pentagon so that it touches the very tip of the pentagon. Then flip the bill over and repeat the same thing on the other side.







, The bill should now look rectangular, with the corners of the bill at one side of the rectangle. Take one of the opposite corners (not a corner at the edge of the bill) and fold it over in a triangle shape. Do the same for the corner of the same end of the bill, making sure that the triangular folds are the same size and don’t touch at the center.







, Take the folded bill and flip it 90 degrees so you are looking at the edge of the folded bill rather than at its face. You will see a central fold in the bill, with the very corners of the bill (with the $1 sign) visible. Hold each corner flap with your fingers and pull the folds slowly apart.







, You should see that the bowtie is almost made, but the central “tie” of the bowtie is still folded in on itself. To open it, hold the bowtie on both sides right next to the folded center of the bowtie, then gently pull. The folds should expand, then open to reveal the face of George Washington right on the center of the bowtie! Push on the center if it is not flattening."

Pull to flatten the center square.",How to Make a Dollar Bill Bow Tie2," A skinny dollar bill bow tie gives you a more old fashioned looking bow tie that is long and thin and has a small, square center. To begin making this design, take a dollar bill and place it on a flat surface with the front of the bill facing up. Fold it horizontally in half “hotdog” style, then unfold. Then fold it top to bottom “hamburger style” and unfold.







, Take all four corners of the bill and fold them over in small triangles whose inside edges almost touch the central fold.







, Take the top long edge of the dollar bill and fold it over towards the central crease of the dollar bill so that the edge almost touches the crease. Repeat on bottom edge, folding it up so that the edge nearly touches the central crease.







, You should now have a long, skinny folded over bill with a crease running horizontally through it and triangular points at each end. Fold the bill in half so that the points touch, then unfold the fold you just made to make a vertical crease.







, The dollar bill should now be folded in a long, skinny shape that lays horizontally. Create a backward lowercase “r” by folding the right side of the bill down, making a diagonal crease at the center point of the bill. Unfold this fold and repeat on the left hand side, this time making a lowercase “r” shape by folding the left side of the bill down at the central point to make a lowercase “r” shape, then unfolding.







, After making the two x-shaped folds, turn the bill over to the unfolded side. You will see the “x” shaped creases in the center. Use your fingers to “squish” the top and the bottom triangles of the x in on themselves, which folds the bill in half into a diamond shape.







, Hold the diamond shape by the end that is not connected to the crease and fold it over the other side so that it is hanging further than the crease. Turn the bill over and repeat on the other side.







, You should now have a folded bill that looks like a “z” shape when viewed from the side, with one end sticking to the left, the central folded area in the middle as the base, and the other end sticking over to the left. Take the one end of the bill and fold it 90 degrees under so that the ends are now parallel to each other, with their folded sides facing outward.








Each end of the dollar bill should roughly be in a pentagon shape.

, Take the bottom edges of the pentagon shape and fold the corners in towards the center fold in triangle shapes. Turn the folded bill over and repeat on the other side.







, Take both pointed ends in each hand, with one finger against the back of the pointed fold in the center. Gently pull each end out while using your finger to gently push the central crease in towards you.







, Your bow tie is almost complete, with the central square of the bow tie still looking a little folded. Hold the bow tie on both sides right next to this central square and pull. The square will expand, then flatten to create a perfect, skinny bowtie!"

Clip the bow tie with a paperclip.,
Pin the bow tie to your shirt.,
Glue a clip to the dollar bill bow tie.",How to Make a Dollar Bill Bow Tie3," The easiest way to attach the dollar bill bow tie to your shirt is to clip it on with a paperclip. Flip the bow tie over to the back side and hook one end of the paperclip into a fold of the bow tie. Then hook the bowtie into the collar of your shirt to keep it in place!, Another more secure way to attach the bow tie is to use a safety pin. Turn the bow tie to the back side and weave the safety pin through a small section of the bow tie. Then pin the safety pin into the spot of your shirt where you want to affix the tie.








, Another way to attach the dollar bill bow to is to use a clip to hold it in place. Purchase a small clip and glue it to the back of the tie using hot glue or another strong glue. Then clip the tie in place.Keep in mind that if you use hot glue, you may render the bill unusable if you accidentally tear it when you detach it from the clip.

Open it, then fold it in half horizontally, pressing the crease.
After making the creases, open the paper and flip it over to the back.;
, With the color-side down, turn the paper so that it sits like a square (instead of a diamond). Fold the paper in half vertically and press the crease.


Open the paper again, then fold it in half horizontally and press the crease.
Open the paper once more. The creases should separate the paper into eight notable sections.

, Rotate the paper into diamond form. Fold the left, right, and top corners down until they meet at the bottom corner.


Note that you should start with the color-side down, but after folding in the corners, the color-side should become visible.
Flatten the paper model after making the folds.

, With the model in diamond form, fold the left and right corners of the upper layer toward the center of the model. Fold the top corner of the upper layer downward so that the corners of this fold meet the top corners of your side folds.


Crease all three folds well, then unfold the paper.

, Use scissors to carefully cut along the vertical center of the upper layer. Only cut up to the top crease line.


Do not cut any of the upper layer creases and do not cut into more than the upper layer.

, Fold the newly cut sections of paper upward. The base of each section should connect from the side corner to the cut at the top crease.


These folded sections will eventually become the legs of the horse.

, Fold the outside corner of each leg section into the shared center corner.


At the completion of this fold, the entire top half of the model has been folded.

, Flip the model over to its other side. Repeat the same folds used on the original top half, making both sides identical.


Start with the upper layer creases and continue through the previous steps until you've folded the leg sections in half.

, Rotation the model until the single corner points upward and the two base corners point down.


Fold the right section upward until the right corner meets the top corner. Crease and unfold.
Fold the top corner down along the left section only, folding no more than one-quarter the length of its long side. Crease and unfold.

, Apply an inside reverse fold along your previous two creases. Doing so should form the head and the tail of the horse.


To make an inside reverse fold, push the corner opposite the crease in between the layers of paper. Continue until the reverse fold hits the crease line. Press along the crease again to reinforce the fold., Fold the tips of all four leg sections upward and along the inside of the model, just enough to flatten the tips into blunt lines.

, Gently separate the four legs, if necessary, and stand the horse upright on its feet. This completes the process.


If done correctly, you might be able to make the horse do a somersault by sharply tapping upward beneath the point of its tail.

Press along the fold to secure it.
The model should like like a triangle after this step.

, Fold the right corner down until it meets the bottom corner. Fold the left corner down until it meets the same point.


Press along both folds.
The model should look like a small diamond after this step.

, Turn the paper over to its back, then fold it in half vertically.


The paper should still be positioned as a diamond instead of a square. Fold the right corner over until the meets the left corner, creating a fold between the top and bottom corners. Press along the fold to hold it in place.
After completing this step, the model should look like another triangle.

, Grab the bottom corner of the triangle and bend it upward, creating a fold just beneath the horizontal center.


Only fold the upper layer of the bottom corner.
This fold should move roughly one-third of the upper layer, bringing it to rest over another one-third. The remaining third should remain uncovered.
The resulting flap will eventually become the wing of the chick.

, Turn the model over to its other side. Fold the bottom corner over so that it mirrors the bottom corner fold previously made on the first side.


Like the other fold, you should only fold the upper layer of paper. The fold should only move roughly one-third of the surface, causing it to overlap another one-third.
Note that the top and bottom of the model should still remain the same. Do not rotate it.
The resulting flap will become the other wing.

, Make an inside reverse fold into the top corner.


To make the fold, push the top corner down and toward the body of the model, allowing it to fall in between the layers of the model.
The resulting point should stick out of the diagonal top edge, and the base fold should connect from the top of the folded wing to a point roughly one-quarter down from the tip of the top diagonal edge.

, Apply another inside reverse fold to the bottom corner of the model.


This portion should be roughly the same size as the previous inside reverse fold.
Push the bottom corner up and toward the body of the model, pulling it in between layers of the model as you do. The resulting point should stick out from beneath the diagonal bottom edge.

, The chick should be done and able to stand on its own. Rest the model on the edges of the bottom (final) inside reverse fold, and allow the rest of the folds to gently flare open.

Fold the paper in half vertically. Crease and unfold.
Fold the paper in half horizontally. Crease and unfold.
Turn the paper so that it looks like a diamond. Fold the top and bottom corners together. Crease and unfold.
Fold the left and right corners together. Crease and unfold.
Turn the paper over so that the sides slope down, then pinch the paper on both sides of the diagonal crease. Four triangles should begin taking shape. Continue pushing inward to collapse the figure, resulting in four triangular shaped sides.
Flatten the figure down. Two triangles should remain intact, but the other two should fold inward along your previous creases.

, Turn the model so that the isolated corner faces left. Fold the tip of this corner down along the center line.


The folded tip should cover roughly half of the visible center line.

, Carefully pry open the waterbomb base. The center crease along both surface triangles should push outward, but the center fold along both inner triangles should remain inwardly folded.


As you ease the base open, press on the corner of the top inner triangle fold. Carefully flatten this triangle out against itself, but do not completely unfold it. When finished, this triangle should lie flat against two-thirds of its original position.
Repeat the same process with the corner of the bottom inner triangle. When finished, you should see a full square of the ""wrong"" side facing up, with four small triangles of the ""right"" side still showing at the top and bottom of the model.

, Fold the paper in half along its horizontal center line. The two upper triangles should overlap the two lower triangles.


This step completes the body of the cow. The excess triangular portions lying beyond the folded square will act as the feet of the cow.

, Place a second piece of square origami paper color-side up. Fold the paper in half so that the top and bottom edges meet.


You'll use this piece to make the cow's head. Connecting the head to the body will come in a later step.

, Fold the bottom edge of the upper layer in half. When finished, the bottom edge should lie flat against the fold.


Flip the paper over and repeat this process with the bottom edge on the other side.

, Fold the bottom right corner upward and inward, continuing until the outer edge meets the top edge. Crease, then unfold. Squash fold along this crease.


Fold one-quarter of the right edge toward the center; crease, then unfold.
Pry open the right corner of the upper layer, then flatten out the diagonal crease so that it lies directly against the vertical crease.
Flip the model over, then squash fold the surface layer on the opposite side in the same manner.

, Fold the point of the remaining right tip into the model, hiding it in between the inner layers.


This should blunt the tip and create the nose of the cow. Note that you should reverse fold no more than one-quarter to one-third of the pointed tip during this step.

, Lay the model flat and identify the left corner of the upper triangle. Fold the tip of this triangle forward , bringing the tip the the center fold.


Flip the model over and repeat this action on the corresponding point.
Together, both of these folded sections make the ears of the cow.

, Starting just behind the ear of the cow, fold the upper edge of the long rectangular portion down.


The left edge of the rectangle should lie perpendicular beneath the middle portion.
This fold will create the cow's neck.

, Reverse fold the rectangular portion into itself along its newly created crease.


You'll also need to reverse fold the bottom right corner into itself by approximately one-fifth the length of the edge. Doing so will allow you to insert the neck into the body.

, Slide the neck of the cow into the folds at one end of the body.


If necessary, you can keep the head in place by applying a small piece of tape to the inner layers.

, Move to the tip of the body lying opposite the newly placed head. Fold the point into the body to blunt the edge.


Only fold in just enough of the point to blunt the edge. If you fold too much in, it may look odd and could cause the cow to tip over due to the weight of the head.

, Stand the cow up on its four feet. At this point, the model is finished and ready to enjoy.

If all you have is rectangular computer paper, make your own square paper by folding the top corner down diagonally. Trim off the extra rectangle of paper at the bottom. Choose any color of origami paper. Paper with a multi-colored design works well with this project since the bird's flapping wings will make the colors dance.
If your paper has two different colored sides, note which one is facing up and which one is facing down. If your paper is the same color on both sides, make a small mark or design to identify the two sides. the side facing the table is the side that you will see when the bird is complete.;
, Start by laying the square in front of you so that the bottom corner is pointing at your chest. Bring the top corner down to the bottom corner, then use your finger to make a crease.


You will now have a triangular shape with the points facing you.
Then unfold the paper so it lays flat again.

, Rotate the square and fold it again, this time bringing the other corner to meet its opposite. Make a second crease with your finger.


The two creases will form an ""X"" shape in your paper.Unfold your paper again.

, Lay the square in front of you so that its bottom edge is parallel to your chest.


Fold the paper in half, bringing the top edge to meet the bottom edge. Make a crease with your finger.
Unfold the paper again to lay it flat.

, Turn the paper sideways and fold it in half again, then crease the fold with your finger.


Unfold your paper once again.
You should now have four creases running through your paper that all intersect in the middle of the square.

, Start with the bottom corner of the square pointing toward your chest. Pinch the two sides of the square along the horizontal fold, bringing the left and right corners down to the bottom corner. The two sides will collapse in toward the middle, and the top corner will fold over them to form a small square. It might take a little maneuvering to get the sides to collapse toward the middle of the square. It can help to re-crease all of the folds to make them more flexible.
If you do this correctly, the small square you make will have a crease running from the top corner to the bottom corner in the center.

, With the bottom corner of the square pointing toward your chest, fold the top layer of the right corner inward so that its edge aligns with the center crease.


Use your finger to crease the fold.

, Do the same thing, folding the top layer of the left corner inward so that its edge aligns with the center crease. Use your finger to crease the fold.


The new folds will take the shape of a little kite.

, You're going to do the folds you just made on the other side.


You will now have two identical sides that look like a kite.
Fold the top part of the kite down to create a crease. Then unfold.

, Orient the paper so that the bottom corner (the part that can unfold to reveal the interior) is pointing toward your chest. Lift the top layer of the bottom corner up and flatten it against the table. It will look like a diamond shape sitting on top of your kite. As you lift the bottom corner, the sides of the paper will fall into the diamond shape naturally along the creases you already folded.

, Repeat the folds you just made on the other side. Open up the backside of the kite. Orient it so that the bottom corner (the part that can unfold to reveal the interior) is pointing toward your chest. Lift the top layer of the bottom corner up and flatten it against the table. Now both sides have a diamond shape.


The two diamonds should align perfectly over one another when you're finished with both sides.

, Fold the right bottom flap diagonally up to the right. Fold the left bottom flap diagonally up to the left.


You should now have three points forming three triangles all facing upward, pointing away from you.

, Turn your paper on the side and open the flaps. Now take bottom portion of paper you just folded and unfolded and fold it up and into the flap. Close the flaps. Then take the portion of paper now in the middle and pull it out, keeping the two folds closed.


Pull the paper out so that all of the edges are aligned. Crease the fold.
Repeat this with the other side so that you have the head and tail pointing diagonally outward.

, This reverse fold will make the head. Open the paper to reveal the two flaps and fold down the tip so it’s between. Then pinch the flaps together and crease.

, Fold the top layer of the middle triangle down at an angle to form a wing.


Fold the wing so that it points more toward the head, not just straight down.

, Repeat the fold for the other wing.


Make sure that the wings line up with one another.

, Holding the bird's neck, pull the tail up diagonally to make the wings flap.


Finished! Enjoy your origami flapping bird.

Flip the paper over so the flat side is now facing you.,
Fold the wings down.",How to Make an Origami Flying Bird2," If you don’t have square paper, take a rectangular piece of paper and fold one corner down and align the edges. You will have a triangle shape with your fold and a rectangular portion left over. Remove the rectangular portion to end of with a square.Lay your paper on the table with the colored side facing down and the white side up.
If your paper has two different colored sides, note which one is facing up and which one is facing down. If your paper is the same color on both sides, make a small mark or draw a design to identify the two sides. For example, mark the bottom side facing the table. This mark will help you know which side of the paper is currently facing you. The side or color that starts facing the table will be the side or color that you will see when the bird is complete.

, Fold your paper in half, first on a horizontal fold. Then unfold and fold it again this time on a vertical fold.


Unfold your paper so it’s laying flat again. You should have two creases that look like a cross. If you marked the bottom, the marked side will be facing the table.

, Now fold the paper on a diagonal so that you create a diagonal crease. Unfold and repeat with the other side.


You will now four creases in your paper. Two diagonal ones, one vertical, and one horizontal. If you marked the bottom, the marked side will still be facing the table.

, Fold the bottom of the paper up away from you on the horizontal crease. The bottom marked side will now be up facing you.


Then rotate the paper so the two open flaps are facing you.

, You will now have a triangle with a flap overlaid onto a square portion of the paper. Fold the triangle in half bringing the flap over to the left.


You will already have crease lines so follow those and fold on the creases.
The inside flaps of your folds will be the none marked side of paper that was originally facing up.
Repeat this with the other side of paper until you have four triangular flaps. Your paper should look like a triangle with two flaps on each side.

, Take each of the two top flaps and fold inward to align the inner edges to the center crease.


You will now have a diamond shape made up of two flaps over the base flaps of your paper.
Fold the top flaps in half on a backward fold. Now take the flaps you just folded and fold each one backward, aligning the outer edges.
You will now have three layers of folds.

, Lift each flap up from the inside edge. Bring it over to align with the center crease.


As you bring this flap over to the center crease you will be creating another crease and expanding the outer edge of your top flap.
The outer edge of the top flaps will be aligned with the crease from your previous fold.
You will still have three layers.

, Now take the flat flaps which are the layer of paper on the table and fold each side in to align with the outer edges of your last fold.


Your paper will now resemble something like a stealth bomber paper airplane with four points at the bottom and one point at the top.

, Keep your previous folds intact as you lift up the center of your paper.


Pull back the two flaps that make up the tail to reveal a flat portion of paper below. Pull the flat portion of paper up through your two flaps.
Keep the folds you made for the tail intact by folding on the creases, but in the reverse direction. This will allow you to flatten the layers of folds.
You will now have a piece of paper that is standing up and looks like a shark fin. The outsides of the fins should be the same color and side that you've marked. The inside is the plain color.

, Take the edge of the shark fin and flatten it on top of the other layers of folds.


You will now have a triangular shape which fits in between the inner edges of your wings.
You will now have a total of six layers of folds if you look at the back of your bird.

, After the wings are flat you will see a diagonal crease line in the center of each wing. Keeping the center folds intact, pull out on the top layer of the wings in an upward and diagonal direction until the crease line becomes the outer edge.


The bottom edge of the wings should be flat. You will now have another layer on top with a diagonal bottom edge that meets at a corner.
When you pull the paper outward, press down on the center folds of your bird and let the portion you are pulling out flatten on the creases you’ve previously made.
You want to keep the center fold and the tail folds of the bird intact.

, Fold the wings in again so the bottom edge of this fold aligns with the bottom edge of your first layer of paper.


Make sure each wing is even and that all the bottom edges line up.

, Then make a small triangle fold on each side bringing the top corners of the wings inward.


Align the long edge the triangle fold to the crease you just created from your previous fold.

,


Fold the wings inward keeping the small triangle folds you just made intact.
You will have crease lines to use as guides as you fold the wings back over twice on each side. The first of these two folds is the same fold you made before folding the triangle corners.
A portion of your paper on your second fold will go over the center area. The bottom of the wings should align with the tail.

, Take the tip of your paper and fold it back so the point meets the horizontal bottom edge of the center layer of paper which is just above the tail.


You will now have four points at the bottom, two from the wings and two from the tail. The top of your paper will be flat with the tip pointing down toward you.

, Fold the portion you just folded down back up in half so that the tip extends just beyond the flat top part of your bird.


You have now created a zig-zag like fold with the part of the paper making up the head and beak.

, You now need to extend the wings on each side. Pull the wings out so that the bottom edge of each wing is flat and horizontal again.


This is tricky, but you need to keep the bottom edge of the bird’s head intact while unfolding the wings from beneath.
Flatten the paper out. If the area around the bird’s head looks smushed that’s fine.

, Fold the bird in half so the wings move up and the folds you made are exposed.


Make sure that both sides are as even as possible and the edges of the wings line up.

, Leave enough room so you can grab the body like you would for a paper airplane.


You want to fold the wings down so that the top edge of the bird is flat while the wings are pointing down.
Then, pull the wings up so that each is flat on the top. Do the same for the tail.
The outside of the bird will show the marked side that you originally had facing down toward the table.
You can now throw your bird like you would a paper airplane.

, You want two of the corners of the paper pointing up and down. If your paper has two colors, start the color you want the bird to be facing down toward the table, away from you. You will fold up in a way so that the outside of your bird is the side of paper currently facing down.


Fold the paper in half bringing the bottom corner to meet the top.
You will now have a triangle.

, Then open it back up.


After you fold the paper over, bring the flap back down to the table.

, Fold down the tip of your paper on a horizontal crease.


The tip of your paper should extend below the bottom edge that’s making the base of the triangle.
Fold the paper in half on a vertical crease. You will already have a crease line to make this fold easy from when you folded your triangle in half.
After you fold the paper in half, rotate the paper counter-clockwise 180-degrees so that it is vertical.

, Fold each flap down but leave enough room in the body of the paper bird to grab it.


You will see a triangular shape in the center of your paper which is the beak. Fold the wings down so that the top edge of the fold is even with the top of the beak.

, Holding the body of the bird, fold the wings up so that each wing sits horizontally.


You want your wings to be flat.

Line up the edges to have a sharp point on one corner. (If you turn it sideways, it looks like half a trapezoid.) This step is essential to create a square piece of paper out of the rectangular paper. If you already have the pre-made square origami paper, then you can scroll down to part 2: Folding; however, you still need to make a diagonal crease of the paper.
;
,


You do not have to use a pencil if you do not feel the need to use it. Creating a line makes it easier to but the paper into two pieces. Now, the paper should be a square.

,


You are also free to color whatever color you would like your elephant to be. Do not be limited to conventional colors of what an elephant is meant to be. Remember, this is a fun craft that children can also enjoy to do.

,


The folded lines should form an X when the paper is in the square position. The folded creases will serve as a guide for future steps.

,


The paper is in a diamond or rhombus position. This step is necessary since it positions the paper for you to make the next step’s fold.

,


This part will form the top of the head of your elephant.

,


The paper should form a triangle. To achieve this step, you can also make the flaps overlap. The main goal of this step is to create the three corners of the triangle as best you can. Make note that the bottom corner is going to be the trunk, so you should make sure that the trunk is long and gradually gets narrower.

,


Each flap looks like a triangle. This step is a little tricky, but you can accomplish this step by using the right side of the middle upside-down triangle formed by step 3 of part 2 as a guide to fold the inner flap first. Then, you can fold the outer flap by lining up with the folded inner flap. The outer and inner flaps should also form a straight horizontal line. This step is necessary to serve as a guide for the next fold.
This step’s folds create the ears of the elephant.

,


Remember to fold up to the horizontal line created by the last step.

,


This fold is like an accordion style fold.
This is going to be the trunk, so you can decide for yourself how long you want the trunk to be. You should make sure the folds are straight and are parallel to the fold in step 5 of part 2. This way the trunk is not going to be slanted, and you will have a trunk pointing straight down.

,


You should not fold too much in. Fold in until you see a folded line.
This step is going to shape the head of the elephant. This will imitate a rounder head and not a square and boxy head of an elephant.

,


This step is only necessary if you want to preserve the form of the elephant, and you do not want the folds to undo itself. To conserve on the amount of tape you want to use, you can use four pieces of tape and fold the top two corners and the sides of the trunk.

,


You have finished the origami—the folding—part of this craft, so the elephant is basically completed; however, you can continue on with the steps in order to create facial features of your elephant.

,


This is the basic facial features you can give your elephant. You can also add additional details to the face of your elephant. Some examples may include drawing the creases on the trunk or the pinks of the ears.

,


This is optional, and this can include other drawings or colors not involving the details of an elephant. You can add unrealistic features on the elephant to add more fun. Some examples may include drawing a bow or a mustache.

,


Get a new piece of paper and start over, or you could use a clear tape and tape the pieces together.
To prevent this, take your time and be patient.

,


Go over the correct folds and fold them by pinching the folds harder. A tip on how to fold harder is to use the tips of your fingernails and pinch while sliding your nails across the paper. This makes the folds stay flatter. This will also allow these folds to stand out against the other folds.
To prevent this, fold lightly at first then fold harder over the correct folds.

,


Color the areas again.
To prevent this, use a different type of coloring utensil. Colored pencils can be the most inconsistent utensil. Markers will make the coloring consistent, but it will be difficult to draw the facial and other personalized features at the end. Crayons may be the best to use since they are more consistent and will allow you to draw other features at the end.

You will learn how to make a kite-fold and an inside reverse-fold by completing this dragon., A good size is 7 centimeter (2.8 in) x 7 centimeter (2.8 in) paper but other sizes will work. If you're a beginner, consider to start with bigger paper (20cm by 20cm) because it is easier to work with.


If you only have a regular letter size piece of paper, make it square by folding the upper left corner diagonally down to meet the right side. Then take the upper right corner and fold it down to the left, connecting to the left corner where the first fold was made. There will be a bottom rectangle left over; fold this backwards and crease it well. Unfold the whole paper and cut (or tear if you creased it really well) off the rectangle. You should now have a square piece of paper., Fold the paper in half along the crease, then unfold. Fold the side corners so that they meet at the center line, then crease. This is called the kite-fold.

, Fold the right and left corners again into the center diagonal line, starting from the top corner this time. Keep these sides folded for now.

, Bring the edges created by the kite-fold into the center diagonal line in a valley-fold. Then again bring the outside corners of the top layer into the center diagonal line from the bottom corner.


There will now be what looks like pleats on each side of the diamond.

, Again make the first kite-fold again with the original side up and turn the paper over. Bring the side corners again to the center diagonal line from the top corner. Then again bring the free edge corners to the center diagonal line from the top corner and unfold.

, Fold along the opposite diagonal that does not already have a crease along it, forming a triangle, and unfold.

, Pinch the two corners at which you have just made the diagonal by pushing the edges up towards you. Then bring your hands together, folding along the kite-folds you made earlier. The first kite-fold crease should go down on each side, the second up and the third down. The corners that you are pinching should be sticking up.


It will look like a diamond with two pieces sticking up in the middle on each side.

, Push the two flaps that are sticking up down along to the top corner. It will now look like an arrowhead, or like a kite with a point sticking out the top of it.

, Rotate the origami dragon so that the corners point right and left. The flaps that you just pushed down should be facing towards the right. Then turn the origami dragon upside down, keeping it pointing in the same direction.

, Bring the bottom corner to the top corner along the centerline to fold the diamond in half lengthwise. It will now look like a wide and short triangle.

, Apply the inside reverse fold to bring the left corner up between the two edges. You will have to slightly spread apart the top and bottom layers to pull the left corner up inside the two layers.


It should now have a piece sticking up on the left side of the paper while the middle and right side of the triangle are horizontal.

, Bring the corner down in between the two layers of the neck to create the head. The head should be a bit less that half the length of the neck. It will now look like a head with a pointy beak on the end.

, Bring the left corner down to the right about halfway down the length of the head. This should be along a horizontal line so the corner point directly to the right. Then bring the corner from the right diagonally downward to the left to create the lower jaw.


There will now be a short piece hanging down, creating the look of a jaw.

, Fold the flap in the middle of the dragon down from the right top corner to the bottom edge. Do the same in reverse on the opposite side to create the wings.


It will look like a swimming animal now because it will look like it has flippers.

, Open the wings to make the dragon look like it is flying and the dragon is finished.

Admire your hard work!",How to Make an Origami Dog," Origami paper already comes in the shape of a square, but you can make your own square with regular paper. To create a square, take a piece of paper and fold the top corner over to the opposite side of the paper, until the top edge of the paper is in line with the side of the paper. This will create a triangle. Then, cut around the triangle shape and open it up. You should have a square. make a square from normal letter-sized paper


When folding the top corner, you should be creating a diagonal at the top of the paper. You don't want to fold the top corner over to the other top corner as this will just create a rectangle.
You can use any color for this project -- choose a color that you want for your dog.;
, If your paper doesn't already have a crease down the diagonal you'll need to create one. Take the top, left corner and meet it with the bottom, right corner, lining up both sides of the triangle. Then, create a crease along the diagonal of the triangle. Unfold your paper back into the square and repeat on the opposite side.


Once you unfold your paper back into the square you should have two diagonals across your square, intersecting in the middle.

, Flip your square around until it is in a diamond shape, with a top and bottom point and two side points. Then, fold the bottom point upwards, until it reaches the middle crease in your diamond., After you have created the first fold, turn your diamond to the left, so that you have another bottom point, and fold that point into the middle crease. Then, turn it to the left again and fold that point inwards. Once you get to the last point, don't fold it. Flip your shape over., Once you have flipped your shape over, position it so that the square of the shape is on the left and the triangle with the highest point is pointing towards the right. Then, fold the bottom half of your square over until it reaches the middle crease in your shape. Repeat on the other side, making sure you don't fold the flaps that pop up.


Basically, once you are done folding, your shape should be very long horizontally, and you should have a diamond shape at the left side of your shape, with a much smaller diamond shape at the right side.
If you folded your flaps on this fold, your diamond shape would not be complete. As you fold the sides of your square over, they should each have a triangle attached to them (on the top fold the triangle points upwards and on the bottom fold the triangle points downwards). Allow these triangles to flap up with fold. Don't crease them into the fold.

, Turn your shape to the left, so that the largest diamond is on top and the smallest diamond is pointing towards you. Now, above your largest diamond you should see two little triangles, one on the right and one on the left. These triangles are right triangles, with their 90 degree angle as the top corners of the shape. Open up the top right triangle until it's top left point meets the edge of your shape.Fold along the crease once you have opened up your triangle. Essentially, as you fold your triangle over to create a new shape, the top side of your triangle that was in line with the top edge of your bigger shape, will line up with the left and right side of your shape. Once it has lined up, you can create a crease.

, Take your top left triangle and open it up. Move the top right point of the triangle towards the edge of your shape and fold along the crease. The top right side of your triangle should line up with the left side of your shape. Create the crease in your folds once everything is lined up.


When you look at your shape once you have made your folds, you should see a straight top edge, with two small points sticking out of the sides. Then, underneath those two points you should see your larger diamond with two larger points sticking out to the sides. Then, underneath that you should see two triangles, with their bases along the sides of your shape. Finally, underneath those you should see a smaller diamond. If you don't have this shape quite right, you might consider going back a few steps and redoing your folds.

, Take the right side of your large diamond and begin to pull it upwards by the outer point. The diamond creates a triangle and on that triangle you should see one crease down the middle and one on the left side. Pull your triangle up so that the crease on the left side folds on top of your diamond instead of underneath it. Line up that crease exactly where it was before, except now it will be on top of your shape instead of underneath the fold., Take the left side of your diamond and pull it upwards. You should see the same creases, one down the middle of the triangle and one on the right side. Fold your triangle in the same way, so that the crease on the right side is now on top of your diamond instead of underneath it.


Once you have done this step, you'll still have somewhat of a large diamond shape, but the top point is inverted into a V instead of a point. Then above the diamond shape you should see two small squares, one on the right and one on the left.

, The two squares that were mentioned in the previous step will now be folded over into triangles, or a long trapezoid. Take the top edge of your shape, and fold it over, until the outer sides of the squares meet, to create one long, upside down trapezoid.

, Turn your shape over so that you see a long rectangle with a triangle pointing downwards at the bottom. At the top of your shape you should see a triangle pointing downwards. Flip that triangle upwards so that the top point is pointing up instead of down. After you have done this you should still have your long rectangle with the bottom triangle pointing downwards (almost like a pencil). You should also see two triangles coming out of the sides of the rectangle, creating a wing look. Then, you'll see your top triangle you just created.

, Take the outer point of your right wing and fold it over so that it meets the left point of your triangle wing. As you fold it over, allow the rest of the shape to follow with it, and create a crease along that long fold. Then, unfold that fold.


As you fold it over, you want the two sides of your wing, or your triangle to line up. If you looked at just that part of your shape it would create a rectangle.

, Take the outer point of your left wing and fold it over to the top right point of your wing. Line the sides up and create a crease along the fold. Then, unfold it.

, This time, you're going to fold the wings back over, but you'll need to do it at the same time. This will cause your pencil to come together, creating the shape of the front of an airplane. Then, fold your airplane over to the right side so that the bottom of it is parallel to a flat surface.

, After you have folded it to the side, fold your airplane under, at the top part of the airplane. After you have folded it under, it should be upside down, behind your shape. Then, fold your front shape over so that the right point of the triangle at the top of your shape meets the left point. Create a crease at the fold., Looking at your airplane as it is upside down, and ignoring the rest of your shape, you should see three triangles in it. Take the middle triangle (it should be pointing upwards while the others are pointing down) and fold it so that the base of the triangle meets the rest of your shape. Flip your shape over and repeat on the opposite side.


Essentially, take the bottom right corner of your triangle and bring it towards the top point of your shape. You won't be able to reach the top point, but you should be about an inch off, depending on the size of square you began with.

, Flip your shape back over so that your airplane is on the right side of your shape and is pointing upwards. Then, take the middle triangle on your airplane, and fold it so that the middle (height) of the triangle comes in line with the top of your airplane. Flip your shape over and do the same thing on the other side -- have the middle of the middle triangle line up with the top of your airplane., After you have made all of your folds, turn your shape so that it looks like a dog. The folds you just created made the dog's head, with the very front of your airplane creating the dog's snout. Then, the rest of your shape should form the dog's legs. You should have one shape directly underneath your dog's head that forms his front legs, and then the second shape forms his back legs and tails.

Open the wings by pulling on the chest and tail.",How to Make an Origami Dragon2," You should know how to fold the origami bird base and origami flapping bird before trying this method.

, A good size is 7 centimeter (2.8 in) x 7 centimeter (2.8 in) paper but other sizes will work. If you are a beginner it is best to start with bigger paper (20cm by 20cm) because it is easier to work with. If you only have a regular letter size piece of paper, make it square by folding the left corner diagonally down to the right side. Then take the upper right corner and fold it down to the left, connecting to the left corner where the first fold was made. There will be a bottom rectangle left over; fold this backwards and crease it well. Unfold the whole paper and cut (or tear if you creased it really well) off the rectangle. You will now have a square piece of paper.

, You should do each of these individually, unfolding before the next fold. Be careful and exact with your folds, making sure the creases are deep and the corners are sharp.

, Fold the top corner of the paper down to the bottom, bringing the right and left corners to the bottom at the same time. Bring the right and left corners to the bottom by folding the paper in between the bottom and top layers, or squash folding it. It should now look like a square diamond.


If you are using colored paper, the colored side should be on the outside at this point. Start with the colored side down when making the square base to do this.

, Fold the top layers of both sides to the center and then fold the top triangle down. Unfold these three folds. Do a petal fold by lifting the top layer from the bottom corner all the way up, folding in the sides at the same time along the crease to create a diamond. Turn the paper over and do the same thing on the opposite side: fold along the sides to the center and the top triangle down, unfold these folds, lift up the top layer all the way to the top and fold in along the sides to create a diamond. This is the bird base.


While completing the bird base and bringing the bottom corner to the top corner the paper will look a bit like an open flower.

, This makes the head and tail. It will now look very pointy, with a point on the left that will be the head, a point in the middle that will become the wings and a point on the right that will become the tail.


To make the head, lift the left side flap slightly and pull the top corner of the paper down in between the back and top layers. Bring it so that it is angled slightly down (so the head will eventually be pointing diagonally up) and crease the fold.
To make the tail, lift the right side flap slightly and pull the top right corner down in between the back and top layers. Crease it where it is horizontal when you look at it so that it will extend straight out.

, Rotate the paper 180 degrees. You want the unfolded point of the diamond pointing to the top so that you can add detail and continue with your folding. Now the head will point up on the left side.

, You can add a jaw and horn and/or thin the neck to add detail to the head and make it more dragon-like.


To add a jaw, fold the tip of the head down to the lower corner on that side and unfold. Hold the neck with one hand and push the head against the neck with your other hand. The neck should fold inwards so that the head folds slightly over the neck, creating a jaw.
To add a horn, fold the tip of the head down to the bottom point of the jaw and unfold. Open the head by spreading the top layer from the bottom layer so you can fold this small piece backwards. This will create a horn on the top of the dragonhead.
To thin the neck, fold in both sides. Take small parts of the bottom edges of the neck and fold them in between the layers. Do this in about three different pieces to trim the fat on the neck and make it slimmer.

, Fold to make it look thinner and/or spikier. It's up to you. Be creative!


To put spikes in the tail, open the layers of the tail and fold back the tip upwards wherever you wish your spike to be. Then fold most of the rest of the tail back out, leaving a small crimp in the tail. You can do this near the tip or in the middle of both. You can do a few crimps as well. Reclose the tail.
To thin the tail, open the layers and fold the bottom edges inwards. This can again be done in multiple locations to create a thin, whippy-looking tail.

, Starting with the left wing (with head facing to the left), fold the top layer of the top corner down to the bottom corner between the head and tail and unfold. Open the left flap of the wing and then fold down the entire wing and tuck inside the loose flap, closing down over the wing. Then fold the loose flap to the left and open the wing by bringing the bottom corner to the top again. Fold the right and left corners to the inside and unfold. Push in the right side (should be colored) of the wing so that it pops in. Re-crease the left side by bringing the left corner to the colored side. Keep a thumb over the right side while you do so to prevent it from popping out again. Repeat with the right wing.

, Pull gently on the chest and tail of the dragon to make the wings pump as if it is flying.

Choose your paper.,
Cut strips from the paper.,
Consider making a ""paper doll chain.""",How to Make a Paper Chain1," The color and thickness will depend on why you're making the paper chain. Consider picking colored paper that matches the theme of an upcoming holiday: red and green for Christmas; white and blue for winter; orange, black, and purple for Halloween; pinks, blues, yellows, and other pastels for Easter. You can buy colored construction paper, or you can color the paper yourself.If there is no holiday coming up, feel free to make your paper chain plain white – or to use a wild mix of colors. Work out a pattern of alternating colors in complement or contrast.
Avoid using thick paper that will not bend easily. Most construction paper should be okay, but you don't want to get much thicker. Remember: you want your paper not only to bend, but to stay bent!
Try using special seasonal paper. For Christmas, for instance, use wrapping paper.;
, Use a ruler and a pair of scissors to cut out a series of long, rectangular strips. Each strip of paper makes one ""link"" in the chain, so plan accordingly. Each new strip should be equal in dimensions to each of the other strips. If you're cutting from a sheet of standard printer paper, try strips that are 1"" wide by 8.5"" long. This way, one piece of paper will make 11 even strips.


Try using a rotary cutter for large volumes of paper. This tool may be quicker than scissors.
The thicker and shorter your strips are, the less margin for error you'll have. When in doubt, make your strips thinner rather than wider.

, This project is similar in scope and style to the standard paper chain. However, the doll chain involves cutting out a series of paper ""people,"" each connected by the hands.You will need all of the same materials, and it shouldn't take much longer – so research your options and decide what you're looking for."

,

Cut out the design on one side of your bag with a utility knife.",How to Make Luminaries,"


Choose lunch-sized brown paper bags that are much like the bags used traditionally in Mexico. Brown paper bags block much of the light, except for what shines through the cut-out areas of the bag.
Pick colored gift sacks that are made of thick paper or paper that is not transparent. Colored bags fit into a specific décor or can be used for color-themed events, such as proms or weddings.;
,


Choose a design for the front of your bag. A design that is too large for the size of your bag may be reduced on a copy machine in order to fit properly.
Ensure that your pattern does not allow too much open space on the front of your bag. Too much open space can decrease the stability of your bag and allow it to crumple.
Create a design that is easy to cut out of the bag. You will be cutting out patterns on several bags. A simple design is much easier and quicker to cut out than an intricate or complicated design.
Transfer your design to cardboard or cardstock so you can use it as a pattern on your bags.

, Tissue paper filters the light and can make it appear a different color.

, There are several light sources that provide adequate light for a luminary.


Put approximately 1 lb. (453 g) of sand in the bottom of your luminary bag to weigh it down. If sand is not available, substitute with rocks or other heavy objects.
Set a tea light candle into the sand. Push it gently into the sand so it sits securely in the bag.
Place a battery-powered tea light into the bag's sand.
Use a flashlight as a light source in your luminaries. Attempt to set it upright so it provides even light throughout the bag
Set a lit glow stick in the bag for light.

,, Light the luminaries 10 to 15 minutes before visitors arrive if you're planning to use them as a welcome to a party.

, Place a piece of cardboard, a slab of wood or a quilter's mat underneath one layer of your bag when you cut out the design. Cutting through both sides of your luminary bag will result in a bag that puts off less light through your pattern.

Some companies sell paper specifically for the purpose of making paper chains, with pretty designs such as children in olden day clothing, butterflies and bees, stripes or dots, etc—if you want pre-printed paper, check the craft store or online.


Choose paper that is strong and not flimsy. Construction paper is a good choice. More ideas are provided in Tips below.
Flimsy paper can be glued to thin card before making strips, to improve its strength.;
, Decide how large you want the rings to be. They can be any size you can manage but the standard size tends to be strips that are 2.5cm/1 inch wide and 20cm/8 inches long.


Cut out as many as you need; the more you have, the longer the chain will be.

, This creates a circle. Keep the circle shape in place with either a staple, tape or glue.

, Again, join the ends of the strip together with glue, tape, or staples.

, See the next section for turning the paper ring chains into decorations.

, As per the last step of Part 1, make a chain. Make several more in various difference colors. When they're made, join them all together for one really long chain. Get a helper to help you pin the long chain up against the wall, across the room, over a pergola, etc.


For an interesting effect, braid the differently colored chains. This will give them bulk and added interest.







, Paper chains can be stuck or pinned around household areas to highlight them or frame them. For example, pin a paper chain around your entrance door or around windows.


Frame your desktop computer with paper chains. This can be fun to jazz up a boring desk area.







, Use a wreath base. Wrap the paper ring chains around the wreath base without squashing them too much. Add a hanger and it's ready to hang on display.

, Trail paper chains across a paper for a party effect. Try to use colors that match the theme of the party or the season. For example, use red, white and blue for a July 4th party, green chains for a St. Patrick's Day party and red and green chains for the holiday season.

, If you're having an outdoor party, make the garden more interesting by covering items with paper chains. Drape the chains along fences, over sculptures and wherever you think the garden looks a little drab. You can also hang chains from tree to tree, from porch to fence, etc.


If it's winter, wrap paper ring chains around your snowman instead of a scarf. This will only last for the party though, as the chain will soak up the moisture fairly quickly and disintegrate.

, Make smaller versions to wear as necklaces and bracelets. Choose pretty patterned paper for a unique item or match plain paper color to your outfit for a complementary look.

, These chains can be used in place of tinsel and can be made in the color that complements your tree the best.


You can also make Advent paper chains; mark the date on each chain in consecutive order. The day that arrives must be torn away from the rest of the chain, until you reach the final date.

Make the first ""link."",
Add a second link.,
Keep adding links.,
Loop the chain (Optional).",How to Make a Paper Chain2," All you need to do is tape, glue, or staple the far ends of one paper strip together into a ring. Try to match up the sides evenly. Tape and staples will make for a quick process, but glue will take much longer because it needs to dry.If you are using glue, hold the two ends of paper together until the glue dries. Make sure that the edges of the paper do not slip askew.
You should not need more than one staple or one small square of tape to seal each loop. Make sure that the link is sturdy and will not fall apart.

, Once you have one sturdy ring, thread another strip of paper through the center of the loop. Now, join the ends of this second strip together with tape, staples, etc. The wide, flat edges of the two links should line up, but the loops themselves should sit at a rough 90 degree angle – like a chain!, Continue in the same pattern until your chain is as long as you want it. In theory, there is no limit to the length of paper chain that you can build, as long as you have enough paper, tape, and time. If you want to hang the chain somewhere, measure the length against the space periodically to check if it's long enough yet.

, You can choose to leave the chain long and straight, with a loop at each end, or you can link the ends together with a single strip of paper. To do this: wait until you have an odd number of links in the chain, then loop and seal one final strip of paper through both of the end-links at once. Now, you should have a large ring of paper loops.If you try to seal a chain that already has an even number of links, the orientation of the loops won't match up.

Hang your paper chain from the walls or ceiling.,
Decorate for a holiday.,
Make a ""wreath."",
Use the chain as a paper necklace.",How to Make a Paper Chain3," If you leave the chain long, you can string it through a space to add a festive flair. Hang the chain a little bit loose, so that it dips low in the center. Try crossing chains over one another, alternating colors, or even linking long chains together to make a super-chain.


If you're having a party, use a waist- or chest-level paper chain to block off a ""private area"" like a staircase, a hallway, or a section of backyard. The paper may not hold up to force, but it will serve as a gentle deterrent to wayward guests.

, You can string up paper chains for a birthday, a party, or a major holiday. Match the colors of the chains to the theme of the party, or to the colors usually associated with that holiday. Get creative!, If winter or Christmas is coming up, try making a faux-wreath using one or more paper chains. For the basic design: use green construction paper, then loop the finished chain into one large circle. You can add concentric small green circles to fill out the ""wreath."" For added effect, make a ""bow"" from red paper or string, and tie it to the front of the wreath.


Hang the wreath on your door, your wall, your fence, your tree. The paper wreath should be light, and easy to attach with tape or a hook.

, Tie a series of (preferably small) loops together into a large loop that fits around your neck. For best effect, make the individual links rather small: not much more than half an inch wide and two inches long. One idea: string an array of bright, colorful loops together into a paper ""lei"" – a traditional Hawaiian flower necklace. Try looping a long chain of tight golden links into a ""gold chain"" – perhaps even two chains!

, Confetti can easily spread around and make a mess. Lay out a cover over your work area, like newspaper, a drop cloth, or butcher paper, to catch any errant confetti.

Once you've finishing making your balloons, roll up your cover so the confetti is trapped inside it, then dump the confetti in a container for later or in the trash.

, Confetti is relatively inexpensive, but you can still save some money and have fun doing it by turning confetti making into a craft. Use suitable paper, like colored construction paper, then:

Use scissors to cut long, narrow strips in the paper. Your strips should be roughly a ¼"" (.64 cm) thick.
From one end of the strip, begin cutting ¼"" (.64 cm) squares free from the strip. Do this until you have enough confetti.

, For personalized confetti, you may want to cut tissue paper into small (no larger than a quarter) thematically appropriate shapes. This can be used in place of store bought confetti, or mixed in with it. For example:Cut miniature hearts in red colored tissue paper to create Valentine's Day themed confetti.
Use green tissue paper to cut out shamrock shapes for St. Patrick's Day celebrations.
Red and green tissue paper cut into small circles work well for Christmastime holiday events.
Cut small scale flowers in bright, vibrant colors to create a springtime vibe in your balloons., The easiest way to do this is with a funnel or a medium thickness tube. Put your funnel or tube in the mouth of the balloon, and pour confetti through the funnel and into the balloon.

Larger tissue paper designs can be rolled up and pushed through the funnel/tube. Do this for as many balloons as you desire., If you don't have a funnel or tube handy, you can simply stretch the mouth of the balloon open to fit your confetti. However, this may be easiest to do with an extra set of hands., In some cases, your confetti may clog your funnel, tube, or even the neck of the balloon. If this happens, use a narrow item, like a chopstick or an unsharpened pencil, to push the confetti through., Now that confetti is inside the balloons, you can fill them with helium or air. When the balloon is full, tie off the end in a simple knot. With another simple knot, attach a ribbon or string to the tied off end of the balloon.

Helium is necessary if you want your balloons to float. Helium tanks can be found at party stores and many general retailers, like Target and Walmart."

Insert LEDs into your confetti balloons.,
Design faces on confetti balloons.,
Use flat sequins to coat the inside of balloons.",How to Fill Balloons with Confetti2," Small, lightweight, battery powered LED lights are available at most craft stores and general retailers. Insert these into the balloons. Turn them on right before inflating the balloon to prolong the battery life of the LEDs.Avoid using incandescent or heat generating lights for this variation. The heat these lights generate can cause balloons to pop or the confetti to catch fire.

, This can be an especially fun activity with young children. Use markers to draw a mouth and eyes on your inflated, confetti filled balloons. You can even attach ribbon or string to the top of the balloon with tape to create hair for your balloon buddy.

In some cases, glue can have a negative reaction with balloons, causing them to weaken or pop. For this reason, tape is recommended for attaching accents, like string for hair, to balloon buddies.

, Rounded sequins can create a nice effect in your balloons, but because of their shape, they don't easily stick to its inside. Insert flat sequins as you would normally and shake the balloon to evenly coat its inside with sequins.Using shiny, silver sequins in this fashion can give your balloons the appearance of disco ball, which is perfect for retro themed parties.

Decorate for parties with your balloons.,
Dress up tables with balloons.,
Play games with the balloons.",How to Fill Balloons with Confetti3," Balloons are a common party decoration. However, your confetti filled balloons will be all the more alluring because of the interesting designs and colorful decorative bits inside. To display the balloons, you might:

Hang balloons from various fixtures and furniture, like sills, floor lamps, chairs, and so on.
Allow helium balloons to float up to picturesque parts of the ceiling. For example, you might float clusters of balloons into the corners of your party room.
Tie helium filled balloon strings to some kind of weight, like a doorstop, a rock, and so on. Place the balloons around your party area as decorations.

, If you're decorating for a more formal party, you may have centerpieces on tables. These are often heavy enough to attach some balloons to, no problem. You can also tape balloons along the edges of tables or to the table corners to add a dash of style.

Oftentimes, helium filled balloons can be tied to the underside of the table and, if the string is long enough, floated out into the open so that balloons aerially border the table.

, Keep away is a popular game played with balloons. A fun version of this game involves players taking turns hitting a balloon up into the air, with each player trying to keep the balloon from hitting the ground. These games work best when played with air filled balloons.The confetti inside the balloons should jostle around every time the balloon is touched by a player. This can make the game more challenging and visually appealing.
You may also be able to use helium balloons that have started to lose their buoyancy to play these games.

",How to Fold a Paper Box," You can use origami paper or fold any piece of paper diagonally from the corner to the opposite edge and trim off the excess. It is important that the paper is square since you are creating a box.;
, Crease the fold with your finger then open the piece of paper.








, Use your finger to crease the fold, then open the paper again. You should now have two creases that intersect at the center of the square.







, Bring each corner to the center, so that the points are all touching. Crease the folds with your finger. Rotate the paper so it sits squarely in front of you, but don't unfold it this time.







, Crease the edges of both folds to secure them.








, Unfold the halfway folds and the triangles beneath those folds. Leave the side triangles folded in.








, Fold over the bottom of the still folded triangles. Crease the bottom edge. You should have what looks like a necktie with two points.








, For the purposes of the guide, the diamond furthest away from you formed by the ""necktie"" folds will be the ""head"" and the diamond closest to you will be the ""foot."" Match the bottom tip of the foot diamond to the bottom of the head diamond. Then, match the top tip of the foot diamond to the top of the foot diamond. Crease along the long sides to solidify the folds.








, Pull up the flaps along the long side to create the side walls of the box.








, As you lift the head wall flap, the creases from previous folds should form two triangle shaped flaps that you will want to fold inwards. Be sure these triangles are folded inwards before proceeding. The head wall will fold over these triangle corners and the top triangle of the head wall will fit neatly into the bottom of the box where you will want to crease it snugly against the sides to keep the box together. After creasing, you should see a triangle on the bottom of the box.








, Try to make sure the folds are clean and not crinkly.

Shape and trim the pom pom.",How to Make Scrap Fabric Pom Poms1," Use a pen and a cup, lid, or compass to trace a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) circle onto a sheet of cardboard. Trace a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) circle inside it, right in the center. Cut both circles out and discard the smaller one so that you have a doughnut shape. Trace the doughnut onto another sheet of cardboard, and cut it out as well. How big you make your pom pom maker is up to you.For a smaller pom pom, make the larger circle 2½ inches (6.35 centimeters) wide and the smaller circle 1 to 1½ inches (2.54 to 3.81 centimeters) wide.;
, You will need around twelve 20 to 30-inch (50.8 to 76.2-centimeter) strips, each about ¾-inch (1.91-centimeter) wide.You can use all the same type and color of fabric for your pom pom, of you can mix-and-match different colors, patterns, and textures. You can also include bits of ribbon and Ric-Rac.You can use less fabric if you want a smaller or thinner pom pom.
You can make the strips thinner, ie: ½-inch (1.27-centimeters)., Hold the two cardboard doughnuts together so that the edges match up. Place the end of your fabric scrap against the doughnut so that it touches the outside edge. Pull the longer end of the fabric scrap through the middle of the doughnut.

You will be treating both doughnuts as one during the wrapping portion of this method.

, When you reach the end of one fabric scrap, pick up another one, overlap it by about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) and continue wrapping until the inner circle is at least ⅔ of the way full. The more layers of fabric you add, the smaller the inner circle will be, which means a fluffier pom pom.Go around your doughnut a few times. One layer of fabric won't give you a very fluffy pom pom.
If you are having trouble getting the fabric scraps through the center hole, use a crochet hook to help you pull them through., Try to keep the doughnut on the table as you cut around it. This will help keep everything together., Pull the two cardboard doughnuts apart enough so that you can see the middle of your wrapped fabric. Slide a fabric scrap between them, and tie it into a tight double-knot. This will hold your pom pom together.You can also use a piece of yarn, string, or twine., You may have to cut a slit into the cardboard in order to pull it off, especially if your pom pom is very thick. Don't worry if the pom pom looks limp or tattered at this point. You will fix that in the next step., Use you fingers to gently fluff up the fabric pom pom. How full it turns out depends on the type of fabric you used and how many times you wrapped around the cardboard doughnut. If there are any bits and pieces of fabric sticking out of your pom pom, you can trim them down until they are even.

Trim down the fabric scrap you used to tie the pom pom together, or tie it into a loop so that you can hang the pom pom."

Continue pinching and gluing fabric flowers to the felt circle.,
Consider making a round pom pom.",How to Make Scrap Fabric Pom Poms2," This will be the base of your pom pom.You won't see it in the end, but it would be a good idea to use a color that closely matches your fabric. If you don't have any felt on hand, you can also use thin cardboard or thick, stick fabric.

Your pom pom will be a little bigger than your felt circle. If you want a different-sized pom pom, then adjust the circle accordingly.
The circle doesn't have to be perfect, but try to make it as even as possible.

, You will need 20 to 30 circles to make a dome-shaped pom pom.If you want a full, round pom pom, you will need 40 to 60 circles. You can use all one type of fabric, or experiment with different colors, patterns, and textures.Save time by stacking several pieces of fabric together. This way, you won't have to cut or trace as much. You should be able to cut through 3 to 5 layers of fabric at once., If you are using different types of fabric, it might be a good idea to keep them organized in separate stacks., Make sure that you are pinching from the wrong side of the fabric so that the right side is on the inside of the cone-flower. This way, the right side will be visible on the finished pom pom., Shift your fingers to reveal the pointed top of the cone-flower. Use a hot glue gun to make a small drop of glue on the tip.Because of how close you are working to you fingers, it would be a good idea to use a low-temp hot glue gun rather than a high-temp one.

, Make sure that the cone is in the middle of the felt circle and standing straight up.Work quickly so that the glue does not set., Work your way in tight rings around the first flower that you glued. The closer together you glue the cones, the fuller your pom pom will be. You should be able to fit 20 to 30 cone-shaped flowers on one side of the felt.Try to point the cone-flowers sideways as you get closer to the edges.

, Your pom pom is done once the felt circle is filled. It will be dome-shaped. If you want a round pom pom, simply flip the pom pom over and continue scrunching and gluing fabric circles to the other side of the felt circle.

Glue down a loop of ribbon before you add your last cone-flower. This way, you can hang your pom pom."

Repeat the process with the rest of the shapes.,
Allow the glue to dry before hanging your garland.",How to Make Paper Garland2," The best paper to use for this is scrapbooking paper or cardstock. Construction paper or origami paper will work too, but your garland won't be as durable.


Try getting two to three different colors or shades. For example, you could have a light blue, a medium blue, and a dark blue.Try getting some patterned paper. For example, half of your shapes can be bright blue, and the other half of your shapes can be white with bright green polka-dots or stripes.

, Scrapbooking punches work just like regular hole punches, except that they come in many different shapes and sizes. They come in circles, hearts, squares, stars, and even snowflakes. You can buy scrapbooking punches in the scrapbook section of an arts and crafts store. You can also find them online.


You can get just one scrapbooking punch and make all of your shapes the same size.
You can also get two differently sized punches. For example, you can get a 1.5 inch (3.81 centimeters) circle punch and a 3.5 inch (8.89 centimeters) circle punch. This will give your garland some variety.If you can't find a scrapbooking punch, you can cut circles out using a circle cutter., If your paper is thin enough, you might be able to punch two to three sheets at a time. Cardstock, however, should be punched one sheet at a time. If you try to punch too much paper at one time, you may dull your puncher and get fuzzy edges on your shapes.

, If you used different sizes and prints, try alternating them. You can alternate them randomly or in a specific pattern.

, Make sure that it goes from one side of the shape to the other.

, Make sure that you leave a 12 inch (30.48 centimeters) long tail on the end of your string; this way, you will be able to hang your garland.


Consider pressing a matching shape on top of the first one, sandwiching the twine in between. This way, you won't see the glue/twine from the other side., They can be as far apart or as close together as you want. Make sure that you have about 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) of blank space at the end of your garland, or you won't be able to hang it up later.

If the garland is for a baby shower, you can use pink/blue paper and white paper with pink/blue polka-dots.
If the garland is for a party with an ocean theme, consider using light blue, medium blue, and dark blue colored papers.

, If your paper is a design on it, make sure that you are folding with the design part out. The blank/white part should be on the inside.

, With the paper still folded, cut it straight down the middle. You will end up with twice as many folded papers.

, The point of the triangle should be on the open part of the paper. The flat part of the triangle should be on the fold. If you were to open up your paper, you would end up with a diamond shape.

, This will be your blank space. You will not be putting any paper on these ends. This is so that you can hang your garland easier.

, Run a glue stick along the edges and down the center fold. You can also draw a squiggle of glue down the middle of the triangle.

, Run your fist across the paper to smooth it down and seal it.

, You can have them as close together or as far apart as you want. Be sure to leave at least a few inches/centimeters of space between the triangles so that the garland will hang nicely.

, You can cut letters out of colorful paper and glue them down using a glue stick. You can also paint the letters on using a stencil and some acrylic paint."

, Stop about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) away from the top fold. Try to keep the space between each slit the same.

, Keep the edges aligned. You should end up with something that looks like a giant pair of whiskers.

, Take your giant whiskers and start rolling the center un-cut part into a tight tube. This will make it easier to twist later.

, You are only twisting those 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) of un-cut paper. Keep twisting until you have a 2 inch (5.08 centimeters) long rope. Leave the tassels/whiskers un-twisted.

Fold the triangle back up, a half centimeter below the previous fold.",How to Make a Turtle out of a Dollar Bill," The more crisp the bill, the easier it will be to make clean folds. Make sure there aren’t any existing creases, because you’ll be creating new creases that will guide you throughout the folding of the turtle.


If you can’t find a crisp $1 bill, try looking for a $10 or $20 bill.
Work on a flat surface like a desk or workbench so you can press hard on the folds.;
, Fold the dollar bill in half, lining the top of the bill with the very bottom of the bill. The top and bottom edges should not overlap or be folded on an angle.


If you unfolded the bill, there would be a line running horizontally through the middle of the bill.

, Fold it in half, so the left edge lines up with the right edge of the bill. Press down with your fingernail to flatten out the bill.


The bill should now be exactly a quarter of the size that it was when you started.

, This should reveal two creases forming a perpendicular cross in the middle of the bill. This also splits your bill into 4 equally sized quadrants.


The cross should meet right in the middle of George Washington’s cheek.

, The right hand side of the bill should align with the center crease. This also should leave George Washington’s face half covered by the right side of your bill.

, This should form a point where you folded both sides and resemble an upside down pyramid.


Make sure the flat end of the pyramid lines up, so you’re getting a perfectly diagonal crease.

, Unfold the bill so it’s flat, and repeat the steps, this time using the top corners of the bill. Take the top left hand corner of the bill and bring it down, creating a 90 degree angle. Repeat with the right hand corner.

, At this point, you should have two X shapes formed by the creases you just made. Fold the X on both sides so that each one has a crease running down the middle. Take the left edge of your bill and fold it horizontally so it lines up with the center crease, to get a perfect vertical crease down the center of your X.


This is the last crease that you need to make before you start folding your bill into a turtle.

, You should now see a cross in the middle of the bill, two creases on each side that form an X, and a vertical crease in each X. The middle of your bill should look like a diamond where the left and right X meet.


Creating creases may seem unnecessary, but it makes it easier to fold your turtle.

, When you pinch the top and bottom of the X it should form a triangular flap on the left hand side. If you folded your creases accurately, it should be a perfect triangle and the bottom of the triangle should run in a straight line.
If it doesn’t look like a triangle, unfold it and try it again.
Your edges should all line up, except for the edge near the center crease of the bill which should overlap the center crease by around a centimeter.

, Fold the excess flap that hangs over the center crease of your turtle, towards the left point of its shell. This will create a long rectangular fold on the left hand side of the middle crease.

, Pinch the right hand X and repeat the steps so you have a triangle of exactly the same size on the right side of your bill. Fold back the excess flap on the right hand side. Your bill should now look like a diamond.


If you folded your bill face up, you should see the pyramids in your right triangle and the bald eagle in your left triangle.

, This will form the shell of the turtle. If you flip your bill over, it should look like a hexagon. You’ve just completed your turtle’s shell.


On the top of the turtle’s shell you should see “In God We Trust.”

, This will form the turtle's feet. You will have four total center flaps to fold on a 60 - 90 degree angle.


You can change the angle in which these flaps are folded, just keep in mind they will change the appearance of your turtle’s feet.

, You should now have a hexagon shell and four feet from the folds you just made. If you’ve done everything right, your turtle should be able to stand on the feet you folded.

, This will form the turtle’s head. When you flip your turtle over and it will look like an upside down triangle at the top of your hexagon.


The more you fold the top in, the larger you can make your turtle’s head.

, This will give the appearance of your turtle head coming out its shell. You can repeat the process with the bottom of your turtle to create a tail, but loosen the fold and make it smaller so it doesn’t look like your turtle has two heads.

Cut a straight line from end to end on a toilet paper roll.,
Check the size of the confetti pusher and assemble it.,
Decorate your uncut roll.,
Load your confetti into the uncut roll.,
Launch your confetti.",How to Make Confetti Poppers2," Use scissors to cut a straight line from end to end on one of your toilet paper rolls. Then use hot glue to attach a sturdy paper straw or wooden dowel to the center of your bottle cap. Allow the glue to dry.

, Open your slit toilet paper roll and position the lid so it is ¾ of the way to one end of the roll, with the straw/dowel exiting the other end of the roll. Then:


Try to insert this roll, along with the cap and straw, into the uncut roll. It should be snug, but you should still be able to push the cut roll inside the uncut one.
Use your hot glue to attach the bottle cap and attached straw inside the cut roll. Position the bottle cap so it is ¾ of the way to one end of the roll. The straw should exit the opposite end., Cover the outside of your uncut roll with decorative paper to cover the plain cardboard. Attach the paper with either a glue stick or tape. Once the glue is dry, use your glue stick or tape to attach a taut layer of tissue paper at one end of the roll., Hold your uncut roll so the tissue paper covered end is upside down. Add confetti to this roll, then gently insert the confetti pusher into the open end of the uncut roll until it is ¼ to ½ of the way inside.


You may need to wiggle the pusher back and forth to position it properly inside the uncut roll. Be careful not to use too much force, as it could break your tissue paper seal and release the confetti., When the moment comes for you to launch the confetti, in a rapid motion, pull back on the straw/dowel of the confetti pusher slightly, then push it forward firmly. This should cause the tissue paper to break and confetti to fly out of the popper."

",How to Make Confetti Poppers3," These containers can be found at most craft stores, but can also be purchased online. After you remove the lid from your push pop container, slide the bottom all the way down so the body of the container is hollow.


After you have removed the lid, this can be thrown away. This kind of confetti popper can easily be reused, but it won't need a top., You can use traditional confetti, but this popper works well with tinsel, too. You may want to use your scissors to trim tinsel into smaller pieces. This way, it'll float in the air more easily.


Add your confetti or tinsel (or both) to the hollow part of the push pop container until it is completely full., Cut a small square of tissue paper that is large enough to cover the opening of the push pop container. Use tape to fasten the tissue paper firmly over the open end., This can be done easily by wrapping the outside of the popper with decorative paper and taping or gluing this in place. However, you could also paint the outside of the popper, draw designs on it, or personalize it however you wish., When you're ready to launch your confetti mixture into the air, push the stick end of the push pop container upward in a quick, firm motion. This should cause the tissue paper to pop, and the confetti to explode outwards.,"

You may want to draw this line in pencil the first couple of times. Use a T-square to make sure the line down the middle is at a right angle to the base of the triangle.
This fold is to form a crease that will be important for the following fold.

, Unfold the recently formed right triangle and fold the two edged side directly to the half-way line of the triangle. The fold's outer edge should be going straight down, perpendicular to the bottom and even extending below the bottom of your triangle.

, Fold the same side over itself again. You should be able to see the claw coming into form.


Be careful to line each fold with your imaginary pencil line.
Make sure you keep each fold very tight and at the same angle. If the folds start to slant upwards, instead of staying aligned, the claw won't be as sturdy.

, You may need to open the hole for the flap up with your finger. Hold it so the opening is visible and easy to insert one flap.

",How to Make a Senbazuru by Yourself," When people view an object, they not only see color, but also the detail of it. A person may think, ""the bigger the object, the more detail is going to be seen"". However, when you're creating a senbazuru, you need to remember that big cranes take up more room and heavier than miniature sizes. The most popular paper size is 3.0 x 3.0 inches (75 x 75 mm).;
, Foil origami can be costly and more suitable for other origami projects. Browse around for paper sets or bundles made for senbazuru, as stores may carry packs of 100, 500, or 1000 sheets. Think of the possible colors you want the senbazuru to have, such as pink, blue, and orange.

, Making a senbazuru does not happen overnight, nor a few days. Don't let the pressure get to you to finish it, but don't put it on the side too much and eventually forget about it.

, The last thing you want to do is fret about the project. A handful of papers in a sandwich bag is a great way to keep them handy. Bring the bag out and fold a few at a time, as you can always put it away & continue later on. Here are some examples:


Waiting for public transportation

Before or after class

Watching TV or a movie
In a waiting room, appointment, etc.
Rainy or snow day activity

, The most challenging part of the project is to ""get to 1000"". Simplify it by breaking it down into ""sections"". Make an equal array of colors by folding 100 papers of 10 colors.

, Write down the number of cranes you made every day on a calendar - you'll be amazed how far you've come along on it. Use Twitter or another social networking site to log numbers & to share with others about the project.

, It's a blessing to accomplish it and a positive feeling to give to someone you love or cherish.

You will see two rectangles, one on top of the other formed by your earlier folds. Take the top left corner of your paper and fold it down to the right. Align the right edge to the first vertical crease on the right half of your paper. Crease only the top third of your paper. Repeat this fold, taking the top right corner and aligning it the left edge of the first crease on the left third. Repeat these folds with the bottom portion of your paper.
Make a crease by pressing with your finger, then unfold so you have a square again.
Flip your paper over so the original side is facing up.
If done correctly, you will see two X shaped mountain folds on the top and bottom of your paper.

, You will now have several creases, some which are valley creases, and some mountain. Work your way around your paper to make the crease patterns more prominent.


Create all the valley crease patterns by taking the outside valley folds and folding inward. You should fold an outer square pattern that creates a picture frame look. Inside your picture frame you will see a square with an X Shaped crease. Then unfold.

, Each corner will look like a square due to your crease patterns. Crease the diagonal valley fold on each.


Your paper should look like a square bowl with four pointed corners.

, Keeping your valley fold crease patterns intact, go around creasing all your mountain folds. The square area in the center should look like the shell of your turtle.You may have to make small creases to individual sections and play with your paper to get the look right.

, You should have a square section in the center of your paper that is created by two vertical mountain folds. Above and below that square are the two areas where you made the small X folds over the rectangles. Fold the top and bottom of your center square inward in a valley fold. Your paper should flatten with the center point of the X folds forming the tips of two triangles facing each other. Follow the patterns of your creases as best you can. The creases will help you in folding your paper on top of itself.
Press down and crease your edges. When you fold the paper, you want to flatten it on itself.

, After you’ve flattened your paper and creased, make two more valley folds, flipping your triangles up. Keep your paper flat.


You will have a square section in the center, which forms the shell. Above and below, you will have two triangles pointing away from one another.

, Fold the triangle portion you just folded up, along with the legs of the turtle, back down in a valley fold and crease. Then unfold.


Instead of folding just the triangle portion, you want to grab the portion of paper underneath and fold it as well.

, Just below where you made your valley fold, make a mountain fold. Fold the head (triangle) and legs down, away from you, to create a three-dimensional aspect.


Your mountain fold should be about 1 centimetre (0.39 in) below your valley fold.

, Now repeat the valley and mountain folds you just made for the tail and legs.


When completed, you should have two equal parts to your turtle.

, Turn your paper over so the opposite side is facing you. Fold the arms down in a valley fold, keeping the triangle portion up.


When you flip your paper over, you should see a vertical strip where the sides of your paper meet.
Fold only the top rectangular arms down. Leave the legs as is.

, Fold the outer ⅓ of your paper inward on either side. You’ll have to flatten the paper here. When you flatten your paper, leave the bottom layer of paper unfolded. This will separate the shell from the arms.


When completed you should have two flaps overlaid on top of your paper.

, Take the two flaps you just folded and fold each one upward to create two arms at a 45-degree angle on either side of the head.


Press down on your creases to keep the front legs in place.

, Fold the paper up on a diagonal valley fold to create the back legs. Fold the paper up so the inside edges meet up with the horizontal crease that makes up the bottom of the shell.


Press down with your finger to crease.

, fold up the bottom triangle, which is the tail, making a valley fold. Bring the tip of the triangle up to fit in the space between the legs. Then fold the tip back in a mountain fold over your previous valley fold. You want to make the tip stick out slightly from under the shell.


When you flip your turtle back over you will see a tiny triangle that forms a small tail.

Make your frog jump.",How to Make an Origami Jumping Frog," You can use ordinary computer paper, colored paper, or origami paper. Traditionally, origami paper is square. However, you can start the frog with a piece of rectangular paper. Lay your piece of paper flat on a table in front of you.Origami paper can be found in craft, art, and stationery stores.;
, Fold the top right corner over diagonally, so that the tip of the corner touches with the opposite side of the paper. The top side of the paper should line up with the left side, forming a triangle shape. Press the fold with your finger to create a crease, then unfold it. Now do the same with the top left corner. Unfold the paper. You've now created a creased ""X."", Fold the bottom edge of the paper up to make a crease that goes horizontally from one bottom end of the “X” crease to the other. Trim the excess below this crease with scissors or by carefully tearing it off. You’ll now have a square sheet of paper with the “X” crease in the middle.Remember to skip this step if you started with a square piece of paper.
If you need help figuring out where to make the horizontal crease, go ahead and fold either the top left or the top right corner of your paper as you did in the previous step, to make a triangular shape. Trim the excess below the bottom edge of the triangular fold.

, Hold the paper on the table in front of you so that the bottom edge is facing you. Fold the top half of the paper horizontally, so that the two top corners meet the two bottom corners. Seal the fold with your finger, then unfold it. The new crease you've made should cross over the X, creating a pattern that looks like an asterisk or star., Center the paper on the table so that the bottom edge is facing you. Push the folds of the horizontal crease at the top of the paper toward the center. By pushing these folds inside the paper, the square will collapse into a triangle shape with two sides.To make the two sides fold inwards on themselves more easily, re-fold the horizontal crease you made in the previous step, but in the opposite direction.

, Place the triangle on the table so that the long edge is facing you. The long edge of the triangle divides into four points, two on each side. Take the top layer’s corner on the right side and fold it up. The tip of the corner should touch the tip of the triangle. Crease the fold with your finger., Take the top layer corner on the left side of the triangle. Fold it up so that the tip of the corner touches the tip of the triangle. Crease the fold with your finger. The paper should now look like a triangle with a diamond in the middle., With the base of the triangle facing you, grab the right corner of the diamond. Fold it so the right edge of the diamond lines up with the center line. Crease the fold with your finger., With the base of the triangle facing you, grab the left corner of the diamond, and fold it inward so that the left edge lines up with the center line. Crease the fold with your finger., The point of the triangle, under the diamond layer, is divided into two sides. Fold the right one out, toward the right side of the triangle, so that its edge lines up with the right edge of the diamond. Crease it. Fold the left one out, toward the left side of the triangle, so that its edge lines up with the left edge of the diamond. Crease it., Rest it on the table so that the bottom of the triangle is facing you. The frog is starting to take shape! The front legs should now poke out from underneath at the tip of the triangle., Take the right bottom corner and fold it from the tip of the triangle toward the center, making a vertical line at the center. Crease it. Now fold in the left bottom corner in the same way, so that its edge meets the edge of the other side at the center. You've now created an oblong diamond shape., Fold the right half of the diamond outward, so that its inner edge lines up with its outer edge. Crease the fold. Fold the left half of the diamond outward in the same way, so that the inner edge lines up with the outer edge, and crease it. These newly folded triangles will become the frog’s back legs., Position the frog so that the long back legs are facing you, and fold it in half, near where the body is narrowest. Make sure to fold the legs underneath the “body” of the frog. Crease the fold., Keep the frog folded in half, with the back legs facing you, and turn it over. Fold the legs upward, so that the horizontal piece of paper that stretches between the legs lines up with the frog's bottom (the fold you made in the previous step). Crease the fold., Set the frog down on its back legs. Press and release the center folds to make it jump. Have fun! These frogs should jump and flip quite well.If your frog isn’t jumping properly, double-check your folds to make sure everything is in the right place. You can also try thicker paper, which usually has more “spring.”

When you start, the outside of the paper should face you.
Note that ""pureland"" refers to a type of origami that only uses basic mountain and valley folds.;
, Fold the top right edge of the paper in until it meets the crease at the center of the paper. Fold the top left edge in the same way so that it meets at the center crease.









Note that a ""valley fold"" refers to a type of origami fold in which you fold the edge in your hand in, toward you, rather than folding it out and away from you.

, Valley fold the lower left side up and in until the edge of this side meets the bottom edge of your previously folded top portions. Crease well, then unfold.









For this step, you should only crease the center of this fold and not the entire length. The center of your creased portion should intersect with the first pre-crease you created in an earlier step.
When done, turn the paper over so that the inside side faces you.

, Bring the top tip down until it meets the point at which your two pre-creases intersect.









When done, flip the paper over so that the original side shows again.

, You should see what appears to be a large triangle on the bottom and two quadrilaterals on the top. Take the inside bottom corner of each quadrilateral portion and valley fold it outward as far as the paper will allow you to fold before tearing.









Turn the paper over to the other side again.

, You should be able to distinguish a downward pointing center triangle. Take the tip of this triangle and fold it up, straightening it out.









You will be left with what looks like a diamond with tall upper half and a short lower half.

, Fold the lowest corner of the center diamond up so that it meets somewhere along the center of the upper tip, but not quite at the very top.









More precisely, look at the rectangular portion lying behind the diamond shape. This section needs to be folded in half as you fold up the bottom tip.
When done, turn the paper over again.

, You should notice two triangular flaps meeting at the center of paper. Fold these flaps outward as far as possible while still remaining flat and without tearing them.








, Feel the back of the paper. There should be a flap along the back that is loose enough to move without affecting the rest of the structure. Unfold this flap and bring it straight down.









When done, turn the paper back over.

, Pleat the top of the shape, positioning the pleating so that the mountain fold hits the crease separating the tip of the structure from the main part of the rectangular body. Valley fold the diagonal bottom sides in as far as they will go without ripping.









A mountain fold refers to a fold made in which you fold the edges outward, creating a ""mountain"" peak facing you.
When you pleat in origami, you use both a valley fold and a mountain fold. Make the valley fold to the inside of the intended mountain fold. Then, mountain fold the edge back along the instructed point.
When done, turn the paper over.

, Valley fold along the bottom-most crease you can find. Mountain fold a narrow strip just above this valley fold to complete the pleat.








, The first mountain fold should be at the very tip of the paper. For the second, mountain fold the model in half lengthwise.








, There is no set position for the head, so use your eye to determine what might look best. The head lies at the top tip right now. As a general rule, do not fold the head so far that it overlaps any of the legs or body.

Fold the ""ice cream"" bit over the ""cone"" bit. If you're using patterned paper, every bit should be showing you the patterned side.

You should be looking at a smaller triangle on top of a larger triangle. The paper, as a whole, is one giant, perfect triangle.

, You should be creating a small triangle going the opposite direction; the triangle is the underside (non-patterned) of your sheet. This will eventually be your tail., Starting at the thinnest point in your big triangle, cut 1/3 of the way down the middle crease. This will create your head and ears., Fold them up on both sides.

Valley fold the head.",How to Make an Origami Dinosaur2," Take a square sheet of origami paper and valley fold it in half horizontally. Crease well, then unfold. Valley fold in half vertically, crease well, and unfold.









A valley fold is a type of origami fold in which the edge you work with is folded inward toward you, creating a ""valley"" or depression along the fold.
At the completion of this step, rotate the paper by 45 degrees. It should now be in a diamond position, with one corner at the top and another at the bottom.

, Bring the bottom tip up so that it meets the center of the paper, marked by the intersection of your previous creases.









When done, turn the model over to its other side.

, Valley fold the bottom edge of your model up so that the crease falls along the imaginary line connecting the left and right corners of the paper model. Crease well, then unfold.








, Mentally divide the bottom half of your model in half again. Valley fold the bottom edge up and inward, dividing this section in half. Only grab the front layer, though, and leave the back alone.









Note that your bottom edge will meet the pre-crease made immediately prior to this.

, Make a vertical valley fold along the vertical center of the model. Crease well, then unfold.








, Look at the model in front of you. There should be a distinguishable upper triangle portion. Valley fold the upper right edge of this triangle down so that the bottom right corner of the triangular section is folded into two equal angles. Crease well, then unfold.









For your second pre-crease, repeat this same procedure with the left side of the triangular section.

, Look at the upper tip of the model. It should be visually marked in half by your vertical center pre-crease. Valley fold each half of this top tip so that the resulting angles are equal in size. Crease well, then unfold.









Note that the bottom edge of each crease in this step should stop at the lowest visible diagonal pre-crease made previously.

, You will need to make a series of valley and mountain folds along your pre-creases to add dimension to the model. These folds should be used to crease the paper model permanently, but do not fold the edges flat. Also note that a mountain fold is the opposite of a valley fold: fold the edges outward, creating a mountain-like peak along the fold itself.









Note the distinguishable downward pointing triangle at the bottom of the model. Valley fold this piece in half vertically.
Mountain fold the top part of the model in half vertically.
Valley fold the top two diagonal pre-creases and the bottom two diagonal creases.
Example the remaining pre-creases, which were made from your first set of pre-creases. Valley fold the inner portion of both creases, stopping when you hit other creases. Mountain fold the rest of these two pre-creases.
When done, turn the model over.

, Bring the top-most tip of the model down, folding it so that the crease connects the inner corners just below this tip.









At this point, you should compress the model by taking the triangular side flaps and pinching them in.
Rotate the model by 90 degrees before continuing further.

, Note the flap of paper sticking out to the right side of your model. Mountain fold along the lower left corner of this flap, separating the angle into equal portions.









Note that the true lower corner of this flap lies beneath the visible surface of the model. You will need to use this corner and not the visible corner when folding.

, While working with the same flap as in the previous step, note the bottom outside corner of the newly created triangular portion. Valley fold at this corner, effectively separating this angle into equal parts.









When done, rotate the model by 90 degrees.

, Disregarding the folded flap hanging off the top left side of the model, look at the main body of the model, including the flap hanging off the right. Create an imaginary line between the right-most corner and the left-most corner. Valley fold along this line.









Turn the model over to its other side when done.

, You should be able to distinguish a clear tip on the left side of the model. Fold the model horizontally, dividing this tip in two equal halves.









When done, rotate the model by another 90 degrees. You should be able to distinguish two clear wing portions and a body portion. Spread the wings apart by gently pushing them down and away from the body.

, Along the body section, you should see what looks like a ""W"" pattern of folds along the top and a single peak at the bottom. Gently press this bottom peak in, creating a blunt edge at the top of model.









Note that the newly created flat region should look triangular in shape.
Turn the model over when done.

, Note the two loose sections at the top of the wings. Make a mountain fold along the lower outside corner of each section, then unfold the main fold previously keeping the wings together.








, Look at the bottom two semi-triangular sections of the body. Make a gently curving valley fold connecting the bottom tips of these sections to the outside each section's own upper outside corner.









After this, you will need to make another more dramatic set of curved valley folds. These folds should connect the outer-most corners of either wing to the innermost bottom corners of each wing. The curve should go inward at a gently angle.
After making your curves, tuck the lower flaps produced by those folds into the upper flaps lying underneath.
Turn the model over when done and rotate it by 90 degrees.

, Gently pull the head down, bending it along its natural crease.









The head should be on the right side of the model.
When done, rotate the model again by another 90 degrees.

, Make a mountain fold to the right of the hanging head flap and another one connecting the bottom of this fold to the body. Create a valley fold splitting the resulting intersection of your two mountain folds in half.









The head should be on the right during this step.
Turn the model over when done. Repeat this same procedure on the head from the other side, and rotate the model until the wings are spread out flat in front of you and the head faces toward the top.

, You should be able to note a natural crease near the head section of the model. Valley fold along this crease.









This step completes the model. Examine it from all sides and redefine any creases that appear loose, if desired, to strengthen the overall shape.

Give your butterfly as a gift, or use as a decoration.",How to Make a Butterfly Origami," If you are using origami paper, there is one side that is shiny and/or decorated – this is the right side. Lay the paper right-side down.









A 6 x 6 inch (15 x 15 cm) square is a good size for beginners. If you want to create larger or smaller butterflies, adjust your paper size accordingly.;
, Match the paper's lower edge to the upper edge and smooth the crease with your fingers, starting from the center and working your way out. Unfold the paper so the crease remains.









In the valley fold, you fold the paper over the crease, so that the sides of the paper that were facing up are now folded in on each other. The resulting crease is ""under"" the folded sides, hence the name ""valley.""

, Match the right edge to the left edge and crease with your fingers, then unfold.









Steps 2 and 3 are combined in this video.
Now you should have two valley creases: one running horizontally and one vertically through the center.

, Turn the paper counterclockwise so that what was the lower left corner now points downwards towards you.








, Carefully bring the lower corner to the upper corner, crease, and unfold.








, Bring the right corner over to the left corner, crease, and unfold.









Steps 5 and 6 are shown in the video.

, Turn the paper clockwise or counterclockwise so that an edge (rather than a corner) is facing you.









There should be four valley creases though the center: a vertical, a horizontal, and two diagonal.

, Align the right edge of the paper with the middle vertical crease and make a fold. Repeat with the left side.









Do not unfold these creases.
This is called a ""gate fold.""

, Insert your thumb and middle finger under the folded corners, holding the bottom half of the paper securely in place with your other hand.








, Align the upper edge with the horizontal crease in the middle of the model. At the same time, open the flaps that you pinched in the previous step, pulling them apart and down until the top of the model meets the center crease.









Now the upper half of the model should look like a roof on a house.

, Now the ""roof"" is upside-down, facing you.








, When you finish, you'll have what's called an origami ""boat base,"" a starting point for many different creations.







, The folded edges you made in the last step should now be face-down. The corners of the ""boat"" should be pointing to the sides, with the two long edges extending horizontally along the top and bottom of the model.








, Join the upper edge to the lower edge and smooth the valley fold with your fingers.








, Holding the trapezoid-shaped model so the long edge is at the top (as at the end of Step 2), lift the top right corner and bring it downwards toward the model's vertical axis. Crease the fold with your fingers.









The flap's corner should now be pointing downwards towards you.
Note that the right corner has multiple layers: you are folding down only the top one.

, When you finish, both corners will be pointing down towards you.








, Examine the left flap you've just folded down, noticing the mountain fold (upward-facing fold) running diagonally from the central vertical axis and ending in a side corner. Lift the side corner slightly, moving it inwards and upwards toward the center (but not all the way). Smooth the fold with your fingers.









The fold should extend all the way from the upper edge of the model to about halfway between the corner you're lifting and the flap's lower point.

, Because there are no guiding creases for these folds, take care to make the left and right folds even.









The video shows Steps 6 and 7.

, The folds you've just made should now be face-down to the working surface, with the flaps still pointing downwards towards you.








, Bring the left corner over to the right and reinforce the crease with your fingers.








, Lift the upper ""wing"" (which is currently extending straight out to the right) and bring it backwards (to the left), creating a fold that starts about 1/2 inch (1 cm) from the left corner of the upper edge and extends diagonally to the lower left corner of the upper flap. Crease with your fingers and then unfold.








, Now the wing tips should be pointing left, and the crease you've just made is face-down on the working surface.








, This time, bring it up and back towards the right. Create a fold that starts 1/2 inch (1 cm) from the right corner of the upper edge and extends down and right to the lower right corner of the upper flap. Crease and unfold.








, Orient the model so that the central vertical fold is ""mountain,"" or upwards-facing.







, This is the body of the butterfly.









Push the wings back along the creases to reinforce the folds.

, Try making more in different colors and sizes.

Finish the Parrot.",How to Fold an Origami Parrot from a Dollar," Fold and unfold the bill in half lengthwise. Whether you choose the face of the bill or not won't matter for this model.(Creases are simply to guide folds in later step.);
, Fold one of the short edges to meet the length of the bill creating a point as shown in the image. Unfold and repeat on closest corner. The two creases should intersect forming a large ""X"" on one end of the bill.

, Align the triangle to the back along the edge that overlaps with the bill. Make sure you only have the triangle folded back and you avoid any additional paper. Once unfolded you should see a perfect square on one end of the bill.

, Align the short edge with the middle crease. Repeat this on both sides with adjacent edges to corresponding creases. Choose one of the diagonals and stick with it for your folds.

, Fold the ""square"" back. This is best done by refolding a corner and then realigning it to the overlapping edge of the triangle.

, This completes a diamond shape where the ""X"" used to be. Unfold.

, Fold the outside edges to the center. The edges will line up to create a diamond along with a left over flap. This is where the creases really come into play so make sure you have done them right.

, Let the flap follow the crease and sit in the middle of the diamond.

, Fold the top two corners of the ""flap"" in towards the center twice as if making the Classic Airplane.

, Align the edges of the created tip with the center of the model. Repeat for other edge and unfold. This will again create an ""X"" assisting in the next fold.

, Allow the paper to follow the creases while you bringing the tip upright.

, Fold the tip down and tuck half of the diamond behind the model. From the side your model should look like a big mountain with a little one overlapped behind.

, Take the big mountain and fold it over onto the model so that it aligns with the small mountain behind it. The direction of this step will determine if you have feet or not. You have folded wrong if the bigger ""mountain"" covers the lesser.

, Slightly open the top of the model, push the tip forward, and then flatten the model once again. The location of this fold can be adjust for different head sizes.

, To round off beak repeat one more time this time tucking into the model.

, If the wings are missing go back to step 7 and rework.

, Flatten the bottom of the model, fold out the smaller flap, and then flatten the model. Very similar fold as step 16 but is more difficult as there are more layers to worry about.

, Repeating the previous step one more time, adjust the desired length of the claws to fit your finger or desired perch.

Unfold and cut.",How to Make a Paper Origami Fox," Start by folding the lower left corner of your square up to meet the upper right corner of your square. You should be left with a triangle.Make sure the corners meet up perfectly. Your fox will look much more polished if your folds are precise.
To avoid confusing yourself, don't change the orientation of your paper.;
, Next, fold the left corner of your triangle in to meet the upper right corner (the right angle). Do the same with the lower corner of your triangle.


You should be left with a small square with a crease diagonally down the middle where the two triangles meet.

, Flip your square over so that all of the folds are facing away from you. Be sure to turn it over horizontally, not vertically.


To confirm that you flipped the paper the right way, check to make sure that seam between the two triangles on the back of your square goes from the upper left corner to the lower right corner. If it doesn't, reposition the square so that it is oriented the correct way.

, Keeping your square in the same position, fold the upper right corner down to meet the lower left corner. Be sure to match the corners up precisely before creasing your fold. .


You should now have a right triangle, with the right angle on the lower left side.

, Fold the entire left side of your triangle over to the right. Try to fold it so that the straight edge will intersect the remaining triangle in half. (It does not need to be precise.)


At this point, you should have a skinny rectangle (that has a point on the upper right hand side) on the left of your piece. There should be a small triangle protruding from behind the rectangle on the right.

, You will notice that the rectangle on the left side of your piece is comprised of two folds. Starting at the bottom of the rectangle, separate these two sections. Fold the top fold to the right and the bottom fold to the left.


As you do this, you should notice a triangle that begins to emerge near the top. This is the fox's head.

, To finish your fox, encourage the head to fold down by running your fingers along the crease. You can also fold the tail out to help it stand up. Lastly, you may decorate your fox's face in whatever way you choose.


You can draw on a nose and eyes, or use googly eyes to give your fox its expression.

, Starting with the colored side of your paper facing down, fold your square in half diagonally. Make sure that the corners line up nicely and that you run your finger along the fold to make a good crease.If you are using construction paper or printer paper, both sides will be colored, so it doesn't matter which side is facing down.

, Keeping the first fold in place, fold your paper in half diagonally a second time. Once you have creased this fold, you can immediately unfold it. The purpose is to create a crease, but not to leave this fold in place.


Be sure to leave the first fold in place. After this step, you should have a square that has been folded into a triangle once and has a crease down the middle.

, Position your triangle so that the long side is facing towards you. Then fold the top point of the triangle down so that it just barely meets the long side of the triangle.

, Keep the paper positioned so that the long side is facing towards you. Then fold up one of the bottom corners so that the point sticks up over the top of your paper. Do the same with the second bottom corner, trying to make sure the shape symmetrical. This will create the fox's ears.


The higher you place your folds, the larger the ears will be. You can make them whatever size you want, but do your best make sure the two sides are the same size.

, Flip the paper over, and you should see the beginnings of a fox face. You should have a large triangle at the bottom (which is the face) and two triangles sticking up on the top from behind (which are the ears). To make it look more like a fox, draw on a face.


Color in the bottom of the triangle with a black pen or marker to make the nose.
Experiment with different expressions. The way you draw the eyes can make your fox look happy, sad, or angry.
You can also put some googly eyes on your fox.

, Regardless of which kind of fox you want to make, you will need to start with a perfectly square piece of paper. Origami paper comes in perfect squares, so so won't have to worry about cutting it. If you don't have a square piece of paper, you can start with a standard 8 1/2 x 11-inch sheet of paper and use a simple folding technique to turn it into the perfect square.You can use any color paper you want, but orange is a popular choice for foxes, since it is close to the color of a fox's hair.

, If your paper is not already a square, start by folding the upper left corner of your paper down to the right side, making sure that the upper right corner is creased perfectly in half.


You should be left with a skinny rectangle at the bottom of the page.
It's very important that your edges all line up. If they don't you won't have a perfect square.

, Next, fold the upper right corner of your paper so that it meets the bottom corner of your previous fold.


At this point, you should have a triangle at the top and a skinny rectangle at the bottom.

, Fold the rectangle on the bottom under your triangle. Run your finger along this fold to make a very good crease.


At this point, you should have a large triangle with two smaller triangles protruding from behind it (one on each side).

, Lastly, unfold your piece of paper and cut the rectangle off of the bottom. This will leave you with a perfectly square piece of paper that you can use for any origami project.


If you created a really solid crease, you may also be able to tear the rectangle off, but be careful to do it cleanly.

Start with a square sheet of paper.,
Crease the paper in half.,
Fold in the top two corners until they meet.,
Fold up the ""bottom"" flaps of the hat.",How to Make a Paper Captain's Hat1," If you have a small head, you can fold a standard piece of 8.5"" x 11"" paper into an 8.5"" square. If you have a large head, you might need to find a larger sheet. A two-page newspaper spread is usually perfect for this.If you want a hat that is slightly wider than it is tall (or taller than it is wide,) then begin with a rectangular sheet of paper. The sizing, however, is still important! Making a shallower, wider captain's hat is a great way to make an 8.5"" x 11"" piece of paper into a hat for a slightly larger head.
Consider the color of hat that you want. Try using black paper for a pirate captain's hat. Use colorful construction paper for a more cheerful captain's hat! Remember that you can always color or paint the paper.;
, Make sure that the crease is sharp and the fold is even. If the paper is square, it doesn't matter which way you fold it. If the paper is rectangular: fold lengthwise or ""hot-dog style"" for a shallower, wider hat, and ""hamburger style"" for a taller but narrower hat., Be sure to bend from the ""closed"", creased half of the paper, not the open end. The folded-down corners should cover the entire surface of the paper, except for a small rectangular space at the bottom. As you fold the corners, try to crease the ""top"" of the hat into a point. The almost-finished hat should look like a pentagon: a small rectangular ""bottom"" with a large, triangular point at the ""top"".The future ""front"" of the hat should be a smooth paper pentagon. On the ""back"" of the hat, you should be able to see a small gap between the sides of the two folded-down corner triangles – as though the triangles are popping out from the rest of the paper.The pointed, closed end will become the top of the hat. The flat, open end is the space into which your head should fit.

, There should be some loose paper on the open (not pointed) end of the hat. Crease the ""back"" flap over the folded-down corners – this should seal the loose triangles in place. Next, fold up an equivalent portion of the flat front-bottom of the hat. The flaps should match up. Your hat is ready to wear!The finished hat should look a bit like a boat: the pointed top of the hat is the ""sail"", and the flaps at the open bottom are the body of the ship.

To create a more elaborate shape, tape or glue cardstock and cardboard onto your balloon form.
Traditional pinatas are made with a ceramic pot as the form, but these can be messy and dangerous. Stick with a pliable form made from paper products.;
, Making your pinata has the potential to get a little messy, so make sure you give yourself plenty of room to work. Cover your work area with layers of newspaper or a disposable plastic tablecloth. This will keep your tabletop clean, and make cleanup afterwards a breeze. Keep yourself clean too by wearing an old shirt or apron as well as latex gloves.

, In a bowl, mix 2 cups (473 g) of flour, 2 cups (473 ml) of water, and a tablespoon of salt. Stir the mixture until it starts to thicken like a batter. Don't worry about breaking down all the lumps; you want the batter to be relatively smooth but it will likely still have chunks of flour in it.

, Tear some newspaper into strips that are about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) wide and 6 to 8 inch (15.2 to 20.3 cm) long. This will make the newspaper lay nice and flat on the balloon. You will need to prepare many of these strips of paper, so that you have enough to cover your balloon in several layers.

, This will form the body of your pinata, so make sure you make it nice and big. Round balloons are preferable because they will create a larger space for all of the candy. You may also use a box if you prefer a square shape for your pinata. Add any additional shapes to make legs, arms, tails, snouts, hats etc, using cardboard, newspaper or construction paper. Tape these shapes on with masking tape or clear tape.

, Dip the strips into your paste and remove any excess paste by running the strips through your pinched fingers or dragging them along the edge of the bowl.

, Lay the strips down all over the balloon in a crisscross pattern until the entire balloon is covered. Leave the knot of the balloon uncovered to make removal of the balloon easier. Complete this step 3 to 4 times, allowing each layer to dry before adding another.

, Once you have finished adding layers of paper mache, let the pinata sit until it is completely dry and has hardened. How long this will be will depend on many factors, including how thick the paper mache is, and the humidity and temperature of the air. In general, plan on several days.

, Use a single color to smooth out the paper and to create an even surface. It does not need to be especially well-painted, just enough to cover the paper. Choose a color that matches the decorations you'll be adding on or to match the animal or character that you're turning your piñata into, as it'll probably show through.

, This will give your pinata a more traditional look. It is also a festive and inexpensive touch. Cut or tear strips of crepe paper and glue it onto the pinata. Leave the paper in strips, or bunch it up into small tassle-like balls and glue on.

, Once you've gotten the base of crepe paper on, add other neat details to your pinata. Colorful cupcake liners and brightly colored tissue squares can be added as fringe. If you made an animal, add googly eyes for a fun look.

, If the balloon has not yet popped, go ahead and pop it and remove it. Since you did not cover the knot of the balloon with your paper mache, you should have a small hole already.

, If the candy doesn't fit, cut away at the edge of the hole until it is large enough to pass the candy through.

, Tie a string or ribbon to the holes to create a loop. This will come in handy later when it comes time to hang the pinata.

, Start adding in candy, streamers, stickers, confetti, small toys or anything else you like.

Avoid adding any candy that is not wrapped,
Toys that might break easily or is also a poor choice.








, Glue down some crepe paper on top of the hole, or use masking tape. The goal is to prevent the filling of the pinata from falling out before you've actually hit it.

, Tie another piece of string, ribbon, or rope to the loop you've already made and use this to attach the pinata to whatever you'd like to hang it from.

Make a pirate captain's hat.,
Decorate a naval captain's hat.,
Come up with your own theme.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Paper Captain's Hat2," First, your hat will need to be black or brown. You can use black or brown paper from the start, or you can color in the paper after the fact. Add a ""skull and crossbones"" to the smooth front of the hat to show your friends that you're a scurvy sea dog. Consider ripping chunks out of the hat so that it looks worn and weather-beaten – a few tasteful burn marks would not be out of place here, either. Yarrr!


If you're feeling fancy, try sticking a feather into the hat. Poke the sharp tip of the feather through the paper just above the flaps, and make sure that it sticks there. The more colorful and tropical-looking the feather, the better!

, A naval captain needs a crisp, clean white hat. Avoid lined or colored paper. Don't decorate with anything – except for, perhaps, a thin golden lining, or an ornate-looking naval insignia. If you'd like to be more direct, simply write ""U.S. Navy"" or ""Naval Officer"".

, Get creative! Invent a country and proudly fly its flag. Draw your own insignia on the front of the hat. Decorate with crazy colors, sparkles, beads, feathers – anything that feels right!

Unfold and refold the hat.,
Staple the hat to fit your head.",How to Make a Paper Robin Hood Hat1," The paper should be 18 by 12 inches (45.72 by 30.48 cm). Sturdier construction paper works better than thin, flimsy color printer paper or newsprint because it holds the shape of the hat better. Do not use stiff poster board, however, since poster board is a little too unforgiving and difficult to fold.;
, The new dimensions should be 9 by 12 inches (22.86 by 30.48 cm). Position the paper so that the fold is to your right.

, Use a pencil to lightly sketch a curved line from the top right corner, where the fold starts, to a position near the diagonal corner at the bottom left, where the paper opens. Your line should end about 2 inches (5 cm) above the corner to make the brim easier to fold later on.

, Use scissors to carefully cut along the line. Keep the paper folded so that both sides are cut symmetrically.

, While your paper is still folded, fold along the curved edge. The new fold should start at the upper right-hand corner, where your curved line started, and extend down to the place where the curved line stopped, approximately 2 inches (5 cm) above the diagonal corner at the lower left.

, Make a symmetrical mirror fold on the opposite side of your hat so that the brim is even all the way around.

, Turn the hat so that the bottom right corner, which had no curve connected to it, becomes the top. The fold or crease between this corner and the corner where your curved edge began form the front crease of the hat. Unfold the hat enough so that the bottom, where the rim now lies, is slightly opened. Bring the back together.

, Adjust the size of the hat by changing how much paper overlaps in the back. Once you have a size that fits your head or the head of whoever will be wearing the hat, staple it in place.


You can also add a drop or thin line of glue along the back of the hat for added support after you staple it in place.

Think about how big that you want your mask to be.,
Once you've drawn it out, cut out the outline of the mask.

,
Here's the tricky part, to cut out the mouth and eyes without making ""stray cuts"", you fold the mask(s) together and cut the line of the eyes and mouth by a little bit.

,
Once the small cut has been done, you stick your scissors through the cut and cut away!

,
(Optional) If you want, you can tape or glue a Popsicle stick to the back of the mask so you can hold it up while your acting with it!

",How to Make a Tragedy and Comedy Mask Out of Paper," If small, fold a piece of construction paper in half and draw out your mask shapes. If big, get two of the same size and color construction paper and do the same to that.

",How to Make a Paper Robin Hood Hat2," The paper should be about 9 by 12 inches (22.86 by 30.48 cm).

, First fold it in half, then fold that half in half again. Do not fold it accordion-style. The new dimensions should be 2.25 inches by 12 inches (5.7 cm by 30.48 cm).

, Leave a small notch at the bottom, where the fold is, to act as the stem. From there, cut out a feather shape, which could also be called a football or half-teardrop shape. Make the feather as long or short as you please.

, Cut small slits, about 1/4 inch (0.635 cm) long and 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) apart. Only cut along the open curved edge. Do not cut into the stem or the folded spine. Cover the entire outside edge in these slits.

, The paper feather should open up into two separate, clear feather shapes with fringes on all outer sides.

, Only use a small amount of glue to prevent the glue from sticking on the feather fringes. Apply the glue to the interior of the fold.

, Press the other feather cut-out into the glue and let dry.

, The feather should be glued along one side of the brim, starting somewhere around the middle and extending to the back of the hat or slightly past the back of the hat.,"

Set up your workspace.,
Blow up the heart shaped balloon.,
Make the paste for forming the pinata.,
Tear the newspaper into lots of even strips.,
Start covering the balloon in the paper strips.,
Once the final layer has dried in place, pop the balloon inside.,
Add candies and any other treats to the middle of the heart pinata.,
Paint the heart pinata.,
Find a suitable place to hang the pinata.",How to Make a Heart Pinata," Cover an area with newspaper or plastic cloth to protect it. Set out the things used for making the pinata.
, Knot to keep the air in. The amount of air you add depends on how big you want the pinata to be.

Where you tie the knot, attach a long length of ribbon or twine. First, wind the ribbon around the center of the balloon, over the dip in the balloon. Tie a strong knot to keep in place. This ribbon is essential for hanging the pinata.
You can also attach two regular balloons until you got the shape of a heart.

, Pour the flour into the mixing container. Add a cup of water. Stir well with the spoon. The paste that forms should be lump-free., The width is ideal around 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) across. Make as many strips as can cover the balloon several layers thick., Dip each strip into the paste container to cover, then apply to the balloon. Take care to maintain the heart shape as distinctly as possible; this may mean shifting the strips around at times.

Apply layer one first, then leave to dry for 12 hours or overnight.
Apply layer two and let it dry too. On average, each layer will need about 12 hours drying time.
Continue with a further two layers, drying each layer in between.

, To do this, insert a pair of scissors into the bottom of the balloon, to one side. Create a small hole which will allow you to stuff the balloon., Then, cover the hole with strong tissue paper, or glue more newspaper on and leave to dry., Good colors include red, pink or orange but you are free to choose any color you like. If adding decorative touches over the painted layer, allow the painted layer to dry properly first before painting on additional designs.

You can add paper cut-outs, glitter, buttons and other items to improve the decoration of the pinata.

, Find a long stick or use a pinata stick. Guests are blindfolded before taking swings at the pinata in the hope that they'll break it open and reveal lots of candies!"

, Do the same thing with the plastic bags. This time, make result bigger and tape it up so that it stays stiff., This will be the legs. You can even make a tail too!,, The paste is made up of one part water and one part flour. You can start by mixing one cup of flour and one cup of water, continue adding the same proportion if you need more paste. You can add more water if it gets too thick. The paste should have a gluey thickness to it. If the paste appears to be lacking in viscosity, leave it for 5 to 10 minutes and it should thicken up., Make sure that you have a lot of strips. Even if you have more than enough, it is still better than having less., Directly apply the soggy strip onto the dog. Continue this until you have one full layer covering the dog.,, You can choose to add more layers if you think that the shell isn't hard enough., Make sure not to cut through the plastic bags.

Cut the tops of each newspaper in a curved shape that resembles the top of a low-cut dress.,
Fold in the bottom of the dress's top slightly.,
Tape the top portion of the dress around your torso.,
Tape the top back on and slip on the bottom.",How to Make a Paper Dress," To start, you'll need to collect a variety of old newspapers. If you do not subscribe to a newspaper, this can get tricky. However, there are ways you can find newspapers for craft purposes.


Old newspaper is commonly recycled.If you know a neighbor who's big into recycling, try asking him or her if they have any old newspaper to spare.
You may also be able to find old newspaper at the recycling bin of a local dump, but make you ask worker if taking the paper is okay. Check at your local grocery store as well. If they have day old newspapers they intend to throw out, they may be willing to give these papers to you.;
, Making a dress out of newspaper can be a fun project for an afternoon. It can also be great for a costume party. To make a newspaper dress, you'll need the following supplies:You will need a pen or a pencil.
Make sure to get a non-toxic brand of adhesive tape.You should get a tape measure, which you can purchase at a local drugstore if you do not have one on-hand.
You'll need some string. You can use shoe string, or buy a thick bundle of string at a local craft store.

, To start, take two pieces of newspaper. Open them up if necessary so they're spread out as much as possible. Lay the pieces side-by-side and tape them together, allowing a small amount of overlap between the pieces. This will comprise the skirt portion of your dress. Use a lot of tape to make sure the pieces are securely together, taping them down on both the front and the back.







, Take a tape measure and measure your waist. Measure just below your chest, slightly below your rib cage. Wrap the tape measure around your waist and see how big your waist is. Write down this number.








To measure your waist, grab your tape measure. Place the end of the tape measure directly on your skin, halfway between your lowest rib and the top of your hip bone. This should be more or less in line with your belly button.Breath out and wrap the tape measure around your waist, making sure it's smooth without twists or wrinkles. Write down the size of your waist before removing the tape measure.
Mark your waist size on top of the taped together newspaper. For example, say your waist is 22 inches. Start at the end of one piece of newspaper and stretch the tape measure out 22 inches. Use your pen to make a small vertical line on top of the newspaper marking the 22 inch mark.

, You will now want to wrap the newspaper around your waist. You want to allow the two ends of the newspapers to overlap at the line you marked. Allow them to point downward slightly when overlapping, as you want a long, flowing, triangular shape. The newspaper should look something like a lampshade. Hold the newspapers in place like this.








If you're having trouble holding the newspapers in place, ask a friend to help.

, Take a pen or pencil. Draw a line marking where the two ends of the newspapers overlap. You'll be taping the newspapers along this line to create the beginning of the bottom of your dress., Remove the newspaper from your waist. Carefully fold the two pieces of newspaper again, having them overlap at the line you drew. They should maintain the same basic shape they were in when wrapped around your waist. Remember, it should look something like a lampshade. Use several pieces of tape to tape the newspapers together along this line. You should now have a cone-like shape that you can stand up.







, You can set your existing skirt, that is the portion of newspapers taped in a lampshade shape, on a chair or stool. You can then add layers by taping more newspaper to the skirt. Take a piece of newspaper and place one end of it roughly in the middle of your skirt. Tape this newspaper to the skirt, using several pieces of tape to secure. Then, add more pieces of newspaper to the middle of the skirt, allowing some overlap between pieces, until all sides of the original skirt are covered with extra newspaper. The new newspapers should add length as they'll stretch down slightly below the two original newspapers.








How many newspaper you'll need to layer depends on the size of your skirt. If you have a bigger waist, you'll need more newspapers.
Length is optional. You can stop with one extra layer of newspapers wrapping around the skirt. If you want a longer skirt, however, add another layer. This time, tape new newspapers over the overlapping portions of newspaper you added to the original skirt. The ends of these new newspapers should be taped down about halfway between the first layer of newspaper you added., Now, take your scissors. Make a cut at the back of your skirt. Cut through the middle of the first two newspapers you taped together. This will create a slit in the back of your skirt, that will eventually allow you to take the skirt on and off.







, From here, create two small strips of newspaper. To do so, take a single piece of newspaper. Fold this newspaper in half length-wise and then cut down the line in the middle. Take one side of the newspaper and roll it into a tight cylinder shape. Press the cylinder down until it folds into a firm strip. Place several pieces of tape along the edge of this strip to secure it. Repeat with the other piece of newspaper.







, You will now apply these two strips to the back of your skirt. This can be a somewhat complicated process, so go slowly here to make sure you do this correctly.








Place one of your newspaper strips along one side of the slit at the back of your skirt. Tape the tip of the strip down on top of the slit. Then, move down about an inch and place another piece of tape across the strip. The idea is to create a series of slots along the seam of the dress, through which you'll later weave string to secure the dress in place. Keep taping down the slit of newspaper, leaving about one inch of space between pieces of tape, until you reach the end of the slit.
Repeat the same process on the other side, using the other strip. Make sure the slots you create on the other side line up with slots you originally created.
Then, take several pieces of string. Feed one piece of string between each slot on one side. Then, pass this piece of string through the corresponding slot on the other side. When you're ready to put on your skirt, you will tie the strings together to secure it. Later, when you want to take off your skirt, you can untie the strings.

, From here, you can create the top your dress. Once again, you'll start by taping two pieces of newspaper together like you did when you began your skirt.







, From here, you'll want to make the top of your newspapers look like the top of a low-cut dress. Cut the tops of each piece of newspaper into an upward bending curve. This should look something like the top of bra cups or a bikini top., You do not want the top of the dress to look boxy or awkward when paired with the skirt. Therefore, it's a good idea to make sure the dress's top bends in slightly, following the curve of your waist.








Take the two taped together pieces of newspaper forming the top of your dress. Cut a small slit about halfway through the non-curved end of one piece. The slit should not go all the way to the top of the newspaper. Cut about halfway up the newspaper.
Now, pull one end of the slit over the other end, bending your top at a slight angle. Tape these pieces together. Repeat this process on the other side.

, Wrap the top portion of your dress around your torso. The curved portions, the ones that resemble a bikini top, should fall on top of your chest. See how much of the newspaper you need for the top to fit. Mark where the newspaper intersects. Remove the top and then cut off any extraneous newspaper.







, You now have a full newspaper dress. Place the bottom on, tying the strings in the back to secure the skirt in place. Then, wrap the top portion around your waist and tape it in place. You should have a full paper dress that you can wear to a Halloween party or just wear for fun.








You will probably need someone to help you secure the dress in place.

, Keep the cardboard bent in shape.

, Remove these from the box. Then, cover the other two shorter flaps in glue and newspaper on, both sides.

, Use the flaps on the other side of the box this time. Cover in newspaper and glue as before.

,, Pick one side on the front or back of the oval. Bend it wither left or right, but do not break it off. Do this to both sides on each piece of cardboard.

, Push together until they dry and stick together. You might want to push the flaps closer to each other to make the fish fatter or wider.

, Glue the edges to the body of the fish's edges. Do the same with the other side too.

, Glue a rectangular flap to the center of the fish on the outside. Do this with both pieces. (The third remaining flap is yet to be utilized.)

, Paint it completely white, then let it dry.

, You can use one color, although two-toned colored rows (one row one color, the next row another) will ensure the best effect. Bunch up the rows as you glue them down the body space, so that they appear wavy and stand up a little way (not flat against the body).


Do not take the scale rows over any of the fish features or face.
Use PVA glue to attach the crepe paper.

, Use a different color again for these areas and simply cover them flat with crepe paper, using squares or pieces until fully covered.

,


Add the eyes. Either glue on large cardboard circles (you can use a marker to fill in pupils) or glue on large googly eyes.
Add the lips. Paint them any color you like.

Spend an afternoon having fun with your children.",How to Make a Treasure Map," It could be a path that uses landmarks, or it could be a verse that includes directions and distances.There could be a game involved with a secret plot.Make sure the start is easy to find, and the treasure is hidden somewhere where it won't be disturbed until the treasure hunters find it.;
, Use a piece of plain white paper to start. Include the compass so the hunters can get their bearings and any written clues needed by the hunters to find the treasure.


Note: You can also use a thicker piece of cardstock if you want a more durable map. Or you can use part of a brown paper grocery bag (just make sure you use a piece with no writing on it). , Feel free to use different colored inks; you can also use colored pencils, Sharpies, or watercolor paint.The features don't have to be perfect. After all, pirates aren't known as being great artists! Include things like:


A red X to mark the spot. This is probably the most important feature!
Landmarks to determine a starting point and a finishing point (the treasure spot), and landmarks to help the hunters find their way in the middle.
Trees, shrubs, or plants. Trees can be made by a simple vertical line with horizontal lines squiggled on top of it that start wider at the base and get increasingly smaller toward the top. Make sure to leave a small portion of your vertical line uncovered at the bottom to create the trunk of the tree. You can also make more detailed trees if you want to spend the time.Houses or other buildings.
Mountains or hills.Rivers or other bodies of water. You can locate the treasure hunt on an island surrounded by water.For a more imaginative look, include some fantasy elements like a sea serpent, some ships, or a castle.

, This will make the map look more like a worn treasure map., Wipe a wet tea bag over both sides of the paper.The map will turn a light brown color. When you finish, the paper should be completely saturated.

, Crumple the map into a ball several times to get it good and crumpled. Let it dry overnight in a ball.

, Gently open the map, and wipe both sides with cooking oil. Blot off the excess with paper towels. This will make the paper feel slightly crunchy.

, Once it is finished drying, the map should look very old.


, Include clues and prizes/treasures to entertain your guests.


This is a great idea for all kinds of events like birthday parties, holiday parties, kids' sleepovers,

, Impress the other adults with your crafty skills by volunteering to create the map for your kids' school play or church activity.

, Use the treasure map as a bonding experience for your family.

Choose your material.,
Cut the paper into equal strips, about 1cm each.,
Trace your foot on a separate piece of paper.,
Cut out your foot tracing.

,
On another piece of paper, draw a flip-flop outline around your foot tracing, about how big you would normally want your flip-flops to be.,
Take the strips of newspaper and weave them together.,
Fold the outermost strip on side A so it is going in the same direction as side B and weave.,
Trace the flip-flop shape onto what you have just created.,
Cut out ""feet"" in the shape of your flip-flop out of the newspaper, at least 30.,
Create your straps.,
Tape the straps together so their ends line up, like attaching a pole to a tree for support, but leaving 1 inch loose.

,
Create a hole between where your first two toes would be.

,
Feed the straps through the hole, split them, and tape.

,
Tape the other ends on the sides of your feet where you chose them to be.

,
Create some 1"" by 2"" rectangles out of newspaper.

,
Flip over your very thin flip-flop and tape the rectangles around the edge, sticking out a considerable distance so it looks like a sun.

,
Place the stack of ""feet"" on top.

,
Fold the rectangles around the ""feet"" and tape.

",How to Create Flip Flops out of Newspaper," It can be anything from newspaper to loose leaf. The only requirement is that it has to be an entire sheet of paper, or ripped/cut into long strips.;
, It is better when they are straight edged, so you could use a ruler and draw the lines or use a paper cutter. (If the page doesn't fit you can always fold it and cut)

, Be sure to hold the pen or pencil straight up and down while tracing or you might end up with a distorted version of your foot. You could also dip your foot in paint and have a footprint on a piece of paper, but that is much messier.

,, (About a centimeter is a good distance)

, Take some strips of paper and clip them together with tape or binder clips. This will be side A. Take one strip and weave it through them perpendicularly, going over and under. Take another strip and weave the same way, but going under and over so the first strip is fixed in one place. Continue until the amount of strips on side B is the same as side A.

, Repeat, switching sides every turn. Continue until it is as long as your flip-flop shape.

, Put tape on the lines you drew and cut out.

, (It sounds like a lot but if you fold the newspaper and then cut, it goes a lot faster. They do not have to be perfect, as long as they are not drastically too big) OPTIONAL: Wet them and let them hang to air dry for more comfort.

, Measure the distance between where the strap would hit between your first two toes and where it would hit on the side of your foot. Add about 2 inches. Create a strap the width you would like using the same weaving technique as before. Do the same for the other side.

Choose the type of paper you want to use.,
Design your bill.,
Cut the bills to the size you want.,
Draw designs on the bills.",How to Make Play Money2," You can use any kind of paper without a pre-made design on it, for example colored construction paper. Printer paper works fine, as does construction paper. If you want to mimic the feeling of a dollar bill you’ll have to buy paper with 25 % cotton and 75 % linen.You can find this type of paper online, but it is more expensive.

, Since it’s play money, it doesn’t need to be particularly serious. However, you should make sure that the amount of the money is easy to understand and unambiguous. Think of a cool design that you want for each denomination (1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 bills).


Have originality and think of other number bills that don't exist that you want to make, such as 6, 25, or 10000 dollar bills.
If you are using construction paper, you may want to use one color for each dollar value to make it easier.

, The standard shape of a regular dollar bill is a rectangle and the dimensions are 2.61 inches wide by 6.14 inches long.Cut them smaller, larger, or even another shape such as a triangle or square if you desire.

, Make sure that the bill value is clear to read. It's up to you to color and use one or both sides of the bill. A regular money bill uses both sides, while Monopoly money uses one side.


Clip or organize each stack of bills by the value. Use them in your next game!

Consider what your money represents.,
Put a face on one side.,
Write the name of your game or country above the centered face.,
Add appropriate designs on the back.,
Consider adding serial codes.",How to Make Play Money3," Try to think what you will be using your play money for. Most money has details that symbolize the country it represents. If you're making play money for a game, maybe you should put symbols on it that represent the game. If you're making play money to look realistic then you should try as best you can to copy the bill you want it to look like.


For example, US bills are easily recognizable by the different presidents on them in the middle.

, Assuming you're trying to replicate a US bill, having a face on the bill is absolutely necessary. This will immediately identify the piece of paper as currency. Center the face in the middle of the rectangle and draw a circle around it. Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, and George Washington are all presidents featured on US currency.If you're creating your own game you can draw any face.


Draw your own face, the mascot of your school, or anything else.

, On the very top of a US one dollar bill it says Federal Reserve Note and then The United States of America. Is this how you would like your play money to look? For example, if you're making play money to use at your school consider writing the name of your school above the face.


Write the denomination out in letters below the face. On a US dollar this would be ""One Dollar""

, Start by writing out the denomination in big letters in the middle of the back of your note. For a US dollar you would write 'ONE' in large letters. On either side of this writing you can add designs that suit the purpose of your money.


If you're making the money for your school you could add the school crest to the right of the 'ONE' and then you could draw the state that you go to school in on the left side. Try to be creative with the symbols.
A US dollar features a pyramid with a gleaming eyeball at the top and the US crest with an eagle. , If you want to get really serious, you can add serial codes to each of your notes of play money. In the US the currency has a 10 digit serial code. It starts and ends with a letter with 8 numbers in between. Put this serial code on the center right and center left of the bill. One example of a serial code would be L72543781G.

Fold it in half the short way.,
Fold one end to the inside edge of the opposing diamond.,
Fold the outside point of the inner diamond to its center.,
Hold the sword in front of you horizontally.,
Do a squash fold for the hilt.,
Make another squash fold.,
Fold the tip of the handle to square it off.",How to Make a Sword out of Paper1," That is, hold the paper like a diamond in front of you, and bring the bottom tip to the top tip, making a crease. Then, rotate it 90º and bring that tip to the top tip, making another crease. You now should have two creases in the shape of an X on your paper.


Start with the pretty side of the origami paper facing you. If both sides are pretty, well, pin a rose on your nose.;
, At this juncture, top and bottom are just two opposing tips -- however the paper is lying now will determine that. Then, flip the paper over.








, You're now looking at the underside of your paper. You folded two points in, so you should be looking at a shape that has two horizontal sides and two sides that come to a point. Fold the bottom, horizontal side to the middle. The under flap should then pop out.









Repeat for the other side. Your end shape should be a diamond (or square, depending on how you look at it) sandwiched between two triangles (of the colored side) and two diamonds (of the under side).

, You should now be looking at something that resembles a finger trap -- alternating colors of little triangles on two lines. Yes? Hope so! Moving on.








, It should be half its original length. Then, open it back up.








, On both ends should be a diamond shape of the underside of your paper. Between those two ends are a series of triangles. Well, take one end and fold it over the triangles to the inside of each diamond on the end. Crystal clear?









The pretty side should line up with the triangles, resembling the shape of a medal ribbon (you know, the kind with the V cut in the end).

, Your strip has four diamonds currently. From the left, fold the rightmost point of the 3rd diamond to its center. Keeping that point on center, fold the strip back onto itself. This should form two creases that are fairly close together. Do the same for the leftmost point of the same diamond.









The center should now sort of pop out and the triangle should have disappeared (underneath the folds).

, Fold the bottom line to the center and then unfold it (you just need the crease for later). Then, rotate it and do the same on the other side.








, Facing you are four tiny triangles. On the left most triangle, fold the tip to its center. Then, open up the triangle, and squash it down. This forms an even teenier triangle pointing to the right. Can you see the handle starting to form?









Do the same for the opposite side. Now one side of your paper is much smaller and thinner than the other.

, Next to the folds you just made should be a triangle that was left intact. Not for much longer! Make the same teeny fold, bring its point to its center. Unfold it, open it up, and squash it down into a triangle facing to the side once more. This should halve the width of your sword.


Half of your handle is now present. A box shape is emerging about 2/3 of the way down the length of your paper, yes?
Repeat for the other side. Now all of your handle is present. What sweet reward!

, It's great the one tip is pointed (your blade tip), but you don't want your handle to be pointy, too. Fold it in to make it square, finishing the handle.









There's your sword, hilt and all!

Spread out a whole sheet of newspaper.,
Trim the paper.,
Fold the paper in half.,
Fold both corners of the paper down.,
Fold the brim of the hat.,
Put a couple of pieces of clear tape on each of the flaps and brim folds on the hat.,
Try on your hat.,
Decorate the hat.",How to Fold a Pirate Hat," You can also use a large piece of regular paper. You will want to unfold the paper completely.
Lay the paper out flat.
Make the hat on a hard table or floor. This will help you get good folds.;
, If you are making the hat for a toddler, you might need to trim the paper to make it smaller.To get the right proportions for your hat, measure the around the top of the head of the child (or adult) the hat is being made for.
If your paper is significantly larger than your measurement, then you can trim it to just a few inches larger than your measurement.
For most small children, you will need to trim approximately 1/4 of a standard newspaper sheet off to make sure the hat isn't too wide and narrow, or too big of a fit.
If you are making a hat for an adult, you might want to use a wider and longer piece of plain paper rather than a standard sheet of newspaper.
Be careful if you are using scissors, as they could be very sharp. Younger kids should always be supervised when using scissors.
The smaller hat made from newspaper will fit most 3-6 year olds, but the larger hat made from the larger paper should fit most older kids and adults.

, Do this fold horizontally. In kids craft classes, this is often called the ""hot dog bun"" fold, because the folded edge is longer than the unfolded part. To start the fold, bend the paper so the top edge touches the bottom edge.
Press down where the paper bends, making a smooth and crisp crease.

, They will meet in the middle.Start with the upper left corner. Fold it down so the side of the paper makes a triangle.
Do the same with the upper right corner. Fold it down so that side of the paper makes a triangle.
The top part of the hat is now folded. It should be triangle shaped with two flaps.

, You will do this by folding the bottom of the hat upwards. Fold the bottom part of the hat below the triangle flaps upwards. Make your crease at the base of the triangular flaps.
Flip the hat over.
Fold the bottom flap of this side of the paper up, matching your fold from the other side.
You have now folded the brim of the hat.

, This will prevent the hat from coming apart.One piece at the bottom of each flap and one on each side in the middle is probably enough to keep the hat together.
You don't want to use too much tape, as this can interfere with decorating the hat.

, Be careful when putting it on so you don't tear the paper or rip off any of your decorations. If you measured your head as suggested in Part I, then you should have a hat that fits well.
Find where your hat sits comfortably on your head.
If the hat is too big, you can use staples to take in the sides. Alternatively, you can undo the folds on the hat, trim the paper to a smaller size, and repeat the folds.

, You can add whatever decorations you want to the hat, but one of the most common themes on pirate hats is the skull and crossbones design, or ""Jolly Roger"".#*Have fun! Your pirate hat can be decorated with whatever you want!


You can draw the ""Jolly Roger"" on the hat with markers or paint.
Alternatively, you could make a stencil of the Jolly Roger with construction paper.
Color or paint the hat in your favorite color, add glitter or other craft supplies to the hat for creativity.
Let any glue or paint dry before playing with your hat. While you are doing that you could try cutting out an eye patch to match your hat!
Have fun wearing your hat for play or for a costume!

Pile together 7 or 8 sheets of newspaper.,
Roll the paper diagonally.,
Tape the ends of the sword.,
Repeat the same process of rolling for the handle.",How to Make a Sword out of Paper2," You can use any paper you like, but newspaper is extra big and lends to a much more intimidating sword.


If you're feeling rather crafty, spray paint the newspaper with silver spray paint -- or whatever color sword your ninja-self might carry!

, Start at the corner and roll the paper on a diagonal until you reach the other side. The tighter you make it, the sturdier it will be.


If you roll in a tight, circular fashion, the sword will be more like a tube or light saber. If you roll it in more of an ellipse shape, it'll be more sword-like.

, Sturdy, transparent packing tape works best, but any invisible tape should do the trick. If you do have packing tape, consider taping up the entire thing -- that sucker is never gonna come apart.


If the end of your sword isn't the right shape, grab your scissors and lob off a chunk on the end. Watch out for paper cuts!

, Only this time, don't tape it up. Bend it in half around the base of your sword. Tape the sword in between the halves. Then, tape the open ends of the handle together to form one continuous base.


The more tape you use, the longer it'll stick together and the more battles it'll endure. Be generous! Now, off to slay the Visigoths!

Cut out a piece of paper to match the dimensions of your sword.,
Glue Popsicle sticks along the length of your sword.,
Wrap your sword in layers of more paper.,
Trim the tip to a point.,
Design your hilt.",How to Make a Sword out of Paper3," Include the length of the handle! If you want a sword that's 3"" (7.5 cm) wide and 15"" (37.5 cm) inches long, cut out a piece of paper with those dimensions. (Don't worry -- you can just tape two regular A4s together if one isn't long enough.)

, Your friends are about to fight you with measly paper swords -- they didn't say anything about what you're allowed (or not allowed) to put inside your sword. This makes your sword much sturdier and more powerful.


You may want to add double the amount of Popsicle sticks to the handle; the base should be wider than the blade. If you're short on Popsicle sticks, use them for your blade; you can always bulk up the handle with more paper.

, Lining your template up with the edge of a piece of paper (of the right length), begin folding your Popsicle-lined strip in between layers of paper. When you hit the end, secure with transparent tape.


You can do this as many times as you'd like. The more paper you use, the sturdier your sword will be. Once you've reached your desired girth, tape all around the edges, making sure it won't unravel upon use.

, Different styles of swords take on different shapes -- is yours a Samurai sword? A ninja sword? More of a machete? Grab the scissors and cut the tip to whatever shape suits your dueling needs.


Once you've got that covered, tape up the tip with more transparent tape. If you don't, you'll just go around giving everyone and everything paper cuts -- a quick way to lose friends.

, There are number of ways to do this and if a light bulb moment presents itself, hold onto it. If not, you can simply fold up a piece of paper on either side of your sword, and tape it to the base. About 3"" (7.5 cm) wide and 6"" (15 cm) long will look good on a sword that's 18"" (45 cm) in length.


Some will choose to cut a hole in a rectangle of paper and insert the sword into it. Cardstock works well for this, but you could also substitute folded paper. If the hole is the right size, it should stay in place. If not, use more tape to keep it secure.

Tuck in the points at the bottom.",How to Make a Paper Penguin1," This method calls for just a single sheet of 6” x 6” origami paper. If you want a larger penguin, then you can easily go for 12” x 12” paper, but you’ll have to multiply any directions containing measurements by two. If you want an even better looking penguin, buy paper that is white on one side and black on the other., To start, you want to place the sheet of origami paper flat (with the white side facing up if you have paper with a black side as well). Then fold the paper in half diagonally so the bottom left corner is flush with the top right corner and make a crease. Unfold the paper and do the same with the opposite corners, and then unfold the page again.When you unfold the sheet again, you will have creases forming a large X across the page., With the page flat again and the large creases making an X, you will then take the lower left corner of the paper and fold it so that the tip of the corner touches the center of the page. In other words, the corner edge will touch the center of the X made by the earlier creases.Flatten the folded portion and make another crease, then open the sheet so it’s flat again.

, You will now have the large X crease as well as a smaller diagonal crease in the lower left of the page. Take the top right corner of the page and fold it over so that it touches the lower left crease.Then open the page once more.

, For the next set of folds, you’ll need to turn the page over. If you have two-colored paper, this means that the black side will now faces up. When you turn the paper over, orient it diagonally so that the current lower left corner now points up., With the paper in the new orientation, take the corner pointing left and fold the paper in half so that it’s flush with the corner pointing right.There will already be a crease here from when you made this fold on the other side of the sheet, but you’ll need to crease it in the opposite direction when you fold it over.

, From the last step, the sheet will now look like a triangle with the side on the left forming a vertical line. Take the corner of the triangle that points down and fold it across at a 45° angle.Fold it so that the horizontal edge made at the top of the fold touches the lower crease already on this part of the page—not the middle crease but the one below it.Once you’ve made the crease from this fold, turn the flap back over so that you have the same triangle shape you started with.

, A reverse fold is a bit more three-dimensional than the other folds you’ve made so far. In order to make the reverse fold, take the crease you just made and crease it in the opposite direction, but make the crease by folding and tucking the corner into the paper.Since reverse folds can be hard to visualize as written instructions, you can find the exact fold in question here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHQMzLUQMmg#t=80.

, With the reverse fold out of the way, you want to take the corner pointing right—just the top layer not both layers—and fold it back on itself. Fold it so that the flat side just above the corner lines up flush with the flat vertical line on the left side of the paper.Make a crease here, but do not unfold the flap. Leave it folded.

, You now want to turn the paper over completely and make the same fold you just made but from the other side. In other words, fold the other corner (the bottom layer from the previous step) over so that its upper edge is also flush with the same flat side of the page.Especially if you’re using a two-colored sheet of paper, this step will make more sense because the form of the penguin will start to become more apparent as the black side of the page will face outward on both sides. As the project continues to take shape, these will be the wings.

, To prepare for the next major fold, you will need to turn the whole paper over again. When you do, you want to orient the paper so that the really narrow point is pointing upward., With the paper oriented so that the long, narrow point face up, take that point and fold it over at a 45° angle so that the point now points to the left.You’ll see how this fold starts to take shape as the penguin’s beak. After making the crease in this fold, return the point to the upward position.

, This step requires you to make an outside reverse fold along the crease you made in the last step. An outside reverse fold is slightly different from the earlier reverse fold. To make the fold, unfold the paper along the black side slightly, and poke your finger from the white side at the fold you made in the last step. When the creases reverse direction, simply reform the fold so that the two black sides of the sheet are in contact again.Once again, reverse folds can be a bit difficult to describe. You can find the exact movement at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHQMzLUQMmg#t=127.

, Though clearly visible now, the wings won’t quite look perfect yet. Take the wing on the side facing up and fold it over so that the white side faces out. You’ll fold it back so that the corner which was facing the bottom left now points to the right. Pull it back far enough so that it’s just shy of where the little tail is at the bottom of the paper., Once you’ve made the crease from the previous step, fold the wing back over on itself so that the black side is once again facing up. Fold it so that the tip of the corner is just shy of touching the horizontal white edge at the bottom of the body., To make the rabbit’s ear fold, lift the portion of the wing you just folder and reverse the crease from the last step, but only at the bottom of the crease and only at the depth of roughly the tip of your finger. This will makes the bottom tip of the wing into a little flap though the flat edge will still be parallel to the rest of the wing.As with the other complex folds, a visual can help, which you will find here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHQMzLUQMmg#t=156.

, With one wing complete, you’re ready to turn the page over and repeat the same steps to form the other wing. Simply use the same folds from steps 14-16 but on the other side., The bottom of the penguin will still have points sticking out in a slightly misshapen way. Fold each of these points toward the inside of the penguin to make a flat, horizontal bottom to the body.Once you tuck these flaps up, you have your penguin!

, Do it so the top edge of the paper lines up with the left edge of the paper. The folded portion will form a triangle, with a rectangular piece remaining along the bottom. Make sure the edges line up and that you run your fingers along the crease you've created.

, Use a pair of scissors to cut the rectangular shape that is left over on the bottom of the paper. Then unfold the triangle to reveal a square-shaped piece of paper. You will use this paper to make a blade for your knife.

, This will create a blade that is at least 1- 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) thick. The paper should now look like a stick.

, Cut a slanting edge on one end of the paper that makes the paper resemble a sharp kitchen knife.

, Just staple the blade in the center and at the top edge to hold it together. You can even color the staples with white-out if you'd like to hide them more.

, The handle should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) longer than the slanted part of the blade. Measure and cut the excess paper from Step 3 to the appropriate length, and then fold it to the width you prefer for your handle.

, Just cross the handle over the blade, about 2 inches (5 cm) away from the flat end of the blade. Then, staple the two together at the point where they intersect.

, You can paint your knife silver, decorate it, or make more paper knives to keep it company.

You can also get some plastic gloves.;
, Take the newspaper and roll it up into a ball. Make sure it's nice and tight so it doesn't unroll. After, make another smaller ball and tape it to the head for the snout. Do the same with two small ears and two small horns.

, Take some newspaper (or whatever you're using) and roll it in your hands like you'd do with clay to make a snake. Once it's thick enough and long enough, tape the head you made to it. Make sure the neck is thick enough to hold up the head or else your giraffe will be headless.

, After the head and neck, you have to make the giraffe's main body part. Take the newspaper (again) and squeeze it real hard to make a round cylinder. It needs to be big enough to attach legs and the other parts. Now, tape the neck (with the head on top) to the body. You don't want the head and neck to be too heavy!

, Roll up the newspaper like you did with the neck, except make four of them. When you've done that, tape them to the main body. You might want to flatten out the bottom of the legs to get your giraffe to stand up straight.

, Tape them all and test to see if your giraffe stands up straight and is ready to be papier mâchéd!

, You can do this next part with a paint brush (a big one) or with your hands. Take the glue and paint it onto all parts of the giraffe. Once it's completely covered, put it somewhere where it can dry.

, Once your giraffe is dry, you want to paint it. This is optional, though. If you want yours to be a newspaper-giraffe, great! But if you want to paint it, go ahead. Look at some images online or read a book on giraffes to see how they look. You can paint it like a real one or you can paint it pink.

, Let it sit overnight standing up. You don't want to lay it on it's side, because then the paint will rub off on the surface you put it on. Once it's dry, you're done! Now you can go and show off you amazing papier mâchéd giraffe to everyone.

Glue the belly to the rest of the body.,
Cut a small triangle out of the orange construction paper.,
Glue the beak to the penguin’s face.,
Make the penguin’s eyes.,
Let the child customize it.",How to Make a Paper Penguin2," Since origami can be a bit difficult (and not very exciting) for younger children, the good old method of cutting and gluing construction paper might be more up their alley. This method of making a paper penguin calls for one white, one black, and one orange sheet of construction paper., To form the body of the penguin, have the child draw an oblong oval on the black construction paper with either a white crayon or a piece of chalk so that they can see the outline.One fun and silly way to help the child make the shape is to have him or her place their shoe on the sheet and trace the outline of it., Using a pair of scissors (safety scissors for younger children), have the child cut out the black oval from the construction paper. When it comes to the eyes later, you can have the child either draw them on the white paper or cut pupils out of the black paper. For the latter, you can have the child cut those out now as well.

, You can now have the child trace the white portion of the belly on the white construction paper.You can find something of the relative oblong shape to let the child trace it again or simply allow them to do it freehand.

, Once the child is done tracing the white oval, allow them to cut the shape out of the construction paper. Then use a glue stick to glue the tummy portion to the rest of the body. Glue it closer to the bottom of the body portion than the middle since the head should be above it., To make the beak for the penguin, have the child cut a small triangle out of the orange construction paper.The beak doesn’t have to be an exact triangle, so you can have the child trace it first or simply cut one out.


For very small children, the size of the beak might be too difficult for them to cut out, so you may have to help with this step.

, You have two different options to glue the beak to the penguin’s face. You can either glue the triangle flat with one of the points facing downward, or you can actually make a little fold on one of the flat sides and glue it at the tab, which will make the beak stick out from the penguin’s face.

, As mentioned earlier, you can have the child draw eyes on the white construction paper, cut them out and glue those to the penguin, or you can also have the child cut the whites of the eyes from the white construction paper, then use the black construction paper to cut out the pupils.


A third option if the child is too young to cut out such small circles is to have some googly eyes on hand from a craft store or the craft section of a big-box store. Young kids may have an easier time using a glue stick to attach google eyes instead., This makes an easy basic shape for the penguin, and then the child can have fun customizing it. If the child cuts out two really flattened ovals from the black paper, he or she can glue them to the side of the body as wings. If the child wants to make feet for the penguin, you can have them trace a leaf or something else with the slight contours to give them the webbed shape.

Fold a piece of paper.,
Cut the piece of paper into a square.,
Create creases in your square.,
Fold your paper into a smaller square.,
Open up your roof.,
Add decorations.",How to Make a Paper House2," Grab a regular 8.5""x11"" sheet of paper. The idea is to fold it up and cut it into a square. Start by folding the upper left corner of the paper down so that it lines up with the right side of the paper. Give it a crease at the corner. Now fold the bottom rectangle up and give this fold a crease too.








, Once you’re done folding you can cut along the straight crease line that you just made. You will be left with a square with a diagonal crease running through it. , Fold the square in half from the left edge to the right edge. Crease well. Then, unfold the paper. Now fold the square in half from the top edge to the bottom edge. Crease well. Again, unfold the paper. You should be left with two creases creating a plus sign through your paper.







, First, fold the top edge down so that it lines up with the horizontal crease you made in the previous steps. Then, repeat with the bottom edge, folding it up toward the crease.









Now turn the paper over. Do not undo the folds made in the previous step.
Once you’ve done this, fold the left and right edges in. They should line up with the center horizontal crease.

, To make the roof shape, open the flaps in the top corners. Flatten them so that the corners extend out past the straight edges on the bottom. It should look like an equilateral triangle. An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are of equal length. 







, Turn the house over and then draw on a door, window, and any other decoration you want. You’re done!

Be sure to crease them well. Then, unfold them and tape the sheets together. Be sure that you are taping the edges parallel to the crease you made when you folded them in half like a hamburger. Now set these two pieces aside. This sheet will be referred to as sheet A.

, You need to tape the longer side of the papers together. This sheet will be referred to as sheet B.

, The line should be about 3 inches (7.6 cm) away from the tape. Now cut along this line. Try to follow the line. This will become the front of your house.

, Set Sheet A so that the tape line is at the top. At the bottom of the larger sheet of paper, Sheet B, draw a door. You can also draw on some windows, plants, or any other decorations you want at the front of the house. , Use the creased piece of paper as the floor. Tape the bottom of the piece, Sheet B, that you just drew onto the middle of the creased piece of paper, which is Sheet A. Before you tape, make sure that the creases on the floor line up with the sides of front of the house. If they don't, you can either make a new floor following the steps above, or just re-crease the paper so that is properly aligned. , Stand the creased sides of the floor up so that they are aligned with the sides of the front of the house. Tape them to the sides of the front of the house. Don't worry if the walls of the house are too short, you’ll fix this soon. , Measure the excess space on top of your existing walls to find out how much extra space you will need. Then, cut two pieces of paper to that height. You can also draw or cut windows or other decorations on the walls at this point if you want.

, Be sure to also tape it to the front of the house for stability.

, Cut the door so that it is still connected on one side. Then, crease it so that it will swing open and closed as you wish.

, Equilateral triangles will have three sides of the same length. Now you need to cut them out. These will be the sides of your roof. If you want, you can also cut or draw windows on these to act as skylights.

, Cut out two rectangles that are 4"" wide and the length of the top of your house. For a more realistic look, draw lines or roof tiles on each of the rectangles.

, Tape each rectangle to one side of the triangles. Then, tape the tops of the rectangles together. When you are done, you should have a large 3-D rectangular prism shape.

, You should have a finished doll house! Now you can furnish it with toy doll furniture to give your dolls a beautiful paper home.

Take a sheet of paper and put it in some water. Make sure you get it really wet. , You don't want to squeeze it into a pulp, you just want it to be a soft balled up material. Eventually you should have a ball of wet paper that has the consistency of Play Dough. Add water or wring it out until you find the right consistency.

, It should look sort of like a worm. You need to wait until you get it into a clay-like substance before you do this. , You need the tray so you can make the small house and put it out in the sun later. Make 3 more little lines out of the wet paper. Place them to form a square that is missing one side. , You should make three or six more lines depending on how high you want your house to be. Put them vertically on the corners of the square that you’re making.

, After each corner has a line on it, start mixing more of the paper into a play dough consistency. Now instead of making more lines, just make them into little flat blocks. These will be your walls. Put them on the vertical lines until you have a cube that's missing 2 faces -the one on top and one of the sides should be missing.

, Be creative if you’d like, or just add a basic flat root over the top of it. You’ll follow the same process of wetting the paper to make the roof.

, This is the final step, and it will hold everything together. Now you can put your fairy house out in the woods somewhere, in your backyard, or just keep it in your house.

",How to Make a Paper Football," You can tear out a piece of ordinary paper from your notebook, or use a sheet of paper from your printer. This is the ideal size of paper for a paper football, but if the paper is a bit smaller or larger, that will work just fine too. Notebook or printer paper will work better than thicker paper or construction paper because it will be easier to fold, and because it will lighter and easier to use in a game of paper football.









Use a fresh sheet of paper so the football looks nice. This will also make it easier for you to decorate it later if you'd like to.;
, Fold one side of the paper over to the other side, either folding the right side of the paper to the left, or the left side of the paper to the right. Make sure the edges of the paper match up so that you create a neat vertical crease down the center of the paper.









Pinch the crease with your thumb and index fingers and run them along the crease to make it more firm.
To make the crease even more firm, you can unfold the two halves, turn the paper over, and fold them again, so that you've created a defined crease along both sides of the paper.
Unfold the paper after you've folded it and secured the crease.

, Use scissors to cut along the vertical crease, or just gently pull the two halves of the paper apart along the crease, using your hands to slide the two halves in opposite directions. This will create two tall strips of paper that are 4.25"" wide and 11"" tall.









You will only need to use one strip to create one paper football -- if you like, you can use the other to create another football later.

, This will create a strip of paper that is half as wide and twice as thick. Place the half vertically in front of you.








, The right side of the triangle should line up with the right side of the vertical strip. The top edge of the triangle should be parallel to the top edge -- the width -- of the paper. This will essentially create a right triangle, with the right angle of the triangle on its top right side.








, This will create another, thicker triangle.








, Once you become a pro at creating paper triangles, you'll be able to create many triangles of almost equal length.








, Fold the top corner down so that the two points meet, creating two triangles. Don't worry if it's not a perfect triangle -- it takes practice to get it right.








, You can also tear off the extra paper or even leave it in place, taking extra care when you tuck it in.








,, Smooth down the triangle until you have a flat paper football. Now that it's ready, you can start being a champion paper football player.








, If you'd like to give your paper football a personalized touch, use a marker or pen to draw stitch marks and other defining features of a football on it.

Consider painting the base item.",How to Mod Podge1," The ideal candidate for Mod Podging is thin, flexible, and porous. You will be gluing this onto something else. If the item you choose is too bulky, the Mod Podge won't hold it, and it will fall off. Here are some ideas:


Fabric and lace
Paper, including scrapbooking paper and tissue paper
Photos are great to use, but it might be a good idea to use a copy instead of an original
Glitter, Epsom salts, and sand
Food coloring can also be mixed into Mod Podge to tint items another color
Leaves;
, You can use Mod Podge to apply things like paper and fabric to almost anything. The best items to use are bulky items that you can hold. Here are some items to get you started:


Wooden and papier-mâché frames, trays, and boxes
Glass cups, candle holders, and mason jars
Terra cotta pots and vases
Other 3D, such as trays, figurines, etc.

, You can either use a flat paintbrush or a foam brush. If you are going to use a paintbrush, look for something that has firm, but smooth, bristles, such as taklon. Avoid boar-bristle brushes, as they are too stiff and will leave streaks. Camelhair brushes are too soft to be used with Mod Podge.

, Mod Podge can be used as both a glue and a finish. This means that you can paint it over paper to make it glossy. Here are some common finishes and what they are:""Classic"" is your basic Mod Podge. It comes in glossy or matte.
""Satin"" gives you a finish that is between glossy and matte.
""Hard Coat"" gives you a durable finish, idea for furniture. It comes only in a satin finish.
""Outdoor"" is durable and water-resistant. It is not water-proof, however, and cannot sit in water.
""Sparkle"" already has glitter mixed into it. It's great for adding some sparkle to any surface. For a heavily-glittered finish, however, you will need to mix extra glitter into the Mod Podge.
""Glow-in-the-Dark"" can be painted over a surface to make it glow at night. It is thin, however, and will require multiple coats.

, Some items, such as paper, are ready to be applied to your base items. Other items, such as fabric, need a little more preparation in order to get the best results. Here is a list of items commonly used for Mod Podging, and how to best prepare them:Fabric needs to be washed and ironed. Washing will remove excess dye and help prevent bleeding. Ironing will make the fabric smooth and easier to work with.
Paper, including scrapbooking paper, is ready to use as it is. You do not need to do anything to it.
Paper printed from a laser printer does not need preparation. Paper printed from an inkjet printer will. Click here to learn how to prepare it.
Photographs will need to be photocopied onto regular paper. Photograph paper is not suitable for Mod Podging. The moisture can cause the ink to melt off.
Tissue paper does not need any preparation. Keep in mind, however, that it is thin and may wrinkle. It may be a good idea to have extra sheets, in case the first one wrinkles or tears.
Natural items need to be wiped clean with a damp cloth and then dried.

, Print what you need to print, then let the paper dry for 10 minutes. Spray the front and back of the paper with an acrylic sealer. Wait for it to dry, then paint both sides with Mod Podge. Let the paper dry all the way before you use it for your project.







, Whether you are using wood or glass, you will need to prepare your base. If you don't, the Mod Podge may not stick well, and whatever your Mod Podges may fall off. Here are common surfaces that people use for Mod Podging projects, and how to prepare them:








Wood surfaces need to be sanded with fine-grit sandpaper, and then wiped clean with a dust cloth. If you don't have a dust cloth, use a damp cloth or sponge instead.
Glass needs to be washed with soap and warm water. You can wipe it with some rubbing alcohol to remove any residue.
Primed canvas needs to be wiped clean with a damp cloth. Un-primed canvas needs to be coated with two layers of gesso or acrylic paint.
Plastic needs to be cleaned with soap and water. Keep in mind that some types of plastic may repel the Mod Podge. If this happens, you will need to find another surface.
Plaster, Papier-Mâché, and Terra Cotta surfaces need to be wiped clean with a damp cloth to remove any surface dirt and dust.
Tin needs to be washed with soap and warm water. If it is very dirty, wipe it clean with a cloth soaked in white vinegar.

, You will need to have the item you are Mod Podging already the right side before you start applying it. Set the frame or box down on the paper or fabric, and trace around it using a pencil. Cut the paper or fabric out using a pair of scissors or a craft knife.









If you want to Mod Podge a round item, like a can, measure the height of the item, and cut the paper/fabric according to that height. Next, wrap the paper/fabric around the cylinder, and mark where it starts to overlap. Cut off the excess paper/fabric.

, Mod Podge can be used as a sealer to protect painted surfaces. You can paint your base item all one color, and Mod Podge cut paper or lace onto it. You can also paint designs onto it, and use Mod Podge as a finish.









Keep in mind that Mod Podge is not water-proof. It will dissolve if you leave it in water too long.

Apply a layer of Mod Podge to the base item.,
Cover the back of the item you will be applying with Mod Podge.,
Place the item you are Mod Podging onto your base item and smooth it down.,
Allow the Mod Podge to dry for at least 15 to 20 minutes.,
Apply a top coat of Mod Podge to the entire surface and allow to dry.,
Apply a second coat of Mod Podge to the surface and allow to dry.,
Wait for the Mod Podge to dry before using your project.,
Consider sealing the item with acrylic sealer.",How to Mod Podge2," You can use a paintbrush or a foam brush. Simply brush on a thin layer, going from edge to edge. The finish of your Mod Podge does not matter so much at this point since you will be covering it anyway.









If you are covering more than one side of an item, such as a box, then work on one side at a time.
If you are covering a round object, consider setting the object down on a mug or in a bowl so it doesn't roll away. Work on one small patch at a time.
If your item is very dark, and you are using a light-colored fabric or paper, consider painting your item white first.

, Place the fabric, lace, paper, etc. down on your work surface so that the back is facing you. Apply a layer of Mod Podge using a paintbrush or foam brush.








, Carefully lift the fabric, paper, or whatever you are using, and flip it over. Press it wet-side-down onto your base item. Gently smooth it until you do not see anymore wrinkles or air bubbles. You can use your fingers or a brayer to smooth it.









To get the best results, start smoothing from the center, and work your way outwards., Try to keep it some place where it won't get disturbed. If there is a lot of dust in your area, turn a box on its side and place the item inside the box.

, Brush it on using thin, even strokes. Don't worry if the layer is thin; you will be adding more coats. It will take one hour for the Mod Podge to dry. If you see any brush strokes, wait until the Mod Podge is dry, then gently buff them away using 400-grit sandpaper. Wipe the surface after sanding with a dust cloth.








, You can add another coat for extra durability, once it dries.








, Most types of Mod Podge will be dry and usable after 24 hours. The Hardcoat variety will require 72 hours., This will make the finish more durable, and reduce stickiness/tackiness.Be sure to match the finish of the acrylic sealer to the Mod Podge. If you used glossy Mod Podge, use an acrylic sealer with a glossy finish. If you used matte Mod Podge, use an acrylic sealer with a matte finish.

Fill a mason jar with 1 ½ inches (3.81 centimeters) of Mod Podge.You will be spreading this Mod Podge around inside the jar.,
Add a few drops of food coloring and stir with a stick.,
Hold the jar on its side and rotate it until the colored Mod Podge covers the entire inside.,
Turn the jar upside down to drain the excess dye.,
Wait 30 to 60 minutes for the dye to dry partway.,
Bake the jars, up-side down, in a warm oven.,
Let the jars bake for 10 minutes.,
Flip the jars over and let them back for 20 to 30 minutes more.,
Take the jars out and let them cool.,
Consider decorating the jar with puff paint to make it look more interesting.,
Use the tinted glass jar properly.",How to Mod Podge3," This will give you a more even finish than just painting it on. It will not be water proof, however.









If you want a translucent look, use glossy Mod Podge.
If you want a frosted or sea glass look, use matte or satin Mod Podge.

, The more food coloring you add, the brighter color your will get. Be sure to stir the Mod Podge and food coloring well; you do not want to see any streaks or swirls. The tinted Mod Podge will look pastel at first, but it will turn clear and bright once it dries.









Consider stirring in a few teaspoons of water. This will make the Mod Podge flow easier in the next step., If you are worried about making a mess, hold the jar over a pad of newspaper or a paper plate.








, Place the jar on top of some popsicle sticks. This will prevent the dye from pooling around the rim.If you don't have popsicle sticks, you can also use pieces of cardboard or plastic knives.








, This will allow the excess dye to flow down the sides of the jar and drain out. After the time is up, you can turn the jar right-side up and let it air-dry for 24 to 48 hours. You can also help it dry faster by placing it into a warm oven. Read on to learn how to do this.


Air drying will give you fewer air bubbles., Line a baking sheet with some aluminum foil, and place the jars upside down on it. Put the baking sheet inside a pre-heated oven; use the lowest temperature you can.








, As they continue to bake, they will start to turn clear., Pull the baking sheet out of the oven and flip the jars over so that they are right-side-up. Be sure to wear some oven mitts to protect your hands. It is very important that you flip the jars over; if you don't, they will become stuck to the baking sheet.








If you still see streaks in the jars after 30 minutes, put them back into the oven and let them bake some more.

, This may take a few minutes to a few hours. Avoid placing the jars in a cold area or running them under cold water. This may cause the glass to crack. The cold water will also cause the dye to fall off.








, You can find puff paint in the t-shirt and tye dye section of most arts and crafts stores. If you can't find any puff paint, try some 3D or dimensional paint instead.









To create a Moroccan style lantern: draw designs using black, gold, or silver puff paint. Then, use superglue to attach small, colorful gemstones to the jar.
To create a stained class effect: draw designs on the jar using black puff paint. Make sure that the designs connect, like with real stained glass.

, The tint is not permanent, so you cannot use the jar for drinking out of. Water will cause the tint to dissolve and fall off. Also, avoid using real candles inside the jar. Try to use battery-operated ones instead.









If you want to use your tinted mason jar as a vase, put a thin, glass vase or candle votive inside it. Fill the vase or votive with water, and put the flowers in. Be careful not to get any water inside the jar itself.

Consider working over a sheet of paper.,
Paint the surface you want to be glittered with glossy Mod Podge.,
Shake the glitter onto the surface.,
Tap the excess glitter off.,
Wait for the Mod Podge to dry before moving on.,
Seal the item once the Mod Podge is dry.",How to Mod Podge4," This way, when you are done, you can fold the paper in half and funnel the glitter back into its container.

, If you use matte or satin Mod Podge, then your finish won't be as shiny. You can also use Epsom salts to create something that looks like ice or snow. You can also use sand, for a fun, beach-themed item.









If you are going to use more than one color of glitter, then paint the area where you want the first color to go. You will need to let this first color dry completely before moving onto the next.
If you want to only glitter part of the item, mask off what you don't want glittered with painter's tape or an adhesive stencil.
If your item is very dark, and you are going to use epsom salts or a lighter color of glitter, consider painting the item white first.

, Try using more glitter than you think you will need. A thick layer will be fine. If you are applying glitter to a jar or cup, try to hold the item from the inside so you don't get your fingers dirty. You can also turn the jar or cup upside down and stick it on top of a narrow soda bottle or water bottle; this will hold the jar/cup steady while you work.









The best sort of glitter to use for this would be the extra fine crafting glitter. You can find it in the scrapbooking section of an arts and crafts store. The standard, chunky glitter will also work, but it will look more coarse.
T=If you are using Epsom salts, consider mixing in some clear or iridescent glitter. This will give you more of a snowball effect.

, Turn the item on its side, and tap the glitter off. Be careful not to touch any area that you just glittered, or you may create a smudge or dent.








, If you want to add another color, let the Mod Podge dry for one hour before adding more colors. If you are done adding the glitter, remove any masking tape and wait 24 hours.

, Choose an acrylic sealer with an appropriate finish, and lightly spray the item. If you need to apply more than one coat, let the sealer dry first before spraying the item again. You will need to lead the sealer all the way before you can use your project. Most sealers will take about four hours to dry, but you might want to refer to the instructions on the can for a more specific drying time.









If you used glitter, use a glossy sealer.
If you used Epsom salts, do not use a sealer.
If you used sand, you can try lightly spraying the surface with a matte sealer.

Finished.








",How to Make a Cootie Catcher (Origami Fortune Teller)," To make a fortune teller/cootie catcher, you must use a piece of paper that is in the shape of a square. If you have a rectangular piece of paper, you can fold it into a square and cut off the excess. To do this, fold one corner of the paper diagonally across until the edges line up. There should be a long rectangular piece of unfolded paper left on the bottom, which should be removed by cutting or tearing.






;
,, With your paper now in the shape of a square, fold it in half so that the edges line up and you’re left with a rectangular shape. Crease the edge so that the fold is defined and secure. Then, unfold the paper back into the shape of a square.








, When your paper has been unfolded back into its original square shape, fold it in half again but this time in the opposite direction of the previous fold. Crease the fold to keep it in place, and then unfold the square again. The square should have a large ‘X’ going through the center of it now.








, Work your way around the square, folding each of the corners in towards the center. There should be a rather defined center point as a result of your previous folding, so matching up the four corners in the center should be easy. You should be left with a (folded, obviously) smaller square/diamond shape.








, Flip your folded paper over so that the previously folded corners are facing downwards, and the flat, smooth top side of the paper is facing you. Repeat the aforementioned step of folding all the corners inward to meet at the center. This will once again leave you with a smaller square/diamond shape.








, Your cootie catcher is in the final stages of folding! Before you finish up the main shape, reassert the creases by folding the paper in half in both directions. This will make the cootie catcher easier to open up.








, Flip the paper back over, and there should be four small squares that are formed and are open at the corners. Pull these outwards, and the center should fold inwards a bit. Insert your fingers into the empty spaces, and you should be finished!







, Typically there are three main sections of the cootie catcher that need to be labeled. When you are holding the catcher, each of the four corner tabs should be labeled with a color. When you flatten out the catcher, the inside tabs should be labeled on the outside with a number. Lastly, each of the inner tabs should be labeled with a fortune

You can also opt to cut a more traditional flower shape.You can fold and crease the petals to give them more texture and dimension if you like.;
, One option for creating the center of your flower is to use small black beads that resemble seeds.


To do this, thread approximately 20 black beads onto a piece of flexible craft wire, making sure the wire is bent at one end to prevent the beads from slipping off. Then twist the beaded wire into a tight spiral shape.
Leave enough excess wire to create a stem for your poppy and then poke the bare end through the center of your petals, securing it with a dab of glue.
If you want the center of your flower to be a bit wider, you can add a small black piece of paper between the petals and the beads.

, If you don't have beads on hand, you also have many options for creating the center out of paper.


The easiest option is to simply cut a small circle from black or green construction paper, decorating it with paint, beads, or sequins if you like.
If you want a more elaborate design, try cutting a long, thing strip of green construction paper and wrapping it into a tight coil, securing it with glue so it doesn't come apart. Then wrap a wider piece of black paper around the green coil, making sure the two pieces are flush at one end. Secure this with glue as well, and then use a pair of scissors to cut vertical slits in the black paper, creating a fringe. You can use white paint to embellish the ends of the fringe if you like., In order to finish assembling your paper poppy, you must add (or complete) your stem.


If you used wire to attach the center of your flower, you will already have a stem, but it will be bare wire. To dress it up a bit, wrap green crepe paper tightly around it, attaching it with craft glue. You can also create crepe paper leaves on your stem if you like.
If your flower does not have a stem yet, you can attach a green pipe cleaner or stem wire for a stem. Depending on how sturdily you need your stem to be attached to your flower, you can opt to glue it to the back of the flower or poke a small hole in the center of the flower, wrapping the pipe cleaner through and gluing the center of the flower on top of the hole."

You can also use red paper plates if you want a sturdier flower.If you want layered petals, you can cut four large and four small hearts. Using a template will help keep your hearts uniform.

, If you to create a more advanced poppy petal, you can use two red of construction paper, which you will need to fold and cut in a specific pattern,Fold the first square in quarters, forming a smaller square. Then fold the square in half diagonally, forming a right triangle. Lastly, place the triangle in front of you with the right angle at the bottom left and draw an arch around the very bottom of it, creating a cone shape with a rounded edge. Cut along this line and unfold the paper, revealing four petals.
Do the same with the second square, but draw your arch higher up on the triangle so you are left with a smaller cone. When you unfold your second square, it should look exactly like the first, only smaller.

, The center of your flower can be a simple black or green circle cut out from construction paper, or it can be more elaborate.You can glue beads or sequins to the center of the flower for a bit of sparkle.
You can also use paint markers to draw the poppy flower's pistil.
For a three-dimensional look, you can borrow one of the ideas for creating the center of a crepe paper poppy.

, Use craft glue to assemble the petals first, and then the center of the flower.


If you used hearts, simply arrange them in a circle, overlapping the points in the center.If you chose to use two layers of hearts, arrange the larger hearts first and then place the smaller hearts on top, slightly staggered. If you want to give your poppy some more dimension, you can bend the top layer towards the center slightly.
If you started with two paper squares, place the smaller petals on top of the larger petals, staggering them so the rounded sections of the smaller petals fall between the rounded sections of the larger petals. Attach in the center with a small dab of glue., If you plan on hanging your poppies on the wall, you don't need to add a stem at all. If you want one, cut a thin strip of green construction paper and glue it to the back of your flower.Green construction paper can be used to create small leaves along the stem as well.
If you want to be able to attach the flower to something other than the wall, glue a green pipe cleaner to the back instead of construction paper.

;
, Trace along the inside edge of your shape to create a ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) border. Poke a hole in your shape, then cut along your lines. Save the border and discard the inside shape.








If your border is symmetrical, keep it folded, cut out the inside shape, then unfold it.
If you want your sun catcher to be the same on both sides, you will need to make another border for the back. Use your first border as a guide for the second one.

, There is no right or wrong way to do this, so you can get really creative here. You can cut the tissue paper into small squares, rectangles, or triangles. You can also tear them into random shapes instead.








Try to use at least two different colors.
Aim to make the pieces about 1 to 3 inches (2.54 to 7.62 centimeters).

, Cut off a sheet of contact paper a little larger than your border. Peel off the backing, and set it down on the table, sticky-side up. Tape down the corners so that it stays put.








, Try to center it as much as possible so that you have a little bit of contact paper all around the border. If you made two borders, set the second one aside for now.








If you can see your tracing lines, make sure that they are facing up. This way, they will be on the inside of the sun catch and not visible in the finished piece.

, It's time to get creative again! Take your colored pieces of tissue paper, and start filling in the border. Try to overlap the tissue paper pieces so that there are as few gaps as possible.









It's okay if some of the pieces extend onto the border, or even beyond it. You will be trimming it down later.

, Cut off another sheet of contact paper. Peel away the backing, and set it down on top of the sun catcher. Run your fingernail along the outside edges of the border to seal everything in.









If you made a second border, glue it down on top of the sun catcher first. Make sure that it is aligned with the first one.

, Leave a slight border of contact paper around it, about ⅛-inch (0.32 centimeter). This will help hold the sun catcher together.








, Poke a hole in the top of your sun catcher and thread a piece of string through it. Tie the ends of the string together to make a loop. Hang the sun catcher in a bright, sunny window.

Get your tissue paper ready.,
Cut out the petals.,
Curl and wrinkle the tissue paper slightly.,
Create the blossom.,
Secure the paper rose petals with wire.",How to Make Tissue Paper Roses1," Select a color of tissue paper for your rose's petals. You may use natural rose colors, such as red, pink, white, orange, yellow, and lavender.Instead, you may get creative and use other colors or even patterned paper. Black roses can look both elegant and morbid if you're decorating for a Halloween party. When making open roses, you may use multiple colors in one ""flower"" to make a rainbow.;
, Using scissors, cut out eight round pieces of tissue paper roughly the same size.Don't try to make the pieces perfect circles, as roses are not spheres. The pieces may be any size, just keep in mind that their diameter will be roughly half the width of the finished rose.

, This will make the petals look more realistic. Stack the petals on top of one another. Place the bottom end of a pen on top of the petals. Curl the pieces around the pen and move the pen up and down and side to side., Separate out the stack of petals. Take the first petal and twist it tightly into a cone shape. Wrap a second petal into a cone around the first petal starting roughly one centimeter below its top. Repeat this with three more petals. For the final three petals, wrap only about a quarter of each petal into the cone and leave the rest flat. These bottom petals should encircle the entire rose.

, Cut a roughly 10 centimeter piece of thin-gauge wire. Wrap the wire underneath the rose where the petals twist together. Fluff the bottom petals over the wire to disguise it."

Flip it over and repeat on the other side.,
Admire your fancy work and adjust as necessary.,
Hang your piece of art with clear fishing line.,
Finished.








",How to Make Tissue Paper Pompoms1," It doesn't matter the color. You can use the same colors, vary different colors, or use similar-toned colors for a more flowery look.









The best places to get tissue paper are GIANT, AC Moore, Michaels, or general craft supply stores. In many stores you can find it in the packaging section where the wrapping paper is.;
, This should be the floor or a fairly large, cleared countertop.









Accordion fold together starting from the shorter side. Make sure the fold is creased and about 1-1/2 inch wide. Fold as if you were making a paper fan.

, Loop the wire around the center of the folded papers and twist.









This should be done once all the folding is finished. Cut the floral wire if there is too much excess.
If you desire a more modern, festive look, cut the edges to a point.
If you're going for a softer, flowery look, round the edges.

, Pull one by one and fluff up as you go.









Be careful! The tissue paper rips easily. Only do about half of the papers on each side so you end up with a ball.

, Make each side as even as possible.








, You may need to mess it around a bit to see how it falls.








, This makes your pompoms appear as if they're floating!









You may tie a length of monofilament to floral wire as an alternative.

Tape down a sheet of wax paper to your work surface.You can also use freezer paper or even a plastic sheet protector.If you are using freezer paper, make sure that the shiny side is facing up.You will be peeling your sun catcher off of this once it dries.








,
Cut or tear colored tissue paper into smaller pieces.,
Brush some glue onto the wax paper.,
Lay down some pieces of tissue paper onto the glue.,
Brush some more glue over the tissue paper patch.,
Let the glue dry before peeling the tissue paper off.,
Consider making a border.,
Brush a thin layer of glue onto your border.,
Place the tissue paper patch onto the border.,
Trim off any excess tissue paper.,
Hang the sun catcher indoors in a bright window.",How to Make Tissue Paper Suncatchers2,", Use at least two different colors and make the pieces about 1 to 3 inches (2.54 to 7.62 centimeters). Other than that, you can get really creative here. You can cut or tear the tissue paper into small squares, rectangles, triangles, strips, etc.








, Squeeze some glue onto a paper plate (or another scrap of wax paper). Use a paintbrush or a foam brush to apply a thin layer of glue to a small section of your wax paper.








Don't make the section too big, or the glue will dry before you lay all of the tissue paper pieces down. You can always add more glue later.

, Make sure that you overlap them slightly. Don't worry if the glue soaks through the tissue paper. You will be covering them with more glue later on.








, Extend the glue past the edges of the patch to help seal everything in. At this point, you can make your design bigger by adding more glue to the wax paper, and covering it with more tissue paper. Remember to coat everything with a thin layer of glue when you are done.







, Glue doesn't stick very well to slippery surfaces, such as wax paper, which is a good thing for this project. Once the glue dries, carefully peel your tissue paper design off of the wax paper. You should now have a thin sheet of patchy tissue paper.








, This is completely optional. If you do not wish to make a border, simply cut your tissue paper into a shape and hang it in a bright window.If you'd like to make a border, follow the steps below:









Cut a simple shape out of a sheet of black paper.
Cut a second shape out of from the inside, leaving a ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) border.
Keep the border and discard the inside shape.
Consider making a second border for the back of the sun catcher. Use the first border as your guide.

, If you made a second border for the back, set it aside for right now.







, Smooth it down with your hands so that it sticks to the glue. If you made a second border for the back, glue it on top of your sun catcher now. Make sure that it's aligned.







, You will most likely have some tissue paper sticking out from behind your border. To make your sun catcher look neater, trim this excess tissue paper off with a pair of scissors.








, Punch a hole near the top of your sun catcher. Thread some string through the hole. Tie the string into a loop, then hang it up.

Select your tissue paper.,
Rumple one sheet of tissue paper.,
Smooth the paper back out and cut it in half.,
Roll the paper into a rose.,
Secure the flower.",How to Make Tissue Paper Roses2," Keep in mind that these flowers will be made of a single sheet each. You won't be able to make multicolored roses like you can with open flowers unless you use patterned paper. Start with whatever size tissue paper you can find. Typical craft tissue paper sizes are around 50 square centimeters.

, Crumple the paper into a ball. The wrinkled texture will give your rose volume. Be careful not to tear the paper., If your paper is a rectangle, cut it lengthwise. Each half can make its own flower. Take one half and fold it in half again lengthwise., Keep the folded edge on top. Take the bottom corner and begin rolling the paper like a cinnamon roll. Move the paper lower as you go so that the center of the rose is slightly higher than the gradually sloping outer layer., Finish rolling the paper by twisting the last edge tightly under the bottom of the flower. Wrap either a small piece of thin-gauge wire or a green pipe cleaner around the bottom tip to hold the blossom in place. You may also gently insert a wooden dowel through the bottom to both act as support and the base of the stem."
"
Measure and cut a roughly 84 centimeter long piece of heavy wire.,
Fold the wire into thirds to make it the right thickness for a stem.,
Cut out the leaves.,
Roll the leaves around a pen.,
Wrap the wire or pipe cleaner around the bottom of the flower.,
Add the leaves.",How to Make Tissue Paper Roses3," Be sure not to leave jagged ends where you cut. Sharps ends can both prick you and tear the paper rose. A shorter green pipe cleaner may be used instead of heavy wire.

, Twist the wires together for a neater look. If you have trouble doing this by hand, use a pair of pliers. Wrap green florist tape around the wire to cover it completely. If you're using pipe cleaner, skip this step.

, Use green tissue paper. Cut out four ovals per flower in the shape of a leaf. The leaves should be as long as either the diameter of the petals for the open flower or the height of the quartered tissue paper for the closed rose.

, Bunch the leaves over the bottom end of a pen as described in Step 3 of Method 1. Curling them slightly gives them a more realistic look. Focus the curve towards one end of the leaves to mimic the main vein of a real leaf.

, Coil it tightly to keep the tissue paper from peaking through. Once the bottom of the rose is covered, start to twist the stem loosely instead. Keep twisting until the stem is about three centimeters long.

, Pinch one end of a leaf and twist the stem around it. Give the stem another few twists, and then add a second leaf. Continue this pattern for the remaining leaves. After all leaves have been added, continue making loose twists with the wire or pipe cleaner until you reach its end.

Stack four sheets of tissue.,
Cut out a 10-by-5-inch rectangle.,
Make accordion folds.,
Fold an 18-inch piece of floral wire in half.,
Separate the layers.,
Bend the wire into a loop to fit around the napkin.",How to Make Tissue Paper Pompoms2," They should be 20-by-30 inch sheets (50-by-76 cm). Choose a color that matches your napkins or is a complimentary accent. You can also use different colors in descending levels of tone for a classic, flowery feel.








, This should go through all layers and make a mini version of a hanging pompom.









Make sure to keep the papers perfectly stacked!

, They should be 3/8 of an inch (about 1 cm) wide. Any wider and you won't have enough folds to create enough volume.









They should be uniform in width; think of folding a fan.

, This is used to create the base of the pompom.









Slip it over the center of the tissue and twist to secure. Trim the ends of the tissue as you like.

Make the ends pointy for a vibrant, spicy feel; make them rounded for something a bit more romantic and feminine.



, Pull each one away from center one at a time.









Be careful not to rip the tissue! It is very delicate.

, Twist the end around the loop to secure.









This doubles as your napkin ring. If you don't like the look of the floral wire, you can cover it with ribbon or otherwise adorn it.

Choose your colors.,
Coil the quilling.,
Shape the designs.,
Paint your designs.,
Add beads and sequins.,
Glue or string multiple pieces together.,
Attach earring hooks or studs.",How to Make Quilling Earrings," Use some glue to attach five of the paper quilling strips together.Place a dot of glue on the end of each strip and use this to connect it to the next strip. You will need the extra material to make a dome or cone.
, Begin coiling the paper quilling using a quilling needle. Wrap the quilling paper around the needle over and over again until it forms a tight coil.It is important to create a tight coil when making quilling domes and cones. This will look better and be more secure than a loose coil.

, Once you have formed the coil, you can begin to push out the center to shape the coil into a dome or cone. Use a quilling mini mold to shape the quilling into a dome shape. Press the coil over the mini mold to form it into a dome.If you don’t have a mini mold, then you can also use a thimble to help you shape the coil. Or, you can also just use your fingertip, but your results may not be as precise.

, The colors you use can change the outcome of your project. Quilling comes in many different colors, so you have lots of options. Try choosing a few different types of quilling in coordinating colors.

For example, you could choose black and white quilling, pink and green, or yellow and blue. Opt for colors that look good to you and that will work for your design.
Consider what you want your design to look like as well. For example, if you are making heart shapes, then opt for pinks and reds.If you are making a cone for a Christmas tree, then use green quilling.

, You will need to use a quilling needle to coil your quilling. Wrap the end of the quilling around the quilling needle and then begin to turn the needle to wrap the quilling around it. Keep turning the needle and coiling the quilling until you reach the end.To make your coils larger, use multiple strips of quilling. Just glue the ends of the strips together before coiling them.
For flat quilling designs, you can coil the quilling tightly or leave it loose to create different designs.

, You can shape the flat coils into different shapes by pressing on the edges. You can leave the quilling in a circle, squeeze the sides to make it into an oval, or press on all four sides to shape it into a square.You can make a heart shaped quilling design by making two coils, loosening them slightly, and then pinching them on the ends to make a teardrop design. Then, glue the two pieces together along the flat edges to create a heart shape.You could even try using a mold to help you shape your quilling. For example, if you have a small star shaped cookie cutter, then you could place a loose spiral into the mold and push out towards the edges of the mold to form the shape into a star.

, You can use puffy paint or some regular acrylic paint to add interest to your quilling earring pieces. Try adding some polka dots around the edges or paint over the entire piece with a solid color.

If you want to add some fine details, you can try painting them onto the quilling pieces, such as a word or initials or some small flowers. Use a fine tipped paint brush to make it easier to create small designs on your quilling pieces.

, You can also glue some beads and/or sequins onto your quilling piece. Try adding a border of beads to the bottom edge of a dome shaped quilling piece. Or, add some sequins around the top and side edges of a flat quilling piece to add some sparkle.You can try adding other notions to your quilling designs as well. For example, if you think some small pom poms would look cute, then glue some on. If you want to add a button, go for it!

, After you have made your quilling pieces for the earrings, you can either glue them together or string them together. The way that you connect your pieces depends on the types of pieces you have created.

For example, if you have made a couple of different sized cones or domes, then it would probably be better to string them together using a needle and some nylon thread.
For flat pieces, it may be easier to glue them together and let them sit until they are dry. You can glue together different sized coils together inside of a large coil, or glue a few different pieces together to form a shape, such as a flower.However, you will still need to add a string to attach the quilling earring pieces to the earring hooks.
If you have multiple pieces that you want to hang from the earrings, make sure to string them together in the order you want them to appear.

, When you are satisfied with your quilling earring pieces, you can either attach them to earring hooks or studs.

To finish hook style quilling earrings, insert the top part of the string through the hoop and tie it to secure the quilling pieces to the earring hook.
To finish earrings on studs, glue the quilling piece to the earring stud and allow to dry for several hours or overnight.

Open up the wings to either side of the clothes pin.,
Make the antenna out of a pipe cleaner.,
Clip the antenna into the clothespin.,
Decorate the clothespin body.",How to Make Tissue Paper Butterflies1," For a more colorful butterfly, cut each square from a different color. This will make the wings.To save time, stack the papers first, and then cut them all at once.;
, Make sure that the corners and edges are aligned. If you are using more than one color, stack them in an order that you like.

, Fold the bottom edge up by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Flip the paper over and fold it up by another inch (2.54 centimeters). Keep flipping and folding in this manner, until you get a fan or accordion.


Keep the papers together while you are folding them. Treat them as one sheet of paper.
Consider cutting a small notch or V-shape into each end of the folded fan/accordion. This will give your butterfly a more interesting design.

, Make sure that you are clipping the clothespin onto the folded edges of the folded paper, and not the top/flat part. The paper will scrunch up a little, but that is okay; when you open it up, you'll have beautiful wings.

, The wings should be sticking out to either side of the clothespin, just like the wings of a butterfly. If they open up more like an umbrella instead, simply twist and rotate them until they are facing the right way


If you'd like, you can gently fluff the wings up too.

, Fold a pipe cleaner in half into a V-shape. Curl each end into a small O-shape or a tight spiral., Position it just above the folded tissue paper. Everything should be fitted snugly in the groove part of the clothespin.

, You can color it with markers or with paints. You can even glue on tiny googly eyes or draw a silly face. To make an extra fancy butterfly, decorate the body with glitter glue and rhinestones.

Decide what types of jumps you'd like to make.,
Decide whether you want quickly made jumps that will be impermanent or permanent jumps that can be stored and brought out and played with again.",How to Make Model Horse Jumps1," If you're not sure what types of jumps exist, do an image search for horse jumps online. For example, you can make a log jump, corner jump, steps jump, or a castle jump. Keep in mind what materials you have and not making the jump too complicated.

A log jump can be as simple as finding a piece of wood that looks like a log.



 


Here is an example of a jump with bars:






Here is another type of jump:







,

Impermanent jumps can be set up on the spot, wherever you are. For example, if you're outdoors, you can help stones up.
Permanent jumps will usually require a base or stand, and some gluing, nailing or tying methods used to keep the jump in one piece.

Fold a sheet of black construction paper in half widthwise, and draw half of a butterfly.Don't make the butterfly too small!,
Cut the butterfly out, following the lines that you drew.,
Cut out the inside of the butterfly, ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) from the outline.When you unfold your butterfly, you should have an outline of a butterfly.,
Place the butterfly frame down on a sheet of clear contact paper.,
Cut the tissue paper into squares.,
Stick the tissue paper onto the wings.,
Cover the butterfly with another sheet of contact paper.,
Cut around the butterfly.,
Hang your butterfly in a bright window.",How to Make Tissue Paper Butterflies2," It should be almost the same size as the paper. Also, make sure that the body of the butterfly is aligned with folded part of the paper. This makes the outer part of your frame.


Use a white crayon or colored pencil so that you can see the line easily.
You can make up your own butterfly, or find a template online to use., Keep the folded while you cut. This way, when you unfold your paper, your butterfly will look the same on both sides.

, The wings should be hollow. This will make the inner part of the frame.


If you'd like your butterfly to have a solid/black body, only cut out inside the wings. Don't extend the frame to the fold.

, Cut a sheet of contact paper a little bit bigger than the butterfly. Peel off the backing, and set it down on the table, sticky-side-up. Place the butterfly frame down onto the contact paper., Make them between 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters). Use lots of different colors to make your butterfly look more interesting. You can even cut some of the squares into rectangles inside.

, The tissue paper will stick to the contact paper, so you don't have to use any glue. This will create the stained glass effect.


If you cut out a hollow body, stick the tissue paper onto there as well.

, Make sure that the contact paper is large enough to cover the entire butterfly. Peel off the backing, and slowly place it over the butterfly, going from one side to the next. Smooth it down with your hands or a ruler to seal it.

, Leave a ¼ -inch (0.64 centimeters) boarder of contact paper around the butterfly to seal it in and keep it from coming apart.

, Punch a hole through one of the wings, and thread a piece of thread through it. Tie the thread into a loop, and hang it someplace where the light will shine through it.You can also tape the butterfly to a window if you won't want to punch a hole through its wings.
The side with the black outline is the front, and the tissue paper side is the back.

Keep assembling and attach your butterflies until you have as many as you like on your garland.",How to Make Tissue Paper Butterflies3," Fold a sheet of paper in half. Sketch out half of a butterfly and then cut it out. This will make your template which you will be basing the rest of your butterflies on. It will make your garland more consistent.Make the butterfly no more than 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) tall.
You should only draw and cut the wings; don't worry about the body. You will be making it out of pipe cleaner later.

, Make sure that the folded part of the tissue paper is nestled against the folded part of the butterfly. You will be cutting the tissue paper one color at a time, then arranging and assembling the colors later on.

, Take the cut tissue paper butterflies out of the template and unfold them. Set them down in a neat pile, and move on to the next color. You will need three different colors.

, Cut the pipe cleaners in half using a pair of pliers or wire cutters. Bend each cut pipe cleaner in half. You will get two butterflies out of one pipe cleaner. Cut and fold as many as you need.

, To save time, make all of your stacks now, so that they will be all ready for you. You can stack the colors in the same order, or alternate them. You can also make some butterflies all one color.

, Scrunch the middle of the butterfly slightly, then slide it into the bent pipe cleaner. Measure up about half way up the pipe cleaner, and twist it twice. This closes the body.If you don't wish to use these butterflies on a garden, you are finished. Gently spread the antenna apart, and curl each end for that final touch.

, This will give your butterflies are more fluttery appearance. Be careful so that you don't pull the wings out of the pipe cleaner body.

, Measure out your twine, and slide it between the butterfly's antenna. Twist the antenna one to two more times, then spread them apart in a V-shape. If you'd like, you can curl the ends of the antenna at this point., When you are done, hang the garland wherever you like, such as across a doorway or window.

Turn the impermanent jumps into durable jumps by building them on a base then gluing or tying them into place.",How to Make Model Horse Jumps2," You will need to either balance the items in place or use some basic structural supports to keep the jump upright.
, Choose four sturdy twigs of the same size as posts. Choose lots of thin sticks around the same size for the fence material of the jump.

Poke the four post sticks into the ground in pairs at a length that is less than the fence twigs. Keep the paired posts close together, with just enough room to slide in the twigs.
Pile the twigs in, and the posts will hold them in place as they build up to form the jump. Make it as high as you please.

, Simply build up a jump by laying craft sticks one on top of the other to the desired height. You could use rubber bands or twist ties to keep the jump in place if you're worried about knocking it over, Find wood pieces that already look as if they'll make a great jump. You can use them as they are if sufficiently large, or build them into a small wall jump., Keep them in a shoebox or similar container for safe keeping."

Look at your creation.",How to Make a Paper Ship1," Take a piece of rectangular paper and place it in front of you so the paper is in portrait format, with the longer edges to the side. Fold it in half lengthwise from top to bottom, so that the fold is at the ""top"" of the piece of paper.;
, This time fold the paper side to side, rather than top to bottom as in the first fold, then unfold. The crease marks your center line. Now you're back to after Step 1, with the paper folded in half top to bottom, but with a crease down the middle. Keep all your folds as straight and clean as possible.

, Hold the top right corner and fold the tip down and towards the center. The top edge should line up with the center line.

, Repeat. Fold the other corner in the same fashion, lining it up with the center line. This should create a ""house"" like shape with a ""big"" roof line and about an inch of paper below the triangle of the roof

, Take one edge of the bottom rectangular strip of paper and fold upwards. Fold it as high up the “house” as it will go without folding the paper beneath it.

, Repeat the last fold. Fold up the opposite rectangular strip along the bottom of the house. Make sure the two strips line up, keeping all the folds symmetrical. This makes a paper hat shape.

, Do this at the point where the diagonal creases meet. Open the hat shape slightly. Hold the two edges at the diagonal creases.

, Gently pull and flatten the hat. You should end up with a diamond-shaped piece of paper.

, Take the bottom corner of the diamond and fold upwards toward the top. Leave about a 1/4 of an inch (0.65 cm) border between the top edge and the edge of portion that has been folded-up. Once done, flip the paper over.

, Fold the bottom edge to line up with the other side. Make the same fold as with the previous step.

, Pull it apart. Flatten it down, similar to Step 8.

, Slowly pull apart. The bottom edge will flip up on its own.

, Your paper ship is now complete! It’s ready to take out for a sail on the storm-tossed seas- O.K., maybe just the backyard kiddie pool.

Use a regular A4/letter size piece of paper.,
Fold the paper in half.,
Fold the two top corners towards the middle crease.,
Fold the flap again towards the middle of the paper.,
Fold the paper in half.,
Fold the wings down.",How to Make a Simple Paper Airplane1," This is standard printer paper, and measures 8.5x11 inches. The paper needs to be rectangular, not square-shaped or cut out.;
, When folding, the orientation of the paper should be vertical, and the crease should be along this middle, longer side. Make sure the corners of the paper match up.









Use your thumb or a flat-edged tool, like a butter knife or a wooden tongue depressor, to crease the paper. When making any kind of paper airplane, make sure your creases are sharp.Unfold the paper. Do not turn it over.

, The edges of the paper should be aligned as exact as possible to the middle crease. The two outer edges of the paper should touch each other at the crease line.









This should form triangular flaps on each side of the paper. The top should be in the shape of a point.
The bottom of edge of the flap should be a straight line.

, Take the top corner of the outside edge and fold it towards the middle. Just like in step 3, the edges should meet up along the vertical  crease in the middle.









The paper should look like a dart, with a much narrower triangular flap on each sides. Most of the paper now will be in the shape of a triangle, with a point at the top.

, When folding the paper in half, make the fold along the vertical crease. You are folding one side of the paper on top of the other, so it should match up exactly. Run your finger or a blunt-edged tool along the crease to make it sharp.








, Lay the paper so that the flat crease is oriented at the bottom. Fold the paper down from the top to make a wing, leaving a few inches at the bottom. Do the same thing for the other side, making sure to fold the second wing at the exact same place as the first. When finished, it should look like a dart plane.









To make a slightly more advanced version of this basic paper airplane, just add wing tips. On the back edge of one of the wings, make a small fold. The fold will be in the shape of a small triangle. Bend it upwards so you have a wing tip that points towards the sky. Repeat on the other wing, making sure the creases of the tips match.

This paper will give you a fast plane that can glide. To make a faster plane, choose a thicker piece of paper.Planes made with thicker paper hold up better at launch, so they can be thrown harder.Using thicker paper will give your plane more speed at the expense of gliding ability.
You may also try cutting the paper first to make a smaller plane. You can cut larger, thicker pieces of paper in half to get smaller planes that can be thrown harder.;
, Find the longer sides of the paper. Fold one end over so it rests on top of the other one. Flatten the paper to leave a vertical crease running through the center of the paper. Open up the paper.The more precise your folds are, the smoother the plane will be. Any creases or areas that don’t sit flat will cause air resistance, slowing down the plane.

, On the shorter side at the top of the paper, pick up one of the corners. Fold the corner downwards so that the paper’s edge meets the center fold from before. Flatten the fold. Repeat with the other corner., Curl over one side of the paper to create a diagonal line. This line should run from the tip to about 1/4th of the way up from the bottom of the paper. Make the fold and you’ll see the top of the paper form into the triangular nose. Make an even fold on the other side to complete the nose., Refold the plane along the center fold by bringing the left or right side of the paper over onto the opposite side. The folds from the last steps will be visible on the outside of the plane, which looks like a flat triangle.

, Separate the two sides of the paper at the top of the plane. Take one side and fold it downwards about halfway to form one of the wings. Repeat with the other side.


Shorter wings also resist harder throws at launch and lead to a faster plane.You can attempt to cut the wings, but this leaves a long tail that creates more drag, slowing the plane. It is easier to start over with a smaller piece of paper.
There is no need to tape the wings in the dart design. Taping the wings also changes the weight of the plane, which can slow it down.

, Add tape around the nose, taking care not to bend it. You can also place a paper clip over it or put a coin inside the center fold. This forces the nose of the plane downward, which prevents stalls and causes the plane to pick up speed., To correct an excessive downwards flight path, adjust the back sides of the wings. Pull these ends upwards slightly to give the plane some up elevator. In most dart planes, only a small adjustment is necessary.Adding up elevator allows the plane to glide further at the cost of speed.

, When your plane flies upwards and loses speed, add down elevator. Grasp the back ends of the wings and pull them downwards slightly.


Adding down elevator causes the plane to fall faster but pick up speed.

, When the plane yaws, it turns to one side. Straighten out the flight path by adjusting the wings. Grasp the wing opposite the direction you want the plane to go. Tilt the end of this wing up and towards the center of the plane. Turn the end of the opposite wing downwards and away from center.For example, if your plane goes left, tilt the left wing upwards and to the right. Tilt the right wing downwards and to the right.

Fortify your boat.,
Use the right paper.,
Increase the flotation.,
Make the boat more stable in the water.",How to Make a Paper Ship2," There are a variety of ways to make your paper ship last longer. Applying strips of tape to the bottom, all around, is a good way to increase the ship’s water resistance.


Make two ships and put one inside the other. This will increase the water resistance as well as the overall sturdiness.
Color the ship with crayons. The wax will help the paper resist water.
Instead of tape, coating the bottom with plastic film wrap will provide a good barrier to the water.
If you plan to re-use it, let the ship dry out after use. Then wrap it in plastic to protect it.

, Using lightweight paper, such as a simple sheet of rectangular computer printer paper, is best. You can use a heavier material such as construction paper, but it will be more difficult to make clean, crisp folds. Remember, this is essentially an origami technique. Origami traditionally uses light but durable paper. Printer, or copy, paper is a happy medium for a relatively simple fold such as a paper ship.
You can also buy origami paper, or kami which is a product developed in Japan in the early twentieth century. It is often decorated and can be found in art supply stores. It is a bit lighter, but is fairly similar in weight to copy paper. You can also use newspaper, but it will be slightly less durable, and easier to tear.

, Widen the bottom by pulling out the diagonal edges. Making the bottom flatter will help the ship stay afloat longer. This will also widen the surface area of the bottom for more stability.

, Using two ships, one inside the other, help the ship have more buoyancy, as well as helping the paper be more resistant to water. Try placing small pebbles around the edge of the triangular middle part of the ship. The pebbles will act as ballast and help the ship keep upright. You can also adjust the weight placement of the pebbles to make the ship move in a straight line.

When making creases, make sure they are sharp and crisp. Use your thumb or a straight-edged tool, like a wooden depressor or a butterknife.

, The edges should meet exactly at the middle crease. The bottom of edge of the flap should be a straight line.









The flaps should make two triangles, and the tip should be in a point.

, Take the outer pointed edge and fold that corner to the center crease. Repeat on both sides.









At this stage, you will have three layers of triangular  folds. The bottom corners of the top triangular layer should meet at the center crease. The edges of the paper should be be mostly in the shape of a triangle, with the bottom edge still flat.

, The pointed tip should be folded to the bottom corners of the top triangular layer that meet at the center crease. The paper now should have a flat, truncated tip where the pointed tip was previously.








, Match the edges of the paper exactly, creating a symmetrical fold along the center crease. The folds done in steps 3 and 4 should be on the inside of the paper.








, The crease should be along the top line starting from the flat nose of the plane. The folds should match on each side of the plane.

Next, measure 5 inches from the top of the paper and make a mark there.
Draw lines to connect these points and form a square in the top left corner.;
, Take your time, there’s no rush. You want your rocket body to be sleek and clean, so try to cut true to the lines you drew.







, You’ll need a pencil and some Scotch tape for this next part.








Place the corner of your square at the tip of the pencil with the rest of the paper pointing towards the eraser.
Wrap the paper tightly around the pencil. You want to make this as tightly wrapped as possible. Keep rolling until you use all the paper to make a small, tight cylinder around the pencil.
Carefully wiggle the pencil out of the cylinder while holding the paper so that it stays rolled.
Gently use the thumb and forefinger of you other hand to push down on the top and bottom of the cylinder to make sure it’s even.
Tape around the seams in three different places (top, middle, bottom) to make sure the cylinder stays rolled. Now you’ve got a body for your rocket!

, You’ll use this to form the rocket’s nose cone. A streamline and pointy nose cone will really increase your paper rocket's aerodynamics.








Place your plastic cup on a clean area of the paper, bottom side down.
Trace around the bottom to make a perfect circle.
Make a small dot in the center of the circle.
Draw a small triangle with the tip ending at the circle. It should look like a slice of pie that is about 1/8th the size of the circle., Go slow and steady and try to keep it as a perfectly round circle.








, These next steps will help you turn your circle into a cone.








Cut out the triangle piece. Now your circle will look like Pacman.
Fold down the right and left flaps to form a cone. It will look kind of like a teepee or a party hat.
Hold it on the top and bottom with two hand and twirl it around in your finger to turn it into a pointy cone.
Use tape to seal the cone. One piece should be enough to hold the seams in place and keep your cone tight, like a dunce cap or ice cream cone.

, Now that you have both the rocket body and nose cone, it’s time to put them together. 








Put the cone on one of the rocket ends and tape them together.
It’s okay if the cone is a little bigger than the body, just make sure you mold it tightly around the cylinder and tightly seal it with tape.
You can test the seal by blowing into the open end of the cylinder. If some air leaks out, use more tape to seal it up.

, To draw a triangle, all you have to do is draw a 2 inch vertical with your ruler, and then a 1 inch horizontal line from it’s base, and connect the opposite ends with a diagonal line., You might want to use a smaller pair of scissors for this part.

, Putting wings on your rocket will make it more aerodynamic and able to cut through the air better, fly faster, and go further.








You want the shortest part of your triangle to be at the base of the cylinder, with the tall vertical part running up the cylinder’s body.
The diagonal part of the triangle (also called the hypotenuse) should look like a fin extending from the body of your rocket.

, Tape your second wing in the same way, directly across from your first wing.








, Take your plastic drinking straw and insert it into the open end of your rocket.







, Be careful not to point your rocket at any body, and especially not anyone’s face. Instead, make a target and aim for that. How to Make a Target

;
, This ""hamburger style"" fold will create a new crease in the center of the page (See the video for help). You should now have two creases along both centers (x-axis and y-axis) of the page.








, Then, fold down the top corners while leaving 1-2 in (2.5-5 cm) of space at the bottom. Grab the two top corners, and fold down so that they line up with the center crease. Use the crease you made before to help line up the corners. Crease along the edges to secure the folds.








, Grab the top flap at the bottom of the paper, and fold it up against the bottom of the two folded triangles. Turn the paper over, and do the same thing to the flap on that side. This will make a paper hat.

Make sure the paper you’re using doesn’t already have any folds, creases or wrinkles in it, as this can compromise the completed plane’s ability to fly. It’s recommended that you start with a bigger piece of paper to make learning the folds easier before trying it with other paper types.It’s easiest to make the folds of your airplane from the top of the paper down.
For the purpose of following these instructions, a basic sheet of 8.5”x11” (most comparable to A4 paper outside the US) letter paper will work best.;
, Turn the paper lengthwise and fold it down the middle. Line up the corners at the top and bottom. Run a thumbnail down the fold to tighten the crease. Then, unfold the paper so that the crease is facing down, with the paper opening like a slight ‘V.’The center crease is made to serve as a reference point for later folds.
You can also fold the paper in half width-wise, if you choose. This will help guide the first couple vertical folds you make.

, Take both corners and fold them down until they’re even with the center crease. Press the creases to hold them in place. The folded corners will form a large triangle at the top of the paper., Fold over the triangle made by the folded corners. The paper will now resemble an envelope, with a square base and the top triangle pointed down at the bottom of the paper. This shape will serve as the body of the plane.Leave 2-3 inches (5-7.5cm) of space between the point of the triangle and bottom of the paper.
Folding the paper over on itself adds weight to the plane as it reduces its size, giving it heft to allow it to fly farther.

, Carefully fold the top corners down again until they align with the center crease. Stop short of overlapping the previous fold to leave a small triangular tip exposed at the bottom of the new fold. You want this triangular piece to be about an inch (2.5cm) long.This last folded point at the top of the paper will serve as the nose of the plane.

, Fold the triangular flap at the bottom up and over the angled folds you just made to secure them. Make sure the tip of the small triangular piece is lined up with the center crease. This fold is especially important, as it allows the plane to hold its shape and works to balance it during flight.The technique of using a triangular flap to secure a fold is known as the ""Nakamura lock,"" named after the origami practitioner who invented it.

, Now, fold the entire paper in half outward, in the opposite direction that you made the original center fold. The extra triangular fold will be at the bottom of the completed plane and will help provide weight and stability. You should be able to see the final size and shape of the plane coming together.Folding the paper back on itself wraps the lower triangular piece around the outside of the bottom of the plane, holding it in place and making it easier to grip and throw.

, Lay the paper on one side and fold the top flap down until the upper corner is even with the bottom of the plane. Turn the plane over and fold the other side. This will form the wings of the plane. Press the creases firmly so they’ll hold. Your paper airplane is now finished!Be careful not to bend the wings while folding them.
Go somewhere with plenty of space and give your new airplane a toss. Airplanes made with this design fly far and straight and can reach some pretty impressive speeds., One simple variation of this airplane design is to make the nose blunt rather than pointed. To fold this design, simply leave about half an inch (1.25cm) of space on either side of the center crease after you fold the corners that will be secured by the small triangular flaps. The corners will have to be folded at a diagonal angle to leave the top of the paper unobstructed.


Blunt-nosed planes give up a little speed but fly much further due to their streamlined construction., When a paper airplane curves too much to one side, it usually means the wings are lopsided. Double check the wing folds and make sure they’re flat, even and at the same height. Make small adjustments, as tampering with the wings too much can soften the paper and decrease loft.


It’s normal for the plane to curve a little, so only adjust the wing height if the plane is spiraling out of control when thrown.

, If the plane has a tendency to barrel straight into the ground, there may be an issue with the back portion of the wings. Bend the back edges of the wings upward very delicately so that they’ll be able to catch the air as the plane moves forward. A small bend makes a big difference, so don’t be too forceful or you might warp the wings out of shape.Paper airplanes operate on the same physical principles that allow real planes to fly. A slight curve of the wings is necessary to turn air resistance into lift.Try a blunt-nosed design if your plane has a problem with taking a nosedive. Pointed noses can easily become damaged when they hit the ground.

, Another common problem is that the plane arcs upwards, then drops out of the air. The solution to this is the opposite of the one used to correct nosedives: simply bend the back of the wings down slightly until the plane flies straight. Try a few practice throws to make sure the problem is fixed before throwing faster.Attempting to throw too hard can also cause the nose to rise, stalling the plane. Launch the plane with a smooth, straight motion of the arm and wrist to send it on its way steadily.

, For your paper airplane to soar true, it’s important that you use a piece of paper that is neither too light nor too heavy. In most cases, a standard sheet of 8.5”x11” (A4) letter paper will be the perfect size, weight and thickness to make a plane that when folded correctly will fly for dozens of feet. The flimsiness of thin papers like newsprint keeps them from catching the air, while cardstock, construction paper and other heavier types will create too much drag, and will also be more difficult to fold.The types of paper commonly used in offices—crisp, smooth and perfectly weighted—often make for excellent paper planes.
It’s okay to use thinner paper for smaller planes, since the compact size will compensate for the weight difference. Likewise, heavier paper can be used to make oversized planes.

, Until you’ve mastered the folding technique, avoid working with papers with unusual dimensions. Most paper airplane folding instructions are given with 8.5”x11” (A4) paper in mind. Altering the height or width of the paper can drastically change how the airplane turns out, and if it’s too wide or too narrow, it may not fly at all.If you’re working with scrap paper, cut or tear it until it’s roughly the proportions of letter paper, then reproduce the folds on a slightly larger or smaller scale.

, Another advantage of medium weight papers like letter paper and stationery is that any creases you make will stay secure. This is especially important if you want your airplane to fly far and fast, as sloppy, loose folds make the plane less aerodynamic. As a rule, the smoother the paper, the better it will take a fold. Avoid pulpy papers and those with large grains that get mushy when creased.Raw, foil, laminate and glossy papers do not take a fold well.
Apply pressure to each crease you make and go over it a couple times. The neater the fold, the better it will maintain its shape.

Unfold the paper after you crease it so the you now have a piece of paper with a vertical valley crease.;
, You want to fold you paper into the center to create triangles that meet along the middle crease.









Run your fingers along the outer edges of the triangles to reinforce the folds with a crease.
Make sure that your two smaller, folded triangles come to a point at the top, forming one larger triangle.

, Turn the paper over so that the triangles are facing down. Then fold the triangle you have just formed back.









Fold the triangle back over its flat bottom edge. The triangle should now be pointing downward.
The paper will now be more in the shape of a square.
Position the point to stay inline with the center crease, which is now in a mountain fold., You will now repeat your initial corner folds on top of the two triangular folds you already have in place.









This will create two thicker triangles that meet along the middle crease.
Underneath you should see your original folded triangles creased to form two downward facing triangles at the edges, and two triangles facing outward (both forming a diamond) in the center.

, From the tips of the three triangles you now have folded over, comprising of the the one in the center, and the two on either side, create three small triangular folds. These folds will help secure the wings of the plane.









The size of the folds should be small. You want to make them equilateral triangles with sides about half an inch long.

, Fold the paper in half in a mountain fold along the original crease. The triangular folds you have just made should be on the outside.









If you fold it the wrong way, the triangles will be facing each other inside the fold.

Your plane will have three parts, the base of your jet which is formed by the initial crease, and on either side, two flaps with two triangles pointing upwards followed by wings at the top. You can choose to hold the two flaps between your fingers when you throw your jet, or fan them out. You may find one method works better than the other.

Perform a book fold to begin. Use an ordinary 8 ½ in (21.5 cm) by 11 in (28 cm) sheet of printer, or A4 paper.








Align the edges of your paper and crease your center fold.
Unfold the paper after you crease it so the you now have a piece of paper with a vertical valley crease.

, With your paper in landscape position, take the top two outer corners and fold each one to meet at the center crease.









Your paper should now look a bit like a house. The two folded triangles should come down to about halfway on your paper.

, Now take the tip of the triangle that has been created by your previous folds and fold it back down to the edge.









You should now have a top layer of paper that resembles an equilateral triangle pointing down. This triangle is overlaid on top of two equilateral triangles on either side pointing up.

, Take the diagonal portions of your paper that form the outer sides of your two triangles and fold them in. Align the upper sides so that the diagonal edges are now vertical, meeting along the center.









With these sides folded in, you should have a flat nose at the top of your paper that looks like a triangle pointing downward.

, You should now have the flat side of your paper with no folds facing you. Take the top half inch of your paper and fold it backwards towards you.









You should see a trapezoid shape with two triangles pointing at about a forty-five-degree angle outward on either side of it.

, Now fold the plane in half in a book fold. You should begin to see the final form of your jet plane.









The part of the plane you just folded over should be showing at the nose of the plane, overlaid on top of your original crease.

, The body of your paper jet plane should be about half an inch tall.









The wings don’t have to be folded even with the base of the plane. They should go slightly past.

, Pinch the base of your jet and fan out the wings slightly so that the top of your plane is a flat surface.








You can apply a small bit of tape to both the front and back of your plane to keep the wings closer together if you wish.
Keep your plane level with the ground and flick your wrist to send it flying.

Throw your loop de loop paper airplane.",How to Make a Loop De Loop Paper Airplane," Using standard A4 or printer paper, measuring 8.5 inches by 11 inches, fold it in half lengthwise and make a crease before unfolding the paper.









Align the edges of your paper and run your hand down the crease to get a nice fold.
When you unfold your paper, you will now have a valley crease.;
, Using your center crease as a guide, align each edge so both folds are even.









Crease the outer edges to keep your folds in place.
You will now have two triangles which together form one large triangle.

, Fold the triangle you just created downward towards you. 








Fold along the bottom edge of your triangle.
The tip should align with the crease and make your paper look like a tall envelope.
The top layer of paper will resemble an equilateral triangle pointing down, like the flap of an envelope.

, The two corners will meet about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) above the tip from your previous fold.









These two points will naturally fold on a diagonal leaving a space in the middle.
With these sides folded in, you should have a flat nose at the top of your paper plane.

, Fold the triangle of about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) up to cover the center points from your previous fold.









This fold will help to keep the flaps you’ve just folded in place.

, Fold backward along your initial crease keeping your previous folds on the outside.









When making this fold, you’re folding in the opposite direction of your very first fold.

, Leaving a 1 centimeter (0.4 in) area for the body, fold down one side of the paper.









When you flip your paper over to fold down the second wing, match the fold of the first wing. It’s important that both wings are equal for proper flight.

, Take a portion of paper on the back of each wing and fold it away from you to form an isosceles triangle, meaning the two sides are longer than the base.









These elevator flaps create drag when you throw the plane. The flaps pull the nose up causing your paper plane to perform a loop de loop in the air After you fold the first elevator flap, flip your paper over to fold the second. Make sure the edges of the folds are even with one another.

, Pinch the base of your plane and fan out the wings so that the top of the plane is flat. Next, fold up the elevator flaps so that the flaps create a 90-degree angle with the top of the wings.









You can either tape or staple the front and back of your plane to keep the wings closer together, and the base more stable if you wish.

, Hold the plane in its center and throw using your forearm.









When you throw your loop de loop plane, angle the nose upward slightly to help the plane fly farther and perform a loop.Flick your wrist forward upon release when throwing.

Cut your paper into strips.,
Punch holes through both ends of the strips.,
Insert paper fasteners into the holes.,
Form a C-shape with your stack.,
Slide the strips away from the stack.",How to Make a Sphere Out of Paper1," Choose a thicker paper like cardstock or construction paper for a sturdier sphere. You can also use decorative scrapbook paper or plain copy paper if you’d prefer. Use sharp scissors to cut your paper into 12 strips that are ½-inch (1.25 centimeters) wide and 6 inches (15.25 centimeters) long., Evenly stack the strips of paper. Punch a hole on either end of the stack using a standard hole punch. The holes should be about 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) from either end.If you have difficulty punching a hole through the entire stack, separate the stack into two or three piles and punch the holes into these smaller piles. Just make sure that the holes you punch are evenly placed from stack to stack.
If you decide to use decorative or printed paper instead of blank paper or blank cardstock, stack the strips so that the decorative side all faces one direction.

, With the strips all in one stack, place a metal paper fastener into the hole on either end. Flatten the ""tail"" of the fastener against the back of the stack.If you are using strips cut from decorative or patterned paper, position each fastener ""head"" against the decorated side of the paper.

, With both ends secured, use your hands to carefully bend the stack of strips into a C-shape without creasing any of the strips.If you’re using decorative paper, remember to have the image face outward.

, While the stack is bent, gently pull the strips apart, spreading them into the shape of a sphere. You can adjust the pieces to overlap to make your sphere look more like a globe, or you can create spaces between the paper to make it look more like a lantern.If you want to hang your sphere, wrap the middle of a piece of thread around one of the metal fasteners. Then wind the thread several times. Knot the ends to form a loop, which you can use to hang it.
You can easily flatten the sphere by sliding the paper strips back into a stack.

Apply two more layers of paper.,
Allow your sphere to dry.,
Puncture the balloon.",How to Make a Sphere Out of Paper2," Choose a thin paper like plain copy paper or newspaper. While your strips do not have to be a certain size, they should be smaller to make them easier to form into a sphere.Start with strips that are 1.5-inch (3.8 centimeters) by 3-inch (7.6 centimeters). You can cut more strips if you'd like a different size.
Smaller strips will allow for a smoother surface.

, You may need to under-inflate the balloon to ensure that you get the right shape. Before you tie it, make sure that it's approximately the right size for your sphere., Pour ¼ cup (59 milliliters) of school glue into a bowl. Add ⅛ cup (30 milliliters) of water. You will need a lot of papier-mâché paste to complete your project, but you don't want to expose unused glue for long because it can start to dry.You can adapt the recipe to change the quantity by maintaining a ratio of 2 parts school glue and 1 part water.
You will need to make more papier-mâché paste as you work on your sphere.

, You want the entire strip of paper to be covered in glue on both sides. Give your paper a moment to soak in the glue. More glue is better than less, as a generous coating of glue is what will help you create your papier-mâché.Your hands will get covered in glue while you work on this project, so keep a towel handy to wipe off the drying excess glue.

, It doesn’t matter which direction you apply your paper strip because you will be covering the entire surface of the balloon with multiple layers. Smooth down the edges of the strip to create a flatter surface. Your paper mâché sphere will have some bumps because of the process, but you can keep it relatively smooth by carefully applying the paper.Keep your balloon in place by sitting it in a bowl while you work. This will prevent the balloon from rolling or slipping away.

, Dip and apply paper over the entire surface of the balloon, overlapping your paper strips to create a solid layer over the balloon., Once you’ve fully covered your balloon with paper, repeat the process twice to add two more layers of papier-mâché. You will need three layers in order to have a stable sphere.

To keep track of your layers, it’s a good idea to use different types of paper for each layer., It will take about 2-3 days for your sphere to fully dry. You can hang it by the end of the balloon to allow the air to better circulate., To remove the balloon, you will need to puncture or cut near the exposed end. After you make your cut, pull out your balloon. Once the balloon is removed, you can add one more piece of paper to cover the hole if you prefer. Your final product will be a paper sphere.

Alternatively, you could just remove the end of the balloon.

You can either create your template by drawing the first one, or you can use a pre-made template.If you draw your own, make a template with each side measuring 2 inches (5 centimeters).
You can find templates for your geometric shapes at http://gemsclub.org/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/buckyball2.43131957.pdf.
If you want a different size sphere, change the size of your geometric shapes, making sure that all the sides are equal in length.

, Use your scissors to carefully cut along the lines that you traced. The shapes need to be the same size, so make sure that you perfectly cut along the lines., Lay one pentagon flat on your working surface. Line up one side of one hexagon to one side of the pentagon, and tape the edges together. Repeat the process for the other four sides of the pentagon.You will use a total of one pentagon for this step and five hexagons.
The edges of the hexagons and pentagon must be side by side without any gap in between them. The sides should not overlap.
If you don’t have tape, you can glue on a connector piece. Use a 1-inch x 2-inch slip of paper as your connector. Add a thin strip of glue along each side of the paper, then attach it to the geometric steps.

, Using your tape or connector strips, attach the hexagons to each other. Once this step is complete, you will have a shallow paper bowl., Turn your pentagons so that one point is at the top. Fit this point into the crevice between two of the connected hexagons that form your bowl. Apply tape or a connector strip to the touching sides. There will be a flat hexagon side in between the pentagons.Each pentagon used in this step will lie adjacent to two different hexagons. Make sure that you tape both connecting edges in place.

, The space between the pentagons will look like half of a hexagon. Fit your hexagons into these spaces, attaching with tape or connector strips.Each hexagon used in this step will lie adjacent to three other edges in the structure. Tape all three edges down.
Your sphere will be half complete.

, You will notice that your bowl has nooks in the shape of a half-hexagon rather than a point, so you will add additional hexagons. Fit your hexagons into the crevices created between the last five hexagons.During this step, you should notice the sphere beginning to curve inward. You are completing the closed top portion now.

, There should be five open nooks. Slide a pentagon into each one, taping or connecting the sides in place.This time, each pentagon will have three edges that lie adjacent to other edges in the structure. Tape all three down.

, Slide one hexagon into each of the five nooks created by the last step. Apply your tape or a connector piece to secure the edges in place.The hexagons you just added will have edges that touch each other, so you will want to tape these down, too.

, There should be a single pentagon shape left open in your sphere at this point. Rest your remaining pentagon on this spot and tape all five sides in place."

, Fold the papers end-to-end to make unfolding them easier. Do this in each direction to create a flexible crease.








, Use your wire to wrap around the center of the flowers at the crease. Wrap enough that the paper is held securely, and then twist the ends together to form a ""knot.""









Optional:Staple the wire. Holding this together, staple the wire to the tissue paper of the accordion you have just made with the tissue paper, making sure that you leave enough of it for a stem.

, Use the long end of your wire to create a stem on your flower. You can make it as long or short as you would like, and then cut off the excess. Alternately, you can choose not to create a stem and cut the wire at the base of the twist.








, Starting with the top or bottom, fan out the tissue paper so that no sheets are stuck together, being careful not to tear it. You are essentially unwinding your accordion at this point.

, For the petals, you don’t need to do any cutting of your tissue paper; it will be used in the full package size. To create the center though, cut your paper  to be approximately ¼ the length of the original tissue paper. This does not need to be exact, but for a smaller center make the pieces shorter, or cut them a bit longer for a bigger center. You can use several pieces of paper for a more full center.








, Use your scissors to cut many tiny, parallel cuts lengthwise on the paper that will be in the middle of the flower. Cut inwards from both the top and the bottom about ⅓ of the way in. When you unfold the flower, this will stick out in a pretty textured fashion.








, Lay your paper out flat on a tabletop with the petal paper on the bottom and the center tissue on top.They should be the same width, and differ only in height. Put the shorter paper in very middle of the larger paper. You should have at least two pieces of the large paper representing the petals.








, Start at one end and begin creating an accordion fold across your paper. To create big, wide petals make your folds 2-3 inches (5-7.5 cm) across. For many small, dainty petals, fold your paper in sections 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide or less. Continue folding the paper back and forth until you run out of sections to fold.








, Wrap a piece of wire around the very center of your folded paper. Twist the two ends together so that the wire is secure, and then cut off any excess. Although you want the wire to be tight enough not to fall off, don’t compress or bend the paper too much.








, Use a pair of scissors to cut a rounded semi-circle off at the tops of the petal paper. When you unfold your paper, it will be in the traditional petal shape rather than in a squared-off top.








, Pull the edges of the paper out, away from the center both above and below the wire. As you pull them apart, the two sides will meet, creating a circular flower shape. Pull the center pieces of tissue outwards to create a poufy-middle section.

20 x 30 inch (51 x 76 centimeter) tissue paper sheets will make a ball slightly larger than your head.10 x 5 in. (25 x 12 cm) sheets make roughly fist-sized balls.;
, Fold the edge of the stack over by roughly 1½ to 2 in. (3.75–5 cm) and crease.Turn the tissue paper upside down and fold the same edge back the other direction. Repeat until the entire sheet is folded into equal accordion folds.


If you're using small sheets of tissue paper, make roughly ½ in. (2.5 cm) folds instead. You should be able to make at least 16 folds (eight forward, eight back).

, Fold the tissue stack lengthwise, to make a crease in the center. Unfold it back to a long strip. Tie a length of craft wire around the crease. Squish the fold between your fingers and pull the wire as tight as you can.Twist the wire around itself and snip off the excess.


You should end up with a long ""bow tie"" shape. Don't tie the wire around both halves, or you'll end up with a fan shape instead.
Leave ½ in (2.5 cm) of extra wire if you want to attach the balls to other objects., Cut both ends of the tissue paper with a pair of scissors. Pointed ends make a more dramatic, ruffly ball. Rounded ends create a more natural floral look.

, Take your toilet paper, 2-6 pieces depending on the volume of the flower you wish to make, and pile them on top of one another. Line up your toilet paper squares and pinch them in the middle, creating a bow-like shape. Take your pipe cleaner and wrap it twice tightly around the middle of the toilet paper. This will replace your fingers in holding the bow shape., Hold onto the center of your flower (where the pipe cleaner is holding it together). Use your other hand to fan and fluff your flower petals. Pull the layers of toilet paper apart and rearrange them creatively to form your flower petals. You can gather, bunch, pull, or even cut these petals to give them the shape you want.While you want to see how far you can stretch your flower petals, be sure to do so carefully. Toilet paper is prone to rip if you pull it with force.

, Once you get the hang of creating the petals, you can make them in minutes. Repeat the flower-making process with different amounts of toilet paper and start cutting different sizes for different flowers. You can attach them to almost anything by wrapping the stem of your pipe cleaner around a frame. Try making a wreath or bouquet for an interest piece in a room.

Prepare the stem.,
Prepare the petals.,
Prepare the stamen or the center piece.,
Assemble the flower.",How to Make a Paper Tissue Flower Bouquet," Only do steps 1 and 2 if you have purchased cloth-covered wire.

Cut a piece of wire long enough to stick out of your vase by several inches. If you are unsure, a longer starting length is always better because you can trim the stems later. A 9 inch stem is a good start.
Straighten out the wire.



 


Cut the green floral tape to a length that is about 3 inches longer than the stem.






Stretch the floral tape by pulling both ends of the strip. This makes it easier to work with for the next step. You should be able to tell when it’s been stretched: the color fades and it becomes less taut.






Starting from one end of the wire, wrap the floral tape around the entire wire, keeping the diameter of the finished stem as thin as possible. If you run out of floral tape, your stem is probably thicker than it should be. Stretch the tape out to cover as much of the wire as you can.






Cut more floral tape (about 1 ½ inches floral tape for every 1 inch of wire you need to cover), stretch it and continue wrapping where you last stopped.






When you reach the end of the wire, set the stem aside. If you have excess floral tape, you can leave it on for attaching the stamen and petals later.





;
,

Cut out six 2 x 3 inch rectangles from a chosen color of tissue paper – each rectangle represents one petal.






Fold each rectangle in half length-wise.






Trim each rectangle so that when unfolded, it resembles a shield.






Take one folded petal in your non-dominant hand between your thumb and pointer finger with the base of the petal closest to your fingers.






With your dominant hand, begin to twist the base gently.






Repeat steps 4 and 5 with each petal.







, Choose one or the other based on the aesthetics of your flower:)

For Making Stamen:






Cut out ½ x 2 centimeter rectangles of any complimentary color – each rectangle represents one stamen. Three to five rectangles are ideal.






Holding the rectangle so that it is in its tallest form, twist the bottom of the rectangle like you did the petals.






Repeat step 2 with each rectangle.








For Making A ""Center Piece"":






Cut a small square out of any complimentary color of tissue paper.






Roll it between your fingers so that it becomes a small ball.






Cut out a second square of the same color so that it can cover the ball but will leave about 1 centimeter excess.
Wrap the ball with the square and twist the excess like the petals were twisted.



,

Cut and stretch a small piece of floral tape (skip this step if you already have floral tape hanging off of your wire).






Take your stamen or center piece and place it against the top of your wire so that the wire ends where the twisting portion of your stamen or center piece ends.






Wrap the floral tape around the twisted portion and the wire to attach the two.






Attach the rest of your stamen with the same method. (Skip this step if you used a center piece)






Then, take each petal and attach it in the same fashion.






When you have added a satisfactory amount of petals, trim off excess floral tape and pinch lightly around the base of your petals to make sure the floral tape is set and will hold in all of the components. The floral tape from the bottom of the petals to the stem should resemble an upside-down cone.






Fluff out your petals. You have successfully completed one flower.






Repeat the above steps at least 9 more times. An ideal bouquet will have about 25 flowers.

Make your dye.,
Dye the tips.,
Use multiple colors.",How to Make Flowers Made of Toilet Paper2," Simply place a few drops of color with a 2 tablespoons of water in a shallow dish. The more drops of food coloring you use, the more vibrant your dye will be. To keep it more natural looking, stick to one drop of food coloring with your water., Carefully dip the tips of your flower into the dye. Keep it upside down until your petals dry. This will take anywhere from 5-30 minutes, depending how heavily you dipped your flowers.


Because you’ve used toilet paper, it will soak up the dye very, very quickly. Remember this when dipping the tips of the petals. You barely need to touch the dye to add a lot of color quickly to your petals.

, Use different dishes to use multiple colors for your flowers. Once you’re comfortable enough dipping them, you can even use different colors per flower. To do this, simply roll the outside tips gently through the dye and then dip the taller petals into your second color."

, Take the rolls and squish them so that they are flat. They’ll bounce back once you start using them, but you want the two creases you’ve created to be noticeable. Once you’ve flattened your rolls, use a pen to mark your toilet paper roll in fourths., Cut along the lines that you’ve marked to make petals of even width. Once you have all the petals you need, start to give them their shape. Help them bounce back toward their original shape. Press the creased parts into each other. You should end up with your cardboard holding an oval shape.

, Place glue along the bottom crease of one of your petals. Glue it to the bottom crease of another petal. Continue attaching petals, one at a time. Making a traditional flower will only take 4-8 petals.

Throw short, stout planes upwards.",How to Improve the Design of any Paper Airplane," Often, during the process of making folds, you crease the page, make the wing length uneven, and so on. Unfold your plane and refold it again. If there’s an extra crease on one side, add it to the other. That way, the wind will hit the plane the same way on both sides.You can also cut off uneven and excess bits of paper, but this is risky since you won’t be able to go back.;
, The aspect ratio of the wings affect flight. Long, wide wings are good for gliding but have to be thrown gently. Short, stubby wings are usually better because you can throw the plane faster and angle it more upwards. Refold the wings according to your needs., A standard airplane needs wings that point upwards. If your wings are flat or upside down, redo them. Wings angled upwards are called “dihedral” and give your plane lift. Lift the wings upwards so that the wing tips are above the rest of the plane., Fins are small folds you make on the wings. The paper doubles over itself when you do this. Take the edges of the wings and fold them downwards and over. This is the fin, and the fold should be parallel to the length of the plane. These fins can help stabilize and strengthen some planes.Fins are useful in more complicated designs. For standard dart planes, they should be avoided since they will slow the plane.

, Stable paper airplanes fly farther and faster. Paper airplanes typically benefit from adding what’s known as up elevator. Take the back end of the airplane, which on a standard dart-shaped plane is the wing tips, and use your finger to bend them upwards a little.This counterbalances the weight in the nose of your plane.

, Most planes also benefit from a little weight in the nose. This helps balance the plane so it doesn’t have a tendency to fly straight up. Cover the nose in a layer or two of tape or add a paper clip. Test out out the plane and make adjustments as necessary.Heavier planes are better at withstanding outdoor flight.

, Bending the wing tips downwards is only useful for planes that try to fly upwards when launched. Use your fingers to bend them down slightly. Try throwing the plane again. If this isn’t enough to balance it, you can try adding more weight to the nose of the plane.

, Slightly bend the end of the tail to the left. If your tail has two sides, bend the left side up and the right side down. When the air hits the bends, the plane will change the plane’s direction., If your plane has a single, vertical edge for a tail, bend it to the right. Otherwise, pull the right side up and the left side down. These bends will correct the airflow to cause a more stable flight.

, The fuselage is the bottom part of the plane. In most paper airplanes, this is where the fold separates the two sides. You’ve worked to balance your plane, so grip the center of the fuselage with your fingertips. This is where the plane gets a lot of its stability.

, More delicate planes are better gliders. A rough launch will damage them and ruin their flight trajectory. Bring your wrist forward in a pushing motion. Keep the plane level with the ground., Planes with short wings function better with a hard launch. Angle your plane upwards. Use the same pushing motion with your hand, but apply more force. If the plane is a dart, it will stabilize as it descends.Non-dart glider planes should be throw upwards gently with a pushing motion.

Large index cards, usually 5 inches by 7 inches, work really well for this project. Use one if you already have some at home.;
, It should be a rectangle approximately 2 1/2 inches wide and 7 inches long.









These measurements do not need to be totally exact, so don't worry if you are a little bit off. What matters is that the paper is much longer than it is wide.

, Draw a line down the middle of the paper lengthwise and a line down the middle of the paper widthwise. These lines will guide the cuts and folds required to make your helicopter.









This is not totally necessary but may help you to make a good helicopter.

, Once you have creased it, unfold the paper and lay it flat.








, This will create two flaps that will eventually become the wings of your helicopter.









If you drew the guide lines on your paper, be sure to stop cutting at least a half an inch before you get to the middle line. This will assure that you do not accidentally cut too far.

, The cuts will be at opposite sides on the length of the paper but will not reach each other. Be careful that they don't connect, as you don't want to cut all the way through the paper.









Once again, the guide lines you might have drawn on your paper may help you. When cutting these horizontal cuts, be sure not to cut so far that you reach the middle line. It's best to only cut halfway to the middle line on both sides you are cutting. This will assure that the bottom of your helicopter doesn't get cut off!

, The whole area directly below the horizontal cuts you just made in towards the center line should be folded in towards the center. Once you have folded the flaps in, you will then refold the center crease that runs the length of the paper that you made earlier. These folds will form the bottom of your helicopter, eventually being held flat by the paper clip.








, They should both be folded down but in opposite directions, so that there is one flap on either side of the paper.









Once you have folded and creased them, open these flaps up halfway. They have now formed the wings of your helicopter.

, It is there to hold the bottom flaps closed and to add a little weight to the helicopter. You're done making your helicopter!








, It should spin gracefully to the ground.









Experiment by dropping it from different heights. See if the way it flies changes.Use various sizes of paperclips, see which works best.
You can also cut the wings, so they are thinner or thicker, to get the best flight.

, You will only need one 5 inch by 7 inch index card and one paper clip.

, Crease the fold with your finger or the edge of your paperclip. Then fold it in half lengthwise again, remembering to crease this fold as well.









The width of your index card will now be one quarter what it was to begin with.

, In essence you will be folding the length of the index card in half. Make sure to really crease the fold well.








, You will be folding the ends of the long dimension of your original index card. Fold one side first and then flip the paper over so you can fold the other side.









Once both sides are folded, open them both up halfway. These folds have now formed the wings of your helicopter.

, It should go over where you folded the length of your index card in half. Just slip it securely on the end. The paper clip is attached in order to give your helicopter a little weight.

Set your boat upright.",How to Make a Paper Battleship1," Every crafts project should begin with thoughtfully choosing the materials you'll be using. What paper you choose to make your boat with will have a major impact on its use and function. Construction paper is arguably the most common paper for use in this project, as it's colourful and easy to work with. Newspaper is another good choice, as it is commonplace, folds well, and resists water.A rectangular piece is needed for a boat-like length. Any size will do, although bigger sizes will increase the boat's floatability.;
, Using more than one piece will improve the boat's stability and ability to float in the water. It will also make the craft heavier and more sturdy, which helps if you're trying to make your boat look like it's ready to go into battle. Stack identical sheets together and fold them as if they were one piece.


You can increase the stability of your boat by doubling the amount of paper from 2 to 4 sheets.

, Make sure that you have folded it in half evenly. Inaccurate folding at this early stage will botch the entire craft.


It helps to go over your fold thoroughly. Run your finger over the crease to press it down. You should try lining up the corners of the paper together to get a more precise fold.

, This should result in two triangles meeting in the center, with a strip of uncovered paper at the bottom.


If you're having difficulty finding the center, make sure the corners are lining up evenly. If you're still having trouble, try measuring the paper with a ruler and draw a thin pencil line down the middle. This will give you a target to aim for.

, If you're using multiple strips of paper, divide the layers of the bottom rectangular strip in two. Take each half and fold it upwards. From there, you should have the shape of a smaller triangle on top of the folded rectangles. Crease your fold and continue.If your fold isn't creased smoothly, try smoothing them it out by running your finger along it, or pinching it with your finger and thumb.

, This will open up the boat and turn it into a three-dimensional object. The boat should be pulled open by its wide corners. Be gentle as you pull it open, and make sure not to undo any of the folds you've creased.


You can complete this more easily by pulling open the body from the corners.
After opening the bottom it should take on a long diamond shape. If the shape doesn't look like this, it is likely your measurements were wrong at some point leading up to it.

, Once you have completed the folds and opened it up, it's time to see how your boat has fared. Upright, the boat should take the form of a long pyramid, with a triangle tip (or sail) poking out from the top. Although it's not quite a battleship yet, with the folds all done, you'll be set to decorate it as you please.

, Slide your fingers back from the plane's 'nose' about 10 cm (4 in.). Tear two rips in the bottom of the plane, each about 1.25 cm (1/2 in.) long. They should be about 1.25 (1/2 in.) apart. Fold the rudder up. It will help your plane fly straight.

, Use a gentle overhand toss to send it soaring. You're a flying ace!

Begin with a large square piece of paper.,
Gate fold both sides of the square into the center.,
Turn the paper around and do another gate fold.Once you have your first gatefold complete it's time to do the same from another angle.,
Fold the square both ways diagonally.,
Make two inside reverse folds.This is where your boat will begin to take form.",How to Make a Paper Battleship2," If you're bored with the simple boat design and want to take your folding up a notch, you can begin making a more advance paper battleship by starting out with a large square of paper. The larger the piece of paper you're using, the more opportunity you'll have to add details and other pieces once the body is finished.1x1 feet is a good place to start if you're unsure what size you want.

, With the square facing towards you, take each half of the paper and pull it to the centre line of your square. If you're having difficulty with where the center should be, measure it out with a ruler and draw a thin line using a pencil.


One of these individual folds on either side is referred to as a valley fold. The two folds together comprise a gate fold.This is because the resulting folds should look like a gate that's ready to open up.

, Unfold the gatefold you originally made. Turn the square 90 degrees and pull the two new halves together to make a new ""gate."" Unfold once you're done.

, After unfolding two gate folds, you should have a grid with folds that make sixteen squares. From there, fold the square across diagonally in both directions, unfolding the paper after each time.These folds will become useful when it comes time to fold your battleship into shape.

, Turn the paper over on its opposing face. Push the corners upward to make an upside-down pyramid. When you have accomplished this, take each of the four corners and fold them down. Turn the boat over when you have completed these folds. It's now ready for decorating.


When you have completed your inside reverse folds, you should have a square pyramid shape in the centre, with four arms jutting horizontally from the pyramid's corners.
The inside reverse fold is a potentially tricky fold to master in origami. It's worthwhile to figure out the individual fold before you move on with it in practice."

Glue on extra pieces.,
Draw on details.,
Give your boat a waterproof coat.If you're planning on making your boat float, you should cover your boat in a water-based acrylic paint.,
Paint different colors for the bottom and top.,
Launch it into the water.",How to Make a Paper Battleship3," Whether you're making a full-on battleship or a little tugboat, almost all boats carry equipment. Radar, extra sails, cannons and top decks are a few ideas of things you might add to your vessel. Anything that cannot be drawn on directly should be added by gluing or taping light cardboard onto the top. Cut out pieces according to your idea and attach them gently to the boat. Make a point of keeping them centered on your boat.


Excess weight could result in your boat getting capsized if you want to make it seaworthy.
You can do this to any boat design, regardless how advanced or simple it is.

, A great craft will come with the artist's added touches. Although you shouldn't try to make a realistic battleship with a paper craft, there is a world of potential difference made in fine details. Even if your boat is floating down the river, drawing on details like chassis studs, stern wear or even little crewmen will bring life to your creation.

, On top of giving it a fresh sense of decor, the water resistance will keep your boat afloat for longer. A steely grey or silver is best if you're going for a realistic-looking craft.


Paint can be applied to the boat with a regular paintbrush.If you're trying to make smaller strokes on your boat and don't have precision toothbrushes available, an old toothbrush can be used for the same effect.

, Most real-life ships are painted different colors: one color for the top, and another for the bottom. Although you could conceivably paint your ship as many colors as you like, a simple two-color pattern should be perfect for a crafts boat.

, Although some boat builders may prefer to keep their boats as purely ornamental crafts, a paper boat with its bottom flaps opened will float on water for a time. If you want, you can fill up your bathtub and see how long yours remains afloat for. Taking your craft to a river or park lake will arguably make for a better photo op.


If you like competition, you and a friend should make your own boats. Place them in the water at the same time and see which one stays afloat the longest!
If you place your boat in the water, chances are it won't be saved for a second use. Luckily, craft boats are very easy to make, so you won't have to worry much if they're lost at sea.

Start with a standard letter-sized piece of paper that measures 8 1/2 inches by 11 inches (A4, printer paper).,
Fold the whole piece of paper in half lengthwise.,
Crease the paper down the middle and then open the piece of paper back up.,
Fold the top corners down and in toward the center crease, so that what used to be the top edge lines up with the center crease.,
Grab each edge that comes off of the top point, basically the creases you made in the previous step.,
Refold your paper airplane along the center line.,
Lay the paper airplane down on your work surface.,
Take the long edge of one side and fold it over so the whole edge runs along the center crease.,
Open up both of these last creases halfway, so that the long edges furthest from the center crease form two wings.,
Grab your paper airplane along the bottom crease and throw it!",How to Make a Dart Paper Airplane1," This size is usually easy to find, as it's the one used in most printers.;
, This means that the short ends will be folded in half, while the long ends will stay the same length.


Make sure that the opposite corners match up to each other perfectly, so that each side is exactly the same.

, Lay the paper down so that one of the short sides is closest to you and so that the raised part of the center crease points up., Crease these folds.Once folded, these two corners should meet each other at the center crease but not cross it. Keep these corners folded in.
The point made at the top of your paper by these corners being folded down will eventually form the front of your dart paper airplane.

, This time you will fold both of these edges down and in to line up with the center crease.


These folds basically make your top point skinnier (and stronger) and the outer edges longer (from about 5 inches long to about 10 inches long).
Remember to keep the edges lined up with the center crease but don't go over it. You are going to refold the paper airplane along this fold again, so you need to have symmetrical folds on both sides for proper balance.

, If you refold the center line and both of your sides are totally smooth, you have folded it the wrong way. Open the paper airplane back up and make the center fold in the opposite direction, so the previous folds are not concealed inside.

, It should be shaped like a really pointy triangle right now, with one edge the original length of the paper and one edge half the original width of the paper. The other edge should be the longest of the three and should be opposite the right angle of the triangle.


Have either of the sides facing up. It doesn't matter which one because you will do the same steps to both sides.

, In essence, you are just folding one wing of the paper airplane in half.


Repeat this same process on the other side as well.

, The center crease you have had all along will now be at the bottom of your paper airplane.


Your finished airplane should be about 12 inches long and 4 inches wide at the widest point of the wings.

, You now have a dart paper airplane.


If your airplane has problems flying, experiment with changing its weight distribution. Attach a small paper clip to the bottom crease, pointing up toward the wings. Try positioning it in different locations up and down the center crease to determine where the weight helps the most.

Remember to make a crease along this fold.

, Remember to crease this fold as well.

, You will end up with two very long sides and small points coming out of the short end.

, Repeat this on both sides.


These folds may be hard to make, as they will result in really skinny long wings, but will create a very fast and straight flying paper airplane.

, Hold the airplane so that the wings stick out and you are holding the body of the plane.

, This will keep your plane in the right shape.


Do not go all the way across and don't start from the very tip. Start where the corners of the tape stay within the wings. The tape is simply there to keep the wings together.

After you fold the paper, run your finger along the crease to secure it.;
, Just unfold the piece of paper the same way you folded it. Make sure the crease is prominent and runs all the way down the paper.

, You should create two similar right triangles with edges that meet right along the line of the crease. They should be as close to the same size as possible.

, The tip of the top corner should move down to touch the bottom of the edges where the two triangles meet.

, Fold the paper in half lengthwise just as you did in the beginning. Fold it along the same crease. You can reinforce the crease again, if you like.

, Once the paper is folded in half, grab one side by the outer edge of the diagonal part and fold it over toward the middle crease, so that you see a small triangle with a bottom edge that touches the middle crease. Turn the paper over and do the same on the other side. You will create a long, rectangular shape with triangles on either side of the plane. Try to make the handle .4 inches (1 cm) long at most.

, Grab the airplane by the handle in the middle and gently throw it upward. You'll see that this plane creates loops instead of flying straight ahead. Keep playing with it -- experiment to see how throwing the plane faster or slower affects the movements of the plane.

Create a base.,
Get a small bottle, about 6cm high.,
Superglue the bottle ""crater"" to the center of the base.,
Include a tray to catch spills.",How to Make a Papier Mâché Volcano1," You can build the base out of papier mâché, if you like, but it helps to start with some sort of prefabricated platform. You can use practically anything to make a base, depending on the shape of the volcano you need. Paper products are generally cheap, disposable, and reasonably sturdy.


An overturned paper or plastic bowl makes for a simple, solid base. This will make a short but functional volcano.
For a taller and more pointed volcano, attach a toilet paper tube to the top of the bowl. Surround it with tissue paper and masking tape to make the general shape of your volcano. The toilet paper tube also provides a ready-made mouth or ""crater"" for your volcano.
If you need a wider base, you can set the main part of the volcano onto a paper plate or platter. This may also come in handy for containing the spillage when the volcano ""erupts"".;
, This will become the ""crater"" of the volcano: the chamber into which you mix the baking soda and vinegar. Make sure that the bottle is made from a non-permeable material that will hold the vinegar without leaking. Ideally, pick a bottle with a relatively narrow neck so that the eruption is focused rather than wide.


For a small volcano, try using a film canister or a single-serving yogurt bottle. For a larger volcano, use a 12-ounce plastic bottle so that you can hold more of the reactive ingredients.
If you plan to use the volcano more than once—or if you think you might need to replace the bottle—consider covering the bottle with a plastic bag so that the papier -mâché doesn't stick to its surface. This may come in handy, for instance, if you want to be able to replace the crater with a fresh Diet Coke bottle each time you make the volcano erupt., Make sure that the mouth faces upward, so that you can eventually fill it with vinegar and baking soda. Try to glue the bottle so that it's level and sturdy. This is the core of your volcano, so it's important that you set a strong precedent for the rest of the sculpture.








, If you plan to make your papier mâché volcano erupt, you'll end up making a mess from the foamy results of mixing baking soda and vinegar. Consider building your volcano into a cardboard box (with the sides cut away, save a short lip to stop running vinegar) or a flat cardboard base. You can glue or tape the ""base"" and core of the volcano onto the tray, or you can simply place the completed volcano into its protective berth once it's time to erupt.








Trying using a plastic food tray; a sheet of wood; an old Frisbee. Place your volcano atop any surface that isn't valuable or irreplaceable.
Alternately, you may set up your volcano in a space where the vinegar-and-baking-soda runoff can easily drain. Set up the volcano outside in the dirt, in a sink or bathtub, or on a concrete patio.

Add embellishments if desired.",How to Make a Papier Mâché Vase," Making a vase from paper is easier than it might seem and since it requires some common household items, you might already have most of the items you need. Before you get started, you will need:








One large balloon
White glue (poured into a bowl or onto a plate)
One toilet paper tube (cut in half)
Newspaper
White tissue paper
One large paintbrush
Acrylic paint (in the colors of your choice)
Some embellishments, such as decorative rope, ribbon, or beads;
, Papier mâché can get very messy, so you will want to cover the table that you will be working on. You can use some newspaper, or you can use a plastic tablecloth. You might also consider wearing an old shirt or an apron to protect your clothing.








, It is a good idea to tear the newspaper and tissue paper into different size shapes because that will help you cover the curves of your vase. Don't cut the paper; tearing it will help it stick together better.








Make the squares up to three inches (7.62 centimeters) on each side.
Make the strips one inch wide (2.54 centimeters) and several inches long. Try making some shorter ones and some longer ones.

, You will need to inflate the balloon, but not all the way. Blow it up until it is about the size that you want for your vase, but make sure that there is enough slack to push the center of the balloon in on itself.








Tie the end of the balloon in a knot when you are finished.
Do not overinflate the balloon! It should be slightly underinflated.

, Next, take the knot of your balloon and cut off the band around the end (the area above the knot). Set the band aside, but do not discard it! Then, take the knot of the balloon and push it through the center of your balloon to create a doughnut shape.








Hold onto the knot. Then, take the balloon band that you set aside and use it to secure the balloon knot. Tie the band around the knot a few times until it is tight. The doughnut shape should hold after you release the knot.
If there is too much air in the balloon, then this will not work. If the balloon pops or it will not stay in the doughnut shape, then get another balloon and start over.

, Take your paintbrush and begin painting white glue onto a small area of the balloon. Then, press a piece of newspaper onto this area and paint more glue over the newspaper.








Continue painting glue onto the balloon and covering the spots with newspaper and more glue until you have covered the entire balloon.
Add another layer of newspaper and glue after you finish adding the first layer.

, As you get closer to the area of the balloon where you tied the band around the knot, you will need to apply the toilet paper tube. Take the toilet paper tub and place it over the knot. Then, apply glue to the base of the tube and to the tube itself. Layer pieces of newspaper over the tube and then paint more glue over the newspaper.








Make sure that you cover the rim of the tube with newspaper and glue as well.
Add another layer of glue, newspaper, and more glue after you finish with the first layer.
After you have finished the second layer, let the glue dry completely before you do anything else.

, Adding a layer of tissue paper over the newspaper will create a more uniform color and this will make it easier for you to decorate your vase the way that you want. After the last layer of glue has dried, apply some more glue over the newspaper. Then, place a piece of tissue paper over the glue and apply more glue over the tissue paper.








Continue to layer glue, tissue paper, and more glue over the entire balloon and the toilet paper tube.
Add another layer of tissue paper after you finish the first layer.
Let the glue dry completely before you do anything else.

, After the last layer of glue you applied has dried, use your paintbrush to apply another layer of glue to the entire vase. Then, set the vase aside and allow this layer of glue to dry. This layer of glue will help to ensure that the vase is strong.








You can pop the balloon inside your vase when the last layer of glue is completely dry., When the glue is dry, you can begin to paint your vase. You can paint it any color (or colors) you like, but you may want to start with a base and then embellish after the first layer of paint has dried.








For example, you could paint your vase black and then embellish it with some red designs after the black paint has dried.
You can also use stencils, sponges, or other techniques to create a unique design on your vase.

, After the paint has dried, you can also add embellishments to your vase. For example, you can glue some ribbon or decorative rope to the neck of the vase, or add some beads, sequins, or glitter the base.








After you have applied your embellishments, let the glue dry and your vase will be ready to use or give as a gift!

Fly the plane.",How to Make a Trick Paper Airplane2," Using plain printer paper for this trick paper airplane is best. If you pick paper that is thicker, it will fall too easily, and if you pick thinner paper, it won't be able to gather enough momentum to really fly. It's important to be precise when you try to fold the paper exactly in half. After you're done, run your finger along the crease to make sure that it's secure., Once you've secured the crease, just unfold the paper in the same exact way that you folded it. You'll be left with a piece of paper with a vertical crease running down its center.

, This will create two triangles that meet along the middle crease of the plane. Running your fingers along the outer edges of the triangles will reinforce the folds.

, Take the top corner of the paper and fold it down along the line created by the bottom edges of the two triangles. You'll be creating a mirror image of the top triangle over this line. You'll have a triangle with a corner that is pointing downward instead of upward.

, The bottom corner of the big triangle should still be peeking below the folds created by the top two corners. Just the tips of the triangles created by the top two corners should meet an inch (2.5 cm) above the bottom corner of the big triangle below them.

, Just take the little flap below the two folded triangles and fold it upward, above the little space where the two triangles met. Make sure that the creases on the sides of the airplane are nice and firm after you do this by running your finger along their edges.

, Fold the plane lengthwise in the opposite direction of the way you folded it in the beginning. You should be able to see the little triangles you created on the outer sides of the plane after this fold.

, Fold one wing down so that it gradually slopes downward, with the thickest part of the wing being at the bottom and falling below the bottom edge of the plane. Then, fold the other wing down the same way to meet the first wing. This will make the plane as aerodynamic as it can be and can make it fly long distances and loop in the air.

Add the final layer and allow the full piece to dry completely.,
Paint the volcano.",How to Make a Papier Mâché Volcano2," The paste mix is an integral part of making any papier mâché project. There are several different mixes you can make, although the main ingredients you can use are water, flour, and sometimes glue. A good ratio is 1:6 for flour and water, respectively. You may add one or two tablespoons of glue or paste to make your mix a little stronger, but it isn't necessary.








, Newspaper or paper towels work best for papier mâché. They absorb the paste mix best, and they're more pliable than copy paper or construction paper – though the latter are viable options as well. Tear the paper into strips about one inch wide and six inches long. They don't need to be precise. Bear in mind that the wider, shorter pieces are easier to work with for optimum coverage.








, Dip a paper strip in the paste mix, and squeegee off any extra paste by running the paper between two fingers. Lay the strip over your base. It is a good idea to lay the strips in a random pattern; if you lay them all vertically or all horizontally it is more likely that your volcano will have unsightly raised edges or even cracks when it is dry. Continue laying strips of paper over the base until it is completely covered.









Keep some old rags or cloths on hand to wipe hands. The papier mâché can stick to hands and make it difficult to do other things. If you're helping kids make a volcano, they might wipe the gluey mixture on themselves, each other, or their surroundings., If the base layer, or any following layers, are not thoroughly dry before you add another layer, the entire volcano will take longer to dry when it is complete. The more layers of paper, paste, and then paint you add, the more moisture will be caught inside. This may cause your entire volcano to crack, collapse, or grow mold – and the paint may not dry properly, either, which can lead to a cracked exterior.

, Once the base layer is dry, continue adding pasted strips around your volcano core until it is built up to the thickness that you want. If you don't want a particular thickness, it's a good idea to wrap at least three layers of paper around your base. To soften the mouth of your volcano, you can secure one end of a strip to the inside of the toilet paper tube, then secure the other end to the outside of the volcano.








, The final layer of papier mâché does not need to be laid smoothly over the base. As a matter of fact, it's better if it isn't! The previous layers of paper should be relatively smooth, giving the volcano a solid structure. With your final layer, you are mainly shaping the appearance. Lay your pasted strip of paper over the volcano and pinch the strip in the middle. This will create a ridge in the paper, which makes your end result look more like a stone mountain!








, Once the papier mâché is dry, paint the form to look like a volcano! Use acrylic paints to make the volcano look realistic; other paints work as well, but acrylic works best with papier mâché. Greys and browns stippled with black can give the appearance of stone for an active volcano, while greens can give the appearance of a grass-covered dormant volcano. If you're confident in your painting skills, spill red and yellow paint from the mouth down the sides to show the magma from an erupting volcano!

Prepare your volcano to explode.,
Erupt with baking soda and vinegar.,
Explode with Diet Coke and Mentos.,
Clean up.",How to Make a Papier Mâché Volcano3," The ""explosion"" is the result of a chemical reaction between two substances – usually baking soda and vinegar. You'll need up to a cup of vinegar and two tablespoons of baking soda, though these increments will vary depending on how large your volcano and crater are. Alternately, try using Diet Coke and Mentos to make your volcano explode for a twist on a classic method. You'll need a 12-ounce bottle of Diet Coke and three mint Mentos.







, Use 1








Add the baking soda first, then the vinegar. Shake two tablespoons of baking soda into the bottom of your ""crater"" bottle. Make sure that you're ready to manage the spillage. When you are ready to erupt, pour 1/4 cup to 1 cup of vinegar over the baking soda. The volcano burst with foam as the ""lava"" spills over the rim of the crater and down the papier mâché mountainsides.
Add the vinegar first, then the baking soda. Pour up to a cup of vinegar into the crater, depending on how large of a bottle you used. Mix in any food coloring or jello granules. When you are ready, dump the baking soda into the vinegar with one swift motion. Watch your volcano erupt!

, Ideally, use an unopened Diet Coke bottle as the ""crater"" of the volcano – although you may also crack a fresh soda open and pour it into the crater just before eruption time. Either way, you should have an open bottle full of bubbling Diet Coke in the center of your volcano model. Get all the Mentos into the bottle as quickly as possible for a smooth and powerful eruption.









One way that works quite well is to drill a small hole in the center of each mint and hang all three by a string. When ready for the erupting volcano, hold the string with all three Mentos centered over the bottle hole and let go.
Flavored versions of Diet Coke (Vanilla, Cherry, etc.) don't react as well as the original, nor do flavored Mentos work as well as the classic mint flavor. Original for both is best.

, If any of the ""erupted"" material spilled onto the floor, the counter, or any other surface, clean it up before it dries. This is especially important with Diet Coke, which will become sticky when dry. Use a sponge to wipe down surfaces. If you intend to use the volcano again, wipe down the surface before it becomes completely saturated with foam and liquid. Once the model dries, it should be ready to use again!

Unfold your airplane and prepare to launch.",How to Make a Boomerang Airplane1," Normal sized pieces of printer paper are generally 8.5 by 11 inches (21.59 by 27.94 cm), which is the recommended size paper for an origami super boomerang airplane. And if the option is available to you, choose 20 or 24-pound weight paper to make a sturdier craft. Crease your fold firmly.The “weight” of your paper does not describe the actual heaviness of a sheet, but the sturdiness and thickness of it. Higher weight paper is sturdier, and will withstand air-forces better when you launch the boomerang in real life. 20 and 24 lb paper is most frequently used in copy machines and office printers.When working with children, you may want to make use of the term “hot dog” style to help young ones better associate the long-sided orientation of the paper with the fold stretching left-to-right. Generally, folding something “hot dog” style is folding it like you would to make a hot dog – lengthwise down the middle.
It is also possible for you to use A4 paper or a 6 - inch square of origami paper to fold your origami super boomerang. However, when one of these irregular shapes of paper, you will have to be especially precise with your folds and may have to make slight modifications.;
, Open your paper and set it on your work space so it is lying lengthwise (horizontally). The crease in the middle of your paper should run left-to-right. Now take the bottom left and the bottom right corners one at a time and fold each inward to the crease.When folding your corners, line up each so the edges both run to evenly alongside the center crease. There should be a 2 - 3 inch gap (5 - 7.6 cm) between your folded corners.
You can use a paper folding tool called a bone folder to help you form tighter creases when folding. You could make a bone folder of your own easily. You might use a smooth bottle cap, a paperweight, or even a coin in your pocket to press with while you fold your paper. This will form an especially crisp crease, which will strengthen your finished boomerang airplane., The bottom half of your paper should now have both corners folded in and aligned evenly with the middle crease. However, a flap at the bottom should remain. The bottom-most edge of the flap should still run parallel to the middle crease.


Fold the bottom edge, which should run parallel to the middle crease, up to meet the crease. Then fold once more so the newly formed bottom edge again bends up to meet the middle crease.Avoid overlapping the crease too much. When your edges overlap, the final fold can become weakened. Neat, well aligned folds will help maintain the structure of your paper airplane.With multiple/layered folds, you should take extra care to reinforce your fold by running your nail or bone folder along your creases. The more layers of paper you have to fold, the more pressure you’ll have to apply to get a sharp crease on each of the layered pages.

, Turn your paper so that the folded half is facing the left side. With this new orientation, the bottom edge of your paper should be an even line except for the leftmost side, which should be angled in an upward diagonal. Fold this bottom strip so its diagonal meets the diagonal fold immediately above it.Depending on the crispness of your folds, the weight of your paper, and the size of paper you’ve used, the size of this fold could vary. You will likely need to fold the tab upward at around the 1-inch mark (2.54 cm).

, Turn your paper so the folded half faces the right side instead of the left. Your folded tab should be at the top of your page, and the edge of the bottom tab should be mostly straight except for an upward diagonal at the far right. Take the bottom tab and bend it upwards so its diagonal runs along the folded diagonal above it. Use crisp, clean folds.


This fold, much like the one previous, may increase or decrease in size depending on paper weight, size, and your folding skills. Approximately, you’ll have to fold your bottom tab upward at around the 1-inch mark (2.54 cm).

, Turn the folded half of your paper from its current right side position to face downward again. Then you should unfold the flaps on the left and right that you just folded. You will need to re-fold, reinforce the folds with your nail or bone folder, and re-open the tabs several times to strengthen the fold. Then leave your tabs unfolded.At this time you should go over all your folds with your nail or a bone folder. This will strengthen the creases of your aircraft and help your plane fly best.

, You can do this with any substantial hard edge, like the edge of your desk, the edge of a sturdy bookcase, the edge of a clean counter-top, and so on. Then:


Take your paper with one long side end in each hand. Be sure you are holding your paper with the folds facing downward toward your edge.
Bend the downward facing side of your paper along the edge by winding it tightly along the top of the edge, the side of the edge, and along the bottom of the edge in a back and forth motion.
Before performing this maneuver, you should check your edge for irregularities. Chips, cracks, or other deformities in your can catch on your paper and cause it to rip. A quick inspection beforehand can save you the trouble of having to start from the beginning to redo your folds.
Apply firm pressure with your hands to improve the bend. Be careful not to apply too much pressure; this can lead to a rip or a tear. You should also keep your movements steady and perpendicular (forming an L-shape to) the counter. This will prevent your paper from catching on the table.
Give extra attention to the heavily folded half of your page. You should reinforce the half of your page with many layered folds by running the folds as directly along the hard edge as possible.When finished, your paper should have a curved, semi-circular, bowed shape from running it back and forth along the hard edge. If you lay your paper on a flat surface and it does not curl into a bowed/semi-circular shape, you should run your paper along your hard edge more until it does.

, Position your paper so the folds are face up with the folded half of the page pointing in the downward direction. The outer left and right tabs, which you left unfolded while running your paper along an edge, will need to be folded inward again. This fold will return the diagonal of each tab to meet and run evenly along the diagonal fold above each tab.


Once you have refolded your left and right tabs, you should fold the outside edges together so the left and right sides meet evenly. Fold a sharp crease down the middle lengthwise.

, With your paper oriented lengthwise, open the middle fold you’ve just made. Now take the outside left and right edges and fold these to the middle crease.


Reinforce your folds here, especially the thick creases that have many layers of paper. You can use either your nail or a bone folder. You might also want apply more pressure to achieve the best crease.

, You should have two flaps folding inward that meet at the center crease. Take the right flap and peel it back so its inside edge now runs even with the outermost right edge.


Do this for both sides to create a small gap in the center. Use your nail or a bone folder to reinforce the thick folds here to strengthen your plane.

, Fold your paper in half lengthwise. Reinforce your folds by running your nail or a bone folder along the creases, particularly the creases with many folds. When you have finished re-creasing, turn your paper so the open, uncreased side is facing in the downward direction (toward you) and:


Fold the top flap, which should contain several layers of paper, to meet the top edge. Then turn your paper over and perform the same fold with the opposite flap of your paper.
Crease the resulting folds well. Run your nail or bone folder several times along each crease. Due to the thickness of your folds at this point, you may have the best results creating crisp creases with a heavy, flat-edged paperweight., Your airplane should unfold in a zig-zag/staircase shape. One half of the zig-zag strip will be heavily folded and the other half not folded at all. The folded end is the nose of your plane.


Hold the plane by laying your pointer finger in the trough of the very middle of your zig-zags so that the tip of your finger almost reaches the folded part of the nose of your plane. Your other fingers should support the plane from beneath.
Launch your plane by throwing outward while curving your hand in the direction you want your boomerang plane to return to you. For example, if you want your boomerang plane to loop around and return to you on the right, you should curve your hand to the right when throwing. If you want the plane to loop around on the left, you should curve to the left while throwing.
It may take a considerable amount of practice before you get the hang of throwing your boomerang airplane. You might also need to tweak the shape of your plane. For example, if you are trying to get your plane to curve back to you on the right, you might add a small rightward bend to the back right tail of your plane. This will create more drag on the side, making it cut more in that direction.
By tweaking the tail end of your plane you can further improve its turning or flight. Usually, these tweaks will involve putting small bends or creases in the tail of your plane. By bending the tail up or down, you create different kinds of drag, or wind resistance. Drag forces will influence how your plane flies."

You should be able to buy this from your local arts and craft store or stationary store. Fold it in half lengthwise so that it resembles a hot dog bun.If you have difficulty finding A4 paper, you should use paper roughly A4 dimensions which are 8.27 × 11.69 inches (210 × 297 millimeters). North America convention uses the name “Letter” to refer to a page that is of similar dimensions to A4 sheets.If working with children on this project, you may want to help visualize this fold by explaining it as “hot dog style.” Much like you’d prepare a hot dog left-to-right (horizontally), you’ll fold your paper in half lengthwise hot dog style.You should consider using a smooth, solid object to help your press firmly against the folds you make. This object is usually called a “bone folder” in paper crafting. You might use a smooth bottle cap, a paperweight, or a coin to press against your folds while folding to make cleaner, crisper folds., Lay your page before you so the crease of your fold faces you and the flaps face away. Take the top left corner and fold it down so that the edge that runs between the upper and lower left corner runs along the crease. Then:


Perform this same fold on the other half of your paper so that both same-side corners fold inward evenly along the crease. This will cause the left side of your paper to slope down to the bottom-left corner in a point.
This is the classic paper airplane shape, with a V-shaped nose and simple rectangular body. You should run your nail or some other solid object along your folds at this point to strengthen the creases of your squirrel airplane., First you'll need to open the lengthwise middle fold and lay your paper flat on the table. The left corners of your plane should still be folded, creating an arrow shape pointing to the left. The triangular point of this arrow is the nose of your craft. Take your nose by its tip and fold it inward until the base of the nose becomes the new outside edge.


As your folds thicken, it will become more and more difficult for you to achieve deep, crisp folds. Deep and crisp folds will make a stronger and more precise airplane. Use a bone folder or press creases firmly with your nail to strengthen your folds.
Your nose should fold inward so the outermost perimeter of your paper forms an evenly shaped rectangle. The center of your paper should be creased left to right, and the triangle you folded inward should be pointing inward to the right.

, The nose of your craft should have an upper and lower corner. Fold both corners inward to run along the center crease flatly. Precise folds that don’t overlap will create the strongest and most accurate airplane. After folding your corners, the resulting shape should create an even base, the resulting flaps forming two halves of a triangle.


Once you have finished this fold, your paper should again be shaped like an arrow pointing to the left. Run over your folds with your nail or a bone folder to strengthen them, and pay special attention to folds with many layers. , Hold the tip of your left pointing arrow and fold it inwards. Fold the tip so that it’s tip is even with its base. After you make this fold, the nose will be shaped with two small triangles pointing left and one small triangle pointing right.


Now your craft is ready to be re-creased. Pick up your sheet and bend it along the middle lengthwise crease. Use your nail or a bone folder to strengthen this fold.

, Use a ruler and a marker to draw guidelines for your next folds. You’ll want a 1-inch (2.6 cm) mark along both sides of the nose of your craft and a 1½-inch (3.8 cm) marks on both sides of the tail. Then draw a line from the marks on the nose to the marks on the tail to create your guidelines for both sides. Fold your wings from the outside of each flap and bend both downward until the creases of your wings follow your guidelines perfectly.Your wings, once folded, should face outward to either side flatly. The middle crease will point down and create a V-shape. Getting your wings to maintain this position might require you to repeat the folds several times to strengthen them. You might also use a tool, like a bone folder.
Both Wings should mirror each other in shape and size. One should not be longer than the other. If your wings don’t look like mirror-images, you should unfold your wings, re-measure your guidelines, and check your folds. Correct and refold any errors you find.
If you’re a novice paper crafter, you might have mis-folded a few steps. This might result in some of your creases being weak. Weak folds can hurt the performance of your finished paper airplane, so you might want to start afresh if you’ve had some mis-folds.

, You’ll likely have to adjust your wings with slight bendings and tweaks from your hand to get the wing position right. Looking at your plane head on, open the wings so that they form a flat L-shape at the top of both sides of the V-shaped crease that forms the body of your plane.


When you have finished shaping your wings, pinch the body so both sides of the middle crease are pressed together. Then flip the plane so that the top of the wings are flat on your table., Take your ruler and use your marker to draw a point .62 inches (1.6 cm) from both nose-side corners of the wing to the inside. On the tail corners of both wings, measure and draw a point ½-inch (1.2 cm) to the inside. Use your ruler to connect these two points to form the guideline for your fin fold.


Take extra care to be precise with your fin measurements. These will have a significant effect on the drag forces on your plane and will greatly impact your modified squirrel paper airplane’s ability to boomerang., Small modifications you make to the tail of your paper airplane will have a significant effect on its steering. To boomerang to the left, you’ll need to tweak your tail to steer to the left. Look at your plane from its tail. See how the very back is mostly flat? You’ll want to:


Slightly bend (tweak) the back edge of the right wing to point upwards.
Divide the left wing’s back edge into a right and left half.
Bend the right half of the left wing slightly up.
Bend the left half of the left wing slightly down
Bend the left side fin slightly to the left as well.You will likely have to make adjustments to your tail after you test fly your craft. The balance of your plane, irregular folds, small tears, the position of the bends in your tail – all these can influence your plane’s ability to boomerang. Have patience and tweak the shape of your plane until it boomerangs to the left back into your arms

, But first, pick it up and hold it by the bottom of the V-shaped crease in the middle. Allow your thumb and forefinger to pinch the nose so the sides of the V press together. Then, in a smooth motion that curves to the left, throw your plane and release with your thumb and forefinger.


Note the areas your plane needs improved. If it turns to hard to the left, your leftward tweaks on your tail should be smaller. If it doesn't turn left enough, you should add a deepen your leftward tweaks., The common problem of your plane looping can be solved by adjusting the upward and downward tweaks you made on your rudders. Make your tweaks subtler. If you have the problem of your plane rapidly crashing to the ground, flatten out downward tweaks you made on the left rudder and, on the same rudder, make your upward tweak less subtle.


You may need to adjust your throwing motion. Experiment with your throwing angle and how hard you throw the plane.

, Use papier mâché glue to attach the newspaper pieces with. (The glue recipe can be found here). Add at least two, or maybe more, layers to ensure a good coverage.


Ensure that the layers are smooth and even.
Allow to dry fully between each layer.

, Choose the color design. You could paint the papier mâché minion either as a cute and silly yellow minion or as an adorably aggressive purple one. For the sake of this article, it's a yellow minion shown in the images.


For the yellow minion, paint the entire papier mâché yellow once. Allow to dry. Paint another layer over the dry layer of paint, to ensure complete coverage. The newspaper print must not be viewable underneath the paint.
Paint the blue overalls on over the yellow paint, as shown in the image.
Finish by painting on a minion eye or eyes, surrounded by the familiar minion goggles. Search for images online if you're not sure which one or set of eyes you'd prefer. (One eye is less painting work.) Alternatively, make 3-D eyes and goggles from recycled items and glue these into place.

, As it dries, proceed with making the papier mâché arms and legs., This is easily done by adding papier mâché pieces to each paper towel roll; two rolls for the arms and two for the legs. One to two layers of papier mâché should suffice. Allow to dry fully.

, Use strong glue; you will probably have to either hold in place or prop up the arms and legs until the glue takes, to prevent the appendages from slipping down.


You may find that a stapler or craft pin may help with attachment as well.

, Use the smallest size possible, as it needs to match the minion size.


If you can't find gloves small enough, buy baby gloves from the dollar store and stuff them with newspaper or tissue paper before attaching.

, Once dried, glue one glove to each of the arms. Staples or craft pins may help with attachment.


You may not need to use papier mâché for this step. Test a little paint to see if it will stick to the gloves without having to add the papier mâché. If yes, don't bother; if not, you'll need the papier mâché.

, These can be purchased from the dollar store or a thrift store for next-to-nothing. Fill each baby sock with newspaper or the paper tissue paper, then use papier mâché to cover the sock. Staple the socks to enclose the paper, then attach the socks at the end of the minion's feet.


Once again, as with the glove, try some fabric paint first to see whether you need to use papier mâché at all.
The socks may be easier to attach by stapling them in place.

, Paint the socks black for the boots of the minion and the legs blue for pants. Paint the arms yellow and the gloves black. Do any other touch-ups as needed at this point.

Prepare some mummy strips.,
Wrap the Pharaoh in papier mâché strips.,
Let the mummy dry.",How to Make a Mummy1," Otherwise, the head of the mummy will be difficult to wrap.


Don’t use someone else’s doll without asking permission.
Inexpensive dolls can be bought at grocery stores and discount department stores.;
, Add one part water to one part flour in a large mixing bowl. Next, whisk the mixture together to create a smooth paste.The paste should have the consistency of pancake batter. If it’s too thick, add a few splashes of water. If it’s too thin, sprinkle in more flour.


For example, if you use one cup of flour, you will need one cup of water.
Add a tablespoon of salt to the paste if you want to prevent molding.

, Tear out small, thin strips of unruled white paper or thin cloth. You can also use newspaper, tissue paper, or paper towels.If you’re making an authentic-looking mummy, choose white paper or fabric. Otherwise, the mummy will be multicolored.


The strips should be about 3-4 inches long (7.5 to 10 centimeters) and half an inch wide (1.3 centimeters).

, First, dip a strip of paper or fabric into your paste and coat each side. Gently squeeze the strip to remove any excess paste. Next, wrap the strip around the mummy as tightly as you can.Wrap the arms against the body. Mummies usually don’t have individually wrapped arms.
If you decide to do more than one layer of papier mâché, let each layer dry completely before adding another.

, Leave the mummy in a sunny spot for twenty-four to forty-eight hours. This will guarantee that any layers have dried. Otherwise, the mummy may mold.


To test whether or not the mummy is dry, press it gently with a finger. The papier mâché should be chalky and stiff.
To speed the drying process, place the mummy under a fan.

Start coloring.",How to Create Papier Mâché," Papier-mâché can get a bit messy (what good DIY project doesn't?), so to protect your grandma's beloved dining table, lay down a few newspapers or other scrap material to keep clean up at a minimum. While you are grabbing newspaper, also get a hold of:





A bowl or large container
Flour, wallpaper powder/paste, or white glue
Water
Your base structure
Paintbrush
Newspaper (for your project -- not for clean-up duty);
, The ideal width would be around one inch (2.5 cm) thick, but each project requires different shapes and sizes. In addition, you will want to go around your project three times, so tear quite a pile. Don't opt for the scissors -- a torn edge blends better than a cut edge.





There is no wrong size your strips could be. In fact, if you want to add volume to your structure by molding the strips, you will need different sizes. So tear away freely.

, A few slight variations will result in the same product. Use what you have at your disposal.






Glue mixture: Pour 2 parts white glue and one part water into a mixing bowl. These quantities can be changed to suit the size of your project. Or, if you have a stronger bonding glue, 1 part white glue and 1 part water will do the trick.

Flour mixture: Combine 1 part flour with 1 part water. Easy as pie!

For super large and intense projects, you may want to substitute white glue for the water.



Wallpaper powder: Pour 2 parts wallpaper powder and one part water into a mixing bowl. This method is good if you're thinking seriously long-term -- it can last years.

, Do this using a paintbrush, a mixing spoon or mixing stick. Blend until it forms a smooth consistency.





If it's too thin or thick, adjust accordingly. Add more adhesive base if it's too thin, water if it's too thick.

, Examples include a balloon, cardboard or a molded figure. In addition, you can papier-mâché two objects together to form a creation! The mixture will take to anything.





If you're using a balloon, consider painting it with cooking oil beforehand -- that way, when it's dry, you can slide it out easily.

, You're going to get your fingers messy! The messier you get, the better job you're doing.




, Do this by lightly sliding two fingers from the top to the bottom of the strip of paper. Hold it over the bowl so it drips back into the container.




, Smooth it out, using either your fingers or a paintbrush. Be sure to get as many of the creases and bumps out as you can. You are aiming to get a very smooth surface for painting and decorating.





If you'd like to create a shape (a face, say), bunch the strip into the form you want, place it on your surface, and then layer another strip on top to smooth it out. This can create volume, texture, and detail quite easily.

, Do this until the entire surface or figure is covered three times over. This is especially important if you're removing the base when it's dry -- it needs to be sturdy and hold its own.





Put your first layer on horizontally, the second vertically, and so forth. It will help show you where you have been before and strengthen the piece.

, It will need a day or so to completely dry, depending on the size of your piece. Leave it untouched until tomorrow, then see if it's ready for painting.




, Paint or decorate as desired. Enjoy! (And be sure to tell everyone you did it yourself.)





Some schools of thought say to start with a white primer. If you're using a light color on the piece, you may want to use this method (otherwise some print may stick out). Make sure not to cover to top part in order to take the balloon out.

Wrap the mummy in plastic.,
Cover the plastic-wrapped mummy in papier mâché.,
Allow the papier mâché to dry.,
Cut the sarcophagus in half.,
Paint the sarcophagus.,
Place the mummy back in the sarcophagus.",How to Make a Mummy2," Use a plastic bag, a trash bag, or a grocery bag. Create a thick, padded layer around the mummy. This will mimic the sarcophagus shape.After wrapping, your mummy should look like a small plastic baguette.

, Lay paste-covered strips of paper or fabric all over the plastic. Wrap the strips completely around the mummy so that all parts are covered. Add three or four layers to create a thick sarcophagus wall.


Let each layer dry for an hour or two before applying another., Set the sarcophagus in a sunny spot to dry for a day or two. To check whether or not it’s ready, gently press a finger against the papier mâché. The sarcophagus should feel stiff and chalky to the touch.


Place the sarcophagus under a fan to speed up the drying process.The sarcophagus needs to be completely dry before you paint it. Otherwise, it may mold and fall apart.

, Use craft scissors or a crafting blade to carefully cut the sarcophagus in half. First, lay the sarcophagus on its back. Next, carefully make an incision halfway up the side of the sarcophagus. Continue cutting all around the side to create a front half and a back half.


If needed, use a pencil to draw a guide line around the sides. Follow this line when cutting the sarcophagus.

, Use acrylic paints to paint the sarcophagus and allow it to dry completely. Use a metallic gold paint for the face and body accents. Use a combination of red, blue, and green for the other parts of the sarcophagus. Consider adding authentic touches to the outside. For example:


Add black and blue accent stripes along the side.
Paint on Egyptian symbols, such as the symbol for Anubis.
Detail small “offerings” by painting depictions of grain, bread, or gold., First, cut away and discard the plastic wrapping around the mummy. Next, lay the mummy in the bottom half of the sarcophagus. Place the lid on top to enclose your mummy.

Embalm the sacred organs.,
Wash the body with more wine.,
Embalm the Pharaoh with natron.,
Wrap the body with linens.,
Place the death mask on the Pharaoh.,
Lay the Pharaoh to rest.",How to Make a Mummy3," Clean the body with palm wine to remove any dirt or debris. Next, rinse the sticky palm wine away with water from the Nile river. This water is considered sacred and will purify the Pharaoh’s body., Make an incision on the Pharaoh’s side, just under the rib cage. Remove the stomach, intestines, liver, and lungs. Set these sacred organs aside. Next, use a hook to remove the brain through the nose. Discard this organ., Place the sacred organs in ornate, decorative jars. Fill these jars with embalming fluid or natron, a naturally occurring combination of baking soda and salt. This will preserve the organs for use in the afterlife. The heads of the jars depict:


Imsety
Happy the baboon-headed god
Duamutef the jackal-headed god
Qebehsenuef the falcon-headed god, Palm wine can act as an antiseptic when used as a cleaning solution. Washing the body again with this wine will kill any bacteria that might disrupt the embalming process.

, Place the Pharaoh’s body in a recessed trough on a layer of natron. Insert several sachets of natron inside the body cavity. Next, pour more natron over the body until it’s completely covered. Let the body embalm for forty days.Natron will draw out all of the liquid in the body to embalm it. Without bodily liquids, the Pharaoh can’t decay.

, First, cover the Pharaoh in a royal funeral shroud. Next, wrap the Pharaoh with strips of fine linen. While wrapping, insert amulets and jewelry into the strips. You can also cast spells and chant incantations during this process.


Depending on the time period, some Pharaohs also have their names written on each linen strip., Each Pharaoh has a death mask made of gold. These masks help the spirit identify the body in death. Gently lay the death mask over the Pharaoh’s wrapped head to complete the mummification.Many less wealthy Egyptians used death masks. However, these masks were made of wood or plaster.

, First, gently lay the Pharaoh in the painted and prepared sarcophagus, being careful not to disturb the death mask. After the sarcophagus is closed, the Pharaoh can be placed in his tomb. Set the sacred organ jars around the sarcophagus and seal the tomb.


Depending on the wishes of the Pharaoh, servants, gold, chariots, and other worldly goods may be entombed with him.

Select a suitable mould.,
Cover the mould in Vaseline.,
Dip a strip of paper into the paste.,
Leave the first layer to dry for an hour or two.,
Put on another few layers the following day.,
Remove the mould from the project once it is fully dried.,
Trim the rim of the bowl to get rid of the jagged edges.




,
Decorate.,
Varnish the new masterpiece.,
Finished!




",How to Make a Papier Mâché Bowl," You can either make your own paste or use a ready-made paste. Plain flour and water makes an ideal paste and is non-toxic and made in a jiffy. See below for the recipe. Alternatively, you can use wallpaper paste as a ready-made solution - just follow the instructions on the package for making it.





To make your own flour and water paste:

Add 1/2 a cup of flour and then a cup full of water.
Mix until smooth. Create a thin paste that is about the consistency of double cream. Some recipe variants suggest adding one tablespoon of sugar to the mixture, though if you're going to do this, make sure to use plain (all purpose) flour.

;
, Follow the grain of the paper if you can. The thinner that you can make the strips, the better. It is recommended that you aim for strips that are about 2-3cm (.78"" x 1.1"") wide.




, Beginners are better off starting with a typical bowl shape. For the more advanced, you may like to vary the shape according to your imagination.




, Be sure to cover it thickly. This is important because it helps to get your project off the mould. If you don't have enough covering the mould, the project may break as you try to remove it. (Or if the shape affords it, cover with plastic wrap, making sure it is covered completely, securing it with tape, if necessary, in a place that won't be covered by the paper strips.)





If using wallpaper paste, it will not stick to the plastic wrap.

, Wipe off the excess - whilst it should be covered in paste, do not have it dripping. Place the strip onto the mould and smooth it out. Repeat with each strip until the bowl is entirely covered with a single layer.




, After the mould is completely covered, prepare a second layer. Leave the double layered project overnight to dry. This will allow the base of the bowl to harden thoroughly. Keep in a warm, dry spot.




, This will strengthen the bowl and thicken it. Leave to dry. Repeat until the mould is covered with paper to about the depth of 1 - 2 cm (.39"" - .78 "").





This may take many days for drying but it is an important step to ensure that the bowl retains it shape, strength and is not at risk of getting mildew from poor drying.
Keep testing with your finger during the drying stages to check for any moist spots.

, Slip a spatula between the paper and the mould. Gently separate the two items and lever the mould out.




,, The bowl is now ready for any type of decoration that fits with your needs. Suggestions for decorating include using collage or découpage, painting, wrapping paper, etc. Ensure that the decoration method is dry before proceeding to the next step.





If wished, apply a coat of emulsion and paint with acrylic paints.

, This will protect the bowl from dust and spills. The bowl is not suitable for use as a food serving item - it is only a decorative object. However, such an object can have many uses, including display, a place to keep things in, a coffee table talking piece etc.

Identify your reason for creating a scrapbook.,
Decide how you want to organize your scrapbook.,
Determine how you’d like to construct your scrapbook.,
Gather your pictures and put them in groups.",How to Start a Scrapbook1," Are there stacks of pictures in a drawer that you want to do something with? Does your iPhone currently have over a thousand pictures of your kids? Do you want to commemorate your wedding anniversary by displaying your favorite moments? Or would you simply like to take on a project to satisfy your inner-creative? Figure out why you want to start a scrapbook and what it will allow you to do.

, Once you’ve figured out why you want to start a scrapbook, you’ll need to figure out how best to present your idea. Your scrapbook can focus on a particular theme. It can attempt to tell a story.Or it can simply unfold a set of events in chronological order.


Let’s say you took your first trip to Europe, and returned with hundreds of photos. You could choose to create a scrapbook that highlights each city you visited. European cities would be your theme.
Maybe during your trip you got lost and met a group of locals who decided to show you the best places to visit in their city, including inviting you to an intimate gathering. You could craft your scrapbook around that impromptu adventure, which means your scrapbook would tell a story.
Or maybe you don’t want to leave anything out of your scrapbook about your trip. You could organize and display your photos in chronological order.

, You can create your scrapbook the old-fashioned way: by hand; or you could create it digitally using computer software. Figure out your preference by asking yourself a few questions:


Which method would be easiest for you?
Which method would you most enjoy?
Do you want to be able to hold your scrapbook in your hand once it’s finished?
Would you like to give your friends or family members their own copy of your scrapbook?
Do you want to avoid the mess that comes with making a scrapbook by hand? Or do you enjoy the physical act of making crafts?

, Pull together the pictures you plan to use in your scrapbook. If you’re creating a bound scrapbook, then have your pictures printed if they’re not already. Organize your pictures either by theme, chronological order, or based on the story you’d like to tell. If your photos are on a computer, you can easily organize them by moving them into separate folders. If your photos are on your smart phone, first transfer them to a computer, and then separate them into folders.

Create a work area.,
Gather your materials.,
Mix your adhesive.",How to Make Papier Mâché Planets1," Find a table or other flat area that can be easily covered to make as little of a mess as possible. Cover the area with newspaper to make for a quick and easy clean up. The adhesive used in papier-mâché can be difficult to remove from wood and other surfaces.






;
, You'll need some basic materials to get started. Papier-mâché doesn't require special supplies. You will need:


A large bowl for mixing your adhesive mixture.
A cup or two of water.
Newspapers torn into long, narrow strips. A good size to aim for is 2 to 3 inches wide and 6 to 7 inches long per strip.
Paint brushes.
Paint or markers to color the planets. In order to make the planets as realistic as possible you'll need all your basic colors handy: orange, yellow, blue, brown, green, red, gray, and white.
At least a dozen balloons, in case you need a few extra.
Ingredients for adhesive: you can use either white craft glue or flour and water.
Material for planet rings. Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune all have rings. You'll need a thin flexible wire or pipe cleaner to form rings, or you can just use construction paper.

, There are two easy ways to make an adhesive that you'll use to apply the newspaper strips to the balloons. You can either use a white craft glue base or a white flour base.









If you want to use glue, you can buy any basic white glue. Mix two parts glue to one part water in a bowl. You'll need several cups to make the entire set of planets.
If you don't have glue readily available, you can grab some white flour from your cupboard. Mix one part flour to one part water in a bowl. Make about two cups.
You'll want a consistency that resembles the thickness of glue, but not so thick that it does not spread easily over your newspaper strips. If it is too thick add more water. If it is too watery, add some more glue or flour.

Visit a craft store to find vellum sheets, vellum adhesive and pens.,
Work carefully with vellum.,
Do not touch vellum excessively with greasy fingers.,
Place bold decorative paper underneath white vellum.",How to Use Vellum on a Scrapbook Page1," Vellum curls and looks wet when used with wet glues, so most vellum glue is sold in tabs that do not distort the surface of the paper. Vellum pens are formulated differently because pens intended for paper can blur and take a long time to set on the plasticized surface.


Make sure that any glue you use with vellum is acid-free.;
, Although you may use vellum to layer, make envelopes and crimp, like you do with normal paper, vellum tears easily. Work slowly and deliberately with this material.

, Wash your hands before handling vellum and after you use glue. Oils can gather on vellum paper if you touch it too often.

, The overlay effect will be strong if you can still see a muted image or color underneath the vellum. Use this overlay effect to soften the look of your scrapbook.

Select plain cardstock paper that supports your color story.,
Purchase patterned paper that supports your theme.,
Experiment with transparency paper.,
Purchase a curated paper collection.",How to Select the Proper Scrapbook Paper1," Acid-free cardstock is a staple of scrapbooking. It is a stiff, heavy paper that can withstand the weight of embellishments, photos, and memorabilia. These characteristics make it ideal to use as a background for your album’s pages. Cardstock is available in every imaginable solid color, texture, and finish. When you select your cardstock, pick out colors, textures, and finishes that complement your scrapbook’s color story—the palette of colors you choose to use in the album.


You may also use cardstock to mat photos, frame pictures, and create embellishments.
Finishes include: iridescent, glossy, matte, and glitter.80 pounds is the most popular cardstock weight. It is similar in thickness to a business card.;
, Scrapbookers rely on acid-free patterned paper to help them tell their narrative, express their theme, and unite their album. The patterns you select should reflect your theme and align with your color story. This lightweight paper is perfect for accents and use as a background.


You may choose patterns that clearly expresses your theme—palm trees for tropical vacations or ballerinas for a dance recital—or you can pick paper with an abstract or geometrical pattern that will work for a variety of pages within your album.
If you struggle to mix and match patterns and colors, you can purchase sets of printed paper., In addition to using solid and patterned paper, scrapbookers also incorporate transparent sheets of acetate paper into their albums. Transparency paper may be completely see through or contain a printed pattern. You may use this paper as an overlay or for a background.


In an effort to keep your album cohesive, the transparency paper you purchase should match the cardstock and patterned paper you select for your project. Do not purchase transparency paper that is unrelated to your theme and/or color palette., Scrapbooking aisles provide consumers with a myriad of options, but don't allow the seemingly endless options to overwhelm you. If you are struggling to mix and match patterns, colors, and even paper types for you backgrounds, opt to purchase a curated pack of paper. Every pattern and color was carefully selected to complement the other options within the pack. A collection of paper will give you a good starting point.


Most packs of curated paper have a line of matching embellishments."

Purchase the colors of chalk you'd like to use.,
Purchase an appropriate tool for adding the chalk to the paper.,
Purchase the right sort of paper for chalking and scrapbooking.,
Add the chalk.,
Add decorative effects over the chalking.,
Blend chalk colors.,
Finished.

",How to Use Chalking in Scrapbooking," The only rider is that the chalk must be acid-free and this will only be known if the box states that it is ""acid-free"". It is probably best to visit a craft store rather than an art store, as artist's chalk tends to be acidic.;
, It's recommended that you don't use your fingers to apply the chalk directly because the oils from your fingers will mix with the chalk and spoil the appearance. The tools for chalking should be provided in the scrapbooking area as well as the acid-free chalk. Basically they appear like little sponges for eyeshadow or similar and they will enable you to apply the chalk without getting chalk all over your hands. The sizes of the tools vary, and it can be a good idea to purchase a few so that you can experiment with them and get a good idea of how they work on paper.


Also purchase a chalk eraser. This will allow you to take out any chalked errors and they don't damage paper.

, The best type is matte paper.

, Chalking can create many different effects and much of your experimenting with the chalk will bring up different ideas of your own. Some basic things to try include:


Chalk over a dark background with light chalk for a dramatic contrast.
Use a darker shade of chalk over the background to create a shadow effect.
Bring colors together and make interesting effects. Try two tones first and blend them well where they join so that they appear to bleed into one another. Add more color changes as liked.
Use chalk around the edges of die-cuts for embellishing them.

, There are many possible effects and the best thing is to experiment with designs and materials that you're used to, then branching out from there.


Use gel pens to create designs over chalked areas.
Use a slightly dampened artist's brush to create lines, plumes, dots, etc. within the chalked areas. Be careful not to have it too wet.
Use ink over the chalked areas.

, If you want to extend the range of colors in the chalks, scrape chalk dust onto a saucer or similar container and mix the colors together to create new shades. There are many possible variations and you may wish to keep leftovers in containers with clear labels for the name of the colors you've created.

Choose the size of your scrapbook.,
Gather your design materials.,
Plan your layout.,
Start putting your pages together.,
Fill each page of your scrapbook until it is complete.",How to Start a Scrapbook2," When choosing an album for your scrapbook, you have several sizes to choose from.The 12x12 is considered the standard size. Other sizes include the 8.5x11, the 8x8, and several different sizes of mini albums.


The size you choose depends on the sizes and amount of your pictures, what you hope to accomplish with your scrapbook, and also the scope of the project you feel comfortable taking on.
If purchasing your album as part of a scrapbooking kit, then the 12x12 size will have more of a variety of materials for you to use.
If you don’t want to take on a large project and if you prefer to finish your scrapbook quickly, choose an 8x8.
One of the mini-sized albums is perfect for taking on a small project and capturing snapshots of occasions, like a baby shower.;
, You can purchase your scrapbook as part of a scrapbooking kit. This is especially helpful if this is your first time starting a scrapbook. Most of the design materials will be included in the kit, such as patterned paper, ribbon, stenciled designs, and word art.


Here’s an overview of the essential materials you’ll need: an album with acid-free and lignin-free pages, page protectors to protect your photos from the oils on your fingertips, photo-safe glue or tape, pigma ink pen in your desired color(s), and scissors.In terms of the design materials included in your scrapbooking kit, the color of the paper and the types of designs you choose will depend on what your scrapbook is for. The materials you use to commemorate the birth of your son will likely differ from what you’ll use to celebrate your daughter’s fifth birthday.

, Before getting started, it may be helpful to plan the layout of your scrapbook. Since you already know which photos you’re going to be using and essentially how you want them grouped, you can make a sketch of four to six common layouts you’d like for your scrapbook to include.


Your layout will show how you’d like your pictures to be placed on the page. Some pages could feature only one photo, some only two or three, while another could have a collage of several photos.
Take a sheet of paper and draw out the layouts you’d like to use. Include spaces where you may want to add designs and/or hand written or printed messages. If you’re having trouble with this step, physically arranging a layout with some of your pictures at a table may help.

, With your layout ideas in place, you can begin putting your pages together. If your scrapbook doesn’t come with a printed background already included on each page, you will likely have to cut and glue printed paper for each page’s background. Once the background is applied, you can begin laying your pictures in their proper places, using your layouts as a guide.


Don’t glue them down until you feel confident about their placement. You may need to trim some photos if they aren’t totally fitting on the page.
Once your pictures are set and glued down, you can add your designs, like stickers or images, or special quotes and written messages.
For a wedding scrapbook, you could include a biblical scripture that was read during your wedding ceremony.
If you’re creating a scrapbook of all of your kids, include comments identifying the dates and/or locations of some pictures.
You could include elegant designs, like flowery prints or swirling lines. Prints of stars could occupy free corners of some pages.

, Work your way through your scrapbook until all of your pictures have been included and designs added, or until you feel you’re all done.

Set a background for your front cover and your pages.,
Import your photos to start putting your pages together.,
Design your pages.,
Save your scrapbook.",How to Start a Scrapbook3," If technology is more your forte as opposed to arts and crafts, then starting a scrapbook on the computer may be your best option. Also if you have tons of pictures to go through that are stored to your computer or a smart phone device, then this may be the more simple option for you.


There are several programs available that will allow you to create a digital scrapbook. You can do a quick search online for those available programs. There may be a fee associated with the program you choose. Because of that, some programs allow you to test out their product before you commit to it. This will help you determine which digital scrapbook program will work best for you.
Each program likely has different step-by-step methods for carrying out an action. The following instructions can be applied generally to any program.

, Once you’ve picked your program, you can begin to work on your scrapbook. Start the program and then click “New” to start a new scrapbook.The file may be given a generic name, such as “Untitled,” so feel free to give the file a name that references your project, such as “Sam’s First Birthday Scrapbook.”

, Similar to starting a scrapbook that’s bound, you’ll have to determine the size of your digital scrapbook. You can determine the size based on the amount of pictures you plan to use, or by what seems visually appealing to you. You can also follow the sizing of a physical scrapbook and choose standard sizes, such as 12x12, 8.5x11, 8x8, or a miniature size.

, Before getting started, it’s best to have a general idea of how you’d like to place your pictures in your scrapbook. If you grouped your pictures together in the planning stage, then you should already know which pictures you’d like to include on each page. Now that you’ve determined the size of your scrapbook, take a sheet of paper and sketch out about 4 to 6 different layouts, or rearrange some of your pictures on a blank computer screen to determine what will look best.

, Unlike a physical scrapbook, you aren’t limited by the amount of materials available in your scrapbooking kit or by what you’ve purchased when designing your scrapbook.


You can set the background for each page by choosing from the program’s available choices. Select your preferred background and either drag it onto your layout, or click “apply.” You can apply a different background to each page or apply the same background to all of your pages.
You’ll likely have to work through your scrapbook sequentially, starting with the front cover and working through page by page. However, depending on the program you may be able to insert new pages before and after an already existing page, which will allow you to work on your scrapbook out of order.

, Select and upload your pictures for each page, and then arrange them into your preferred layout design. Click the “file” tab to find the option to upload an image. Depending on the program you’re using, there may be an image icon for you to click to access your images without clicking the “file” tab. Use your mouse to drag the pictures into position. You can also resize your pictures, making them bigger or smaller, if necessary.

, Once your pictures are set, you can play around with the features of your design software to add designs. You can add frames to your pictures, insert design elements, and word art to create the layout you want.


If for example you’re making a scrapbook to celebrate your daughter’s first year, you could add images of her favorite animals or toys, you could include a sweet message for her to read when she gets older, or you could include an image of a birthday cake.
Let’s say you’re memorializing your trip to Africa, include decorative images of an airplane, maps, and special quotes about traveling or a safari.

, Once you’re finished designing your scrapbook, save it. You can then either prepare to have it printed, or you could email it to your family and friends.

Inflate the balloons to proper size.,
Prepare the papier-mâché.,
Add the papier-mâché to the balloons.,
Look for problem areas.,
Allow the glue to dry.",How to Make Papier Mâché Planets2," You will use ten balloons total. One balloon will represent the sun, and the other nine, the planets. In order from the sun, these are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto (which has been demoted in status to a ""dwarf planet"";after conducting your own research, you may choose whether or not to include it). Although you may not be able to get the scale exact, it will be useful for educational purposes to blow up the balloons so that their relative size matches the planets they represent. The biggest balloon will be the Sun, which is approximately ten times the largest planet Jupiter. For sake of scale, each planet can be roughly compared to the following objects:









Mercury — marble
Venus — walnut
Earth — golf ball
Mars — acorn
Jupiter — basketball
Saturn — soccer ball
Uranus — soft ball
Neptune — small grapefruit
Pluto — kidney bean , If you’ve never worked with papier-mâché before, it's both a fun and easy medium to work with. The process of making it is simple, but will almost certainly get messy. You will be dipping newspaper strips in your adhesive mixture and applying it to an object, in this case a balloon. Once the strips dry, you'll be left with hardened objects that will represent the planets.









Tear the newspaper into long, thin strips.
Use one strip at a time and get rid of excess adhesive from each strip over the bowl by running your fingers lightly over it. This will conserve your mixture but also make sure your planets are not too soggy.

, Drape the wet newspaper strips across the surface of each balloon. It may help to make two layers, one horizontal and one vertical, so you can be sure of full coverage. Balloons have a tend to wander if not held in place. If you have an extra pair of hands, have one person hold the balloon while the other applies the strips. Otherwise, you can put the balloon in a large bowl that will keep it in place or nestle it between two weighted objects, like some books. 








In order to cover the tie end of the balloon, tape it down and then place a strip directly over the end. Make sure there are no gaps between the strips. You want to cover the balloon completely.
Use your paintbrush to smooth the surface and get rid of excess glue from the newspaper strips. It's okay to leave some texture to the final product as this will make the balloons appear more realistic to the topography of a planet.

, You won't want to peel off layers of dry, painted papier-mâché, so look for any issues after you place the strips.









If you see a strip that doesn't look right and it's not yet dry, simply remove it and reapply a new strip. You can do this after it's dry, but the strip may break apart and require a little more work.

, Factors like humidity and room temperature can affect drying times. You may need to wait until the next day to proceed to the finishing touches. Using a gentle blowing fan may speed the process somewhat, as long as it doesn’t scatter the balloons around the room. It would be best if you have a drying rack, or an enclosed protected space to prevent the balloons from rolling around. Otherwise, the added weight of the glue should limit their movement on its own.

Paint your planets.,
Make planetary rings.,
Make a place to hang your planets.,
Display your project.,
Use your completed project to educate children.",How to Make Papier Mâché Planets3," Many of the planets of our solar system have bright, vivid colors. You'll want to be as accurate as possible if it's an educational project, but otherwise, have fun and be creative! 








Mercury is typically a slight gray or blue.
Venus is a pale yellow.
Earth is mainly blue with white for clouds and green and browns land masses.
Mars is a reddish brown due to its rusty rocks and minerals.
Jupiter is orange with light white bands.
Saturn is a pale gold due to its high concentration of ammonia.
Uranus is a pale blue.
Neptune is also a light blue due to its high concentration of methane.
Should you wish to include Pluto, paint it light brown.

, Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune all have rings. The easiest way to make rings is to use a thin wire purchased from any local hardware store. You can make a small hole in the dried exterior using the wire or a small knife. You'll want the hole to be on the side of the balloon and somewhat centered to make it as much like the real placement of the rings as possible. Put the wire through the hole and close the end to anchor it. Then form a circle around each ringed planet with the wire long enough to stretch the entire diameter. The wire will support itself and will simply need to be bent around each planet.









If you do not have wire, you can use construction paper. Cut the construction paper 2 to 3 inches wide and long enough to make it around the entire balloon. Glue the construction paper ring around each planet. , If you want to hang your planets using fishing line or other string to give the allusion of a floating solar system, you'll need a place to tie the string. The easiest way to do this is to gently poke a hole in the hardened paper (being careful to not pop the balloon) and put a curved paper clip through the hole where string can be tied.








, One simple way to display your project is to use the paper clips you placed in earlier, tie fishing string and hang from something like a paneled ceiling, putting the planets in order so they realistically portray the solar system. You can also tie each planet to something simple like coat hangers that can be hung around the room, or make a wooden dowel that planets can be hung from.


The sun should be the first balloon, followed by each planet in order. The string should hang the planets low enough that they are visible to each child and readily able to be interacted with. Since it will be difficult to replicate the exact scale of each planet's distance from the sun, you should make them far enough apart to be clearly distinguished from one another. A good distance to shoot for would be 2 to 3 feet apart if you have plenty of space, otherwise use your space the best way you see fit.

, Point out the difference in sizes, colors, and so on. This is a great way to convey facts and to help children begin a journey of understanding our solar system better. "

Print onto vellum paper.,
Make a vellum tag to cover writing or photos.,
Make border strips with your vellum.,
Tear vellum for a rough-edge layer effect.,
Use stencils atop your vellum.,
Buy commercially produced vellum envelopes.,
Cut out a piece of vellum and use it to journal.,
Tear long strips of vellum.,
Feed strips of vellum paper into a paper crimper.,
Create a photo frame with vellum.",How to Use Vellum on a Scrapbook Page2," Since vellum is a cloudy, translucent surface, it works great for creating classic looking titles and quotes in almost any color. Insert 8.5 by 11 inch vellum paper sheets into your printer as you would normal paper.


Open up a word processing program and type in titles or quotes. If you plan to cut the titles into smaller rectangles before affixing them to your scrapbook page, you can print many titles on the same page of vellum. Once your document with text is completed, print it out on a normal printer. Leave the sheet for at least 5 minutes before removing it from your printer tray, because vellum takes much longer to dry ink than normal paper. Cut the titles and affix them to each page.
Open a photo editing program. Choose a photo that you want to appear as an accent or shadow on your page. Print the photo out on a piece of vellum paper in the size you desire. Cut it into a smaller size and layer it onto your page with adhesive glue.

, Once you have a photo or small card you want to use, cut a piece of vellum in the same size. Place it over the image/card on your scrapbook page and connect the vellum, photo and page with metal brads or ribbon on 1 end.


You may need to use a small paper punch to make an even hole through each layer. The translucent vellum will serve as a cover that the viewer can lift to view the image more clearly.

, Use small decorative paper punches, such as hearts or stars, in an even pattern across a long narrow strip of vellum. Layer it around your photos or entire page for an artful effect, since decorative paper or photos will show through the punched area.


Save the small cut out vellum shapes for use on another page or as a confetti.

, Lay down decorative paper, then affix torn vellum to the page. Layer photographs and titles on top to create artful texture on your page.

, Place a stencil on top of a vellum sheet and draw the shape with a vellum pen. Cut out the image inside and layer above decorative paper or photographs.


You do not need to cut out the stenciled image. If you attach the vellum with brads or ribbon, you can use it as a cover and lift up from the side or bottom to view an image or page.

, Because of vellum's delicacy, it is much easier to buy vellum envelopes for scrapbook use than to try to make the envelopes yourself. Glue the vellum envelopes onto a page to store recipe cards, photos and memorabilia.

, Journaling in scrapbooks allows you to place your own thoughts and handwriting on the page. Use a vellum pen and practice on a sheet of scrap paper before writing your final draft.

, Go over the edges with a colored vellum pen. This detail will create a distinctive border pattern, which you can use to brighten and focus your page.

, Do this slowly so that it does not tear. Smooth it out slightly and glue it on the page for a textured look.

, Decide upon a smaller part of an image that you want to show and cut a square in your piece of vellum. Glue that directly on the photo to camouflage a portion of the picture and highlight a smaller section of the image.

Add decorative elements with die cut paper.,
Soften and accentuate your album with vellum.,
Create embellishments with chipboard.",How to Select the Proper Scrapbook Paper2," Die-cut paper is similar in purpose to a sticker. It is a pre-cut and pre-printed design sold in a variety of interesting shapes—from footballs and softballs to doilies and tea cups. Scrapbookers incorporate die-cut paper into their albums as large decorative elements and accents.


Select die-cut paper that aligns with the theme of your album and helps move your narrative forward.If you are interested in making your own die-cuts, you may purchase a machine or a home-kit. Die-cut machines are relatively inexpensive and they allow you to create custom embellishments for your album., Vellum paper is translucent. This thin, yet durable, product is sold in an assortment of colors, patterns, and textures. It is ideal for layering over other elements, such as pictures, text, and bold colors.


In addition to layering it over other items, you can stamp, emboss, and print on vellum paper.
Select colors, patterns, and textures that make sense with the theme and palette of your album., The rigidity and thickness of chipboard makes it an ideal medium for dimensional embellishments. You can purchase pre-cut chipboard designs or cut your own embellishments out of sheets of chipboard. This product is available in a variety of colors and thicknesses.


The thickness of chipboard is measured in points. The thicknesses include: “Light” (20 pt., approximately the thickness of a cereal box); “Xl” (32 pt, approximately the thickness of a credit card); “Extra Heavy” (50-52 pt, approximately the thickness of a penny); and “2X” (85 pt, approximately the thickness of 2 dimes).
You can purchase adhesive chipboard.
You can paint, ink, and distress chipboard to customize the product."

Create a shopping list.,
Limit your purchases initially and slowly build your collection.,
Consider the size of the album.",How to Select the Proper Scrapbook Paper3," The amount of scrapbook related products available to consumers is incredible. If you aren’t extremely careful and disciplined, it is easy to over purchase paper, embellishments, and tools. Make a list of all of the types, colors, patterns, and textures of paper you need for your current project. As you browse the aisles or online pages, do your best to only purchase items on your list.


Making a list can help you stay on budget.
Don’t forget to check your home supply of paper before you shop., There is not a hard and fast rule about how much paper you will need for one scrapbook album. The amount of paper required for a project is dependent upon the page count and the amount of embellishments you intend to add to your album. Purchase paper conservatively—you can always return to the store to buy more items if needed. Save the paper that is left over after you've completed a project. Overtime, you will build up a collection of supplies.Before purchasing your supplies, read the stores return policy. Determine if you can get a refund for unused merchandise and how many days you have to return the item(s).

, When you purchase paper, use the dimensions of your album as a guide. You will need several pages of cardstock, patterned paper, and/or transparency paper to use as background pages. If possible, you should purchase these background pages in the same dimensions as your album.


Scrapbooking albums come in two standard sizes: 12 x 12 inches and 8 ½ x 11 inches. Smaller albums are available in the following dimensions: 8 x 8 inches, 6 x 6 inches, and 5 x 7 inches.
Scrapbooking paper is generally sold in two standard sizes: 8 ½ x 11 inches and 12 x 12 inches. If you are making a smaller album, you can cut these papers down to size and use the scraps for embellishments."
"
Pick a scrapbook style.,
Decide on a size.,
Pick your paper.,
Cover the basics.,
Fill your decorating toolbox.",How to Make Your Own Scrapbook1," Albums come in a few different forms, so you want to think about what will work for you in terms on where you'll store your album and how you want the interior to flow.



Three-ring style. You can use a regular three-ring photo album as a scrapbook. They easily hold 8.5”x11” pages/paper, which are inexpensive, and they also stand up nicely on a bookshelf so they're easy to store. You can add pages to a three-ring binder anytime and in any place within the album. You can slip your pages easily into standard-size, acid-free photo-safe protective sheets to prevent wear and tear. The biggest downside is that there will be a gap in your two-page layouts where the rings are, so the look won't be seamless.

Post-bound style. Post-bound scrapbooks are held together by small metal posts that you screw and unscrew in order to add new pages to your album. Just like a three-ring style, you can add pages anywhere within the album; it just takes a little more effort to unscrew and screw again the posts to do so. That being said, this styles does offer an almost seamless two-page spread because when the album is open, the pages lay closer to each other. You can easily insert (top-load) your finished pages into the album's protective sheets.

Bound with non-removable pages style. You can buy a scrapbook album with a fixed number of pages -- meaning you cannot add or remove pages from this type of album. That means you have to plan and execute your pages well since you can't simply pull out a page if you make a mistake. These albums don't come with sheet protectors, which can be good or bad. It's an advantage if you like to use bulkier embellishments or want to glue envelopes to the page and fill them with photos. Of course the downside is that without the sheet protectors, you sacrifice some level of protection and must be sure to treat your pages with care.;
, There are two standard sizes for scrapbooks: 8.5""x11"" and 12”x12” as well as a number of specialty sizes. The style of album you want may dictate what size you choose.



8.5""x11"". 8.5”x11” albums are the most economical choice. The background papers are less expensive than 12""x12"" because they're smaller. You can also save money by buying your photo-safe sheet protectors from office supply stores since they're a standard size. Finally, you can use an inexpensive three-ring photo album to hold your 8.5”x11” pages or purchase a three-ring notebook from the discount office supply store to serve as an album.

12'x12"". This size album has become increasingly popular, and as a result, there are more decorative background papers in this size than in the 8.5”x11”. Another advantage of the 12""x12"": you can also fit more photos on a page.

Specialty sizes. You can find scrapbooks in a whole range of sizes from pocket-sized to those that look like oversize coffee-table books. These styles are typically bound with non-removable pages. They can be good choices if you want to devote an album to a single event such as the birth of a baby or a family reunion celebration.

, This is one of the most fun and potentially most overwhelming steps in your scrapbook-making process. There are hundreds and hundreds of papers to choose from. There are papers with holiday themes, sports themes, hobby themes, floral patterns, geometric patterns--the list goes on and on. Make your choices based on what appeals to you or what you have in mind as the themes for some of your page layouts.


You can buy your scrapbook paper in packs or by the sheet.
You don't have to purchase your paper from a craft or art supply store. If you see something you like anywhere, pick it up. Just be sure the paper is marked ""archival quality"" or ""acid free"" because the acids in many types of paper can damage photos and other mementos over time.
Buy a bit more than you need -- especially of a particular design you like so that you'll have a back-up in case you ruin a page.
You might want to think in terms of multiples so that you have at least two of the same design. Some people prefer to use two sheets of the same paper when they create the spreads in their albums. Or pick up the same design paper in two different complimentary colors. For example, the same snowflake pattern in red and in green.

, Technically, a scrapbook can take on any form you can envision. Will yours be made from newspaper and macaroni? Regardless of what you see in your scrapbooking future, there are a few basic things you need: scissors, glue, and cardstock.



Scissors. Plan to spend between $5 to $15 on a pair of good quality, sharp, straight-edge scissors. You'll be using your scissors a lot, so it makes sense to put a little bit of money into this important tool.

You can invest in a paper trimmer or paper cutter if you prefer. Depending on size and quality, they could run from $10 to $70.
There are tons of decorative-edge scissors you can buy to add some interest to the edges of your paper or photos when you cut them. They can be a lot of fun, but they are a nice-to-have rather than a must-have item.



Adhesive. There are a variety of ways to stick your images and embellishments to the page, but you're likely to need nothing more than a good glue stick. It's easy to use and comes in an acid-free, photo-safe formula.

If you want to be able to remove photos from your scrapbook pages, purchase photo corners. You insert the corners of your photograph into the paper corners and glue them to the page. Then you can remove the picture by gently pulling its edges out from inside the corners, which stay in place on the page.



Cardstock. Pick up a pack of multi-colored 8.5""x11"" Cardstock. You can use it to mat your photos, create tags and blocks where you can write text to add to your pages.

If you're using an 8.5""x11"" scrapbook album, you can use the Cardstock as solid background pages for your album.



, You'll probably want a few other basic supplies to get started scrapbooking. Scrapbooking can become an expensive hobby--there are lots and lots of supplies out there, and you can have a ton of fun adding to your collection. But the truth is, you only need a few basic items to make a truly beautiful scrapbook.



Plastic stencils. Get one plastic stencil with multiple, standard shapes (circles, ovals, squares, rectangles, diamonds, etc.). Use this to ""crop"" your photos and create shapes out of Cardstock for adding titles and creating text boxes on your pages.

Markers. You need at least one good black marker for journaling and titling your pages. If you can, pick up a few different colors (stay away from hard-to-read shades like yellow or light pink) in a couple of different tip thicknesses.

Embellishments. You could spend a small fortune on embellishments. Charms, decorative tags, die-cuts, jewels, studs--they're all out there and then some. You absolutely do not need store-bought embellishments to make a beautiful and creative scrapbook. Browse through the selection at your local craft store, but don't feel as though your pages won't be complete without them.

Look around your house for items you can use to embellish a page. Pictures cut out from greeting cards, old costume jewelry pieces and pieces of ribbon are all things you may have lying around that you could incorporate into your page designs.

Choose your photographs.,
Choose colors of cardstock that match your scrapbook's colors and theme.,
Buy some decorative papers for decorative mats.,
Buy a tube of acid-free adhesive.,
Acquire a paper trimmer if you don't have 1 already.",How to Mat a Photo for a Scrapbook Page1," You can use photos of any size and shape in a scrapbook. The most common sizes are 5 by 7 inches (12.7 by 17.8 cm) and 4 by 6 inches (10.2 by 15.2 cm).;
, A lot of cardstock comes in a variety of colors of 12 by 12 inch (30.5 by 30.5 cm) sheets, which is an optimal size for cutting mats for 5 by 7 inch (12.7 by 17.8 cm) photos.

, You will want to wait to use these papers until you have mastered matting with cardstock; however maps, patterns and scroll work designs create a beautiful accent to scrapbook themes.

, Choose a roller or sponge option, if possible, for easy application. These are available online and at scrapbooking and craft stores.

, This precision tool allows you to both measure and cut cardstock and other papers.

Decide on a theme or message.,
Play around with layout.,
Think in terms of spreads.,
Crop your photos.,
Follow your layout.,
Add text.,
Add embellishments.",How to Make Your Own Scrapbook2," You probably have a big stash of photos and other materials that you want to organize in your scrapbook. Now's the time get them out and make some decisions about how you want to proceed.


Let your materials dictate your direction. Go through your photos, cards, ribbons, awards, newspaper clippings and other materials and group related things together based on their relevance to an occasion or event (graduation, summer vacation, Christmas, etc.) Choose the background paper that works best with each layout idea.
Decide on a color and theme ahead of time. Maybe you had a wedding with a black and white theme or your sister just gave birth to a baby girl. Pull background papers from your collection in the color(s) and styles that work with that theme and go through your materials and gather together all the photos and other memorabilia that you'll use on those pages.

, Before you jump in and start gluing things to paper, you want to have an idea in mind for your page layout. Some people plan everything down to the last detail before they begin attaching things to the page; other people develop a general idea that includes the basics and then allow the details of the layout to develop on their own.


Get a plain piece of paper the same size as your page. Use a pencil to sketch out a plan of how you want your layout to look. Pencil in the places where you'll put your photos, title, text and other pictures.
You can simply rough in your photo placements and take it from there or go in a more detailed direction and plan everything including the placement of all embellishments or other decorative bits. Experiment a little and work in a way that feels creative and comfortable for you.

, A spread is made up of two side-by-side pages in your album. Instead of treating each page as stand-alone, consider what the pages will look like when the album is open and when they're displayed next to one another. Consider creating your rough layouts two at a time so you can plan your spreads.


When you take a spread into account, it's easier to avoid creating pages that clash or compete with one another for attention.
While you don't have to go as far as to use the same background paper for every spread, at least choose papers that coordinate either in color or design.

, Once you've decided where your photos will go on the page, you may have to size them down in order to make them fit. Use your scissors, paper trimmer or plastic template to create the size and shape you want for you photographs.


If you're concerned about ruining an important photo, make a copy of it and use that in your album. Or take a picture of your picture and use the duplicate image.

, Once your have your photos cropped, lay everything in place as per your rough layout. Something that initially looked good on paper, may not completely appeal to you once you see it in place on the page, so be willing to move things around a bit if you feel as though you need to. Be sure you're 100% happy before you glue anything in place.

, You might want to add a title, captions or a short block of text that sums up your memories in a catchy way. You may have already planned for these in your sample layout, or you chose to wait and see where you'd like to put text after you had your photos in place.


Don't write too much. Your photos and other images/materials will likely tell the story of your page, so limit your text to one or two sentences that sum up something interesting you want to remember about the event/experience.
Consider including the date somewhere on your page. You may find it difficult to believe that you'll ever forget when something took place, but life gets busy and experiences accumulate, and you may find yourself puzzling to come up with a date. Besides, scrapbooks can be passed down through the generations, and those who enjoy them in the years to come will appreciate pages that are dated.

, Embellishments can add interest, support your theme, guide the eye and create unity among pages with a common theme. Ultimately, if you decide to embellish your layouts, you should do it in a way that you find visually pleasing and meaningful. There are a few ideas for using embellishments to give them added impact.


Group them. In the same way that collections are best displayed in groups, so are embellishments. Consider clustering decorative elements together on the page for added emphasis.

Depending on the number of embellishments you're using, you can create a couple of groups on the page. When you do, consider following the rule of three--the eye likes things grouped in threes or at least in uneven numbers.


Put them in the corners. Put embellishments in the corners of photos or text blocks to help anchor them to the page. They'll give the images or text a bit more ""weight"" and ground them in place.

You can also put embellishments in the corners of your pages. If you have several pages that are a part of the same theme, using the same decorative elements in the corners of each of those pages helps to unify them.


Stack or layer them. Glue two or three decorative elements on top of one another. Keep in mind that this will add thickness to your page, so choose your items with care. If you're using a bound album with no removable pages, you won't have plastic protective page covers to contend with, so you could allow for a little more bulk.

Take a class.,
Network.,
Attend a scrapbook convention.,
Turn pro.,
Make scrapbooks for others.",How to Make Your Own Scrapbook3," Scrapbooking classes are often held in craft stores, at rec centers and by scrapbooking ""coaches."" You can also purchase idea books and DVDs. If you have some extra time and money to invest, you can also participate in weekend workshops, camp sessions or retreats.

, One of the best ways to grow as a scrapbook artist is to learn from and share ideas with other scrapbook lovers. Visit scrapbooking blogs, social network pages devoted to the craft, Pinterest boards or join organizations such as the Scrapbooking and Paper Crafting Society.


If you take a class or simply spend some time hanging out in the paper aisle of your local craft or art supply store, you're likely to run into other scrapbook hobbyists. See if they're part of a club you can join or consider starting your own scrapbook club.


, There are several scrapbook conventions that are held annually and offer attendees workshops, lectures and vendors displaying the latest supplies. Look into the Creating Keepsakes (CK) Scrapbook Conventions, Scrapbook Expo and Great American Scrapbook Conventions.

, If you enjoy scrapbooking and want to share your skills with others, think about stepping up and offering your services as an scrapbooking professional.


Become a teacher. Teaching someone how to make a scrapbook means you're not only good at what you do but are able to explain and demonstrate scrapbooking tools, approaches and designs. You'll also need patience in working with beginners and a positive and encouraging demeanor. Finally, you'll have to keep up with all the latest trends and materials so that you can share those with your students.

Check with your local craft or art supply store to see if they have a need for a scrapbook instructor. Otherwise, consider securing your own space and offering a one-day or weekend workshop. Advertise online and in local establishments.



, Not everyone has the patience, creativity and skill to make a scrapbook, and they're willing to pay someone who can in order to preserve their memories. Advertise your services online or set up a booth at a local street fair or craft fair. Bring the very best examples of your work along with plenty of business cards.


You can create a website your your business. Post photos of your best scrapbook layouts or create digital pages so potential clients can see examples of your work.
Work as a scrapbook writer. If you're good with words, consider becoming a freelance writer. Websites devoted to scrapbooking need writers to contribute content, or you could write and sell your own ebook. There are a number of specialty magazines devoted to scrapbooking, so you may also be able to sell your articles to magazines or journals.

To come up with article ideas, go to scrapbooking discussion board to see what kinds of questions people have and what the hot topics are. Attend conventions and talk to product reps to see if there is a need in their company for someone to write product-related articles.


Become an event planner. If you have strong organizational skills and a keen sense of what scrapbookers want to know and see, you may be able to find a position coordinating a scrapbooking expo or retreat. You could offer your services as an independent contractor or try to secure a job with a company that plans these kinds of events.

, This is a fairly standard matting size.


Add 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) to the height and width measurements of your photo. You will cut your cardstock into this mat size. Once you center the photo on this cardstock, it will create a border of 1/8 inch (0.3 cm) on all sides.
Take a piece of cardstock. Beginning in a corner, measure the width of the mat size with a ruler. Mark it with a pencil in several places next to the ruler line for easy cutting.
Measure the length of the mat size and mark it in several places with a pencil.
Place the cardstock inside the paper trimmer with the excess paper going underneath the blade. Carefully align the pencil lines along the center of the trimmer, where the blade rests. Hold the paper and swipe the blade down for an even cut. Turn the paper and repeat this cut along the opposite pencil lines.

, Apply roll-on adhesive to the back of your photograph in sporadic lines all around the border and interior.


Center the photo above your mat. Press the photo lightly onto the map. Make any adjustments to ensure an even border.
Smooth the top of the photo with pressure. Use a soft cloth over your hand to avoid getting finger prints on the photo. Ensure it is properly affixed and allow it to dry. It is ready to be glued onto your scrapbook page.

, Remember to double the border amount and add it to the photo dimension measurements before cutting your cardstock. Choose the size of photo mat based on your preference.

, These photo mats will be 5 by 7 inches (12.7 by 17.8 cm), making great 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) mat borders for 4 by 6 inch (10.2 by 15.2 cm) photographs. Take a single sheet of cardstock and lay it on your flat work table.

, Mark the line measurement with a pencil. Measure 5 inches (12.7 cm) down from the top of the sheet.


Measure 7 inches down from the top right corner of the sheet. Draw the line measurement with a pencil. Your width measurement should be 5 inches from the first set of lines you drew.
Flip the sheet around so that the bottom is on the top. Repeat the above measurements. When you finish, you should have 4.5 by 7 inch (12.7 by 17.8 cm) photo mats.
Cut out the rectangles with a pair of sharp paper scissors.

Begin to double mat your photos.,
Create a triple photo mat.,
Replace your cardstock mats with decorative mats.,
Create a Polaroid photo mat.,
Create an embellished mat.",How to Mat a Photo for a Scrapbook Page3," Create your first mat in a light color, such as white, that will highlight your photo. Choose a smaller size, such as a 1/4 or 1/8 inch (0.6 or 0.3 cm) border.


Make a larger photo mat in a complimentary, but darker, color. Make it 1/4 to 2 inches larger than your first photo mat. You will need to double the border measurement and add it to your last mat's dimensions before cutting the new mat.

, With this technique, you will want a small bordered mat, a larger bordered mat and a smaller bordered mat on the outside again.


Measure and cut 3 mats. The first mat should be 1/8 inch (0.3 cm) larger than the photo on all sides. The second mat should be a 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) larger on all sides than the first mat in a different color. The last mat should be 1/8 inch (0.3 cm) larger than the second mat on all sides in the same color as the first mat.
Glue the mats together and then affix the photo. This mat may need extra time to dry. There are many variations in sizes and shapes for this mat.

, Use the same process to create mats with decorative paper; however, you will need to be more careful when working with decorative paper so that it does not rip.


Alternate using cardstock and decorative paper matting for a beautiful decorative effect. Use less glue on decorative papers so that they do not warp.

, Cut your photo to be 3 inches wide and 3.125 inches high (7.6 by 7.9 cm). This is the standard size of a Polaroid print.


Cut a white mat to be 3.5 inches wide and 4.25 inches (8.9 by 10.8 cm) high. Center your photo so that it is 1/4 inches (0.6 cm) from the top.
Write a memo about the photo on the bottom white portion, just as you would with a Polaroid photo.

, When you measure and cut your mat, make the border measurement several inches wider than it is tall.


When you center your photo on the mat, make sure it is even on either side of the photo. Use this space to draw, add stickers or add jewels.

Get creative.",How to Scrapbook," Speaking simply, a theme is the underlying purpose or idea holding your scrapbook together. If you've decided to make a scrapbook, you may already have a theme in mind. If you do not have a theme, though, you should start by picking one.


A theme will determine the photographs you choose, as well as the album and embellishments.
Possible themes include:

Family vacations
High school or college accomplishments
Family reunions
Family holidays
Times spent with friends
Military career

;
, With your theme in mind, sort through any photo collections that may contain photos fitting with that theme. Begin with your most recent photos and work your way backward through time.


Look for photographs that are clear and avoid any that seem blurry.
Note that you do not need to use an entire photograph. In all likelihood, a portion of your photos will be cropped. As a result, if you find a photo with a background element you do not want, you can still use it for your scrapbook if that element can be cleanly cut off.
Choose as many photos as you like during this stage. If you have too many, you can narrow your selection down later.

, Sort through the photos you pulled and arrange them into categories. Each category should then be broken down into pages, and each page should have roughly four to six photographs assigned to it.Note that if you plan on making a smaller scrapbook, you may only need two or three photos per page.
You can create multiple pages for each category, if desired. For example, if you are making a scrapbook of a specific family vacation, your categories may include something along the lines of: trip there, beach, hotel, museums, return trip. If you have a lot of beach pictures, you can have multiple pages for those pictures. The idea is merely to group similar photos together within the scrapbook overall.

, You do not need to plan out each page ahead of time, but at minimum, you need to determine how many pages you want, how many photos you want to have per page, what colors and embellishments you might want to consider using, and how many journal entries you plan to include.


Keep a notebook filled with possible layout ideas. Write possibilities down as you brainstorm, then eliminate the ones that you don't like and choose your favorite after sorting through the notebook.
This is also a good time to determine if you want to make separate title pages to separate your categories or if you want to place titles directly on photo pages.
If you want to be even more thorough, you can also tentatively arrange photos on your working surface to get a general idea of how each page may look.

, Scrapbook albums can usually be found at craft stores and most stores that sell stationery. Standard albums are square with 12-inch by 12-inch (30.5-cm by 30.5-cm) pages.


You can also find pocket albums with 6-inch by 8-inch (15.25-cm by 20.3-cm) pages.
In a pinch, you could also use a standard 3-ring binder for your scrapbook, but an actual album is preferable since the binding and pages are better suited for scrapbooking.
Consider your theme when choosing your scrapbook. For example, if your scrapbook will contain photos from a beach vacation, a light blue or sand-colored album might be a good idea. On the other hand, for a scrapbook featuring photos of your friends, you might want to consider a more playful color.
Also note that you may be able to find albums with titled covers for some major events, like weddings and military enlistments.

, When you look for paper to include in your scrapbook, take along a few of your photos and compare them to your options. Plain colored paper should coordinate with the colors in your photos, and patterned paper should coordinate with both the colors and theme of your scrapbook.


You will usually need two sheets of background paper and one to two types of matting and deco paper per page.

, Your embellishments should coordinate with the theme of your scrapbook.


Standard embellishments include 3D embellishment stickers, rubber stamps, and charms, but you can get as creative as you want. Choose embellishments that add visual interest but are relatively flat. Otherwise, your scrapbook may not close well.
Stickers and stamps are among the easiest embellishments to match to your theme since there are so many varieties available.
Consider the color of your paper and pictures when choosing embellishments. Try to choose items that work with your current color scheme.

, There are a variety of adhesives suitable for scrapbooking, but each has its pros and cons.Spray adhesives are good for covering large areas without making the surface seem ""wet."" It is also good for use with sheer material. Let the adhesive dry after application until it feels tacky before sticking two items together.
Foam tape and dots are sticky on both sides an can be trimmed to size. These adhesives also add dimension to the objects they adhere to, making scrapbook pages more visually varied.
Pressure-sensitive dots are ideal for heavy embellishments because they have tremendous bond strength.
Glue sticks are, perhaps, the most convenient to use. Make sure that you use a minimal amount and choose a glue stick labeled ""acid free"" or ""safe for photos.""
Liquid glues work well for embellishments and are easy to apply, but they can make pictures and other paper embellishments wrinkle if too much is used.
Double-stick tape has minimal bond strength but are suitable for pictures, paper embellishments, and small, light items.

, Once you have your supplies in hand, you need to arrange them in a way that makes it easy for you to access each item when you need it.


Keep all your photos in one spot and organized in the order you will use them in.
Set aside embellishments in the furthest corner of your work area until you are ready to use them.

, Place one scrapbook page in front of you and arrange your background paper on top of it. You will usually use a couple of sheets to add dimension to your page, but occasionally, you might get away with using one sheet.


Avoid using more than three sheets of background paper. Adding too many may make the background too busy and distracting.
When arranging the background sheets, there should be some overlap between them, and the should rarely be evenly aligned with one another.
Once your background pages are in place, position any paper borders over them, arranging them to your liking.
At this stage you should not glue the paper down.

, Determine a photograph's focal point and determine how much of the background is necessary. As long as the focal point and essential details remain, you do not need to worry about cropping too much.


Consider the best size and shape for each photo based on the layout of each page.
As a general rule, it is wise to have doubles of your photographs, just in case you make a mistake.

, Choose a type of paper that varies from your background. Cut a section of paper that is just a bit larger than your newly cropped photo and place the photo on top.


Do not glue anything down yet.
Consider leaving extra matting paper below the photo or to the side so that you can write a caption for the photo later on.

, Arrange your matting and photos on the background paper already on your scrapbook page. Position the elements so that others you have yet to add, like journal blocks or embellishments, can still fit.


Usually, elements of a page should touch or overlap with other elements. Avoid having pieces of the page look as though they are “floating” or separated from the others.

, Use a little of your chosen adhesive to secure everything onto the page.


Work from top to bottom. Glue the photos to the matting and, once that dries, glue the matting to the background paper. After that dries, glue the background paper to the page itself.
You should wait for the page to dry before adding any writing or embellishments.

, Consider what these memories mean to you and what you want others to understand by looking through them.


Brainstorm ideas in a separate notebook before deciding on anything.
Write a draft of each caption or journal block before writing it into your scrapbook.

, If you left room for captions next to each photo, use a no-bleed pen or extra fine tip permanent maker to write a descriptive yet brief caption that identifies the photo.


Captions can include information about dates, locations, and people in the photo.

, These entries are not specifically related to a photo but make a general statement about the overall category those photos fall into.


Consider using stories, personal quotes, anecdotes, or fitting lyrics and famous quotations in your journal entries.

, Most words in a scrapbook are handwritten, but some prefer to type, print, and paste blocks of text, instead.


Handwritten words can be sloppier and you may make a mistake as you write them, but they have a more personal and meaningful effect.
Printed text is cleaner but may seem cold and impersonal.

, Embellishments should touch or overlap other elements of the page, like pictures and matting, without covering important details.


Avoid placing embellishments in an area that is separated or distant from other page elements. Typically, no element on the page should appear to “float” in space.

, You can use just about any type of sticker, but ones with acid-free adhesives are best. Scrapbooking stickers, also called 3D embellishment stickers, are especially fitting since they add a little bit of dimension to an otherwise flat page.


Your stickers should match the theme of your scrapbook or category. For instance, shell stickers work well for beach vacations, stickers of footballs or baseballs work well for documenting an athletic activity, and heart or rose stickers work well for romantic themes.

, Stamps can be personalized almost as easily as stickers. Choose rubber stamps that match your theme and color inks that coordinate with those already on your page.


Test the stamp on a separate sheet of paper before stamping it onto your scrapbook page.When stamping the page, make sure that the image is evenly covered with ink and stamp it on a hard, even surface. Hold the stamp securely on the sides and do not rock it back and forth.
Allow the image to dry before touching it. Otherwise, you may smear the ink.

, You can cut your own simple shapes and designs out of decorative paper that coordinates with the color scheme of each page.


In addition to deco paper, you could also use colored cardstock.
You can hand-draw and hand-cut your shapes if you trust the steadiness of your hand.
Alternatively, you can use a die cutter or paper punch that has an interesting shape.

, If you did not leave room for a caption beside your photos, you can still add basic identification information by attaching stationery tags to the corner of a photo.


Paper stationery tags can be written on with a smear-proof pen or marker.
Attach the tag to the corner of the photo by using a small amount of adhesive on the tip of the attached ribbon or string. Let the tag itself hang loose.

, You can use nearly any relatively flat object for a scrapbook embellishment. Make sure that the item does not contain anything that could be potentially harmful to your photos, though.


Good non-traditional ideas include pressed flowers, buttons, ribbon bows, locks of hair, magazine cut-outs, and headlines from current newspapers.
Be cautious when using metal embellishments. Never attach the metal directly to the photo since it can cause damage to the photograph over time."

Continue making as many flower embellishments as desired.",How to Make Flower Embellishments for Scrapbooking (Using Artificial Flowers)," They can be ones you already have handy, or you might need to purchase them from a craft store. Ideally, they need to be:


The right size for your scrapping project
A suitable color for your scrapping theme
A quality flower (silk or paper—not plastic)

, You can keep the stems to use in other projects if wished. Flatten the flowers a little if needed.

, You can use the flowers as they are, or you can jazz them up a little (as seen in the video). Examples for improving the flowers include:


Painting with metallic marker in color of choice (could be the same color or a contrasting color)
Rolling on sticking glitter
Painting small patterns (e.g. polka dots, love hearts, etc.)
Adding other elements such as lace or ribbon, etc.

,, Make the cardstock into card size for the background piece, and ensure that it opens up neatly as a card should.


Cut a half piece of differently colored cardstock to stick onto the lower half of the card.
Measure this piece to fit across the larger card.;
, Match the circle size to make it slightly larger than the flower size but not by much.


Take the two circles that have been punched out and set aside a flower for each circle.

, These will sit behind the smaller circle.

, In this example, the other dimensional is a circle with ""Happy Birthday"" written inside it.

, Use tweezer tips, a needle, or a similar sharp ended point to create the hole.

, This fastener will hold the three pieces in place and its circular part creates the raised heart of the flower.

, On the outer larger circle, add a circle of dots with a marker.


This creates an additional finishing touch to help the flower stand out.

, Arrange the flowers on the card (or scrapping project) as wished. In this example, a birthday card is used. Two flower circles are added to each end, with a Happy Birthday circle placed in the center. Adhere using either small scrapping stickies, tape, or craft glue.

, The example shows a dotted edging being made using a marker.


The project shown here includes the addition of ribbon to finish off the card.
The ribbon is tied into a neat bow.

, They make good gifts for scrapping friends and are also ideal to sell in small packets online or on craft stalls.

Get a pair of scissors.,
Purchase a paper trimmer.,
Buy a self-healing cutting mat.,
Choose a cutting blade or craft knife.,
Grab a paper piercer.,
Select quality markers.,
Select quality scrapping paints.,
Buy a solid ruler.,
Get suitable adhesives.,
Buy some suitable starter scrapbooks.,
Look for a local scrapbook store.",How to Put Together a Scrapping Tool Kit," Although this seems simple, it isn't a case of grabbing the pair already lying about the house; the scissors must be reserved only for your hobby to avoid blunting them. Choose scissors that are sharp and have a fine-tip. There are special versions for scrapping but provided your scissors are good quality, you will be fine with non-specialised ones. Mark them with a label ""scrapping"" so that you don't accidentally use them on anything else. You will want 2 pairs. A large pair of scissors for general cutting paper, cardstock, and chipboard. Then you will need a small fine point pair for trimming small items and cutting ribbons.;
, A paper trimmer is an essential part of the scrapbook artist's repertoire. You will this time and again to cut mats, backgrounds, strips and other paper embellishments in a quick, straight and easy manner. You might like to consider purchasing a small trimmer to begin with and upgrade to a larger one as you advance in scrapping. The larger trimmers clearly offer more in the way of versatility but they also cost more.


, This is a very important part of your craft, to ensure that table-tops are preserved and to prevent slips. The cutting mat also protects the blade of any cutting tool used from blunting. Another choice is a glass mat. The hard surface of the glass makes it easier to cut fine exact shapes without catching the tip of your craft blade in the softer mat.


, You have the mat, now you need the cutting implement. Cutting blades are best in the form of a knife kit that comes with varying blade types that can be changed easily and sit atop an easy-to-hold handle. If your craft store does not have this, most art stores will have one. Given the labour that your knife will be subjected to, it pays to buy a good quality cutting tool from the outset. Look for one of the newer ergonomic handled blades. They are worth the little extra.

, These are useful for setting brads on a project. The paper piercer can pierce a hole precisely where you wish to place the brad. You can also use the piercer to thread yarn, cotton or silk thread, metallic threads and even to sew through.

, When you write by hand on your project, you need to use quality markers (or writers) that will not bleed, seep through or spoil the pages in any way. The markings that you make should also last down the decades and not fade away. So, look for acid-free, durable, fast-drying acrylic tip markers. Ask your local scrapping supplier for recommendations on quality markers.

, Specialised scrapping paints enable you unleash your creativity in many ways and colours. At first, buy a few basic favourite colours that you can build on later. Get a supply of different brush sizes, sponges, and stamps to apply the paint with.

, A metallic ruler is a solid investment for a scrapper. The metal cannot be cut as you are using a cutting implement and the ruler gives a very straight edge as a guide for drawing or cutting along. A metal ruler is also useful for tearing paper. You can also find some clear acrylic rulers that have a metal edge. The best ones have ""0"" feature. This allows you to find the center of any edge on paper.

, Always get adhesive products that will not deteriorate over time or react poorly with other materials used for scrapping. Adhesives that you will be likely to need include glue (a glue pen is really useful) double-sided tape, foam mounting tape and pop-dots of varying sizes. Look for the special double sided tape runners made just for scrapping. They are made in holders that make it much easier to use for scrapping. These tape runners place only the adhesive on your paper leaving out the tape backing. It is worth it to invest in a good quality tape system.

, You can start with ready-made scrapbooks., but there is nothing like the feeling of creating it yourself! There are now tools that help you create your own covers and bindings from using coils to actually laminating a binding. The options are endless., There you will find a wealth of knowledge about how-to's. The store should be full of supplies and ideas. There will most likely be classes and crops. You should also be able to find an employee or Design Team member who is willing to help you with design issues or just learning what to do. Scrap-bookers love their craft and tend to want to convert others. Take advantage of their helpfulness!!"

Know what topic you want to make the scrapbooks on.,
Obtain scrapbook.,
Have material.,
Take a rough pad/book and figure out what you're going to write.,
Start with your final piece.,
Decorate your scrapbook.,
Cover the scrapbook with plastic.",How to Make Mini Scrapbooks," The best way to figure that out is to think about something that you really like. Scrapbooks are really descriptive and have opinions, which is why it is best for you to make it on something you know a lot about.Here are some questions you could ask yourself:


What do I like to do in my free time?
What takes up most of my time?
What am I passionate about?
What am I really interested in?
What is that one subject that I can call myself a master at?;
, You can either make it on your own, or purchase one. If you do make it on your own, make sure that it portrays you. It's important that you create something you relate to.For example, if you're someone who is bright and bubbly, don't choose a scrapbook with dull coloured pages. You should instead go for a yellow-orange or red-pink theme.

, Scrapbooks are mainly visual, therefore you need to have a lot of images. You can find them online and print them out.

, You can plan out each page by drawing on your rough pad/book. Draw blocks for where your pictures will be and write where you want your written work to be.


It's important that you know everything about your selected topic before you start doing the written work because if you don't know much about it, you won't know how to express your opinions verbally.

, Write first and then paste the photos. If you are using glitter pens, make sure that they don't smudge. You don't want your scrapbook looking messy, do you?If you are using ink pens, which wouldn't normally be advisable, please check that it does not leak.

, Use stickers to decorate it, for instance. If you don't get stickers that relate to your topic, hearts, flowers and stars are the basic types of stickers applicable everywhere.


You can even cover your scrapbook with ribbons or some personal artwork you have made.

, Scrapbooks can be easily damaged if not taken care of, especially when you are showing it to someone else. This is a part of you, so take care of it like you would take care of you."

Head out to the forest, wooded area, neighbors yard or wherever you can find a big stick.,
Take the wood and strip it of the bark.,
Take the wood and cut it into 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) circles.,
Once the circles are cut use the leftover wood and cut a 2 inch (5.1 cm) long piece.,
Set the links aside and pull out the push pins and the foam core board.,
Now take a link and lay it across 2 circles so it is evenly placed between the two.,
Continue the previous step till row 1 has all its inlay set with all it neighbors.,
Once all the inlays are finished and both pages are complete, sand the whole thing down.,
Once it is sanded to your liking, grab that remaining piece of branch and cut a 4 inch (10.2 cm) piece of it.,
Stain it.,
Once it is all dry, lay the pages and spine face up.,
Once it is glued together, make sure it closes evenly and easily.,
Measure the pleather straps and secure them on one side of the book.,
Decorate the pages.,
When it's all finished, put it together.",How to Make an Epic Scrapbook," Look for something about 1.5–2 inches (3.8–5.1 cm) thick and about 5 feet (1.5 m) long. It should be nice and dry, not rotten or moldy. It's okay if it has bark on it, as you will deal with that later. Make sure the wood is as straight as possible; if it is curved, you will have some trouble.;
, Once that is complete, break off any branches and cut them as close to the branch as possible. Basically you want to make the whole piece of wood as smooth as possible.

, Try to make the cuts as even as possible. You will need 40 Pieces total. Once each piece is cut sand the whole thing down. Don't forget to sand the sides. Make sure the whole piece is smooth before moving onto the next one.

, With this piece, cut small strips of wood that are 2""x1/4""x1/8"". You will need 36 per page, totaling to 72 pieces (or links, as we will call them). Try some practice cuts before you get started, and make a few extra in case some break or you mess up. Before you go onto the next step make sure each link is strong by pushing and pulling on it in various ways. You don't want anything to break after you're finished.

, Lay the board down, and about 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the edge mark a straight line going all the way across the board. Do this again on another side of the board so that the lines intersect only once. Use these lines to lay out your circles of wood. It should be 4 circles high and 5 circle wide, totaling to 20 circles per page. Once you have them laid out, move them around to your liking and then use the push pins to secure the outside circles. Then work your way in making sure each circle has at least 3 push pins

, Hold the link down and trace it out. Clam one circle in a vice and use a dremel to eat out the inside of the link tracing. Eat out just a little bit in the top and see if the link fits in the inlay. If it doesn't, expand it till it does, then make the inlay deeper till the link's top is flush with the circle. Check every little bit to ensure you're not going too deep, and make sure the bottom of the inlay is flat. This will create a stronger bond when you glue it later.

, Then glue row one together. Don't use to much glue here: if you do it will seep onto the other side of the circles and dry. If you do spill some out of the inlay, just let it dry. You can pick it off later and sand it down.


Don't glue row 1 and row 2 together yet. Once row one has dried, finish row 2's inlay, and then glue row 2. Only then can you glue rows 1 and 2 together. The reason you work your way up while glueing is that it is much harder to dremel pieces that are already glued than it is to clamp them in a vice and go about it that way.

, Don't use big strokes because you will scratch the wood. Instead, sand each circle down and then each link down so everything is flush. If it is too much to sand, use the dremel to eat out some wood to where it can be sanded.

, Take it and make 4""x1/4""x1/8"" strips. you will need about 40 of them. These pieces will be the spine of the book. Lay a few side by side till it is the correct height. Do this for the next column so that that rows are staggered bit. This will make sure the spine won't break. Use pins to hold the rows together and then glue them together. Replace the pins so they push the pieces together. Don't worry about it sticking to the board, as you will be able to sand it down later. Once it is dry, sand it down till it is smooth.

, This step is optional; if you don't want stain, that won't affect the quality of the book. Stain is used to enhance the color and protect the wood. You can use a clear stain if you wish. Stain one side of each piece, and then let it dry. Flip it over and stain the other side. Stain at least twice to get good protection on the wood.

, Measure out six inches of leather and use the E600 or shoe goo to fasten the leather to the spine and pages. Leave enough room for the book to close comfortably. Use more glue than you think you will need and then press the leather to the wood. If glue seeps out, just wipe it off. If it's a lot of glue that seeps out, rub it off; it should come off fairly easily.

, If it isn't right, remove the leather from the wood and rub the glue with some force to remove it.

, Use small strips on the other page so you can tie the strap off. You can glue one side of the strap and tie the other side for a nice effect, but feel free to do secure it however you want.

, Now that the book is complete, use the pictures, cardstock, and other pretty bits to make the meat of the book. Decorate the pages however you wish, but make sure to include enough pictures and make it look good.

, Then you can give it to that special someone, or keep it for yourself.

, Write about work/school, life, your thoughts and emotions, your friends and enemies. Write lists (of favorites or least favorites, such as food, songs, colors, people, things to do, etc).

",How to Make a Baby Scrapbook,"


Your theme often depends on which pictures you would like to use in the book. Some commonly used baby themes include the birth and hospital stay, the first year, holidays, special vacations and outings.
Some baby scrapbooks do not have specific themes apart from being a scrapbook about a baby. There is nothing wrong with this approach, but you may find that you have so many baby pictures that scrapbooking is easier when you focus on one specific theme per book.;
,


Select a book and choose paper in colors and designs that relate to your theme. You should also pick out stickers, photograph holders, colored pens, stencils, stamps, craft scissors and any other accessories or supplies you would like to use as you create your scrapbook.

,


Many parents include items such as footprint and handprint copies, birth certificate copies, cards, gift tags, hospital bracelets, ultrasound scans, hospital cafeteria menus, newspaper clippings, baptismal certificate copies and plane ticket receipts.

,,


Examples include making paper frames, adding stickers and cutting the edges with decorative crafting scissors.

,


Alternate the locations and angles of the material to keep your book visually interesting. Many scrapbookers like to include items in chronological order to tell the story of specific events in a baby's life.

, You may choose to write small notes to the baby using colorful pens.

Research the person's favorite music.,
Research the person's favorite books and authors.,
Buy decorative paper, tags and stickers from your local scrapbook store.,
Gather condolence cards that were given at the funeral.",How to Make a Memorial Scrapbook1," You may want to choose a scrapbook in the person's favorite color, or in a classic white. Buy scrapbook pages in a neutral color, such as cream.

Scrapbooks commonly come in 6 by 6, 8 by 8, 8.5 by 11 and 12 by 12 sizes. If you are planning a comprehensive book that includes more than pictures, you should choose either 8.5 by 11 or 12 by 12. You can buy a pack of pages that can be inserted into the scrapbook as needed.;
, Ask for contributions from friends and family. Since families often set out pictures during funerals and wakes, you may be able to take these photos and scan them in before or after the service.

It is a good idea to scan all photos that you plan to use into the computer. If you don't have a scanner or computer that can do this, you can ask a friend or get an archival service to do it. Keep the photos on a computer disk and print them anew with a digital printer or at a local photo lab. Then, give the photos back to friends or family so that they can keep them as a part of their photo albums.

, Ask for 100 to 300 words from each person in the form of a letter, note or memory. Give people at least a month to think about this and write from their heart., You can either recopy each person's prose onto your scrapbook pages with a decorative scrapbooking pen. You can also frame each person's note like it is a photo., For example, try to find a wedding announcement, wedding invitation, retirement party invitation, newspaper article that they were featured in, obituary and funeral program., Type up or journal lyrics from their favorite songs., Include quotes from these authors throughout the book., Many stores sell sets of thematic scrapbooking accents, including themes such as mother, father, vacation, wedding and more. These can help to make a scrapbook look professional very quickly., If there were too many to include, make a list of people who gave cards and flowers to be included on a page."

Choose your page titles, for your subsequent pages.,
Convey the person's life in the first half of the book.,

Make a last page with a quote or poem to the person's memory.,
Display your photo album at family gatherings or take it out each year at their birthday.",How to Make a Memorial Scrapbook2," Measure your photo and then add 1⁄4 to 2 inches (0.6 to 5.1 cm) to the measurements for the cardstock, depending upon how large you want your frame to be. Affix the photo to the cardstock with acid-free glue.

You can employ many different matting techniques with both photos and notes. You can do a double or triple mat where the mats are in larger sizes and different colors. You can also alternate cardstock with decorative paper or use white gel pens to draw borders onto the photo mat.

, You may want to also include the dates of their life., Most scrapbooks are divided by themes and titles. The title showcases each theme. You may want to consider titles like Our Father, Working Mom, Growing Up, In Remembrance, Golden Memories, Missing You, Travels Together, and any other 1 to 5 word phrases that describe a time of life or a feeling surrounding that person.

You will need to choose how you want to place your titles at the top of each page or group of pages. Options include writing the titles freehand, typing them out on the computer, using stencils or using alphabet stickers.

, Most memorial books include information and photos of the person's life along with their passing. Use the first half of the book in themed pages about their childhood, education, work life, passions, hobbies, children, husband and/or retirement.

Include memories that people have written during this first half of the book. If there is an especially good or funny memory, use that as the page's focal point. Find photos and memorabilia that accent this memory.

, In this portion, include the journaling that you asked people to do, cards, the obituary and funeral program., After you have gathered information about the person's family, outline the genealogy in an artful way over 2 pages., Draw or doodle on the page to give it added depth., You may want to choose prose or poetry that gives a heartfelt but hopeful wish for the person., Scrapbooks are meant to be enjoyed and added to."

Gather photographs that express your relationship with your dad.,
Separate the photos into themes.,
Decide if you want to do a digital or physical scrapbook.,
Choose your theme.",How to Make a Father's Day Scrapbook1," Choose photos that were taken over the course of many years or recent photos, depending upon what you think your father would like best.


Try to gather many photographs. You do not have to use all of the photographs, but it is better to have more rather than less because you will have many creative options.;
, For example, you can separate them by years, people, sports, vacations and more. Once you have all the photographs arranged into piles, you can decide if you want to concentrate on 1 area or do a scrapbook that includes the whole set.

, If you like to do arts and crafts, then choose the traditional scrapbooking method of finding the elements, gluing them on paper and putting them inside a binder. If you are skilled on the computer, or your dad is very tech savvy, then go with the more modern digital option.


If you want to craft the scrapbook by hand, you may want to go to an arts and crafts or dedicated scrapbooking store. Find a scrapbook with a metal binder, so that you can add pages. Find base pages in the right size. You can plan out your pages 1 by 1.
If you want to do a digital scrapbook, then you will want to ensure that all your photos and memorabilia are scanned into the computer. Use clip art, cutting and pasting and more to create a proof of your scrapbook and then print it. You can go to SmileBox.com or Shutterfly.com to make your scrapbook using online programs and templates. You can also use the Apple program iCollage to make a printed, email, Facebook or Flickr scrapbook.

, After you have decided the set or sets of photographs you want to use, you can begin looking for complimentary themed items. The following are things that you can find online and in scrapbooking stores:


Look for paper products in your theme. Many scrapbooking stores carry decorative paper, stickers and lettering in sports, vacation, hobby and patterned themes. If your theme is more general, use paper in your dad's favorite color or pattern, such as plaid, stripes or paisley.
Find poems or quotes about fathers. If you can't find the words you want to use, then choose quotes from famous authors. This is similar to choosing a greeting card that says what you want to say.
Look for ticket stubs, programs, pennants, children's artwork and other memorabilia that you have gathered in recent years. An advantage of scrapbooking is that you can take many seemingly unrelated elements to form an artful collage.
Look for clip art, magazine images or other images that remind you of your dad. These may be used in the background to express the scrapbook's themes more clearly.

Decide on an important theme for your scrapbook.,
Incorporate relevant photos and memorabilia.,
Write down thoughts that summarize the theme.,
Keep your content consistent.,
Plan layers for your scrapbook.,
Color coordinate the page to the theme.,
Use all of your scrapbook space.,
Give your scrapbook a title.,
Color your background.,
Resize photos to fit your layout.,
Glue photos onto cardstock.,
Write in some info for context.,
Be short and sweet with whatever you write.,
Use stickers for border and decoration.,
Laminate or store your scrapbook.",How to Make a Scrapbook Page," No matter if you're creating a full scrapbook or a single page, the inspiration behind the scrapbook should be emotionally significant to you. You'll have more fun and create a more meaningful scrapbook if you choose a theme that's important to you.Some popular themes for scrapbooks include: family vacations, holidays, graduations, births, weddings, friends, or school.;
, Collecting materials for a scrapbook may include many things, from photographs to newspaper clippings from a certain date. If you're looking for an older specific date, it may take you longer to find photographs or materials to use. While you can easily find material online, try looking for personal materials.


Ask family members for photographs, family trees, or souvenirs that they've collected over time.

, If you're collecting materials for a scrapbook, take time to think about the memory itself. These thoughts should be written down as they happen. If you think of something pithy or engaging, you may be able to use it as part of the text in your final product.


Talk to family members or friends involved in the memory to gather their memories or thoughts. You can also use these for the scrapbook.

, A scrap page won't offer a lot of space, so it's important to choose a theme for each page and follow the concept. This will keep the layout from looking unorganized or overwhelming.


For example, you could designate one page for a relationship you had with a specific friend or a special day you celebrated.

, A good scrapbook will consist of several different layers to give texture to each page. Gluing sheets of construction paper on top of one another will create a three-dimensional impression. Make the layers progressively smaller as you stack them to create an image that really stands out.You may need to measure out the pieces of paper so that you can fit multiple shapes and layers on your scrapbook pages.

, Try to use some basic color theory to support each scrapbook page. Colors can make you feel an immediate emotional response so decide what tone you want to convey for each page. For example, warm colors (like reds, yellows, and oranges) are energizing. You may want to use these colors for a sports or athletic scrapbook page.Cool colors (like blues, greens, and purples) are calming. These would be good colors to use for baby scrapbooks or relaxing vacations.
Neutral colors (like browns and grays) are considered safe to use in most any situation.

, Whether or not you're using a standard printer page or a full-blown poster sheet, you only have a given amount of space to say what you want. With this in mind, every bit of planning you do for a scrap page should keep the amount of space in mind. Discard less important ideas in favor of better ones and give the central ideas more space.


Placement on the page is also important to consider. In general, the center of a page will be the most eye-catching. You can put less important concepts on the borders or edges.

, Even text itself can be considered part of the art on a scrapbook page. Choose a fitting title for your scrapbook and write it in using your best calligraphy. If you are unskilled with cursive writing, bubble letters also work well for this purpose.Some examples of page titles include:Family: ""A Family of Friends"" ""Generations of Love"" or ""Happiness is Homemade""
Graduation: ""Achieve"" ""Believe in Yourself"" or ""Dare to Dream""
Travels: ""Are We There Yet?"" ""Departures and Arrivals"" or ""Life is a Journey""

, A scrapbook should be a work of art. Even if you have a lot of material to cover the original page with, color the foundation. This will let color pop out where there may not have been any otherwise. Marker and watercolor paints are perfect for adding color between the cracks. If you use paint, allow the page time to dry before gluing on your images.You can also use patterned paper as a foundation for your scrap page. For example, use a patterned paper for your border or use cut-out shapes to add meaning to the page., With the help of a computer, take the photos you want to include and resize them according to the amount of space you have to work with. Because you'll have space for a limited number of photos, it is best to give the most space to the best photo, downsizing less important images for use on the sides of your page.Depending on your smartphone, you may even be able to resize photos using a photo editing application.

, Glue your photos onto pieces of cardstock before gluing them onto the page. Placing the images on bigger pieces of cardstock will function as a border. Choose an acid-free adhesive or use photo tabs to stick the photo onto your cardstock. Mark the page with a ruler so that you center the image correctly.If you don't want to use cardstock, you can stick the photo directly onto the scrapbook page or onto another piece of scrapbook paper. Just be sure to use paper that's larger than your image so you end up with a border., Although the photos in a scrapbook should tell enough of a story on their own, you can enrich their meaning by tacking on some context. Regardless of if it's a picture of a vacation, party or family reunion, saying a bit about where it is and why you were there will bring the memories rushing back.You should write up your text as a draft on another sheet of paper before writing it on the final copy. This will allow you to focus on the aesthetic of the text itself and figure out exactly what it is you would like to say before writing it permanently.

, With a scrapbook, you will not have a lot of space to say whatever it is you wish to communicate. With this in mind, be tactical and efficient with the words you use. Poetry and song lyrics are perfect in this sense, as they often communicate feelings better than regular prose would.


You can also include favorite inspiration quotes or quote people who were involved in the activity that the scrapbook page describes.

, Once all of your pages are in place, small stickers can be used as a pleasant add-on. Buy a few sheets of stickers from the dollar store and tack them around certain images as a border. It helps the effect if the stickers are somehow applicable to the theme of the scrapbook.For example, for a scrapbook page about a trip to the beach, you could use seashell stickers. Or, for a baby shower scrapbook page, stick on baby rattle and pacifier stickers.

, A scrapbook page is meant to preserve the feeling of a memory forever. You can increase the longevity of your scrapbook by laminating the pages. Then, be sure to store it in a book or folder where it won't be damaged.You can use a purchased scrapbook by filling in the pages. Or, you can make single scrapbook pages and have them professionally bound. This may preserve the scrapbook best.

,, At the end, you'll have one scrapbook between you. Take turns in keeping at home and showing parents/other friends etc. Or, have several weekends in a row where you make a scrapbook each until each one of you has a scrapbook of her own. This can be achieved easily by printing off several copies of photos from your computer, so that no-one need miss out (scan them in if necessary).

Gather some scrap paper.,
Buy a set of pens.,
Start your first scrapbook doodles by outlining what you want to draw with pencil first.,
Begin by doodling words.,
Experiment with drawing lines, swirls, loops and shapes.,
Draw lines or circles behind titles, stickers, photos and tags.,
Use a white gel pen to add embellishments to colored paper.,
Trace your doodles, instead of creating them by hand.,
Try a more complicated doodle as the layout of your scrapbook page.",How to Doodle on a Scrapbook Page," If you haven't doodled on pages in years, it is a good idea to get some practice. Before setting any pen to a scrapbook page, be sure you have practiced the design, until you become an expert.;
, Gel pens work well for doodling, because they give a vivid look and they roll easily onto the page. You can buy a set of colored gel pens at most stationary and scrapbooking stores.


Be sure to purchase a white opaque gel pen. You can use white gel pens on dark decorative papers and tags to create contrast.

, Erase any mistakes. Draw over your pencil lines with pens.

, If you are not comfortable with drawing free form shapes yet, it is a good idea to start with words and captions. This will add a more personal touch than typing and stickers.


Think of a sentence to put underneath photos. Describe what's going on in your words. Use a gel pen to write the short sentence underneath the photo after it is affixed to the page.
Add words to a nearly completed scrapbook page. When all the elements are in place, add the place name, names of people in the photo, or cute phrases that remind you of the experience. Write them at different angles on the decorative paper so it looks as if you are putting a confetti of words onto a page.
Add to a decorative paper by placing words on it. For example, if your paper is full of circles or squiggly lines, write the same word inside each squiggly line or circle. If your title is ""A Day at the Beach,"" you may want to write ""Sun"" in each circle or ""Fun in the Sun"" on each squiggly line.

, Then, combine all the elements in more complicated designs. You may want to put these combinations at the corners of your page.

, You can add simple layers by doing some doodling on a page before you paste your elements. Practice on scrap paper a few times and then doodle right onto the page.

, This is an easy way to add borders and contrast without drawing ornately.


Cut a piece of colored paper with a paper punch. Draw a line just inside the edge of the paper. Follow the contours of the cut out to make a border.
Draw swirls around the edges of square or circular shapes. This works great on photo mats because you can draw a border on your paper and it appears to be a frame for the photo.
Place small dots around the edges of your paper. This staccato drawing will add definition to colors, words, photos or shapes.
Draw small lines, like stitches, around a border. The white pen on dark paper will give the illusion of sewing. It will create a look of homemade, hand sewn work.

, If you are not confident in your doodling skills, you can draw inspiration from the world around you and add another layer of traced scrapbook doodles to your scrapbook page.


Buy several sheets of clear acetate transparencies. This is the material that is used for overhead projectors. You will use this as a tracing medium and glue it directly onto your page.
Find swirls and designs that you like. You can use anything from a sheet of paper to a piece of fabric or advertisement.
Wash your hands before working with clear acetate. It will help to avoid smudges. Place a sheet of acetate over your design. Trace a part of the design with a colored permanent marker. A portion of a design, such as 1 small swirl, will look more like a doodle than if you trace an entire design.
Allow the marker to dry for a half an hour. The slippery surface means that it will be wet for a while longer than paper. Cut around the design loosely. The acetate is clear so you can leave plenty of space that your viewer will not be able to see.
Glue the transparency onto your scrapbook before you put on your final embellishments or photos. You can draw a design with a glue stick that is right underneath your scribbles, so that it will not show. Do not put a layer over the entire sheet of acetate or it will show through. Stick it to the page and allow it to dry.

, Many advanced scrapbookers now use doodling as the main way to decorate a page. Learning to do this can take time, but it is an excellent way to bring a fun and personal tone to your work.


Use scrap paper to mock up a doodle on a scrapbook page. If possible, make it close to the same size, so that you can experiment with photos, titles and tags.
Draw large doodles, such as swirls or lines to your page. Make lines large so that you can journal in portions of your layout.
Plan out what colors you want to use and where you want your elements to go. Place a picture to the side or directly over the center of your doodle. If you create a swirl pattern, you can place a cut out picture in the center for added depth.
Add additional doodles around the borders and in the corners. Add shapes, such as stars or hearts, depending upon what works well with your theme.
Once your practice layout is finished, draw it directly onto the page and color it in. If you do not want to draw on paper, draw it onto a transparency and overlay the transparency.

Add some pictures and photos.",How to Make a Friendship Book," Double-sided scrapbooking paper is a great choice for this, because it has a design on both sides. It's also thicker than other types of paper.You can also use cardstock or thick poster paper instead. Avoid regular scrapbooking paper that has a design only on one side; it's too thin.

These books will only last you about a month or so. Consider matching the theme of the paper to the season.
You can also buy a blank journal instead. Click here for ideas on how to decorate it, and here for ideas on how to use it.;
, You can do this with a metal-edged ruler and a craft blade or with a paper cutter.You will be folding this in half to make the cover, so you only need one sheet., It's best if you do this using a specialized punch; you can find it in the scrapbooking section of an arts and crafts store. You can also use a small jar to trace the curves, then cut the curves out with a pair of scissors., If you are using double-sided scrapbooking paper, make sure that the side you want for the cover is on the outside. Run your fingernail down the spine to sharpen the fold., You don't have to do this, but it will help protect your book. Use your cover to trace an identical shape onto a sheet of transparency film, then cut it out. Fold the film in half, then place it around the cover.Transparency film is a sheet of thin, clear plastic sheeting. You can find it in office-supply stores and in some photocopying shops.
You can use vellum instead, but it will give your cover an opaque look.

, Regular printer paper works just fine for this, but you can also use more scrapbooking paper as well. If you need to, trim the paper down until it is the same size as the paper you used for your cover: 8 by 11 inches (20.32 by 27.94 centimeters)., Fold each sheet of paper in half hamburger-style. Run your fingernail down the folded edges to sharpen the creases. Once you have all 4 to 5 pages folded, stack them inside one another, just like making a simple book., Make sure that the pages are aligned. Gently tap the book against a table to help straighten things out further. If you rounded the corners on you cover, you will need to round the corners on your pages as well., Open up the book to the center page. Open up a phonebook, then set the book down into it. Use an awl to punch three holes into the crease. You will need a hole in the center of the spine, and a hole 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) from the top and bottom edge.Make sure that you go through all the pages and the cover.
If you don't have a phonebook, you can use another book you don't mind possibly ruining. You can also use a piece of scrap wood.
If you don't have an awl, you can use a nail instead.

, Cut a 24-inch (60.96-centimeter) piece of waxed thread. Waxed thread comes in limited colors, but black will work with most designs. Thread it through a yarn needle, or any other needle with a large eye.You can find waxed thread in the leather-working section of an arts and crafts store.
Waxed thread is recommended for its strength and durability. You can use other types of thick thread if you want to, such as baker's twine, embroidery floss, or thin yarn.

, Push the needle down through the top hole, starting from the outside cover; leave about a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) tail. Sew down towards the bottom hole, then work your way back to the top. When you come out of the middle hole, stop., Make the knot as close as possible to the top hole. Use a double-knot for extra-strength. When you are done, trim the tail ends down to about 4 inches (10.16 centimeters). Leave them as they are, or tie them into a bow., Pull aside the transparency, if you added it, then begin decorating the front cover with stickers, doodles, and other things. If your paper already has a theme to it, try to match it. Here are some ideas to get you started:

Decorate the cover with stickers or simple doodles.
Add a fancy label to the front, then write the title on the label. (ie: FRIENDSHIP BOOK or OUR TIME TOGETHER).
Write the month/season and the year in one of the corners (ie: FALL 2012).If you plan on making many book, write ""Volume 1"" on the cover of the first one., If the inside cover is plain, you can use a glue stick or double-sided tape to paste down a sheet of pretty scrapbooking paper over it. You can use this section to keep track of important dates.

Write something like ""NOTES,"" then use it to keep track of your friends' favorite foods, colors, etc.
Write ""BIRTHDAYS"" across the top, then write down all of your friends' birthdays below it.
Use it as an address book. Use a ruler to add lines, then write your friends' names followed by their contact information.

, Find one or two small charms, then slip them onto one of the tails of your waxed thread. Push them down as close to the knot as possible, then tie the two tails into another double-knot.

If you tied the tails into a bow, you'll have to undo the bow first, then re-tie it later.
You can finds lots of charms in the jewelry and beading section of an arts and crafts shop.

, Trim down the tails on the waxed thread as close to the knot as possible. Next, cut an 8-inch (20.32-centimeter) piece of colored washi tape. Fold it over the edge of the spine to hide the thread. You can also glue down a piece of colorful ribbon instead.

Washi tape is colorful tape with patterns on it. You can find it in the scrapbooking or sticker section of an arts and crafts store.
You don't be able to do this if you already added a charm to the thread. Choose one of the other.

, You don't have to do this, but it gives your book extra flair. It also helps reinforce the seams. Open up your book to the first page. Cut a strip of washi tape down to the same height (8 inches/20.32 centimeters), and set it down into the seam between the pages. Turn to the next page, and repeat the process. Do this until you reach the back cover., This is not absolutely necessary, but it's a great way to add space to your book. You can also make your own envelops by cutting rectangles out of paper, folding them in half hamburger-style, then taping up the side edges.A glue stick will work the best for this. If you don't have one, use double-sided tape.

, Instead of gluing a photo all the way down, tape it to the page by just one edge. Flip the photo over, like opening a door, then write about the event under the photo. Flip the photo back into place to hide the message., If the paper inside the book is mostly solid-colored (like tea-stained paper or printer paper), you can write the stories out by hand. If the paper has lots of patterns on it, however, the designs may be hard to see. Write the stories out on the computer, then print them out.If you are printing the stories out, make the paper smaller than the pages of your book. This way, you won't cover up that pretty scrapbooking paper!
You can also use a combination of the two: writing by hand and typing.

, Focus on the stories you did with your friend. Did you go to a theme park with your best friend? Write about that! Did you go to the mall or movies with your friends? Write about that too!, Have each friend keep the book for a week, then fill out a page or two. By the time the book comes back to you, it will be filled with lots of exciting memories!

Because these friends live far away, these stories can be more personal, such as an outing with the family.
Another option is for you to keep the book, then have everyone else mail or email stuff to you. Glue their stories to the pages of the book., Show your book to your friends, and let them write something in it too, like a yearbook. If you wrote about going to the movies with a certain friend, have him or her comment on the story, or even add to it. They may have noticed things about that day that you didn't., Fill the pages with gossip (but don't spread mean rumors), comics, or made-up stories. Write down your dreams, goals, and fears, and remember to encourage and support one another.

Save the tickets from the movie that you went to; glue it right next to the story, or just below it.

, Doodle in the margins of your stories, or add a simple illustration. You can also paste photos of your time together. The photos don't have to be recent either. Feel free to include a ""Our Favorite Memories"" page, and keep all of your favorite pictures there."

Choose some ideal pieces.,
Clean the jewelry up.,
Think of ways to add the jewelry pieces.,
Make special features from the pieces.,
Think of themes for the jewellery pieces.",How to Embellish Scrapbook Projects with Jewelry," Clearly you won't be using the diamond or emerald stones to make a scrapping project but you can indulge in any imitation costume pieces that you have around the house. Broken necklaces and bracelets are excellent sources to pilfer pieces from, as are the odd earrings without a mate. Brooches can be great jewellery items also. Just make sure that they are pieces that you don't wish to repair or keep as jewelry anymore.;
, Make sure that the jewelry is clean and as shining as it should be before using. Remove latches, pins, sharp edges etc. and aim to find a flat edge that can be stuck to a page.

, If you are scrapping a collage or picture that will not be squashed flat into a scrapbook but will be placed on display, you have more leeway to use larger, non flat objects. For example, take the beads from various necklaces and bracelets and thread them into a design for working into your page. Glue one part of each bead to the page. Earrings will often have flat designs that will be fine in a scrapbook once attached. If you have large photos of people, you might even consider adding the jewellery to their body features for a three-dimensional reality.

, Be inspired by the loose pieces to recreate something wonderful in your scrapping. The image shows a great example of reusing beads with fabric to recreate a flower design.

, Some jewelry will undoubtedly have sentimental attachments for you. Try to incorporate this jewelry into a page that reflects the memory - such as a first date, an outing with friends, a visit to a special event, a wedding etc. and design the entire scrapping theme around this piece of jewelry. Don't forget to add text to complete the story and enlighten future generations as to why that pieces was special to you.

Choose a scrapbook.,
Buy photo-safe paper.,
Play around with different designs and textures of paper.,
Find a paper that enhances your theme.,
Buy proper tape to adhere your pictures with.,
Gather fun embellishments.",How to Decorate a Scrapbook1," Think about what type of scrapbook album you want to use. There are several types available, each with their own advantages. One thing to consider when deciding on a type to use is how much money and decoration you want to commit to. Here are a few of the most popular kinds:Post-bound albums are probably the most popular choice for modern day scrapbooks. They have a decorative cover, usually with a place to insert a picture, and acid-free photo safe sheet protectors ready for you to slide your paper and pictures into. You do have to buy the paper to put your pictures on separately, but this allows you to choose your own colors and designs.Scrapbooks bound with non-removable pages are nice because the album already comes with paper, but be careful because they do not always come with page protectors.Three-ring photo albums are the cheapest of the albums, but you do have to buy paper separately. You can add in acid-free photo safe sheet protectors, and then slide your finished page into the sleeve. These albums allow you to add in new pages as your scrapbook grows.;
, It is very important to buy paper that is specifically designed to preserve photos. Paper meant for scrapbooking is acid-free and lignin-free so that over-time, your photos do not break down and ruin. So whether you are buying paper to put into an empty scrapbook, or a scrapbook with paper already in it, be sure that the paper is safe for your photos., There are many different types of paper you can choose from to use for a scrapbook. Here are some of the most common types of paper used for scrapbooking:Card-stock paper is a heavy weight paper mostly used as the background of the page format.B&T (Background and Texture) paper is great to use as decoration for the background on the page. You can also use it to accent edges or as a photo mat background.Gingham paper is a popular ""checker board"" patterned paper used as background accents that can be used for backgrounds or accents.Vellum is translucent paper and is great to use for an elegant look. It can be placed over photos or memorabilia to ""dress up"" a page., Paper can help you capture the mood of the photos. If you are using black and white photos, choose an elegant paper pattern to match. If you have colorful pictures of a kid's birthday party, pick paper with a fun design.

, There are many different ways to glue and stick your photos or other decorations into a scrapbook that are safe and will not harm your photos. Be sure to check that you are using one that is safe, and do not use just anything. Here are some safe options to use:Photo tabs are rolled up inside a box and are sticky double-sided square tabs. These are cheap, easy to use, and a virtually mess-free option.Glue sticks are inexpensive and convenient to use. Watch to make sure you do not over apply the glue because it could cause your paper to warp and buckle. Just put a dab of glue at each corner and one swipe in the middle.Glue dots come on a roll and are great for adding ribbon, buttons, or other 3-D items on your page. All you have to do is press your 3-D item onto the glue dot, and then lift the dot off the roll. Then, press your item onto the page and press down. These are very sticky so be sure that you are confident about the spot you want to place your item before doing so.Foam mounting tape is a double-sided adhesive that is about 1/8"" thick. This tape allows you to add dimensions to your pictures or embellishments., Head to a craft store, and look for stickers, stamps, ribbon, or other embellishments to add in your scrapbook. You can find hundreds of decorations to use for just about any theme. You can also add pieces to your scrapbook that you have at home such as ticket stubs, receipts that represent a special memory, award ribbons, drawings, or pressed flowers. Things that remind you of a great memory, and fit in your scrapbook, may be the perfect thing to use for decoration.


Another fun way to decorate is to use texturing scissors. You can find scissors that have teeth along the edges that give the edges of paper fun designs. You can purchase these at most craft stores.

Select photos based on a specific theme or event.,
Group your photos.,
Mat your photos.",How to Decorate a Scrapbook2," A well-organized scrapbook will capture a certain time or event such as a first birthday, holiday, or family road trip. Within this theme, the scrapbook will unfold the story you will tell of that time. So the first thing to do is gather all of the photos that you want to use to help memorialize special memories., Usually, the layout of a scrapbook has a double-page spread, meaning there are photos on the left and right side of the page. These pages should match and compliment each other in color and theme. So as you are deciding on which photos to use, think about which photos you may want to stand alone, and which ones you want to pair with several others on a page. This will help you decide which photos to add in the scrapbook, and which ones you may want to leave out. Just because you have one hundred photos does not mean you have to use them all.Even if there is one special photo alone on a page, and then three photos on the page next to it, try to find a common theme to connect them.
Scrapbooks tend to look better when pictures are not crowded on a page. Keep this in mind when deciding how many photos to add., If you are using a patterned paper, or paper that has many colors, mat your photo onto a solid neutral paper to prevent the photo from competing with the design on the background paper. This is a simple step and can make all the difference in your scrapbook design. No matter what your background paper looks like, providing a mat allows your scrapbook to have a more finished look. Follow these steps to mat your photos:Have ready a solid color paper that is neutral in color. Try to choose a color that will compliment the colors on the background page. When in doubt, black and white work with everything.Cut the paper so that it is 1/8""-1/2"" larger than your picture. This will provide a frame and visual space between the paper and photo.Use photo-tabs to adhere the picture onto the mat. These are double-sided sticky tabs that are photo-safe and keep your picture flat."

Decide how you want the page to look before fixing it permanently.,
Add thoughts with your photos.,
Slip your finished page into the sheet protector.",How to Decorate a Scrapbook3," Arrange your photos, embellishments, or anything else you may be adding on the page to see what looks the best. When you are satisfied with the placement, then you can tape or glue everything in place. Keep these tips in mind as you arrange your elements:The eye is drawn to the center of the page first, so do not leave the center empty.Photos that capture a similar moment, or are somehow connected, look nice when they overlap at the corners.Uneven numbers are pleasing to the design of a scrapbook. For example, decorate a page with three photos instead of four.Decide where you want the photos first, and then add embellishments around them. Embellishments should break up negative space, but not become distracting.

, If you want to add a special anecdote, date, explanation, or poem to go along with your photos, feel free to do so. Writing memories about certain feelings, thoughts, or special memories next to pictures enhances the scrapbook experience. You can write your words on a separate piece of paper and then tape it in, write directly in the scrapbook, or type the words on your computer and print them out. Do what makes you the most comfortable.


For example, if you are creating a scrapbook documenting a family road trip, consider adding highlights from the trip you want to remember next to some of the pictures. You may write, ""That time we got lost and ended up finding a diner with the best pie in the world..."", next to a picture of your family eating at the diner.

, When you are satisfied with the layout of your page, and everything is tapped or glued into place, slide the page into the clear page protector. If you want to go back to add or edit something on the page, all you have to do is slip the page back out.

Get 8 square sticky notes.,
Fold the bottom edge to the tip of the point you just created.

,
Fold in half vertically so that it looks like a square made of two triangles.

,
Pull the shared upper left corner of the triangles apart from itself until you get a rhombus shape and crease.

,
Repeat the previous steps seven times with different sticky notes.

,
There should be a tip that you can pull apart on each.,
Fold the the tabs (actually two protruding tips) into the gap between the sides on the second rhombus.

,
Holding the whole thing so that the tip points to the outside, continue adding links to it in the same fashion until you have a full circle.,
This circle is collapsible.",How to Make a Sticky Note Shuriken," Fold the two sticky corners on one towards the center.;
,,,,, Take another sticky note and put the tip that doesn't pull apart into the slot. Rest the edge against the point where the tips fold apart and line the tip up with the top edge of the other one. If you've done this right, the tip of the first rhombus should stick out from the second, but don't get frustrated if it doesn't. It's a matter of how you have them rotated. Flip one of them over top-to-bottom and go again.

,, The last one can be a bit tricky.

, By pushing the sides together, it transforms into the complete shuriken, and by pulling apart again it goes back.

Use multiple adhesives in one scrapbook.,
Choose wet adhesives for stronger and more permanent gluing.,
Choose dry adhesives to easily modify and reposition items.,
Avoid acidic adhesives.",How to Choose the Right Adhesive to Use in Your Scrapbook1," Many scrapbooking projects will benefit from having multiple adhesives at your disposal. Having many adhesives will allow you to temporarily position a photograph, make a short note about a memory, or permanently glue a banner or heading. Wet and dry adhesives come in permanent, repositionable, and temporary types, which means some are best for permanent adhesion while others allow you to keep items in place before firmly adhering them., Wet adhesives, or glue, come in liquid, paste, stick, or spray forms, and are generally more permanent and take longer to dry.As wet adhesives tend to be more permanent, they are often best suited for more permanent choices, like headings, banners, and photo mats.
Although wet adhesives are generally stronger and more permanent, there are a few that allow for a longer working time before drying.

, Dry adhesives, such as tape, tabs, dots, and photo corners, tend to be easier to remove and modify, and tend to mount items instantly.Dry adhesives tend to be less permanent and are more easily repositioned. Keep dry adhesives on hand to temporarily hold items in place, adhere photographs, and to keep your options open.
There are a few dry adhesives that are designed to instantly stick to whatever surface they are placed on, so be sure to double check which is which.

, Acidic adhesives will destroy the quality of photographs and paper overtime. Even trace exposure to acidic adhesives can cause lasting effects and further deteriorate your paper or photograph.


Avoid sticky notes. The adhesive on the backs of sticky notes is acidic! Even if applied momentarily, the acid will affect and damage your paper or photograph.
Always read the label. If you are unsure as to whether your adhesive is acidic, throw it out or set it aside for another project. Better safe than sorry!
Beware of adhesives with strong odors. Adhesives that have strong odors are more likely to be acidic and damaging to the items in your scrapbook.

Layer text over images.",How to Add Text to a Scrapbook," Scrapbooks should be made to last and acid-free paper will last at least 100 years.Plus, anything with a pH level below 7, or not acid-free, will make photos fade over time. This is important whether you’re printing text from your computer or cutting out stenciled letters. Any paper you buy at a scrapbook shop or in the scrapbook section of a craft’s store will be acid-free.;
, It’s not just the paper that has to be acid-free. Markers, pens, and glue should all be suited for scrapbooks. Products that are not labeled ""acid-free,"" ""archival"" or ""photo-safe"" could react chemically with your photos. Things not acid-free will make paper deteriorate more quickly too.

, If you don’t know anyone who scrapbooks, that’s okay; you can look at scrapbook websites or buy a magazine. Look at as many examples as you can. Seeing what other scrapbook enthusiasts have done can help inspire you as you create your own unique scrapbook.

, How you place photos, trinkets, and decorations in a scrapbook is going to affect what kind of text you use. Sometimes, you may want your photos to be the main focus and use text to just enhance them. Other times, you may want your journaling to be a central focus. In this case, you will want to pay close attention to placement.

, After you have the photos you want for a particular page, think about what you want to say about them. Dates and labels are a given. What sets a scrapbook apart from a photo album is the something more. If you’re recording a birth, you may have pictures of the new baby and a tiny hospital bracelet. Journaling is about the details of the day, like how happy you were or when visitors first arrived.

, In addition to longer journal-like text, you may want shorter captions that explain photos and memories quickly. You can place text on ribbon-like strips of paper to record names, places and dates. Captions work really well to explain to viewers what is happening in a particular photo, such as ""Grandma nearly blew out all the candles on her 100th birthday cake.""

, When using a computer to type text you want to adhere on your scrapbook, it’s important to think about how you’re going to print it. If you decide to use card-stock, make sure it's lightweight enough to run through your printer. If you use paper, it should be smooth, because it will be hard to print on textured paper.

, Most scrapbooks are 12 inches by 12 inches and the standard size printer paper is 8.5 inches by 11 inches. You cannot use paper that will cover an entire scrapbook page with most printers. Change the orientation to landscape and use the widest margins possible, if you want to cover a lot of paper with text. You can print directly on your scrapbook canvas only if you have a wide format printer., Whatever application you use to type text on your computer, you will have a lot of choices when it comes to font. Remember your first priority is to make your text readable. Standard fonts like Times New Roman and Arial are very readable and look neat. Try other fonts, if you want to elaborate on the theme of a page. Fonts like Comic are good for kid-themed pages, while you can use a font like Papyrus for travel or artsy-themed pages., No matter what size paper you print on, you can choose many different sized fonts that you can trim and glue on your scrapbook. Look at your scrapbook for reference and think about your layout, while you explore the right size of text. Labels and headings should be larger that journaling text.

, This can be daunting, if you’re not fond of your penmanship, but this personal touch can be worth the effort. It’s especially nice to use your own handwriting for heartfelt journaling. Think about your great-grandchildren looking at your handwritten thoughts decades down the road.


Line handwritten areas in pencil first with a ruler or straightedge.
Write the text out with pencil before you trace over it in pen.
Erase the pencil marks for beautiful, thought-out writing.Mimic different styles of lettering, if you want to try something other than your natural handwriting.

, Stencils come in all shapes and styles, and they can be a great way to add text to a scrapbook quickly. Cut large stenciled letters out for titles and headings. You can use contrasting colors or different textures for an extra pop. If you're strapped for time, you can stencil letters directly onto your scrapbook and color them in., Dip a brush in an ink pot to try your hand at calligraphy. If you don't want to get that fancy, you can look at styles of letters you like and copy their basic shape with something as simple as a marker. Calligraphy works great for labels and short pieces of text., Adhesive backed and paste-on paper letters come in all sizes, styles and colors. Your local arts and crafts store will carry many different lettering options for scrap-booking. Take your time to browse these options, but keep in mind specialty letters that are pre-cut with adhesive can cost more than other text.

, If you have a piece of journaling longer than five lines, blocking text off is best. Look at the area you need to cover on your scrap-page and adjust your letter size accordingly. To create a block of text in MS Word place your cursor where you’d like the text block to start, press Ctrl+Shift+F8 to create a block, and extend the block around the text you’d like to include.After you create a block, you can center text, if you wish.
Pay attention to line-spacing.
Use a piece of scrap for handwritten block text too.

, Sometimes you may not want to use plain paper or card-stock to print or write a block of text. If you have pre-lined or embellished paper you want to print on, you simply have to plan this out a little more carefully. First, measure your piece of scrap. Then, drag a block around your text that is the same dimensions as your scrap. Change your font size and line-spacing accordingly., The best way to check if you have the right size font for your layout is by printing your text on regular paper first. Make sure the paper and type is the same size you’ll use for the real printout. Cut your text from the practice paper and check the placement on your scrapbook.

, If you’re printing photographs, you can add text directly to them on your computer. You can also label directly on photos with markers or pens. Alternatively, you can use digital word art from a program like Photoshop to print onto your scrap paper.

Use a glue stick to for general purposes and large areas.,
Use spray adhesives for simple and even application.,
Use paste for more durable and permanent adhesion.,
Use quick drying liquid adhesives for more permanent solutions.",How to Choose the Right Adhesive to Use in Your Scrapbook2," Glue sticks are great for paper and are one of the more common, easy to use, and cheaper adhesives for scrapbooking. Not only are gluesticks easy to apply, they are also repositionable until dry, safe for children, and tend to not crinkle paper.Apply glue sticks in thin layers for optimal adhesion and minimal wear on the paper.
Be cautious of how much glue you apply with a glue stick, many people tend to apply too much glue due to the ease in application.

, Spray adhesives are applied from an aerosol can, and are one of the more popular adhesive due to their ability to be used for a myriad of purposes.Spray adhesives also come in tacky, less permanent forms, and are ideal for adhering items that you would like to move with minimal damage.
Spray adhesives can contain fumes that can be toxic to inhale. Be sure to use spray adhesives in well-ventilated areas.

, Pastes are generally chunkier water-based glues, which mean they take much longer to dry than sticks or sprays and are more likely to wrinkle thin materials like paper.Pastes are best used with more durable materials, like thick card-stock or water-proof material, and for more permanent solutions.
Pastes are all-purpose glues and are often non-toxic and child safe.

, Liquid glues, like sprays, come in a wide variety strengths and drying times, and often come in applicators like bottles, pens, or rollers.


Quick drying liquid glues, like PVA or SuperGlue, come in bottles and are ideal for most adhering purposes, with the exception of photographs.
Glue pens generally allow for a longer working time without jeopardizing the strength of the glue."

Use tape to make mounting items quick and simple.,
Use tabs, like glue dots, for 3-D embellishments and accessories.,
Use photo corner mounts to maintain archival quality adhesion.",How to Choose the Right Adhesive to Use in Your Scrapbook3," Tape is one of the most pervasive adhesives available, and can be found in almost any form. From light weight single sided to heavy duty double sided. From thick and embellishing foam tape to invisible transparent tape.Double sided tape can be useful for adhering photos or ephemera, like stamps or postcards, to your scrapbook.
Use foam tape to embellish objects and give them dimensionality.
Transparent tape is ideal for invisible adhesion.

, Tabs are similar to tape, but come already perforated on rolls and can be easily distributed in increments. Glue-Dots come in a roll packaged inside a small box. Simply unroll the liner and carefully place a clear Glue-Dot in the place you wish to adhere an embellishment or accessory.Tabs, like tape, come in many specialized forms, and can be used for adhering photos, paper, ephemera, or objects.
Tabs and glue dots bind almost instantly, so be sure they are placed in the exact spot you wish to adhere. They may be removed, but often will cause the paper or surface to tear.Glue dots are generally safe, but are best kept away from children as they are small in size and can be easily ingested.

, One of the main concerns with adhering photographs is not only the strength of the glue, but also its quality. Corner mounts provide a strong, long-lasting adhesive, while minimizing negative effects on your photos.


As a dry adhesive, corner mounts allow for a longer working time and can be repositioned with minimal damage to the adhering surface.
Corner mounts are ideal for holding original photographs in place, without applying any damaging adhesive to them.
Make sure to appropriately crop your photograph to best fit the corner mounts.
Use fasteners, like brads, to adhere different objects together with style. Fasteners technically have no adhesive material or glue on them, but become an “adhesive” by piercing the paper or surface."

Let sepia photos do most of the work.,
Add modest decorative elements.,
Keep the design theme running through without chopping and changing too much.",How to Complement Sepia Photos for Scrapbooks," Good tones that match sepia well include whites and creams. Try to get scrapbook backing paper in these tones as they will set off the photos well.;
, Sepia colour splashes that work well include maroon, forest green and deep blues. It is important, however, to choose one or two alternative colours at the most, to avoid over-colouring and removing the suggestion of antique elegance.

, When laying out your photos in the scrapbook, avoid overwhelming the pages of the scrapbook with differing colours; rather, keep it simple and elegant by sticking with one colour theme and even then, only use it moderately.

, If you are trying to capture the old world elegance, Victoriana floral emblems and similar designs are likely to be ideal additions, provided that they are not over-coloured. Small ribbons can also work well, giving an authentic old time touch.

, Once you have chosen a pattern for paper or decorative additions, stick with it for the entire scrapbook; in doing so, you will create the simple elegance of an antique-style scrapbook.

The eaves of the White House have become the towers, and the trees that flank the White House have become the smoke from the ruined buildings.

, The current $20 bill was the product of a redesign implemented by the U.S. Treasury in 1998 – three years before a terrorist sect hijacked commercial jets and flew them into the Twin Towers.Some 9/11 conspiracy theorists contend that the hidden towers on the $20 bill were a sign from the U.S. government—or some shadowy, powerful organization—foreshadowing the event.

Crumple the paper.,
Uncrumple the paper and spritz it with water, tea or coffee.,

Lay out the paper to air dry.",How to Make Paper Look Old1," Take a sheet of paper in your hand and crumple it into a ball. The tighter the ball, the more creases your paper will have.;
, After uncrumpling the sheet of paper, fill a squirt bottle with your chosen liquid. Then, squirt the paper until the spots you’re looking to shape and color are damp.


Note that the liquid you use will give the paper a different look. Water won’t color the paper, but will enable further alterations. Tea will give a slight brown color, while coffee will give the sheet a darker color.

, Now that it is damp, the paper will be easier to shape. Try tearing off edges, removing small circles with your fingernail, or creating tiny wrinkles. This damage simulates the passage of time; the older you want the sheet of paper to look, the more damage you need to include.


If you want to make darker, deeper creases, crumple the damp paper again. Be careful not to rip the page in half.

, Place the paper on a flat surface, such as a countertop or table. The sheet should completely dry in a few hours.


Alternatively, you can use a hair dryer to speed up this process.

Paint watercolor paper or use cardstock or construction paper.,
Measure 1, 2, and 3-inch squares.,
Fold them in half and cut the open edge into a petal shape.,
Roll the petals.,
Put hot glue in the corners, wrapping the first one very tightly.,
Glue the petals to each other in an open fashion, layering them.",How to Make Paper Flowers1," A really nice way to get paper flowers with interesting, nuanced petals is to paint on watercolor paper. It allows for slightly different shades within the same piece that look natural and reminiscent of a real flower.









For watercolor paper, you simply dip your brush in a bit of clean water, add some watercolor paint to the tips of the brush, and go over the paper. The best part about it is that it’s supposed to look slightly different in every spot, so you don’t have to worry about shading or blending.
You can also use cardstock or construction paper, too, and it’s quicker and cheaper. You just won’t have the soft gradient of watercolor paper; however, you could choose a more vivid color with this type instead.;
, With this method, we’re going to assume you want to make a handful of different paper flowers. Let’s make three different sizes, then: 1"" (2.5cm) flowers, 2"" (5cm) flowers, and 3"" (7.5cm) flowers. All you need to do is cut squares that are these sizes (in both length and width) and pile them up.









Make a whole bunch. Each flower will require at least 12 squares or so. And it’s not that the 1"" squares are in the middle and the 3"" squares are on the outside – instead, it’s just the amount you roll them up to get them bigger and smaller. A 3"" flower, for example, will be made entirely of 3"" squares.

, Take a handful of the same-size square in your hand and fold them all in half, layering them like an onion so you can cut them all at the same time.









To make your cut, place your scissors on the open side and cut it into a half-arch type of thing (that is, rounded at the top). When you open it up, you'll notice that it's now in the shape of a petal.

, Flower petals aren't flat, so you don't want yours to be either. Roll them up to bend the papers into a more flower-like shape. The more intense your rolling, the more curved they'll be.









And then unroll them. When you unroll them, they'll maintain a bit of the curve of the roll. Can you see how they might fit together to form a flower?

, For the very center of your flower, put hot glue in the corners of the paper and roll it back into a tight bud shape. The center of the flower will be more enclosed and the petals will spread out from there.









Hold it there for a second, being careful not to get any hot glue on your fingers. You now have the very center of your flower and can start attaching petals.

, Take another square of the same size and put hot glue in the corners. Then, taking the bud in your opposite hand, glue the petal the bud. Since you're still on the second layer of petals, this one, too, will be highly curved and close to the bud. As you expand, the petals should get more and more splayed out.









Every layer should peep out from between the layer before. In the valley where the two petals meet in one layer should be the center of the petal from the next layer. And again, with each succeeding layer your petals should get less and less rolled up.Once your layers reach the size and width that you want, you're done. It's as simple as that! With this technique, they look even better in groups, so don't stop now. Make a few to stick together to make their beauty (and your creativity) exponentially more remarkable.

Choose and brew your solvent.,
Place the paper on a baking or cookie sheet.,
Preheat the oven to 200ºF (90ºC).,
Pour the solvent onto the baking sheet.,
Use a sponge brush to spread the coffee/tea around.,
Dab excess liquid with a paper towel.,
Modify the paper.,
Place the baking sheet in the oven for four to seven minutes.,
Remove the paper and allow it to cool.",How to Make Paper Look Old2," To age your paper, you can choose to use coffee for a darker color or tea for a lighter color. You can also affect the color of your paper during the brewing process.


If using coffee, you can darken or lighten the color by using more or less coffee grounds.
With tea, the resulting shade of your sheet of paper will be affected by how long you leave the tea in the water. A longer infusion will result in a darker shade, while a short infusion will make for a lighter shade.
Let your liquid cool before proceeding to the next step.

, Make sure the paper can fit inside the sheet easily, without going over the edges.

, By preheating your oven at this point, it should reach the desired temperature by the time the paper is ready to be baked.

, Start pouring in a corner of the baking sheet, not directly over the paper. Only pour enough liquid to cover the sheet of paper with a thin film. Don’t be concerned about solvent ending up beneath the paper; it will soak up the liquid beneath it.

, Here you can be creative with the patterns you create. You can spread the solvent evenly around the sheet if you want a more uniform look. Otherwise, you can spread it unevenly to create more vivid, obvious patterns.If you’d like to create a more vivid, spotty pattern, you can sprinkle coffee grounds on the paper, letting them stand for a few minutes., Make sure there are no pools of liquid left either on the paper or in the baking sheet. You’re not trying to get the paper completely dry, just making sure there is no unabsorbed liquid sitting on the sheet.

, Before you put the baking sheet and paper in the oven, you can add a few touches to make the paper seem even older while it's damp and easy to manipulate. Tear a thin, jagged strip off the side. Or, dig small holes out of the paper with your fingernail; you can crumple these tiny wads and move them to other parts of the paper for a bumpy, parchment-like look. Additionally, you can press down on the paper with something like a fork to leave imprints.

, Ideally, you’ll want to put the sheet on a middle oven rack. Keep an eye on the paper as it bakes. You’ll know the process is complete once the edges start to curl up. The time it takes for this to happen depends on your oven.

, Using oven mitts, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Give the paper 10 to 15 minutes to cool down before you attempt to write on it.

Take a sheet of paper over a sink.,
Find a candle or lighter.,
Run the flame along the paper’s edges.,
Burn small spots into the paper.",How to Make Paper Look Old3," This is important in case you accidentally light the paper on fire; you can just drop it into the sink and douse it in water. For this particular method you should write on the paper after the aging process, to avoid losing some of your work with excessive burning.

, There is no difference in the effectiveness of each source of fire. Simply use whatever is available to you. Avoid using a butane lighter as the flame is too intense for this type of work.

, Hold the edges of the paper between 1/2 inch (1cm) and 1 inch (2.5cm) above the flame. Move the flame along the edges, going back and forth along the sheet’s perimeter. This will create the darkened look of paper that's been around for a very long time and been damaged by time and circumstance. Do not put it too long on one place by the candle.


Don’t let the flame linger on any one spot too long; this could set the whole sheet of paper on fire.As you move the flame long the paper’s edges, make sure you’re moving away from your hand to avoid potential burns.

, If you want to further damage your sheet of paper, you can burn little holes into it. Again, put the paper around an inch above the flame, this time letting it linger. Pay attention to this spot as it browns and blackens. Once it’s reached the desired color, remove it from the flame.


If you want to burn holes into your sheet of paper, leave it above the flame slightly longer. The heat will eventually burn through, and a small flame will catch. Be quick to blow it out.
If the paper catches fire quicker than you can blow it out, drop it in the sink and douse it in water.

Dig a hole in your backyard.,
Crumple the paper into a ball and place it inside the hole.,
Fill the hole with dirt.,
Retrieve the paper after three to fourteen days.",How to Make Paper Look Old4," You want this hole just deep enough to fit a tennis ball. No need to damage your yard unnecessarily.

, Sprinkle the ball of paper with a bit of water; no more than a quarter of a cup. You can rub some dirt onto the paper before you do this; the mud will dirty and smudge the sheet.

, Make sure the paper is completely covered. The dirt will damage and wear out the paper over time, so you’ll need to ensure a snug fit.

, The amount of time you wait depends on how old you want the paper to look.

Cut your paper into a square.,
Draw a spiral on the paper.,
Cut it out and roll it around the tip of a pencil or Q-tip.,
Unroll and secure the bottom with a dab of hot glue, if desired.",How to Make Paper Flowers2," Any size square will work. Really. That being said, smaller squares, a few inches (7.5 cm or so) across will be easier to work with and handle when you’re assembling the flower.









For the paper, construction, watercolor, or scrapbook paper works best. Anything that's on the stiffer side and colorful will do the trick.

, Take a pencil and lightly draw a spiral shape starting from the outer edges of the square of paper. Then simply freehand a spiral – the more room in between the lines, the thicker your petals will be. It’s as simple as that.









It doesn't have to be perfect, uniform, or even by any means. A lop-sided, wonky spiral will be just as adorable as a spiral that was meticulously drawn down to the millimeter. Just draw a spiral like your inner seven-year-old self might draw a spiral and that’ll be great.

, Cut along the lines of the spiral, creating a curly ring of paper. It will naturally cut off the edges and leave you with one giant curly-cue. Then, starting at the very center, roll it around the tip of something small, like a pencil or Q-tip.








To roll, hold the very center to the edge of your pencil or Q-tip. then roll it up like a spool of ribbon, each length on top of the other. As your spiral starts to get bigger, you'll notice that it starts to move downward. This is how it's supposed to be.

, Take the pencil or Q-tip out and you'll be left with a rolled paper that looks very much like a flower. To keep it together, dab the bottom side with hot glue – and you're done. Talk about easy!









Your first one or two may not be perfect, but as you keep going you'll be able to figure out what will create the look you're going for. You'll also notice that as you create more, they look neater and neater.
You could also attach a pipe cleaner or a hanger wrapped in green planter's tape to the bottom for a stem. Who doesn't love a homemade bouquet?

Choose a variety of different colored pieces of tissue paper.,
Cut strips from the tissue paper.,
Cut vertical lines into the strip, leaving an inch or so untouched.,
Take a small piece of floral wire and bend it at the top.,
Take your cut up strip and wrap it around the stem.,
After you have made your flower, take floral tape and wrap it over the masking tape.",How to Make Paper Flowers3," A classic flower will be made up of only one shade, but if you're feeling adventurous, combine a few together. For each flower, you'll need 3 or 4 sheets of tissue paper.









When you've chosen your tissue paper, place them together, lined up in a pile.

, How much you should cut will depend on the size of the flower you want to make. As a general rule of thumb, cut a strip twice as big as the flower you want to create.









If you're making several flowers, experiment with different sizes. Just cut strips that are of various widths and it will automatically create smaller and bigger flowers.

, Go down the strip cutting little snips into the tissue paper at even intervals. If you want teeny petals, make the snips close together; if you want larger petals, make them farther apart.









Leave an inch or so of tissue paper untouched at one end of the strip. This will be the part of the flower that you work with and use as your base, so you don't want it shredded.
The strip should still include every layer of tissue paper that you started with. No need to cut one sheet at a time.

, Wrap a piece of masking tape around the loop once it's formed. This will be the bud of your flower and will give the flower something to structure itself around.









If you don't want a masking tape bud, you can either color the masking tape or cover it with more tissue paper. You could also try leaving the floral wire exposed. With enough petals, it may blend right in.

, Roll and roll and roll until you come to the other side of the strip and it's all wrapped up. Then, take another piece of masking tape and wrap it around the base of the paper, securing it in place. Do this to as many layers as you want of paper.









Once the tape is on, fluff your ""petals"" to give them a more flowery look. Spread them out and squish them a little to get them to sprawl out like a carnation.

, Floral tape is green and will look more like a stem. Then you can take the end of the tape and attach it to anything, whether it's a card or the end of a pen.









If your flower still seems like it's missing something, try wrapping a ribbon around the base. This also provides you another way to attach the flower to something without using the tape. A ribbon is much more delicate and will emphasize the cuteness of your flower.

Create a drawing.,
Draw the image onto white paper.,
Add geometric shapes around the initial image.,
Hold the paper up to a window with the images facing outward.,
Color in the drawn images with crayons.,
Finish by coloring in all of the remaining background of the paper.,
Coat the back of the drawing in a small amount of baby oil.,
Allow to dry fully.,
Punch or pierce a hole in the top of the paper.,
Hang or attach the drawing on a window.",How to Make Paper Look Like Stained Glass," Decide on a simple drawing the first time that you try this, so that you can concentrate most on getting the technique accurate. Afterwards, you can progress to more advanced drawings. Some ideas for trying first include a star, a moon, a basic tree, a flower or the outline of a cat or dog.


It is also recommended that you keep your first design small, as there is a lot of coloring in required.;
, Use permanent black marker to sketch the image in place. Position the drawing in the center of the white paper.


If you prefer, print out a simple design using black ink on white paper.

, These help to give the impression of a stained glass window. Diamonds, squares and rectangles are suitable shapes.

, Using the light to highlight the images, draw around them on the back of the paper as well.

, Used different colors for each image, and perhaps different colors within the image. Color them on both sides.

, The whole sheet of paper must be colored in for the best effect, both front and back.

, Use a cotton swab or bud as the ""brush"". Turn the paper over to the back. Dip the swap into the oil, then coat sections at a time of the back of the drawing. Continue until you have covered the entire back of the paper.


Be sparing with the amount of baby oil used. It should be just enough to coat the paper for a translucent effect. Avoid having it drip off or thoroughly soak the paper.
Paint gently; if you press too hard, the paper may rip.

, See Warnings below for what might happen if it's not dry enough.

, Thread a piece of ribbon or string through it and tie in a loop for hanging.


You can stick this step if you're going to use poster tack or tape to attach the paper to the window.

, The light will shine through, the baby oil will intensify the colors and let the light shine through, giving the impression of a stained glass window.

You can also use thin plain paper and card stock as popular alternatives. Origami can be folded from any type of paper, as long as it is the appropriate thickness.


Origami paper, also known as kami, is what is traditionally used in this famed Japanese practice. Kami is advantageous because it is thin, flexible, and often pre-cut into squares. However, kami was invented to be a less expensive option to Western paper, meaning it can be low quality.Plain copy paper is used for many styles of beginner origami. When choosing copy paper, look for a thinner option as it will fold and crease nicely, whereas a thicker version will be lumpy and unsightly after folding.Card-stock, or craft paper is another popular paper choice for folding. The advantage to card stock is that it comes in endless amounts of shapes, and colors; however, sometimes it can be too thick and rigid leading to cracking within your design.
The best way to determine if the paper is too thick is to try a few quick folds. If the paper does not have an even, smooth crease or tears under the pressure of your folds, it is likely too thick for origami.;
, When you desire a longer fan, use a rectangular shaped paper. Your fan will be approximately two thirds the length of the longer side of the rectangle. Otherwise, you can stick with a square piece of paper. A square piece will yield a fan approximately two thirds the length of the square's sides.


Paper that is 15 cm x 15 cm (6” x 6”) is good for beginners. but you can also use a larger piece if you desire a longer fan.The 15 cm x 15 cm paper choice will allow for a small, handheld fan. If you desire a larger fan, try starting with 20 cm x 20cm (8” x 8”).

, If you are using a rectangular piece of paper, skip this step. With the paper front-side up, fold down a portion of one side and crease. Unfold the crease and use scissors to cut along the crease. Now you have a rectangular piece of paper.If you have access, use a paper cutter. A paper cutter allows for a quick and straight cut by placing the paper on the mount, aligning it up the corners and pulling the blade down in one quick motion. This is effective for cutting several pieces of paper at once. 
Cut slowly. You want to do your best to cut a straight line in order to have an even fan. If you're struggling to get a straight cut, try using larger cuts to ensure the smoothness.

, It should be back-side up, with the non-decorative or plain side facing you.

, Think of folding it like a hot dog bun; you want to fold along the longer edge to produce a long, skinny fold. Line up your corners of the top of the sides of the paper to ensure a straight fold, then crease from the center outwards.With the paper folded closed, you can use your fingers to set the crease by pushing directly down it with your fingers.
Pick the folded paper up and look at it's profile from the side view, ensuring that the decorative side is downwards. Note the “V” shape in the fold. This is called a “valley fold.”

, You want to do a second “hamburger fold.” That is, you want it to be short and wide, like a hamburger bun (versus the long and slim, hot dog fold.) Fold the left side of the paper onto the right side, align the corners and crease from the center for an even valley fold, then open the fold again. Now you will have a sharp vertical crease in the center., You want to make two vertical flaps meeting at the center, not overlapping. This is called a ""gate fold."" Think of it as two closing doors meeting in the middle, like a gate., Fold the two vertical edges in twice more, or until you have two inward-folding flaps about 1 cm or 0.5 inch wide. The sides will be folded over themselves, making two slim flaps. Make sure your folds are straight with sharp creases at each step.

, Be gentle while unfolding to prevent tearing your hard work. Now you will have several vertical creases. Each crease should be approximately 1 cm in width. Do not unfold the horizontal fold from step two.

, The fold from step two will be running vertically on the left. Now the creases that were previously vertical are horizontal.


Depending on which hand is your dominant, it may feel more comfortable to have your thick vertical fold on the right. Try laying your paper with the fold on each side, and see what feels most comfortable for the upcoming steps.

, Starting from the bottom, fold the horizontal edge upwards. From a side profile, the fold should maintain a “V” shape. Don't forget to keep your edges lined up to create an accurate, tidy fold.

, Hold your previous fold and crease underneath the paper. There will be decorative paper on decorative paper in this fold. This is called a ""mountain fold.” From the side profile, the peak of the mountain will be at the top, opposite to the downwards “V” fold.From the bottom of the paper there should be first a valley fold, and above that will be a mountain fold.

, Fold a valley, then a mountain, and repeat. This series of folds resembles an accordion. You will immediately start to see a pattern in your folding.If you make a mistake, be patient and keep trying. It may seem overwhelming at first, but the process will seem easy after the first few tries.

, A suitable length is approximately 15 cm which the length of the original paper before folding. When it comes to choosing the string for the handle, you can pick yarn, string, cord, or anything similar. Pick a color to complement your fan but don't let traditional color pallets limit you. Get your creative juices flowing.

, When looking at your fan, the handle will be the portion that does not contain the horizontal fold. Choose the length of the handle you want by holding different locations and seeing whats comfortable. While pinching the bottom of the fan, wind the yarn, thread or cord around it several times. Tie a knot and cut away the excess after you have tied the knot off. If you feel your fan is too large, the bottom, unfolded edge can be trimmed off in a straight line. Do this by tying your handle further up than desired, and trimming off the excess bottom piece below the yarn or string. like.
When it comes to tying the string, a shoelace bow gives a simple but cute touch. If you're looking for something more hearty, try double knotting it by tying the loops of your knot into each other a second time.
You can decorate your handle as well. Tie on beads, charms or feathers to add dimension to simple yarn or cord.

, Now that you know how easy it is, you can make several more.


If you want to alter your fan, simply unwrap the handle and unfold. After your mountain and valley folds are present you may want to do extra decorating within the folds, such as glitter glue or stickers. When you reassemble your fan, it will fit together easily as the folds have already been creased.

Finished.",How to Make Paper Curls3," Larger hearts require thicker, longer strips of paper, whereas smaller, delicate hearts will come from thinner, shorter strips.


Avoid using construction paper for this project, as it is too heavy and won’t curl properly.

, No template is needed for this project––each heart is created from a strip of the quilling paper. Just make sure that you have an even measurement/edge on each strip. Note that a symmetrical heart has an equal width on each strip.

, Each heart should be created the same way, using your pencil and clean fingers.


Fold the paper strip in half. Make sure that the ends meet up evenly and you have a firm crease in the middle of the paper strip.
Place your pencil or pen side along the top of one of the paper strips. Hold the paper strip firmly next to the pencil.
Wind the pencil and paper downward toward the center crease of the paper. Wind halfway down the middle of the folded paper strip and then slowly remove the pencil.

, Begin rolling the paper from the bottom right corner, and finish rolling at the top left corner. When you reach the taped part, simply roll right over it. Try to roll the paper so that one end is slightly wider than the other. The wider end will be the bottom of your wand.Plan on having one end come to a sharp point and the other end to a ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) opening., Coat the inside of top left corner with liquid glue. Smooth it back down onto the wand. Secure it with a piece of tape or a clip until the glue dries. Once the glue dries, remove the tape or clip.You can also secure the corner with a piece of double-sided tape instead of gluing it.

, You can do this with a sharp pair of scissors.If the ends get crushed, you can fill them back out with a skinny skewer or knitting needle., Squeeze some hot glue into the tip of your wand. Wait for it to set, then repeat for the bottom. If you need to, stuff the inside of the wand with some rolled up tissue. This way, you won't have to use as much glue. Try to make the glue as smooth as possible.For a fancier wand, stick a fancy button or gem into the hot glue before it sets. Do this for the bottom/wider end of the wand only., Coat the bottom 3 to 4 inches (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters) of your wand with hot glue. You can coat the handle with a thick, even layer of hot glue for a neat wand, or you can use messy, vertical lines to make a more rustic wand, like Harry's. You can even create dots, specks, or swirls.For a fancier wand, stick fancy buttons or charms into the glue before it sets.
Not all wands have a handle. The most notable is Hermione Granger's wand.
Look at pictures of wands from the movies to get ideas.

, Squeeze some hot glue around the rest of the wand in a spiral. Start at the top of the handle and finish at the tip. You can even go back down the other way to make a lattice or crisscross pattern.You can also glue other items to the body to create texture, such as charms or sequins. Keep in mind that you will be painting over this.

, This is not absolutely necessary, but it will help give you a smoother base for the actual paint. Coat the wand with paint primer. Let it dry, then paint the other side.If you added a fancy charm to the bottom of the wand, you can leave it as it is or coat it with primer.

, To get a wood grain effect, go over the wand with a lighter shade while the paint is still wet. Do this using a stiffer bristle brush, starting from the bottom of the wand and finishing at the tip. Let the wand dry before moving on.

Most of the wands in the films were brown, but you can use another color as well, such as: black, tan, white, grey, or green.
If you added an embellishment to the bottom of your wand, you can leave it blank, or your can paint over it.

, Use a brush to apply the paint to the handle of your want, then quickly wipe it off with a damp paper towel. You can weather the rest of the wand in a similar fashion, but only work a few inches at a time.Don't paint the entire wand, or the paint will dry too fast.
Use a thin brush or a q-tip and watered down black paint to fill in any gaps, creases, or corners., Mix up a lighter shade of the base color you used for your wand. Dilute it with some water, then use a thin brush to apply it to some of the raised areas on your design. Don't get too carried away, however; you only need a little dab here and there., Use your finger, a q-tip, or a paper towel to apply gold or silver rubbing wax (ie: Rub n' Buff) to the raised areas of your wand.Gold will work the best for brownish wands, while silver will work better for white or grey wands.

You don't have to do this, but it can give your wand a nice, magical touch.

, You can use the spray-on kind or the brush on kind. Do one side first, let it dry, then spray the other side. Depending on the type of sealer you are using, you may need one to two more coats. You can use a matter, glossy, or satin finish for your wand."

When you are halfway across the sheet of paper, pause, and coat the edges of the paper with glue. You don't have to do this, but it will make the wand sturdier.Liquid glue will work the best, but a glue stick or double-sided tape may also work.
If you don't have time to roll paper into a wand, you can use a paper straw for the wand base instead., Coat the upper right corner of the paper with more glue, then smooth the corner down onto the wand. Secure the corner with tape or a clip until the glue dries. Once the glue dries, remove the tape/clip.You can also secure the corner with a strip of double-sided tape instead.

, Use a sharp pair of scissors to do this. If the scissors crush the wand, you can push it back into shape by poking a skewer or knitting needle into it., You don't have to do this, but it will make your wand look more interesting. You can paint it with acrylic paint or with spray paint. Paint one side first, let it dry, then paint the other side.To make the paint last longer, consider coating the want with sealer. You can use the spray-on or the brush-on kind.

, Place a drop of glue at the end of the ribbon, then press the ribbon against the tip of the wand. Wrap the ribbon tightly around the wand in a spiral, like on a candy cane. When you reach the end of the wand, cut off the excess ribbon, then glue the end down.You can make the stripes as far apart or as close together as you want.

Your ribbon can be as thick or as thin as you want it to be. Something between ¼ and ½ inch (6 and 13 millimeters) wide would work the best.You can also use colored or patterned washi tape instead of ribbon.For something different, decorate the handle with glitter glue inside. Let the glue dry before moving on.

, You don't have to do this, but it will give your wand a nice touch. It will also help cover the hole at the bottom of the wand. If you don't have any rhinestones, you can use a pretty button, charm, or glass gem instead. Choose a small one that is the same width as the bottom of the wand., Cut several strips of thin ribbon that are at least half the length of your wand. Something between ⅛ and ¼ inch (3.5 and 6 millimeters) wide would work the best. Line the ribbons up along a strip of tape, then wrap the tape around the tip of your wand. Make sure that the ribbons are hanging down the length of the wand and not sticking out of the top.

Try sheer and/or metallic ribbon for a magical touch.
Avoid making the ribbons longer than your wand, or they may get tangled.
You can use curling ribbon. Be sure to curl them with scissors first.

, Use a cookie cutter or a stencil to trace two identical shapes onto a sheet of cardstock. Cut the shapes out with a sharp pair of scissors when you are done. Hearts and stars are great choices, but you can use another shape too.

If you can't find any cardstock, you can use poster paper, a folder, or even thin cardboard.
If you are using thin cardboard, use a craft blade to cut the shapes out instead.

, Unless you already like the color of your cardstock, you will need to paint it. You can use acrylic paint, poster paint, or even spray paint. You only need to paint one side of each shape. The other side will eventually be on the inside of the wand.

To make the wand last longer, seal the shapes with a clear sealer.

, Here is where you can let your imagination run wild. Outline the shapes with glitter glue. Hot glue a pretty rhinestone in the middle of the shape. Add some sequins in the corners. The possibilities are endless! You can decorate your shapes as much or as little as possible.

You can make them match or you can make them different.
Go with a theme. For a mermaid wand, add some seashells!

, Turn the first shape so that the back, plain side is facing you. Draw a vertical line of glue down the center, starting from the middle and finishing at the bottom. Press the tip of the wand into the glue. The wand needs to be halfway inside the shape., Coat the tip of the dowel with more glue. Next, draw a thin line of glue around the edges of the first shape. Quickly press the second shape on top. Make sure that the decorated part is sticking out, and the edges line up with the first shape., Use paper clips, clothespins, or binder clips to hold the edges of the shapes together. If any glue leaks out from under the shapes, quickly wipe it away with a damp cloth. Once the glue dries, you can pull the clips off.You don't need to secure the shapes in the middle where the dowel is. Doing so may create an unsightly bump.

Just trace the outline of what your feet look like. The two feet will be glued together to form the turkey's body.Trace both your left and right foot.

You can create the turkey body out of any color you want, but brown is the most commonly used and will resemble the look of a turkey the most.;
, Use whatever colors you like the best, and use a pencil or pen to trace around your fingers. Repeat this process on different colored paper to create all of the feathers for your turkey.You can use one or both hands for this step.

Trace in between your fingers and around your thumb.

, Cut around the trace of your hands and feet and set the pieces to the side as you move onto the next one. Be careful when cutting and use child safe scissors if you are younger., Line up both of your cutouts so that your heels overlap each other, but so that the toes of your cutout go out at a 30-degree angle. This should make it look like a single cutout with one neck and head, and two bumps that represent the turkey's stomach.

You can use liquid glue or a glue stick.

, Arrange the hands behind the turkey to get a feeling for what it will look like once it's done. Stack your traced out hands on an angle and glue them together so that the feathers look like they are spread out. Once your hands are glued together, take them and glue them to the back of your turkey's body.Center the hands on the back of your turkey's body, so that they come rising from behind your turkey's head or the heel of your cutout., Use orange and red construction paper. You can either create an outline for these features and then cut them out, or you can just cut out a triangle and round teardrop free hand.

Use orange construction paper to create the beak for your turkey.
Use red construction paper for the wattle of the turkey.

, You can purchase googly eyes at most arts and craft or department stores. If you don't have googly eyes, you can draw eyes onto the top of your turkey's body to emulate them., Glue the rest of your pieces onto the turkey's face. If you've run out of construction paper for the turkey's features, you can draw them on with a pencil or pen. The beak should be pasted under the eyes, and the wattle should go right under the beak. Once the glue dries, your project is finished."

Gather the appropriate materials.,
Wash out a plastic bottle.,
Cut out the coin slot.,
Attach the legs.,
Make it pink.,
Decorate your pig.,
Put your plastic bottle piggy bank into action.",How to Make a Piggy Bank1," For a plastic bottle piggy bank, there are lots of things you'll need to transform a bottle into a bona fide piggy bank. These supplies can all be bought from your local arts store. It is likely you'll be able to find some (if not most) of the supplies in your house already.


An empty plastic bottle. This will be the case of your piggy bank.
A box cutter and scissors, used to cut the pieces.
A hot glue gun, for gluing pieces together. You should always have an adult with you when using hot glue.
A paper egg carton and pipe cleaner.
Decoration supplies. It's recommended you use markers, acrylic paint and googly eyes, although other things like construction paper and pink spray paint will help get the best pig-like appearance.;
, There's no set limit to how big or small your piggy bank should be. You should, however, aim for a plastic bottle that's between 500-1000ml. Wash it out with water. Dry it afterwards by catching the excess water with some paper towel.Keep the bottle cap on the bottle. It will serve as the pig’s snout., Get an adult to slice a coin slot into the middle of one of the long sides using a box cutter.If you're not sure whether the hole is big enough, try sliding coins in. If they don't fit, you know you have to make them bigger. A coin slot will need to be at least 1 inch long to fit a standard US quarter. The size of your slot should depend on the biggest coin you're planning on fitting into it.

, Cut out four sections from paper egg carton to use as legs using scissors. Have an adult use a low-heat hot glue gun to attach them to the side of the bottle opposite the coin slot you cut, so that when the pig stands on them the slot faces up. The open side of the carton should face into the bottle. That way, the pig's legs will look solid.

, This step is optional, as a piggy bank can have a certain homemade charm if left as is. Many normal arts and crafts supplies, like markers and tempera or acrylic paint, will adhere poorly to the plastic bottle. You do have a few other options, though:


Spray paint the legs and body pink. Remember, always use spray paint in a well-ventilated, outdoor area.
Collage over it with tissue paper and an acrylic decoupage medium (you’ll find it in the glue section of any arts and crafts supply store). Apply a thin layer of decoupage medium onto a small section of the water bottle with a paintbrush, lay a piece of tissue paper on top of it, and brush another thin layer of medium on top of that. Keep going until the whole thing is covered.
Wrap the bottle with felt or construction paper, and paint the cardboard feet pink with tempera or acrylic paint., Now that you’ve got a basic pig shape, it’s time to get artistic with your creation. Adding many of these touches will require a hot glue gun, so it is advised you have an adult around to help you with these parts:Make a tail by twisting a pink pipe cleaner into a spiral and having an adult help you hot glue it to the pig’s bottom (opposite the face end.)
Give the pig eyes by hot gluing googly eyes onto its face, or by drawing, cutting out, and gluing on your own eyes.
Draw nostrils onto the pig’s snout with a black marker.
Cut two triangles out of pink paper or felt, and glue them on as ears.

, Now that you've got the finished product, put it somewhere in your room and deposit coins whenever you come into pocket money. Although plastic bottle piggy banks don't come with a natural opening slot, small coins can fit out by unscrewing the bottle cap. You can withdraw coins once the piggy bank is full by taking a box cutter to the back of the bottle and pouring out the coins. The hind section can always be re-taped if you want to keep using it.

"
Get a piece of paper that is approximately 17 inches tall and 18 inches wide.,
Fold your piece of paper to create a pocket.,
Fold the short sides of the paper in half and then crease it.,
Staple or glue the edges to finish the pockets.,
Decorate the cover as you please.,
Put documents inside your new folder!",How to Make Folders1," You should be able to find one at your local art supply store.


If you have a piece of paper that is larger than 17 by 18 inches, simply cut it down to size.
Construction paper works well for making a folder. You can also use a stronger type of paper, such as a thin cardboard or poster board, if you would like the folder to be more durable.
If you don't have any paper that big, you can simply tape pieces of paper together to make one that is the right size.;
, Place one of the short sides closest to you and the longer sides running up away from you. Fold the bottom 6 inches up and make a crease along the fold. Make sure to fold it so that the longer sides are folded but the shorter sides stay the same length.

, Be sure to fold the paper right down the middle.


Fold the paper so that the previous fold is concealed inside. This will make the pockets on the inside, instead of the outside.

, You will only need to attach together the outside edges that have two layers of paper, where the long sides were folded up, and the center crease, where there are two layers of paper due to the pocket flap. This will finish the pockets on the inside of your folder.


Remember to to do this step on both flaps of the folder.

, Personalize it with decorative flair or simply write a description of what you will keep in it, so that you know without having to look inside it every time.

, Now your important papers are safe and sound in your very own homemade folder.

Paint the bottom of your foot brown and your toes orange.,
Plant your foot onto a white piece of paper.,
Paint your hand red and plant it onto a separate piece of white paper.,
Paint your hand orange then yellow and layer it over your red handprint.,
Cut out a red piece of construction paper to form the turkey's wattle.,
Cut out an orange triangle to form the turkey's beak.,
Draw eyes on the heel of your footprint.,
Glue on the rest of your turkey's pieces.,
Cut out the handprints.,
Glue or tape your feathers to the side of your footprint.",How to Make Footprint and Handprint Turkeys2," The imprint of your foot will act as the body and feet of the turkey. Paint your foot brown using a brush or your fingers. You can buy finger paint at most art stores.Read how to fingerpaint for more ideas on finger painting.
Spread out a tarp or tablecloth to prevent paint from getting on your furniture or floor., After you put your foot on the paper, the paint should form an image that somewhat resembles a turkey's body. Once you are done planting your foot on the paper, wipe it down with a rag or clean-wipe, so you don't make a mess., These handprints will make up your turkey's wings and feathers. You will repeat this step with different colors to create a full set of feathers for your turkey.

You can also replace your handprints with feathers to emulate the turkey's wings and feathers., Plant your hand down over the red handprint. Put your hand at an angle, so it looks like the handprint has 8 to 10 fingers.Clean off your hand and repeat the process using yellow.

Feel free to get creative and layer your handprints however you want if you don't like the way it looks.
Use one hand when fingerpainting so your other hand is clean and free to touch other things.

, The wattle is the red piece of skin that hangs from the turkey's neck. It's one of the things that distinguishes the turkey from other birds.The wattle should look like a red tear drop., Use an orange piece of construction paper to cut out the turkey's beak. You can either do this freehand or use a pencil to outline the beak and then cut it out with scissors., Draw eyes near the heel of the brown imprint of your foot to represent the turkey's eyes. You can also paste on googly eyes if you want to give your bird a sillier feeling.

If you aren't artistically inclined, two black circles made with marker is good enough.Make sure that your footprint paint has fully dried before drawing anything on it.

, Glue the beak under the eyes and the wattle. The wattle sits under the turkey's beak. This will complete your turkey's face. You can add other features like a smile or eyeglasses if you want a goofier looking turkey., Wait until your handprints are dry before cutting them out. Cut around the outside of the print using scissors. It's okay to leave a little bit of a white outline around your paint., Tape or glue your handprints behind the turkey's body. If laminating your turkey, you can position the pieces the way that you want them and run it through the laminator instead of gluing them together.Center the handprints behind the turkey so that they look like they are rising behind the heel of your cutout. This completes your turkey project."

Trace an outline of your hand.,
Draw on the eyes and beak of your bird.,
Color in the body of your bird.",How to Make Footprint and Handprint Turkeys3," Trace around your hand's fingers and thumb. The thumb will be the face of your turkey, the hand will represent the body, and your fingers will represent its feathers. You can use any color of pencil you want for the outline, but make sure that the color stands out so people can see it.

If you use regular computer paper, your final product may be flimsy or fragile. Instead of using regular paper, consider using cardstock or white construction paper.
Good colors for the outline of your turkey include dark blue or black colored pencils.

, Draw a small triangle on the end of your thumb, to resemble the beak of the bird. You can also draw a wattle, which looks like a red tear drop under the beak. Draw a circle with a black dot in the middle to represent your turkey's eye.The beak of the bird should be orange, while the wattle is usually red.

, Use a brown or yellow colored pencil to color in the body of the bird. If you want to make colorful wings, choose different colored pencils. Use brighter colors like green, red, yellow and orange to make the colors pop. To make your bird's feathers look realistic, use quick strokes. Once you're done coloring the turkey, you're done with the project.You can glue candy corn to your fingers to give your feathers a more colorful look.You can also draw feet onto the bird with yellow colored pencils.

Gather your materials.,
Draw a pig’s head on pink cardstock.,
Make a cardstock base.,
Attach the base.,
Decorate the toilet paper roll.,
Attach the cardstock head.,
Cut a coin slot.,
Start saving money.",How to Make a Piggy Bank2," Toilet roll piggy banks are arguably the simplest design for homemade piggy banks. They're a good place to start if you're not used to crafts projects. Possibly barring a glue gun, most of the supplies you'll need should be found at home. If you find something that's close enough to one of the listed items, it should be fine.


A toilet paper roll. Save a roll once a given set of toilet paper has run out. If there isn't anything around yet, you might find a roll in the bathroom garbage can.
Pink cardstock. Cardstock is thicker and more durable than regular paper. You can usually find it at an arts store.
Scissors and a box cutter, for cutting out pieces and coin slot.
A low-heat hot glue gun and glue. Remember, you should always have an adult with you to help with hot glue.
You can use a bottle cap for the nose if you want, but this is optional.
Decorating supplies. Markers, felt, constructive paper and collage materials are all fair game when it comes to making a toilet roll piggy bank.

, The head makes a nice decoration, and also keeps coins from falling out of one end. The head shouldn't be much wider than the toilet roll. It will be glued onto a toilet paper roll body, so Don’t just make the outline of a pig’s head—give it eyes, a snout, a mouth, ears, and whatever else you think a pig should have. When you’re happy with your drawing, cut it out.If you’re unsure about the size, just hold it up to the toilet paper roll and see how it looks.
If you want to use another fun recycled object, you could ask an adult to attach a bottle cap as the pig’s snout using a hot glue gun. Add a couple of nostrils with a felt-tipped marker. If not, feel free to just draw the snout onto the cardstock.

, Take another piece of cardstock and stand the toilet roll on top of it. Trace around the toilet roll. Once you have a pencil circle, draw a slighter bigger circle around it. Cut it out. This will be the base of the piggy bank.


You don't need to worry about exact measurements here, but the diameter of the second circle should be bigger by half an inch.

, Work your way around the edge of the circle, cutting small lines that go from the outer edge to the smaller circle inside, that you traced from the toilet paper roll. Make a cut every centimeter or so. You should end up with a series of tabs. Fold all the tabs in toward the center of the circle. They will give you a way to securely attach the base to the toilet paper roll. Stand the roll in the middle of the circle. One by one, have an adult put a dot of hot glue on each tab, and press them to the side of the tube. Before you go any further, make sure the base is firm.


To be extra sure the base is well attached, you can wind a piece of tape around these tabs to be sure they don’t come unglued.

, You can do this with whatever supplies you have on hand that seem fun: markers, paint, collage materials, crayons, or felt would all work well.Since you’re making a pig, pink would be the most obvious choice of color. However, you should do whatever you feel suits your style.Once there is some money in the piggy bank it will stand up on its own with no problem, but if you want it to stand up while empty you can attach a couple feet for balance. Just cut a couple triangles out of cardstock and glue them to the bottom of the base.

, Using a hot glue gun, glue the head to the end of the piggy bank opposing the base. This can be done by dabbing a thin line of glue around the roll's perimeter, and setting the cardstock down firmly. Give it a couple of minutes to settle before you move on.Gluing a pair of feet to the bottom of the head can be good if you really want it to look like a pig.

, Lastly, with a box cutter, you should make a coin-sized hole at the top of the piggy bank. Make it just big enough so that coins can fit through. If you need to test the coin slot to make sure it's big enough, try fitting a coin through. If it doesn't fit, it means you need to make it bigger.


It is recommended you get an adult to help you with the box cutter, as they are very sharp.

, Even something like a toilet roll piggy bank can stand for a great savings plan. Saving money is a very adult thing to do, and if you make a habit of saving money, you'll be rich before long. Put your piggy bank somewhere you'll see it all the time and add coins whenever you get some pocket money.


When it comes time to retrieving your money, toilet roll piggy banks can be saved. Although they don't hold many coins, you can withdraw your money by taking off the head and pouring out your coins. If this ends up destroying the head, making a new head is at least a lot easier than starting the piggy bank from scratch.

Get the right supplies.,
Mix flour glue.,
Prepare the paper.,
Get the balloon ready.,
Papier-mâché the balloon.,
Let it sit.,
Slice out a coin slot.,
Attach legs and a nose.,
Make it pink.,
Decorate your piggy bank.,
Enjoy your finished product.",How to Make a Piggy Bank3," You'll need flour, water, a pot to mix paste in, newspaper/brown paper bags/butcher paper, a balloon, a paper egg carton, a box cutter, a and glue, stuff to decorate with (tempera or acrylic paint, tissue paper, acrylic decoupage medium, spray paint, markers, etc.), a pipe cleaner, googly eyes (optional), a marker, and scissors.


Flour, water and a cooking pot. These usually found in a well-stocked kitchen. You shouldn't need too much flour to make it work. Set aside a few cups, and put back whatever you don't use.
Paper. Newspaper and brown paper bags are usually the best. You want the sort of paper that is naturally absorbent.
A low-heat hot glue gun. As always, remember always to have an adult present when you use a hot glue gun.
Googly eyes, a pipe cleaner and a paper egg carton, for the pig's decorative pieces.
A balloon, for the piggy bank's frame.
A box cutter, to make the coin slot.
Decorating supplies. You could use anything from paint (spray or acrylic) to markers for this type of piggy bank. Paint is recommended, as the colours will stand out more. Acrylic decoupage is useful for gluing stuff like construction paper once the frame is done.

, Whisk together 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of water thoroughly in a small bowl. Boil 4 cups of water on the stove, and stir the flour and water mixture into it. Let it simmer for about 3 minutes, and then let it cool. Ask an adult to help you use the stove.You can purchase mixable papier-mâché paste at arts and crafts supply stores, but it’s easy to make your own at home.

, Get at least a full newspaper, along with brown paper bags, or butcher paper. Crumple it up into tight balls, uncrumple it, crumple it again, and then uncrumple it once more. This helps the glue soak into the paper more thoroughly. Once that's done, tear the paper into 1 inch squares.You will need a fair amount of it for this project, so prepare more than you think you'll need.

, Blow a balloon up to whatever size you want the body of your piggy bank to be. It doesn’t matter what color the balloon is, as it’s just providing a structure to papier-mâché on top of, and won’t actually be visible. Tie the balloon off when it reaches your desired size.

, Wet the pieces of paper with the flour paste you mixed earlier, and apply them to the pig. Get just enough paste on the paper to have it stick, but not so much that it's dripping. Smooth the paper onto the pig as you apply it, and try to cover the space evenly. Altogether, you'll need to do three layers, although you should use your own judgment if you don't think that's enough.


Your piggy bank will be stronger if you allow each layer to dry before adding another, but this is not strictly necessary., Your piggy bank will probably need at least a couple days to dry thoroughly.Put it in a well-lit, well-ventilated area to speed up the process. Once it's ready, you'll finally be able to decorate it.

, Have an adult use a box cutter to slice a coin slot in the pig’s bag. If you're not sure whether the coin slot is big enough, try putting a bigger coin in the slot. If it doesn't fit, that means you should cut a bigger slot. You should also be able to use this hole to pull the balloon out from the inside of the piggy bank.A coin slot will need to be at least 1 inch long to fit a standard US quarter. The size of your slot should depend on the biggest coin you're planning on fitting into it. Because papier-mâché can be delicate, it's recommended you measure out your cut before you commit to it.

, Cut out five sections from a paper egg carton. You will use these to create the pig’s legs and nose. Have an adult use a low-heat hot glue gun to attach them to the appropriate places on the balloon.The open sides of the carton ""legs"" should face into the piggy bank. That way, they can be painted after.

, The simplest way to do this is to paint it with tempera or acrylic paint. You could also use markers, spray paint, or tissue paper. To collage tissue paper and an acrylic decoupage medium, start by applying a thin layer of decoupage medium onto a small section of the water bottle with a paintbrush.Lay a piece of tissue paper on top of it, and brush another thin layer of medium on top of that. Keep going until the whole thing is covered.

, Decorating your piggy bank should be a creative exercise. You should decorate it however you want. However, for a truly pig-like appearance, you can add the pig's other body parts:


Make a tail by twisting a pink pipe cleaner into a spiral and having an adult help you hot glue it to the pig’s bottom.
Give the pig eyes by gluing googly eyes onto its face, or by drawing, cutting out, and gluing on your own eyes.
Draw nostrils onto the pig’s snout with a black marker.
Cut two triangles out of pink paper or felt, and glue them on as ears.

, This sort of piggy bank arguably takes more time and patience than the other designs, but it can look fantastic if you put the time into properly decorating it.


This sort of piggy bank can be difficult to withdraw from. Because the material is solid, you'll have to take a box cutter and cut a hole out from the top. It's recommended you cut a hole around the coin slot. If you want, you can tape the opening shut and re-tape it when it comes time to withdraw again.

Make some more, and arrange them in a bunch.",How to Make Coffee Filter Flowers," You'll want the white kind that fold totally flat, not the kind that are glued together. These are pretty inexpensive and can be ordered in bulk from outlets like Amazon. Just make sure they're the flat-bottomed variety, and - at the risk of stating the obvious - don't try crafting with any filters that have already been used.


You'll need six filters per flower, and six or seven flowers make a good medium-sized bunch or bouquet, so do the math and get as big a pack as you need, plus some extras for experimenting with your dyes and techniques.

, If you want plain old white flowers, skip this section. You can choose how to dye them, depending on how you want them to look; it's worth experimenting with different kinds of dye, colors, and strengths of your mix. Paint (watercolor or watered-down acrylic paints), food coloring, and even tea can work well, and each of them will give you a different effect.
, You're going to be working with a dye of some kind, so put down some newspaper or use an area that you don't mind getting messy. Food coloring in particular can stain your hands and clothes, so be prepared to get a little dirty!

You'll need a small actual work area (enough room for a bowl), but more importantly, you'll need enough room to let your filters air dry. If you're planning on making a lot of flowers, lay out some newspaper or wax paper, or a set of trays or cutting boards, enough to accommodate several stacks of coffee filters, side by side.

, How much you use will depend on the kind of dye. For food coloring, you probably only need 5-10 drops, but with paint, you want a good dollop. Aim for somewhere between the quantity of toothpaste you'd put on a toothbrush and the amount of cream cheese you'd put on a bagel.


There's no real science to it; just add a little at a time, stirring and mixing as you go, until your color is evenly distributed in the water.
To get an idea of how dark or vibrant the color will actually be on the filter, you just have to try it out. Then you can add more water or more color to change the outcome, as desired.

, You can dye several filters at a time without any negative effect, so grab somewhere between five and ten in a stack, fold the whole stack in quarters (just for ease of handling), and stick the outer edge in the water. There's no need to immerse them completely, because the filters are very absorbent; they'll suck up the color.


Try experimenting with how much dye you apply to each one. You might want some of the filters to just have dyed edges or be half colored, and others to be fully colored. Similarly, you might want to do some with a mixture that has a lot of color in it, and others with a more watered-down variation.
Dye filters in various shades. Flowers with slightly darker centers or outer edges can look pretty neat!

, The coffee filters are, obviously, covered in paint or food coloring and wet, so you need to leave them to dry. This might take longer than you think; ideally, leave them overnight. Make sure they're on some newspaper, wax paper, or another surface you don't mind getting stained.

If you really want to accelerate the process, you can try using a hair dryer to dry them out; it does work, but it can also cause the paper to curl up and change a little in texture, so keep an eye out for any unintended consequences if you try this.

, Stack them and fold the whole stack into quarters (fold them in half, and then in half again).

, This will help the final craft look more like a flower. The edge you're cutting shouldn't be too far from the filter's original edge (assuming you want a flower that's about the size of the original filters). In other words, don't cut too much off; just enough to create a neat edge

.

There's lots of room for experimentation here; try some filters with deeper or shallower curves, some with more or fewer petals, etc. If you're not sure where to begin, start with three to four curves on each quarter side of filter, about half an inch in height.

, Stack them and again, fold the whole stack into quarters., You want the center three filters to be a bit smaller than the outer ones, so cut a little closer to the center angle of the folded stack (maybe 0.25 - 0.5 inch away from the outer edge).

Try to keep your ""petal"" size and shape - that is, your scalloped edge - fairly similar to what you cut the first time, for consistency. You want this stack of filters to be a little smaller than the first one, but generally similar in design.

, You don't need them folded anymore; open them up and smooth them out, before stacking them. The smaller set go on top, the larger underneath.

You might want to separate and rotate the individual filters a little, so that the petals don't perfectly align.

, This part can be tricky the first time, but you'll get used to it. Don't worry about getting the ""petals"" looking perfect at this stage; you just need to secure the center of the flowers. Once you have the center of all six filters held tight, secure the pinched bottom with a stapler.

Don't worry about manhandling the filters. Even if they get folded or crushed, the outcome will still look good; in fact, you're going to end up purposefully fluffing and crushing them, later.

Optional alternative: An alternative approach here can result in a more secure flower. This won't work well with pipe cleaners, but if you have a fairly thin wire (like 18-gauge floral wire) for your stems, you can actually poke each filter through it, at the center. Hold the wire firmly and start with the big ones, pushing the wire through each one's center, one by one; then do the small ones. Once all the filters are skewered, use pliers to create a little twist in the wire at the top, like the flower bud's ""core"". Push the filters up against this core, and work them into a cone shape around it.

, Sure, you can just make a flower bud without a stem, but if you have some pipe cleaners or floral wire (and haven't added it already, with the alternative method above) and want to make a ""complete"" flower, then now is the time to add it.

Lay the stem against the pinched bottom of the flower and staple it to the filters. This can get a little finicky if you don't have a good stapler, but it is doable. Practice your angles until you can reliably secure the wire to the filters.

, The staple or wire method are important, but alone they might not hold your flower tightly enough. Get some masking tape, washi tape, or even floral tape (although this variety isn't always very sticky), and wrap it around the base of the flower and stem (if you used one).


If your tape is green, it can actually help your final product look even more like a flower; the tape doesn't end up very visible in the bunch of flowers, so don't be afraid to use enough to secure the flower to the stem.

, How much you ""crush"" and ""fluff"" is up to you, but it looks good even with a fair amount of ""abuse"". Do each petal layer one by one, starting in the center. Separate it from the others and pull it towards the center, crushing it a little in your palm to fluff it up. Then do the next one, and so forth. Don't be afraid to rough them up for a more ""flowery"" look!


To make the flower look a bit more realistic, hold the stem with one hand, and with your other hand gather the top filter and squeeze it together. Now do this with the second filter, and so forth. Once you've done all six layers, fluff them out a bit.

, With six or seven flowers, you can form a nice little bouquet or vase-full, or you can skip adding the stems and use your flowers to decorate a wreath or other household ornament. Get creative!

Trace your plate onto a sheet of poster paper or thin cardboard.,
Trace your smaller plate inside of the larger one.,
Cut out the base for your wreath using a craft blade.,
Paint the wreath base, if needed.",How to Make a Paper Wreath1," You want a 5 to 6-inch (cc to cc-centimeter) difference between them. The finished wreath will be about the same size as the large plate.


You can also use bowls for this instead.;
, Place your large plate upside down onto a sheet of poster paper or thin cardboard. Use a pencil or pen to trace around it. Put the plate away when you are done.

, Place the smaller plate down onto the center of the circle you just drew, and check to see if the thickness of the border suits you. If it is too thin, choose a smaller plate; if it is too thick, choose a bigger plate. Once you are happy with the size, trace around your plate, then put the plate away.

, Start by cutting out the larger circle, then the smaller one. When you are done, discard the inner circle so that you are left with a wreath shape.


Be sure to work on top of a cutting mat so that you don't ruin your table.

, Chances are, the leaves will be covering most of your wreath base. There may be some gaps, but this should not be a problem if the colors of your wreath base and leaves are similar. If your wreath base contrasts sharply with your leaves, however (ie: you used neon green poster paper for your wreath and your leaves are red and orange), then you might want to paint it to make any gaps less noticeable. You can paint the wreath base using acrylic paint and a paintbrush, or you can spray paint it instead.

Draw some leaf shapes onto a sheet of thin cardboard.,
Cut your leaf templates out using a craft blade.,
Use the template to trace leaf shapes onto some paper.,
Cut your leaves out.,
Fold your leaves in half lengthwise, then unfold them, to create a crease.,
Dress up the leaves further, if desired, then let them dry before moving on.",How to Make a Paper Wreath2," If you don't know how to draw, gather some leaves from outside, and trace their shapes instead.You can also find some leaf outlines online, print them out, and glue them to the cardboard. You only need one of each leaf shape.


What shape you use depends on what sort of leaf you are making. For example, holly leaves are perfect for winter, while maple and oak leaves are great for fall.

, Make sure that you cut on top of a cutting mat so that you don't ruin your table. Also, try to be as neat as possible. This is what the rest of your leaves will look like.

, You can use just about any type of paper for this, including old book pages, scrapbooking paper, wrapping paper, and even construction paper.


Consider using some glittered or metallic scrapbooking paper for a few leaves. This will give your wreath a touch of sparkle!
Consider using some accent or contrasting colors. For example, if your wreath has lots of blues, greens, and purples, consider adding some gold or bronze accent colors as well.

, If you using thin paper, you can stack 2 to 3 sheets of paper, and cut through them at the same time. This will save you lots of time.You can use a pair of scissors for this, but a craft blade will give you the most precision.


Keep organized by separating your leaves into piles based on shape.
How many leaves you cut will depend on your design, the size of your leaves, and the size of your wreath base.

, This will give your leaves some dimension and make them look more organic and realistic.Don't fold glittered paper. It is too thick to fold, and the glitter may fall off., Your leaves are ready to go at this point, but you can decorate some of them further to make your wreath look more interesting. Avoid decorating all of your leaves, or all those lovely little details you added will be lost. Choose a few leaves, then consider decorating them further with glitter or paint. Listed below are some ideas to get you started:


Draw veins on some of the leaves with glitter glue. This will make your leaves more interesting to look at. Don't overdo it, however!
Outline some of the edges with glitter glue or a metallic pen for a gilded look.Use a sponge and some distressing ink, watercolor, or watered down paint to lightly shade the edges of your leaves. This will give them a distressed look as well as some texture. Be careful not to overdo it, however!"

Glue down several leaves onto your paper wreath base.,
Start filling in the gaps with more leaves.,
Wait for the glue to set or dry.,
Cut a piece of string long enough to hang your wreath.,
Attach the string to your wreath.,
Hang your wreath from a door or window.",How to Make a Paper Wreath3," You can use tacky glue, a glue stick, or even hot glue. Leave some gaps between the leaves, but glue them down at different angles. Only put the glue to one side of the crease, so that your leaf still sticks up. If you over the entire back of the leaf with glue, it won't be three-dimensional anymore.


Consider starting with your larger, darker-colored leaves. This will lay down the foundation for your wreath, and give you more surface area to work with.If you made any leaves out of gold or sparkly paper, consider gluing those down first., Use smaller and smaller leaves as you go, and don't forget to overlap some of them. Also, try to place different shapes and colors together. This will make your wreath look more realistic and interesting.


If you have scraps of paper left over and some gaps that are too small to fill with leaves, consider cutting some other nature shapes, such as seed pods, pinecones, acorns, and berries. Use these to fill in any tiny gaps.

, How long you wait will depend on what type of glue you used. If you used hot glue, this will only take a few seconds to a few minutes. If you used tacky glue, this could take a few hours.

, How long you cut the string will depend on where you plan on hanging the wreath, and how low you want it to droop down. Choose a string that matches your wreath. For example, if your wreath looks rustic, a piece of yarn or jute cord would look great. If your wreath looks fancy or elegant, consider some satin or velvet ribbon instead.

, There are lots of ways you can do this, and it all depends on what sort of look you want in the end. For example:


If your wreath is thin, simply bring one end of the string through the center hole of the wreath, then tie both ends together to create a loop.
If your wreath is thick, turn the wreath over, then hot glue both ends of the string to the back of the wreath; keep the ends a few inches/centimeters apart.

, Because this wreath is made out of paper, it would not be a good idea to hang it over a fireplace mantle. Also, if it snows or rains a lot where you live, remember to take the wreath inside, or the paper will warp.

Plan the bouquet lightly in pencil.,

Use a green color pencil to draw in the stems and any leaves you'd like.,

Poke holes at the top and bottom of each spot where you'll put a flower.,

Thread a needle with the ribbon.
,

Come up through one of the holes where you want to place a flower.,

Bring the needle down through the other end of the same flower.
,

Adjust the stitches as needed.,

Repeat the stitch for as many flowers as you wish to create.,

Tie off the ribbon on the back side.,
Attach a bow to the spot where the stems intersect (optional).,

Tape or glue a piece of card over the back of the embroidery to cover the messy back of the work.
,

Write anything you want in the card and give it or send it to your recipient.
",How to Make a Bouquet Card With Ribbon,"

Flower stems can cross. Don't be afraid to put stems behind flowers.
Try to take up the space of about two thirds of the front of the card, however large it is.
Make the total height of each flower bud about the same as the width of the ribbon.
Pencil lightly so that you can erase it if you change your mind, or make a mistake.;
, The stems can just be curvy lines, and the leaves can simply flow off the stems. Again, don't be afraid to go right over a spot where you'll put a flower later., You can use a straight pin or the needle you'll use to embroider the card, or both.,, There is no need to tie a knot on the back side; just catch the end of the ribbon with your finger.,, Leave them a bit loose so that the ribbon puffs on the front of the card., You can allow the ribbon to twist if you wish.

Get a picture frame.,
Get decoupage glue and acrylic primer or paint.,
Prime your frame.",How to Make a Decoupage Frame1," You can find these at craft stores. You can also find cheap picture frames at dollar stores. If you are making party favors or gifts, packs of small picture frames can be found at big box stores.


Decoupage glue does not work on all plastic, so get a wood frame to be safe.
You can decoupage on ornate, molded frames as well.This may take some more time, but the results are stunning.;
, These can be found in craft stores in the paint section. You do not need to buy expensive paint, any cheap white paint will do. Mod Podge is the most famous decoupage glue, so mention the name to a store clerk if you are having trouble finding the glue.

, Cover your frame with acrylic primer or acrylic paint. You should only need one coat, enough to cover the wood, but not to completely drown out all the wood grain.


You can use a regular flat bristle brush for this.

Find a tray big enough to fit your paper.,
Brew a pot of strong coffee.,
Pour the coffee into a tray or tub.,
Submerge your paper into the coffee.,
Let the paper soak for about 5 to 10 minutes.,
Lift the paper out of the coffee.,
Dry the paper.,
Allow the paper to cool before using it.",How to Make Coffee Stained Paper1," You can also use a baking pan, a rimmed baking sheet, a plastic tub, or even a plastic lid. The tray needs to be deep enough so that you can fill it with coffee and submerge your paper.;
, The stronger your coffee is, the darker your paper will turn out. How much coffee you make depends on how big your paper and tray are. You need enough coffee to fill your tray.


You can also use cold, leftover coffee., You want it to be deep enough so that you can submerge your paper. Somewhere around ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) deep would be ideal.








, Set your paper into the tray and press down on it with your hands. If the coffee is hot, or if you don't want to get your hands dirty, gently paint the paper with a paintbrush until it sinks to the bottom of the tray.







, The longer you soak the paper, the darker it will become.For extra texture, sprinkle some coffee grounds on top of the paper. This will give you some dark, age spots or speckles., Use both hands to lift the paper out of the coffee by one end. Hold the paper over the tray, and let the excess coffee drip out. Be very careful during this step; wet paper is fragile.







, There are two ways you can do this: baking it or with a hairdryer. Baking the paper will give you more texture and a darker color. Blow drying it will give you a smoother texture and a lighter color. Here are the two ways you can dry your paper:








To bake your paper: set it down on a clean baking sheet, then bake it in a preheated oven at 200°F (94°C) for 5 to 10 minutes.
To blow dry you paper: set it down on a waterproof tablecloth, then blow dry it. Flip it over onto a dry part of the tablecloth, then blow dry it some more. Blot any excess coffee with a paper towel.

, Once the paper is dry, remove it from the baking sheet or tablecloth. Set it down someplace where it won't be disturbed for a few minutes so that it can cool off.

Trace your frame onto wrapping paper.,
Moisten your paper using a spray bottle.,
Apply glue.,
Sand the edges of the frame.",How to Make a Decoupage Frame2," Trace the whole frame (including the window!) onto the back of wrapping paper or other patterned paper. Cut the paper out along your traced lines. You should have a reproduction of the outside of your frame made in wrapping paper.


You can also simply cut around your frame; however, this can look sloppy unless you have a very steady hand.

, If you are using thick wrapping paper, you can brush water on lightly. , Paint the glue in a thick, even layer on the frame. Then lay the paper on, starting from a corner and moving outward to prevent bubbles from appearing.


After your initial application of glue dries, seal the paper with another application of decoupage glue. Use a foam brush to avoid brush strokes, and let it dry.

, This is a good idea if you cover the entire picture frame with a pattern. Sanding the edges of the paper away shows off the wooden frame, and gets rid of any sharp edges or cut lines that make the frame look less professional.


Use a low-grit sandpaper. You won’t need to sand too much; you’re only sanding through paper and glue.

"
"
Rip up napkins, newspaper, or magazine images.,
Apply the decoupage glue.,
Seal the piece.",How to Make a Decoupage Frame3," You can cut out images from magazines, but keep in mind that carefully ripped pieces actually flatten out better with decoupage glue. This may give your frame a more finished, professional look.


Some people like to upcycle pretty party napkins. Decoupage will work best with 2-ply napkins. Trace around designs that you like with a wet artist’s brush, and use the wet lines as perforations to tear out your pieces.
Keep in mind that you will have to glue these pieces later. Don’t make your cutouts so intricate that they will tear when they are being glued.

, Apply the glue to the back of the paper, and then stick the paper to the frame. If you are using very delicate paper, apply glue to the frame, and then apply the paper to the glue.


If you are applying the paper to a frame with molding, you can go over the top of the pieces with a wet artists’ brush and use a stippling motion to better accentuate the molding., Use a foam brush to apply glue to the top of the paper. Foam brushes do not leave brush marks, so they are ideal. You can find these at any craft store or home improvement store.


You can also use a wide brush if you apply the glue in light coats.

Prepare a cup of strong coffee.,
Set the paper down onto a waterproof surface.,
Paint the paper with the coffee.,
Flip the paper over.,
Paint the back of the paper.,
Allow the paper to dry.,
Smooth the paper out with an iron, if desired.",How to Make Coffee Stained Paper2," You can brew some fresh coffee in a coffee maker, or you can make a cup of instant coffee. If you are making instant coffee, plan on using 3 tablespoons of instant coffee to about 6 ounces (cc milliliters) of water.If the coffee is too dark, don't worry, you can always lighten it with more water.
The coffee can be cold as well.

, It would be best to work over a waterproof tablecloth. If you don't have one, set up two baking sheets. Make sure that they are clean.








, Use a wide paintbrush or foam brush to apply the coffee to the paper. Paint from side to side in rows using even strokes. Do not swirl the brush across the paper, and try not leave behind any white patches. You want it to be as even as possible.








The paper will get wet, but don't let it get too soggy., Carefully lift the paper up, and flip it over. Set it down onto a dry part of the tablecloth.If you were working on a baking sheet, set it down on the second, dry baking sheet.








, Use the same technique as before.Once again, don't let the paper get too soggy.








, Transfer the paper someplace where it won't be disturbed. Allow it to dry completely.This can take several hours to overnight.








, If the paper is still damp the next day, or if it looks wrinkled, you can iron it. Sandwich the paper between two thin sheets of fabric, such as tea towels or cotton muslin.Turn your iron on to the wool setting, and let it get warm. Pass the iron over the paper, then let the paper cool down.

Twist the paper towel around the coffee.,
Dip the packet into water.,
Dab the paper with the packet.,
Allow the paper to dry.,Finished.,
Finished.

",How to Make Coffee Stained Paper3," Make sure that you use regular coffee grounds and not instant coffee. If you do not have a paper towel, you can use a round coffee filter instead—the kind that you can flatten out, not the pocket kind.








, Gather the corners of the paper towel together. Twist the paper towel around the coffee, like wrapping a lollipop. Make sure that there are no gaps where the coffee can fall out of. If you need to, tie the bundle up with a piece of string.








, Fill a cup or bowl with hot water. Dip the bundle into the water, then squeeze out the excess.








, Repeatedly stamp the paper with the coffee side of the packet. The more you stamp, the darker the color will be. Experiment between stamping closer and further apart.









You can also lightly brush the paper with water. This will help soften any harsh lines.

, Once the paper is colored to your liking, transfer it to someplace where it won't get disturbed, and allow it to dry. This can take around 10 to 15 minutes.

Gather your materials.,
Now that you have your materials ready begin creating the bottom half of a box with the paper.,
Now that the first half of your cube has been created add some gram weights, which can be purchased online or in store at a wide range of locations, into the box.,
Now place your newly created paperweight where it is needed you could also decorate it by drawing on it with a pen or use origami paper for designs to make it a little more festive.

",How to Make a Paperweight out of Paper,";
, This will be used to hold the gram weight.

To make the bottom half of this box start with a square piece of paper. The size of the paper will change the size of you paperweight. Also make sure that once its made it will be able to hold your gram weights. I recommend using 6"" by 6"" (15cm by 15cm) piece.






Place the sheet so that the corners are facing up, down, left, and right. Then make two folds in the paper, one going from the upper left side to the lower right and the other going from the upper right to the lower left. Be sure that the creases on these two folds are both ""mountain fold"". In other words when you fold the paper fold it away from you and not towards you.






Now using these creases as guide lines fold the corners of the square piece of paper in towards the center creating a smaller square. Note: Do not worry if the edges won't line up exact they almost never do.






Now fold the left and right sides of you new square into the center and then do the same for the top and bottom sides. This will create an even smaller square. Next begin to unfold this new tiny square.






Continue to unfold the square until you are back to the point where you had folded the corners of your original piece of paper into the center. Now unfold the top and bottom triangles leaving the left and right ones folded.






Now you should have a complex shape consisting of a square middle and a triangle at the top and bottom. Grab the section where the triangle and square parts meet and fold the crease in to create a corner. Do the same on the other side of this triangle. And then lift the triangle up to create the first side of you box.






Be sure to lift the quarter piece that is going to be another side of this box. Repeat Step 2.6 with the other triangle. Once both sides are upright you should notice that there is a little extra on the top and bottom sides. Fold this extra paper into the box to reinforce these sides folding the triangle tip out as part of the bottom of the box.







, Note: Be sure not to buy weights that are large or have hooks on them as this will tear the paper cube.


optional: You may wish to leave the box open and not make a cover but if you wish to hide the weights just follow steps 2.1 through 2.7 to create another box and place that box over the bottom one to create a cover. Note: You may need to make the second box slightly bigger to fit it over your first.

Blanket stitch along the top and bottom sides of the cover.,
Slide your notebook into the pockets.,
Use washi tape.,
Use your decoupage skills.,
Add your favorite quote.,
Go for glitter.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Notebook Cover," Any size notebook will be just fine. Start by measuring around the spine, back to front. Whatever number you get, add 8"" (16 cm). You'll need the extra to wrap it around later. As for from top to bottom, add 1/2"" (1.25 cm). If your notebook was 5x11, your final results are 5 1/2"" wide by 19 inches tall.


You can either use one or two pieces of fabric/felt. For felt, you generally only need one; for fabric, you may want to use two thin pieces so each side is pretty. If this is the case, cut out two and sew them together, each exposing their pretty side.
You could also use an old t-shirt!;
, (If you don't need this step, skip it.) Grab your favorite pen and cut a piece of felt that's about 3"" (7.5 cm) long and extends about 1"" from your pen on both sides.


Place the notebook, open, centered on the fabric. Wrap the sides around it snugly. Looking at the outside edge of your front cover, mark where you would like your pen holder to be attached (a washable marker is good for this). You should be drawing a line down the edge of the right-hand side.
Cut a slit along said line.
Insert the pen into the small rectangle of fabric to know how snug it needs to be.
Pin the edges in place and sew along the very edge with a machine. The ends should lightly curve toward the fold on the edge.
Cut off any extra material. Done!

, Because later the flaps will be sewn down and you won't be able to -- decisions, decisions! You could do more fabric or felt shapes or you could sew on some cute buttons! Since fabric shapes are self-explanatory (cut to shape, sew on), we'll cover adding buttons:


Put a couple of dabs of glue (just dabs!) on your button. Place where you'd like it on your cover. Repeat for all the buttons until your design is glued down in place. Let dry.
Sew the buttons to the felt, with 2 or 3 stitches through each button.

, Fold in the sides of the cover (the part that flaps over the insides) and set with pins.


You may need to recenter with your notebook to double-check how big your flaps should be.

, Pearl cotton embroidery thread works well with felt. Start at one corner, end at the other, and repeat for the other side.


Hand sewing works, too, it just takes more time and diligence. Remember to stay within 1/4"" of the edge on each sides to leave room for your notebook!

, Tada!

, With the only materials needed being tape and scissors, this method's only downfall is the precision and time it takes. But if you have an afternoon to spare, you can create a design that's intricate, beautiful, and straight up impressive. Washi tape is like normal tape, only it's patterned and sturdy.


The idea here is to have several different patterns of tape cut into different geometrical shapes (triangles, generally). A hundred carefully placed pieces of tape combine to form one amazing, abstract masterpiece. If you've a steady hand, give it a shot!

, Have some colored, pretty paper lying around? Or some sheet music, maybe a book you tear up? Even some wrapping paper? Excellent. With a glue stick, some varnish (decoupage glue is 1 part water to 1 part white glue), and a brush, you're set!


Cut your paper into pieces -- or rip it for a distressed look. You can make it totally haphazard or more patchwork-y.
Glue each piece down to your cover, overlapping a tiny bit. Make sure the papers on the edge wrap around the side, leaving none of the original cover visible when the notebook is turned over or inspected.

Be sure to press out the air bubbles as you glue each one down.


Put one or two coats of varnish on the entire thing. Let dry and you're finished!

, If your notebook cover is papery (plastic won't work), there's an easy way to make it uniquely you: add your favorite quote!


In Photoshop (or similar program), write out your favorite quote in the font and design you like. Make sure the dimensions match the size of your notebook cover.
Print out the paper and attach it the front of your notebook with a piece of transparent tape to keep the design from moving. Make sure the tape doesn't cover any of the letters.
Pressing down firmly with a ballpoint pen, trace the letters. Check near an edge to see if the ink is lightly transferring, creating a stencil.
Once you're finished tracing, remove the cover and the tape.
Paint your letters with acrylic paints. If you'd like, take a black scrapbooking pen and outline them. Cover each letter with a layer of glossy varnish to seal and let dry.

, When in doubt, glitter to the rescue. With modge podge and a brush, you can create shiny, sparkly designs that will be totally transfixing. Just apply your modge podge to the cover wherever you want your first color. Dunk in glitter and let dry. Then modge podge the next area, dunk in glitter, and let dry. Repeat this for as many colors as you'd like!


A sponge brush works best, but a paintbrush will work, too. If you're in a hard spot, you could even use your fingers. Just keep a bowl of water and a towel nearby!

You can print out words or pictures. Or you can chose to hand write.

, Using scrap paper, layer your quotes on nice paper. This way you add more dimension to your art then if it was just pasted on your flat paper. Think of it like scrapbooking, and make it as appealing as possible.


When you cut the paper, you can chose to use jagged scissors so that the paper doesn't have completely straight edges.

,


If you are making your book from scrap, cover your cardboard with nice paper, and then paste the layers of paper with the content on it. Using a hole punch, punch holes along the side so you can connect the pages if there are more than one.
If you are using a notebook, just paste your content, which you layered on more paper, straight into the notebook.

Now, divide the distance between these marks into thirds and mark the two middle points.;
, Protect your work surface with a piece of scrap wood or an old phone book as you punch a hole at each of the marked points using the awl or wire brads. Making these holes should not damage the text in the book. Most paperback books have an inner margin of 1/2"" (1.2 cm) to 3/4"" (1.9 cm), leaving plenty of room for rebinding.

, Open the book a few pages and, next to the lower middle hole, push the needle through about twenty pages. Pull the thread through until the knot is snug against the pages. Go back out to the front cover by pushing the needle up through the awl hole. This step anchors the thread.

, Pull the thread tight each time you go through a hole.

, Then go down through the other middle hole. Pull the thread tight after going through each hole. Around the back again, then up through the top hole.

, Cut sixteen rectangles of ordinary printer paper, measuring 7/8"" (22mm) long by 1.5"" (3.8cm) wide. If you have access to a paper cutter it will help make the pages even, as will stacking or folding the paper before cutting. (Don't stack too thickly, though, or you'll have trouble cutting. Two stacks of eight layers each seem to cut reasonably easily, and it doesn't matter if the pages for one book are slightly different from the other.)
, Trim the outside edges so that they're once again even. These will form the pages of the books.
, Line up the centers of the pages with the centers of the cover cardboard. Lay the book open flat with the cover side down on a cutting mat or a spare chunk of scrap cardboard. Use a push pin to poke three holes in the spine, through the center of the pages. Do this for both books.

Buy a notebook or journal.,
Decorate the cover of the slam book.,
Include a teacher, parent, or other adult.,
Create a name page.,
Write a question at the top of each page.,
Try not to be mean.,
Put numbers on each of the question pages.,
Answer you own questions first.,
Pass the slam book to a friend.,
Save the slam book.",How to Make a Slam Book," You will need a book with many blank pages to be your slam book. You could simply buy a composition notebook at many drug or department stores.


These don’t have to be expensive, and any notebook can work. You could buy a black covered composition notebook with lined paper inside or something that looks more like a journal with a fancier cover. It’s up to you.The goal here is to use a book with a lot of blank pages because you will be passing it around for people to write in.
How many blank pages you need depends on how many people you want to pass it to and how many questions you want to ask them.;
, This is where your personal creativity starts to come in.You’ll want to decorate the cover of your slam book so that people know what it is and it looks attractive. Use stickers or marker to write the words “slam book” on the cover of the notebook or journal.
Some people also decorate their slam books with colorful stickers, glitter glue, and even fake gemstones. Use your artistic talents!
There is not one way to decorate the cover of a slam book. Some people keep the book closed by tying a ribbon or even a string of beads around the slam book, but you don’t have to do so.

, If you’re going to be passing a slam book around school, it can be a good idea to let the teacher know what you are doing. Some people pass slam books around their families too! You don’t only have to pass it around other people your age.


This can help prevent you from getting in trouble if the teacher thinks the slam book is something that is distracting students from classwork. The other problem with not telling the teacher is that the teacher might think the slam book is negative because of its name.
Be kind. It will take you a long ways in life, in general. Explain the purpose of the slam book to your teacher (and parents). Let them know that the purpose is positive and that any negative “slams” will not be allowed.
The adults will probably appreciate your creativity if you take the time to explain to them. Ask them when you can circulate it. Maybe you will agree to only circulate it during recess, for example. Maybe you include the teachers in the slam book circulation! It might be interesting to know your teacher’s favorite band or ice cream, for example. Why not?

, You will want to create a few pages toward the front of your slam book where people should write their names in order. This allows you to figure out later which people gave which answers.


You should include a list of numbers on the name page that indicate how many people you want to sign the slam book. Some slam books have spaces for 10 names, others have 25, and so on. It’s really up to you.
If you choose 10, write the numbers 1 to 10 on the name page. It depends if you are trying to keep the slam book among a small circle of friends or a larger one.
The person given the slam book first signs his or her name in the first available number. That’s the number they will use when answering questions you pose throughout the other pages of the slam book. The next person uses the next number, and so on.

, This is how a classic slam book works and starts. You should start by writing a question at the top of the first blank page inside the book after the name page.The question should be something that you want to know about other people, including your friends. It could be something like, “what is your favorite school lunch?” Or “what is the last thing you bought at the mall?” Or “what color are your eyes?” Or “what’s the last music video you watched?” Or “what’s your favorite class?” Or “if you could be one current celebrity, who would you choose?”Questions work well when they are designed to tease out another person’s likes or dislikes or when they seek non-embarrassing information that helps you learn more about your friends (such as their pet’s name or their favorite ice cream flavor).
They work best if they provoke short answers. So, try not to ask things that will require lengthy response. Really any questions work, though, as long as they aren’t mean, inappropriate or passing rumors. It’s also possible to just write statements that also provoke answers. For example, you could write “favorite music artist” on one page and “last trip you took” on another.

, A slam book, in its best version, should be something you use to find out more about your friends, including their likes and dislikes.What a slam book shouldn’t be is a notebook or journal that ends up full of mean comments about this person or that. That’s bullying, and bullying can cause serious damage to other people.Don’t pass rumors in slam books and don’t go negative. When people get in trouble, it's usually because they went negative in some way.
A good rule of thumb is never to write something in a slam book about another person that will upset them or that would upset you if it was written about you.

, If you do this, it will also help people understand what they are supposed to do when they turn to each page.


Make sure people know they are supposed to answer the question on each page. Sometimes there is confusion with slam books, but, usually, once the first few people do it, they tell others how it’s supposed to be done and word spreads.
So, if you have created, say, space for 25 names on the name page, you would create a numbered list from 1 through 25 on each question page too.
You don’t have to do this. You could just instruct people on a front page to put their number and answer on each question page, but the more guidance you can give people the better, usually!

, It will probably help your friends if you become the first person on the list to answer the questions you have posed.


Don’t assume everyone knows what a slam book is! You could just explain it to your friends. However, it may end up circulated pretty quickly among other people you haven’t directly explained it to. That’s why answering each question as #1 yourself provides people with an example of how it’s supposed to work.
You could also create a page toward the front of the page that says something like “how this works” and then explain what each person is supposed to do.
Include the instruction that when the final number on the name page list is taken, the book should be returned to you. People need to know who the slam book belongs to and where to return it or you may never see it again!

, Here’s how it works. You pass the slam book to a friend, and that friend is supposed to answer the questions on each page.


The friend should indicate they wrote the answers by writing #1 or #2 (if you filled out #1 already) and then their answer on each page.
Or, if you have already chosen to number each answer page, they should write their answer after their number.
Once your friend #1 answers the questions, they are supposed to pass the slam book to a second friend, who then answers the question on each page by writing #2 (or #3 if you were #1) and then his or her answer.

, It will be a lot of fun to look back at your old slam books with friends as you age.


Some people feel slam books are almost like time capsules in that they capture the vibe of a certain era. You will find it interesting to look back on what you wrote years ago.
For example, slam books have existed for decades, and some news sites think it’s entertaining to see what people were writing in slam books in the 1980s.It could be fun to do a new slam book every year. You could even note the year on the cover of the slam book. Let it become a ritual, and compare how people’s tastes change with new trends and as they age!

, Cut as close to the spine as possible for best results.

, To get the same amount of pages in each section look at the page number on the very last page and divide that number by 5 using a calculator. The number that comes up is the number of pages you need to have in each section.

, You may even want to glue the pencil to the spine to hold it in place as you roll. When you have finished rolling you should have the spine surrounding the pencil with 5 distinct page sections pin wheeling outward, each one held by a binder clip.

, To make this process easier you can use an empty toilet paper roll to guide your pages. Make sure that the pages are all flat against each other and put back the binder clip on that section. Because the ends of the pages don't line up now, use scissors to cut off any excess paper making them line up again. Do this step to all 5 sections.

, Hold it in place for several minutes until the glue dries. Repeat this step to the other 4 sections.

, Paint the top and outside of the desk organiser with at least 2 or 3 coats before painting the inside and bottom with 2-3 coats as well.

, This is the hardest part. You have a pretty thick stack of paper, and if you used cloth for your cover it's even thicker, but you're going to need to either staple, hole-punch, or cut it.


Hole-punching: To hole-punch, either punch a hole near the top (but not too close) of the book, on the spine, and another about an inch down the spine. Repeat this on the other side of the spine. Then, thread ribbon or yarn through this and tie a bow. This is a more decorative method.
Cutting: If you don't have a hole-punch, you can either open up your pocketbook and bore a hole through the spine with scissors in the same way you would do with a hole punch, then thread the ribbon or yarn through. (see hole-punch for more instructions.) If this is too time-consuming for you, try to fold it again and simply cut a hole.
Stapling: Take a long-armed stapler, and staple the inside where the fold has creased the papers. Two staples; one at the top and the other at the bottom should be sufficient. If you decide to add more, start at the middle to avoid wrinkly paper.

, You can use rick-rack, lace, spare cloth, pictures, leaves, and other good collage-making items.

Make sure you choose hardcover books, as those are easier to paint.;
, You can keep the paint job simple by coating a book in a single color. You can also get elaborate and paint a pattern or landscape. It just depends on what kind of look you want to achieve. Search online for different examples or just go with what feels most natural to you.


Tape the binding so books appear older and well-worn.
Utilize tools like stamps and stencils.
Tie a ribbon around the book to add a decorative touch.

, Acrylic paint is extremely versatile and applicable to many surfaces. But before you start painting books, take the time to prepare your work space and materials.


Put down newspaper or scrap paper to prevent paint from getting on your table or carpet.
Gently clean your books with a cloth or paper towel to remove dust, grease, and dirt. As a water-based paint, acrylics will not adhere to oily surfaces.
Open each book and lay it down on the scrap paper so that the cover side is up.
Grab whatever design tools you will use such as stamps, stencils, and ribbons.

, Though you can use the paint directly out of its tube or jar, you may want to consider mixing it to create different colors. You can also thin the paint by watering it down.


Use your palette to mix colors or to thin paint. Keep paint wet by adding a retarding medium, which makes the paint dry more slowly.
For the base coat, use a large, flat brush. You may need to use other paint brushes for small details and intricate designs. Keep brushes wet to prevent paint from drying on them.

, Varnishing helps protect the paint and makes it last longer. This is especially important since your painted books will be out in the open (not behind glass, like some acrylic paintings). Wait until the paint is dry and then paint the varnish on. You can use either a gloss (shiny) or matte (dull) finish.

, Stack a pile of painted books on your coffee table or fireplace mantle. Add them to a bookshelf. Set them on your nightstand or on top of a piano. Create a centerpiece for the island or dinner table in your kitchen.

Select a size for the label.,
Choose suitable paper.,
Choose a paper shape.,
Draw or stencil the chosen shape to the paper.,
Attach the paper label to your diary.,
Write on the label.",How to Make a Label for Your Diary2," Decide where the label is to go on the diary and choose the measurements. Use these measurements for the paper piece you're about to create.

, There are many options here, just be sure that whatever you use is durable enough to serve as a label. Some of the possibilities include gift wrapping paper, construction paper, old cards, printer paper, craft paper, a paper doily, etc. Recycle where possible.


Layering of different kinds of paper is another possibility.

, The shape possibilities are endless, so here are just a few suggestions to help you decide:


Use a simple geometric shape, such as a rectangle, a square, an oval, etc. You can also round off or indent the corner edges for added flair.
Use a luggage label as the paper shape. Draw around it on your favorite paper and cut out the design.
Use a stencil, such as of an animal, a flower, a letter (your first initial maybe), a tree, a favorite object, etc.

, Cut out the label shape, taking care to keep its true form intact.

, Simply glue it in place where you want it. Allow to dry.

, Add your name, a message or simply ""My Diary"", as wished.


To prolong the label's life, consider covering with contact paper or sealing with a clear drying sealant such as Mod Podge.

Attach the cloth label to the diary.,
Done.",How to Make a Label for Your Diary3," Scrap fabric is ideal, or you might like to buy a special piece of fabric. Calico, cheesecloth or muslin will work too, for a more rustic and simple look.

, Do you want the cloth label to cover the diary's front or just fit into one area of it? Decide, then cut it to size.

, This might be by using fabric markers or stitching with thread. Both ways will look great. You could even combine the two approaches. Some suggestions for decorating include:


Stitching a design or message on the fabric using embroidery thread and embroidery stitches; be as fancy as you like, including making knot roses, three-dimensional flowers, etc., or keep it very simple and naive-style.
Use fabric pens or paints to draw and paint a picture and any words. You could draw an animal, add a poem or a saying, or create a pattern, for instance.

, Glue it in place, taking care to smooth out any wrinkles or bubbling that might form.


If wished, cover with Mod Podge to seal. However, this will change the texture of the fabric considerably, so be sure you want stiffened fabric before doing this.

, The diary will now have a nice texture and and old-world charm.

If you are using an old pad of paper, pull the back cover off and cut it in half.;
, The paper needs to be 1-inch (2.54 centimeters) longer and wider than your cover.You can use any type of paper you want, such as scrapbooking paper, wrapping paper, or even construction paper.

For a more unique look, create your design on the computer, then print it out on high-quality paper., You don't have to do this, especially if you used paper that's already fancy, like wrapping paper or scrapbooking paper. If you used construction paper or printer paper, consider drawing designs onto it, then coloring them in.

Make the front cover fancier than the back cover. Add a title or an image.

, Turn the paper so that the blank side is facing you. Brush a thin layer of liquid glue (ie: Mod Podge, tacky glue, or white school glue) onto the cardboard. Place the cardboard, glue-side-down, onto the paper. Make sure that it is centered.

You can also use a glue stick instead.
Smooth the paper down, if needed, with a ruler or credit card. Work your way from the middle of the cover to the outside.

, Use a metal ruler and a craft blade to cut the corners of the paper off. Make sure that you cut all the way down to the cardboard. This will help remove bulk and help the paper lay smoother., Turn the cardboard so that the blank side is facing you, and the covered side is facing down. Coat the back of the paper with more glue. Fold it tightly over the edge of the cardboard, and press it down.

Smooth the edges of the paper down, if needed. Work your way from the edges of the cover inward. Wipe away any glue that seeps out.

, Cut two sheets of paper that are ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) than your cover, both lengthwise and widthwise. Try solid-colored paper if your cover is fancy, and patterned paper if your cover is plain., Turn the cover so that the paper side is facing down. Coat your cut paper with glue, then press it down onto the cover. This will cover up the bare cardboard and overlap part of the wrapped edges.Smooth the paper down, as before, then wipe off any excess glue.

, Choose a waterproof decoupage glue, topcoat, or acrylic spray sealer. Spray it onto the front and back cover. Let the sealer dry before moving on.Be careful if you decorated or printed the paper; the ink may run.

, You can use lined paper, printer paper, or even sketchbook paper. Avoid cutting more paper than this, especially if you are using thick sketchbook paper. If you cut more paper, you will need to make a bigger coil, which is more likely to warp out of shape.If you are using an old notebook, cut the paper in half, and use that instead., Take one of the pieces of paper you just cut. Orient it in the direction you want the cover to go. Use a pencil and ruler to draw a vertical line down the paper, about 2 millimeters from the left side edge.You can put the binding along the top edge instead. In this case, draw a horizontal line 2 millimeters from the top edge.

, The hole needs to be to the right of the line so that it's closer to the middle of the paper than the edge. You can make the hole with a thin nail, a 3-millimeter screw punch, or a 1/8-inch (3-millimeter) hole puncher.Don't use a regular hole puncher. It's too big.

If you made a horizontal line, punch the hole below the line instead.
You can find these tools in the scrapbooking section of an arts and crafts shop.

, Work your way up and down from the middle hole. Try to space the holes as evenly as you can. Leave about 5 millimeters of space at the top and bottom of the paper., Place the template on top of 4 sheets of paper. Punch more holes into the stack, using the template as a guide., Lay your template on top of your front cover. Punch the holes, then lift the template away. Repeat this step for the back cover., Place the back cover face-down. Stack the paper on top. Place the front cover on top, face-up. At this point, you can also insert other items into your book, such as folders and sticker sheets., Tap the stack against the table first to make sure that everything is aligned, especially the holes. Place binder clips along the top, bottom, and right-side edge.If you are making a top-bound book, place the clips on the bottom and side edges instead.

, Get some 16-gauge stringing wire; you can find it in the beading section of an arts and crafts shop. Wrap it around a thick pen. How many times you wrap the wire around the pen depends on how many holes you have. If you have 24 holes, wrap it 24 times.Trim off the excess wire with wire cutters.

Every so often, squish the coils together so that they are nice and tight.

, Gently stretch the wire until it is about the same length as your book. If you put the holes along the top of you book, then stretch the wire to match the width., Poke one end of your coiled wire into the first hole on your book. Twist the wire until it reaches the next hole. Push it through the hole, and twist it again. Keep twisting and threading the wire until it comes out the last hole., Use needle-nose pliers to pinch the end of the wire at one end of your book. Bend the wire inward, towards the coil. Repeat this step for the other side of the book with the other end of the wire., If you still have any wire sticking out past the second/second-to-last-coil, you will need to trim it off. Do this with a pair of wire cutters."

Select a hardcover book.,

Cut with a scroll saw for intricate designs.,
Punch out paper quickly with a hole saw.",How to Make a Book Safe," If you don't want to damage any of your own, antique stores often sell unwanted old books for next to nothing. Make sure the book is thick and wide enough to store the objects you plan to hide.


The book that makes the best hiding spot has a similar subject matter and size as the other books on the shelf. A boring title also helps deter people from picking it up.;
, Flip through the book and choose the page you'd like to see on the left hand side, opposite your compartment. People often choose an illustration near the front of the book.


If you want a larger compartment, you can plan to start cutting at page 1 and just leave the front cover.

, Once you've chosen the starting page, turn the next page over to the left. You'll end up cutting this page eventually, but since it will be the top page of your compartment, it needs extra attention later on to keep it looking nice., Using plastic wrap or a plastic bag, wrap the front cover along with all the pages on the left hand side. Hold it in place with tape or a loose rubber band. This will protect these pages from glue.

, The back cover will be the base of your compartment. Once you're sure both ends of the book are fully covered, you can shut the book.


If you like, you may repeat the steps above and choose an ""end page"" for the compartment as well, but this often looks messy by the time the project is done.

, You can use plain white glue, but it's usually a little too thick to spread easily. Pour the glue into a cup and mix in a little water at a time, until it's slightly runny (usually around 80% glue / 20% water).Don't overdo it, as too much water may cause the pages to warp.


If you want to bypass these problems, visit a hobby shop and purchase glue intended for jigsaw puzzles.This should dry clear without warping.

, Brush on one or two thin layers of glue along the outside pages of the book, on all three edges. Check thoroughly for drips before you continue, and wipe them away with the paintbrush.


If the coat of glue is too thick, it will take longer to dry and may add bubbles and lumps to the pages.

, Place the book on newspaper and set several heavy objects on top of it, such as paperweights or other books. This pressure will help the pages dry together with minimal warping. Retrieve the book once the pages are firmly dried together. This can take as little as one hour, or as long as 24 hours in cool, humid conditions.If the pages are not firmly stuck together by the time the glue is dry, brush on another thin coat and let dry.
Good air circulation will speed up drying. Try pointing a fan so it blows across the drying paper. An air purifier is even better if you happen to have one, as it also removes some of the mold spores that attack old or wet books.

, Open the book to the first piece of plastic. On the right hand page, draw the rectangular outline of the compartment with a pencil and ruler. Work in long, straight lines, and leave a border at least ¾ inch (19 mm) on all sides to prevent tears.


Extend each line past the corners of the compartment. This will help guide your cuts.

, Place the ruler along one of the lines you drew. Hold a sharp utility knife alongside the ruler, at a 90º angle from the paper. Start about ½ inch (1.25 cm) outside of the rectangle, and bring the knife down along the line pressing down hard. Repeat this cut along the same line about four times, then cut all other sides of the compartment the same way.Be patient. Don't try to cut through more than ¼ inch (6mm) at a time. Rushing will create jagged edges and increase the risk of cutting yourself.

, Carefully tug out the cut paper, slicing through any corners that are still attached. Continue cutting down along the edges of the compartment, keeping it as straight as possible. Repeat until you reach the piece of plastic at the back of the book.


A typical hardcover book typically blunts three or four utility knife blades.Put in a new one each time cutting becomes difficult, or this project will take all night.
Put a piece of corrugated cardboard above the plastic to prevent you from cutting through by accident.

, Tug or slice off any scraps of paper along the inside edges of the compartment. Cut through the corners again if you need to; they usually get pretty messy.

, Apply the same diluted glue to the inside edges of the compartment. Just use a thin layer, and wipe up any glue that runs to the base of the hiding spot.

, Remember that extra page you saved at the beginning? Take it out of the plastic and glue this page over the top of the compartment, carefully lining it up with the page beneath it. This covers up the pencil marks and cut marks.


To line it up exactly, start by lowering the edge next to the spine of the book, and smooth it down with your palm.

, Unwrap the back cover and any pages you were saving. Lift the compartment and brush glue onto the underside, then press it down over the base of the book.


For a fancier-looking compartment, glue something decorative to the base first. Try a square of felt, or an illustrated page from the book.

, Since the wet glue is not exposed to the air this time, it may take several hours longer to dry than the outside did.

, You don't want your compartment covered, of course. Cut out a rectangle in that single page so it matches the pages beneath it. Now your book safe is ready to hold your treasures.

, Gluing the pages together before cutting keeps them steady, but this makes deep cuts awkward and still doesn't hold a paperback in place all that well. Try this method instead for these projects:Take two small pieces of fiberboard (or any similar scrap board) and sandwich the pages you plan to cut between them.
Hammer four finishing nails through the top board and most of the pages, almost to the bottom board.
Cut through the first layer of pages as usual and rip them out.
Turn the top board and hollowed-out pages over and secure with a weight or rubber band.
Repeat to cut through the rest of the book. The nails hold the pages in place, and turning the completed pages over improves your access to each fresh page.

, Use the ""nail down"" approach described above to hold the pages steady. Trace a design on the board — as intricate as you like — and cut through from one board to the other using a scroll saw. Preferably, use a blade with a relatively low number of teeth per inch.If you reach a turn too sharp for the scroll saw, withdraw the saw and start again from an additional pilot hole.Book dust, especially from old musty books, can cause allergic reactions, breathing problems, and infections.Wear a respirator mask while cutting and work in a well-ventilated area.
A dremel doesn't give you the same level of control, but it can speed up cutting the rectangle in the basic method above., Drill a hole through a piece of lumber using a hole saw. Clamp this over the pages you want to cut, with a solid piece of lumber on the other side. Drill a hole through the page, then use that hole as a guide for your hole saw. This will cut through the circle rapidly, although you do need to stop frequently to remove paper from the saw and allow it to cool down.This is the fastest option available, but you are limited by the shape of your hole saw. You can create larger patterns in different shapes by shifting the lumber to a different spot on the page and cutting additional, overlapping circles.

Choose paper to cover your book with.,
Cut the paper to size using the measurements for your book.,
Fold the paper 1/4 inch above the top and bottom of the book.,
Tape down the top and bottom folds.,
Create the folds for the sides of the book.,
Fit your book inside of the cover.",How to Cover a Book1," For books without covers or to protect your textbooks, make a paper cover for your book. You can cover your books with foreign or old newspapers, old or new maps, sheet music, old wall paper, a brown paper bag, etc.. Unless you are covering a smaller book, you will need a large piece of paper to make your cover. It will need to be at least double the length of your book and three inches taller than the height of your book. , To find the width of the book, lay the book open and measure the width with a measuring tape or ruler. Then add 6 inches, 3 inches to cover both sides of the book. Next measure the height of the book and add 3 inches, 1 ½ inches to cover the top and bottom of the book.


Using a ruler, mark a faint line with a pencil on your paper the dimensions of your cover, and then with a sharp pair of scissors, cut your paper to size.
Avoid laying the book out so that a previous crease that was in a bag or on your paper aligns with a cover edge. If your paper is already worn, it will tear more easily when it is on an edge of the book., Close your book and center it on the paper. Faintly mark the edges of the top and bottom of the book then add an extra ¼ inch so that the book will fit inside of the cover. Take the book off the paper, and fold the paper up to the spot marked and make your fold into a crease. Repeat the process with the top of the book; fold the paper down and create your crease about a 1/4 inch above the top of the book.


Go back over the creases you have made in the paper with a pen or bone folder. You want your creases to be crisp and clean, especially if you are using heavy paper. , Use double-sided tape to tape down the folds you have just made so that they do not flap. The double sided tape will help the cover stays snug on the book once it is covered. Place the tape toward the center of your cover, leaving about three inches at both sides for your book to fit in the cover.

, Lay your book open flat on the paper and center the book so that both sides have the same amount of paper for the flaps. Press your book down so it does not move, and fold the paper over the right side of the book and create a crease. Go back over the crease, more lightly than before, with the side of your pen or your bone folder. To accommodate for the thickness of the cover, do not make the creases too heavy.


With the flap in the right side of the book, close the book and wrap the paper around the book and mark where you want to fold the paper to make the last flap. Take the book of the paper, and crease the flap for the left side of the book. Go over the crease with your bone folder or pen again, but remember to keep the crease lighter.

, Gently place the back of the book into the fold on the back of your paper cover. Then wrap the paper cover around the book and tuck the top cover of the book carefully into the front of the paper cover. "

Add a name tag to your cover.,
Use paper tape to create fun horizontal stripes on your book cover.,
Buy fun stickers to create a theme or add flair.,
Place a plastic pocket on the front of your book cover.,
Create a pocket in your cover with paper.,
Create a rubber band notebook holder on a textbook book cover.",How to Cover a Book2," You can buy fun or fancy name tags or labels from crafts and office supply stores. Write your class or your name on the label using a fun script or font. Practice writing the word on a scrap of paper in different scripts or fonts until you find a script you like, and then with a marker or pen, inscribe the title onto the name tag. Use a ruler and carefully center the tag on the front upper center of your paper cover and then adhere it., You can buy different colored paper tapes from a crafts store that go well with your cover. Take the cover off of the book to make the stripes, or make the stripes before you make the cover. Mark a place for each stripe at the top of the book every 1-2 inches. Use a ruler to mark off the stripes at regular intervals to make sure they are evenly spaced. To keep your lines straight, draw faint lines down the cover with your ruler and cover them with strips of paper tape.

, For example, if you have a blue paper cover with white stripes, you can adhere an anchor sticker to the bottom corner of your cover to create a sailing themed book cover. You can buy any kind of sticker(s) to go along with the color or pattern of your book cover. , You can put your school schedule into a document holder you adhere to your book cover or you can decorate a card to place into a holder to give your cover more fun style. In office supply stores, you can find self-adhering business card holders, self-adhering document holders, and insertable label holders for shipping. Simply adhere one of these pockets onto the front or back of your book cover. , You will follow the method “Making a Paper Cover” to make your paper cover, but you will use two pieces of paper instead of one. The second paper creates a pocket you can use to put papers in. You can overlap two different colored pieces of large construction paper to create a pocket on your book cover. Or you can use one solid color and one pattern or music sheet, etc.. This pocket will look cool but is also a practical addition to your cover. You will be able to quickly stash documents in the front of your book cover with a pocket.To create the paper sheet you will cover your book with, lay the papers on top of each other so that the piece below sticks out 2 inches from the bottom edge of the top paper.
Use double sided tape to adhere the two pieces of paper together at the edges of the paper.

, If you keep a pocket notebook, make a rubber band holder to keep your pocket notebook. It will help prevent you from losing the small notebook in your bag. Simply take two large rubber bands and place them around the length of the front cover so that they are spaced a bit wider apart than the notebook.To secure your notebook in the cover, put your notebook under the rubber band closer to the book opening, and set it on top of the rubber band nearer to the book spine.

Sew around the edges of your cover using a ⅜ inch inseam.,
Use your scissors to round the corners of the fabric, and then turn the cover inside out.,
Iron the cover, and then sew a perimeter around the sides of the cover.",How to Cover a Book3," If you have a sewing machine, making fabric covers is a simple way to cover your notebooks. Pick one fabric for the cover and the another fabric for the flaps on the inside of the cover. You can choose a combination of a print and a solid color fabric, two print fabrics, or two different colored solid fabrics.


You should prewash your fabric to prevent it from shrinking. Iron the fabric before you use it as well.
You will need less fabric for the inside of the cover and more for the outside.

, Use a ruler or measuring tape to get the height and the width of your book for the big cover. To find the height, measure the height of the notebook and add an inch. To get the width, multiply the width of the front cover by two, then add the width of book's spine, and then add another inch.


For example, your height and width may be 8 (height)x 12 ½ (width of book spread open) inches, and then you would add another inch to have 9 x 13 ½ inches.
For the dimensions of the inside flaps, use the same cover dimension for the height, for my example it is 9 inches. To find the width, divide the width by 3. In my example, 13 ½ divided by 3 is 4.5 inches. My fabric will measure 9 x 4.5 inches.

, Using a pair of sharp scissors and a ruler, make a faint straight line on your fabric and cut out your fabric to size. You should cut out 2 larger pieces of fabric for the outside and inside and 2 smaller pieces of fabric for the inside flaps.

, Make a ¼ inch flap along one of the long sides of the inner fabric, and iron it down so that it is creased. Double the fabric, turning over the folded crease once more so that it has a second ¼ inch fold over the first fold. Create a crease on this double fold and then iron it down. Do this on both pieces of the flap fabric., On the inner side of the double fold, use your sewing machine and sew the flap down so that it is closed. At the top and bottom of your fabric back up your sewing machine and go back over the stitches to ensure the stitching does not come undone at the ends. Repeat the process with both pieces of fabric. , Lay out a piece of the bigger fabric with the print or color side facing up. Then place the smaller fabric flaps on top of the bigger fabric so that they are covering the right and left sides of the bigger fabric. The sewn sides of the flap fabrics should be facing in toward the center of the big fabric. Then place the last piece of big fabric on top of the three pieces of fabric with the print or color side facing down.


Pin the 4 fabric sheets together. To keep the fabric in place while you sew, pin about four pins on the bottom and top of the fabric and the three pins on the sides of the fabric.

, Leave a gap of an ¾ inch in the middle of the bottom or top of the cover so that you can turn the cover inside out once you have finished sewing.

, To round the corners, trim the sharp edges of the 4 corner edges off. Then flip the cover inside out. Make sure to get all of the corners all the way turned out.

, Iron the cover to flatten it, and then use your sewing machine to go back over the 4 sides of the cover. You can use a 3/8 inch inseam. This perimeter will close the ¾ inch gap you left, and give the cover a clean and finished style.

Take your time with it, don't rush.,
Forget all of these directions.",How to Creatively Ruin Your Wreck This Journal," You can find these at Borders, on Amazon.com,Barns and Nobles, and other places. It costs around $13.00 to purchase one.






;
, Some instructions may require you to tear all or part of a page out, so keep that in mind before you work on both sides of one part only to find out that the page behind it requires you to tear it out.








, If you enter the book title into google, you should find the flickr group for it; there are thousands of photos people have taken of certain pages. This should give you some ideas.








, Instead of following the instructions exactly the way they're worded, see if you can find a way to technically follow the instructions without doing what it appears to be asking. Some examples are:









One page gives the instructions ""Add your own page numbers"". It doesn't say to go through and number them in consecutive order, so you could try something like numbering the pages in the order you do them. At the end, your page numbers could go like this: 10, 1, 5, 15, 20, 23, etc.
Another page says ""Leave this page blank on purpose"". It says nothing about not folding it, tearing it, or crumpling it, so try ripping that page out and making origami with it.
Finally, one page says ""Ask a friend to do something destructive to this page. Don't look."" One might think that this means don't look ever again, but it could also mean don't look while your friend is destroying it.

, Even on pages that don't require color, color everything! Make drawings, write something, mutilate your color pencil box. Some examples would be:









For the page about documenting what it was like to sleep with the journal, you could draw a snapshot of a dream you had while sleeping with the journal.
On the compost pages, draw a flower or draw the bottom part of a plant with roots and dirt (and maybe even include a drawing of what composting paper looks like).
On pages asking you to write, use various colored pencils, pens, or markers to write instead of using just a black pen or pencil.
Before you cut up the page for paper chains, color it so it looks cool when you make the chain.

, This is a fun activity that shouldn't be kept to yourself; bring it with you when you go out somewhere, so everyone can help you wreck your journal. If they don't wreck it themselves, they can give you ideas on how to improve upon your creative destruction.








, Just coloring every page with your box of crayolas is somewhat boring, that's for sure. Use tape, glue, markers, paint, dirt, different colored threads, plastic wrap, wax, and anything else you can think of to spice up your pages.








, If you rush, you may find that your ideas become lackluster and your urge to destroy it fades. Set the book aside when you feel like you are done for the day, and don't push yourself to finish it.








, There are no instructions on how to wreck your journal. Everyone's different, therefore, everyone's journal will be unique. Just let your creativity out and interpret the instructions how you want to interpret them. Have fun with it.

, Use the ruler to guide the initial slicing and you can then use the cut pages to guide the rest of the cuts. Be careful to keep the lines straight as the pages can shift and it's easy to slice off thin ribbons of paper. Move from cutting line to cutting line and go through the book.

, With the whole book cut up, grab each section and alternate direction. Half go one way and the other half go the other way. Hold it down with your hand so it doesn't flop back into the middle.

, Plop some magazines down on top of the book to keep it in place. Now get out some ridiculously large design book that you got at the store on an impulse because it had some rad pictures and it was on sale and damn if that cover isn't trippy.

, Sweet, you're done and now the book needs some nice place to be appreciated. Close peeks at the book reveal several bits of random salaciousness to enjoy. Lust and greed and overdoses, this book has it all.

Select a notebook or diary with a hard or heavy cardstock cover.,
Gather your crafting tools.,
Select collage materials.,
Brush your adhesive onto the cover of your notebook or diary.,
Attach your collage materials to the cover.,
Brush another layer of your adhesive over the finished collage.",How to Decorate a Girl's Diary or Notebook1," You will need a cover that is sturdy enough to hold up to being brushed with a collage adhesive (like Mod Podge or a craft glue and water solution) without wrinkling or ripping.;
, You will need scissors or a small precision knife for more precise cutting, soft bristle or foam paintbrushes (for brushing on your adhesive/sealant), and a decoupage adhesive and sealant (like Mod Podge).


You can make your own sealant/adhesive by mixing two parts white craft glue with one part water.

, You can make your collage out of cut out photographs, images or text cut out of magazines, or even just pretty pieces of patterned craft paper or thin fabric. Use whatever you like: pick images that fit your interests and personality, patterns that you find pretty, or words that you find meaningful.

, Make sure the surface you are decorating is covered with an even, smooth coating of adhesive. A foam brush may work best for this., You may need to brush a little additional adhesive under the edges and corners of your collage pieces to get them to adhere properly, especially if they overlap each other. Use something hard and flat, like the edge of a ruler, to smooth out any wrinkles or bubbles.

, This will act as a protective sealant and help keep your design in place. Wait for the sealant to set and dry before using your diary or notebook or adding additional decorations.

Finished.

",How to Make a Terry Cloth Book Cover1," Open your book up and lay it down on its spine. Use measuring tape or a ruler to measure the width and length of the book. This measurement will allow you to cut cloth to the proper size of your book. Write down the measurements with a notepad or on your phone.;
, Add 2 inches (50.8 millimeters) to both the length and width measurement that you took down. This extra slack will help you attach the cover to your book. Use sharp craft scissors to cut the terry cloth to your measurements.You can use a marker or pen to make marks that will designate where you should cut.

, Measure to the middle of your cloth and cut a 2x2 inch square on the top and bottom edges of your fabric. This will create two cut-out square tabs on the top and bottom of your terry cloth book cover. Your cloth should now resemble something looking like an uppercase H.

, Bias tape will prevent your book cover from fraying and will straighten the rough edges of the terry cloth. Start by pinning the tape in place with sewing pins, then use a sewing machine to attach the bias tape all around the edges of your terry cloth book cover.


You can purchase bias tape online on places like Amazon or at fabric, sewing, and craft stores.
Try to find bias tape with a color you like. If you don't have a sewing machine, you can try to attach the bias tape by hand using a needle and thread.

, The velcro strips will help the book cover stay attached to the book. The rough side of the velcro is called the hook, and the soft side of the velcro is referred to as the loop. The longer pieces of velcro will attach the bottom and top of the cover to the book, and the smaller pieces will fasten the cover to the cover and back page of the book., Pin the four 1 inch (101.6 millimeter) strips 1 inch (25.4 millimeters) away from the indent on the top and bottom of your terry cloth. Put the hook side of the velcro on the top and the loop side on the bottom of your book cover., Flip your terry cloth over and place the 1 1/2 inch (38.1 millimeter) strip hooks on the left and right edge of the book. One strip should be an inch (25.4 millimeters) from the top of your terry cloth, and the other should be an inch (25.4 millimeters) from the bottom of your terry cloth. Take the four remaining 1 1/2 inch (38.1 millimeter) strip loops and pin them in the center of the top and bottom edge of your terry cloth., You should have 12 different pieces of velcro that you must sew onto your terry cloth. Once you're done, you'll be able to fold your terry cloth around your book and use the velcro to keep the cover in place. Use a sewing machine to sew the strips onto the terry cloth.


As an alternative, you can use a needle and thread, but make sure that you purchase sew-on velcro, or it may be hard to attach.

, Place your book on top of the terry cloth and open up the book's front cover. Fold the upper and lower flaps onto the cover of your book and fasten them together using the velcro. Fold the left edge in and attach the smaller pieces of velcro together. Repeat this process for the back cover of the book.

Select a diary or notebook with a plain paper or fabric cover.,
Buy some markers.,
Decide on a design.,
Draw your design on the cover.",How to Decorate a Girl's Diary or Notebook2," Alternatively, you can make your own paper cover. Try to select a material that is not too slick or glossy, so your marker won’t smudge.

, Make sure to get permanent markers that will not smudge or wipe off once the ink dries. The type of marker you should get will depend on the material that your cover is made of.


If your diary or notebook has a paper cover, regular permanent writing or art markers (like Sharpies) may be your best bet.
For fabric covers, try fabric markers, which are designed to write on fabric without bleeding or washing out.
Use oil-based paint markers for surfaces that don’t take regular ink well, like leather or glossy paper.
Opaque or metallic markers are best for drawing on dark surfaces.

, Do some sketches on scratch paper before writing or drawing on your cover. Draw pictures, doodle some geometric designs, or have fun with hand-lettering words and phrases that are meaningful to you.


If you’re not comfortable drawing or writing freehand, you can also use stencils to add ready-made designs.
Try creating an airbrushed effect with a marker and an airbrush spritzer., You may wish to sketch your design in pencil before filling it in with your markers. Take care not to smudge the marker as you are drawing. Allow the ink to dry completely before using your diary or notebook.

Decorate your diary or notebook with stick-on gems or stickers.,
Decorate your diary or notebook with washi tape.,
Use hot-glue to add decorative objects.",How to Decorate a Girl's Diary or Notebook3," This is one of the easiest ways to decorate your cover. Buy some stickers or gems with adhesive backs and place them wherever you like. For an extra layer of protection over flat stickers, brush on a layer of decoupage adhesive (like Mod Podge).

, Washi tape is a type of decorative tape that comes in a variety of colors and patterns. Cover your entire notebook with strips of washi tape, fold the edges of the tape inside the cover, and create a tidy border by cutting off the excess with a precision knife.Alternatively, just add a few strips as accents wherever you’d like.

, You can use whatever you’d like: decorative “found object” embellishments, buttons, small stones, or anything else you can imagine.If you don’t have a glue gun, you can affix the objects with a strong craft adhesive like E-6000.Whatever type of adhesive you decide to use, take care to work in a well-ventilated area and read the directions and safety warnings carefully.

Finished.

",How to Make a Terry Cloth Book Cover2," Lay the book open, over your piece of terry cloth and measure 2 inches (50.8 millimeters) around the book. You'll need this extra cloth to properly fasten it to the book. Use a pen or marker to mark lines where you'll have to cut. Use sharp scissors to cut along where you marked.

, When spraying the adhesive, you only have to give the book a single coat. Find a spray that is made specifically for fabrics to hold your terry cloth to your book.


You can purchase adhesive spray at many hardware stores including Home Depot and Lowes.Some popular spray adhesives for fabrics include Spray n Bond Fusible Adhesive, Basting Spray, and Aleene’s Fabric Stiffening and Draping Liquid., Press down after you lay your book onto the cloth. Try to center the book as much as possible so that you'll have enough slack to properly attach the cover to the book. The cloth should stick to the book.

, Cut two slits 2 inches from the top and bottom of your book. Keep your book on your terry cloth when doing this, and do not cut past where your book is or else you'll have cuts on the surface of your cover. Doing this should create two small tabs at the top and bottom of your book, which will be used later to help secure the terry cloth to the book.

, Apply the glue with your hot glue gun, an inch (25.4 millimeters) away from the left and right edge of your terry cloth. These pieces of cloth will fold over and fit inside the front and back cover of your book., Before the hot glue dries, fold the flaps over and press down on top of the terry cloth to attach the cloth to the inside to the back and front cover of your book. The terry cloth should now be wrapped around your book with 2 inches (50.8 millimeters) of slack remaining on the top and bottom of the book.

, Add more glue with your hot glue gun to the top and bottom 2 inches (50.8 millimeters) of slack. Make sure to pay special attention to the outside corners of your cover, because the terry cloth will bunch up there more than anywhere. If your terry cloth is not staying attached, apply more glue using the hot glue gun in those corners.

, Once you've glued your terry cloth to the front and back cover of your book, there should only be the two flaps that are not attached to the book. Use a butter knife or thin object to push the terry cloth into the bindings. Do this on both the bottom and top of the book's spine. Allow the glue to dry before handling your book.,"

Find suitable bricks.,
Decide how you'll decorate the brick bookends.",How to Make Bookends out of Bricks1," A brick is pretty much a brick but there are some things to be wary of when choosing your bookend bricks. For example, be sure to use completely dry bricks before beginning the project. This might mean leaving the bricks to dry somewhere first if you've unearthed them from a wet outdoor location. Second, avoid bricks that you can't sit evenly. Bricks that have chunks of mortar stuck to them or that have missing corners that make them wobbly might not be suitable for the bookend, although by all means test their balance first and see if you can't knock off that mortar with a few well placed hammer knocks. And of course, ensure that the bricks are clean before proceeding––a cloth dipped in hot soapy water and rubbed over dirt and stains should help to remove the worst of any grime build-up. Be sure to use solid bricks not the ones with holes. They may not be heavy enough and will not give you a smooth surface.mor


It's recommended that you make the bricks in pairs each time, as clearly having one brick for each end of the bookshelf is helpful in most cases.

, There are various suitable options here, depending on your own skill level, the crafty items available to you and the end look you're after. The decorating possibilities this article covers are: paper (decoupage), fabric, photos, paint, glitter and three dimensional. Follow the section below that suits your needs best.

"
"
Select the paper.,
Wrap each brick in a layer of plain colored paper first.,
Cut out the decoupage images.,
Add the images to the base layer.,
Spray with acrylic sealer to complete the project.",How to Make Bookends out of Bricks2," Although it may be tempting to use last year's holiday wrapping, bear in mind that you'll have to live with the design year-round. Also, cheap flimsy paper is not an option––even though you'll be decoupaging it, the flimsier the paper, the more likely it is that it'll rip and won't present a good final look. The paper selected should be suitable for your décor, interesting to look at and representative of your taste. Ideas include:


Magazine images
Strong, nicely designed wrapping paper images
Images you've picked up from here and there such as brochures, ticket stubs, postcards, bookmarks, promotional materials, etc. You could even consider making a trip memory brick bookend, or some other memento bookend
Fabric-backed contact paper; this comes in lots of interesting designs and colors
Cut-outs––some craft stores sell specially produced decoupage cut-out sheets with designs ranging from Victorian images to animals.;
, This will serve as the base layer over which you'll add the decoupage pieces of paper. Wrap as if you were wrapping a present, only be as neat as you can possibly be and avoid too much overlap at either end or you'll create unevenness.

, If you haven't already done so, cut out the images or clip them to size for adding to the brick bookend.

, Using decoupage glue, glue the images all over the covered brick in a pattern or randomly, as wished. Follow the glue instructions for drying times.

, Again, wait for it to dry completely. Once dried, start using your new decoupage brick bookends.

Create a design on paper before painting.,
Cover your workspace well to protect surfaces.

,
Clean each brick in readiness for painting.,
Paint the bricks as desired.,
Display once dried.

",How to Make Bookends out of Bricks3," It could be as simple as painting the whole brick one simple color (or even simply varnishing it clear). Or, it could be as complicated as painting on specific designs and images or doing some free-flowing painting in a random way. In each case, be sure to complement the décor color scheme.


Try glow-in-the-dark or neon paints for a funky look.

,, The bricks should be as clean as possible to allow the paint to adhere well.

, Allow to dry between coats and paint enough coats for it to look smooth and well covered.

,"
"
Select the glitter and any other related adornments.,
Cover your workspace well to protect surfaces.

,
Paint decoupage glue over the brick surface (except for the part that will not be seen).,
If adding extra bling, glue on separately once the glittery layers have dried.,
Spray with acrylic sealer when you are finished so the glitter doesn’t end up all over your books.",How to Make Bookends out of Bricks4," You could also add rhinestones, costume jewels, sequins and any other affordable bling that jazzes up the look.

,, Sprinkle the glitter over the glue. Allow this layer to dry before adding any additional layers of glitter.

, Use silicon adhesive for such items.


For larger jewels and flash, place a dab of silicon adhesive on the back and hold for a few minutes against the brick. Consider using fake pearls, pretend money, or feathers to call attention to these sparkling bookends. You could even top each brick with a small tiara.

, Once dried, the bookends are ready for display.

"
"
Select the desired photos.,
Print the pictures.,
Purchase or make two photo frames that are the same size as the brick.,
Place the pictures inside the frames and affix to the larger sides of the brick.,
Decoupage the brick sides and top with other photos.",How to Make Bookends out of Bricks5," The photos could be themed, such as a family holiday or a child growing up through the ages, or simply random photos you like. You will want two large pictures––one on each side of the brick (or four if you're creating two bricks) and then two or three smaller pictures for each side of the brick. Determine if you want to cover the top of the brick––if so, find another picture. Use a ruler to take measurements so you know how big to print your pictures.

, If your pictures are cataloged on your computer, print out enough pictures to cover both sides of each brick (two larger pictures), the two sides and top (several smaller pictures). Use camera-ready photo paper for the highest quality. Alternatively, have a photo store print the images for you.

, You will have a framed photo on each side of the brick and then you'll decoupage the rest of the pictures onto the brick itself. Consider using frames that do not have stands and flat back surfaces so they can be easily affixed to the brick.

, Use either liquid nails or silicone adhesive to make each frame stick. Hold in place for several minutes while it adheres and bonds to the brick.

, You may just like the look of the two pictures frames and stop there. However, if you want to add more family memories, brush one layer of decoupage on a cleaned brick surface and then affix your photos. Wait about 20 minutes for the solution to dry and then add another layer. Perform this step three or four times and then spray with acrylic sealer to complete the project.

"
"
Select the fabric.,
Wrap each brick as though you are wrapping a gift.,
Decorate if wished.,
Spray with a fabric sealant.,
Place the fabric brick bookends on the shelf to hold your books.

",How to Make Bookends out of Bricks6," As with the paper choice, be sure to use fabric that is suitable year-round and matches the décor. Of course, if you're happy to change the brick bookends regularly, you could also theme them to a season, such as using Christmas colors for the holiday season, then recovering the bookends post-Christmas. Stronger fabric is advisable, to prevent the likelihood of any rips or wrinkling. Fabric suggestions include:


Fabric direct from your fabric stash, scraps or other pieces
Scarves, old clothing that has been loved but is no longer wearable––a cozy look can be achieved by cutting up and old fluffy sweater
Sarongs or other clothing wraps
Old sheets––put those childhood Spiderman sheets to good use and wrap the bricks in a section that features Spidey.

, Instead of using tape to keep your work together, use a dab or two of liquid nails or silicone cement. You could also use a hot glue gun if you're gluing fabric to fabric. In each case, don't overlap the folded parts too much, to ensure that the brick still sits evenly.


You may want to sew the edges of a cut portion of fabric so they don’t fray or tear as time passes.

, Although optional, you can add additional items to the fabric covered brick, such as tying ribbon bands around each end or gluing on interesting decorations such as buttons, rhinestones, lace, etc.

, Although this step is optional, it will help to keep the fabric clean and make it easier to dust.

Create a 3-D look by affixing blocks and shapes to the brick using liquid cement.",How to Make Bookends out of Bricks7," Make a house, a face, your dog, a car––nearly any design can be made using liquid nails (or silicone adhesive) and found objects.


Check out a hobby store for small dollhouse pieces. Re-create a tiny library on the outside of each brick by purchasing a dollhouse bookshelf, chair and even a few doll book. Glue the bookshelf to the back of the brick and then affix the chair and other books to the side. You could even sit a small doll in the chair reading a book for extra interest.
Design a modern looking face or architectural structure using basic children’s blocks. Create interest by using a variety of color and shapes on each brick backing.

Submit your manuscript to publishers.Find the publishers you're interested on sending your work to, and contact them about your work.,
Self-publish your novel.",How to Make Your Own Book," The word 'book' is vague and could be taken many different ways. Are you looking to write a novel? A comic book? A picture book for children, or even adults? A manifesto on nihilism? If you are looking to make a book, chances are you'll already have some vague idea what you want to do.Books are most easily divided into two categories: Fiction and Non-Fiction.However there are many possible mediums you could go about either. Some books are highly visual, while others rely solely on the written word.;
, Digesting the art of other people is an integral (and often underrated) step in creating your own. If you've settled on a medium or genre, you should dive into a few books you think represent the best traits of that style. Place attention not just on the surface content of the writer's work (like plot and character) but the ways in which he brings it about-- through figures-of-speech, metaphor or flashback.


For instance, someone writing an existential tract may look into George Batailles or Albert Camus. A would-be fantasy writer may want to check out Michael Moorcock's Elric series.
If you like a trick an author uses in a certain work, make a note of it. Great writers borrow techniques from one another all the time; plagiarism only occurs when specific information is copied without due credit.

, No work of art was ever truly created in a vacuum. Even if your book is only being written to be read by yourself or another person, considering what the experience of reading your book will be like is a necessary part of planning. If you plan on eventually sending this work to a publisher or professional distribution, consider what they might be looking for in new releases. If you're writing it for your child, for example, try to imagine what it would be like to have your story read to you at bedtime.Doing some research into things like demographics and bestsellers will help you if you're serious about making a break into the bigger world of writing.

, If you are feeling a case of writer's block, play around with freewriting exercises.Let your mind go wild with ideas, and don't worry too much about the way it looks as a finished product. Also, there aren't many writers out there who won't swear by the beneficial effects of mild alcohol or coffee consumption to get the creative juices flowing.


Write using a train of thought. Get in touch with what you're thinking and write whatever pops into your head. Most of the time, you'll be able to trace a coherent sequence of ideas from it. , Before you get out of the ideation phase, it's important you stop and consider just how difficult it can be to make one a reality. Most projects that are started never see completion. This is usually due to the fact that real life concerns like work or relationship stress get in the way. What's more, you may lose inspiration quickly if the project's left idle for too long. Though the workload will depend on the type of book you're making, it's still a major commitment. Only try if you really think you're up to it., You can't write a book without first having a clear idea of what you're writing on. A book written senselessly cannot be satisfying to read from cover to cover. Take the ideas you thought up while planning and sequence them in a way that looks dramatic and interesting. All works, no matter how ambitious in nature, have a beginning, middle and end.Use inspiration from other works if you get stuck.


If your book is non-fictional, replace 'plot' with 'thesis' or 'information'. In many ways, forming a fiction and non-fiction book are very similar. It's all a process of getting your ideas together in a way that gives you some impression of what you'll be writing about when it comes down to the act itself.

, A basic outline will take the beginning, middle and end that you thought up during the plot creation, giving them more sense and structure. At this point, you should be putting all of your best ideas down on paper; you can't ensure they won't slip away if you don't give them some concrete form. Don't worry about the outline making sense to anyone but yourself. Most importantly, don't skim over the outlining process. It may not be as glamorous as the actual writing itself, but it will save you frustration down the road. A strong plan results in a strong execution.


Populate your outline with characters or ideas. With the basics down pat, you should see about opening up some of them. Fiction relies heavily on characters, so making separate outlines for each of your characters and how they evolve throughout the story can be helpful.

, When tackling something as potentially daunting as an entire book, a clever way of making the process feel more manageable is to break it down into parts. If you already have an outline of the events or ideas you'd like to cover in your book, it becomes a simpler thing to break those up into bite-sized chunks you think will be more helpful to yourself and the reader. If you find yourself struggling on deciding what will populate each chapter, you should return and add new detail to your framework.Try to give each chapter a title and a couple of lines detailing what will be inside of it. You don't have to use the chapter names in your finished product; they're simply there to give you a guideline on where to go when you're writing the final thing.

, At last, it's finally come time to give some weight to your ideas. However, your first attempt at a written work should be considered another outline in of itself. Try to write as freely as you can; don't censor yourself at all. Take each chapter on independently and write until you feel you've covered the points in sufficient depth. It's no worry if it seems a bit short at this point; doing your final draft will see a lot of these ideas expanded or changed altogether.

, Writing, whether as a profession or a hobby, is a majority part planning. If you've followed the steps so far, you'll probably agree. In any case, it's at this point where you should hunker down to write the finished product. It may take days, weeks or months, but enough hours invested will eventually see your literary dream take solid form. It's a good idea to give a set amount of time each day to work on it. Don't let yourself lose focus of what you want to do.A final draft is considered a macro edit, but you should give the finished copy another set of revisions after reading through it.

, Some people will know the name of their books before they write the first word. In other cases, the title may be the last thing you add. A really great title will pull a potential reader, without them knowing the slightest other thing about it. Think of great book titles like Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, or Tolkien's The Hobbit-- these are titles that stick in someone's head, regardless if they've actually read the book before. Be patient, and try to think of an economical, pithy way of summarizing your book in a few words or less.


Choose out a few words from inside your manuscript i you're having trouble. It's possible you've already written the title to your work in passing but didn't think at the time to point it out as such.

, The preferred style of title page depends on the type of book you're making.. If you intend on sending your book to a publishing house, the title page should be kept relatively basic. Make a title page that offers hint of what your book is about.Stick to the basics of work title, name, date and contact info, all written in large enough font to be read easily at arms' length. With a creative venture however, the possibilities are endless. If you're visually artistic, drawing up a doodle to go with the title adds a sense of style.
A title is obviously mandatory for any title page. No matter how adventurous you're getting with the title page design, make sure to make your title big and bold.

, Most of your favourite books-- from the pulpy fantasy fiction to the leatherbound classics-- probably have an attractive cover to them. While the common adage tells us not to judge a book by its cover, there isn't a book out there that hasn't been helped out if it's got an attractive look to boot. A sleeve should wrap around both sides of your book. If you're measuring out a sleeve yourself, consider the area of the book's spine as well.


For making a book at home, you should laminate a paper of your choice. Draw an appealing cover onto the sleeve if you have the artistic gusto for it, and don't forget to include important details like your name and the title of the book.
Keep in mind that cover sleeves are only really worthwhile if you're doing a fully DIY approach and aren't trying to send it over to a publishing house. If your book is published professionally, the publisher will look after things like cover sleeve and artwork.

, While some publishing houses may not have set requirements for the formatting of your manuscript, it is generally understood that the best looking submissions stand the best chance of acceptance. A poorly presented draft may be overlooked completely... even if the material itself is brilliant!


Adhere to standard font and size. Times New Roman in Size 12 is usually seen as the go-to format for text. Many professional writers prefer it because it's so easy to read.Number your pages. Page numbering cannot be overrated when you're sending a manuscript. In case the pages are dishevelled, someone on the receiving end of your literary masterpiece is going to need to know which pages fit next to which. A page heading (with author and title) doesn't hurt either.
Align and indent. Microsoft Word processors will align left and properly indent your pages by default, but in case you've dabbled with the settings at all, it's a good idea to make sure this is all in order before you print., Lastly, printing your masterpiece off is simple but essential to the plan, provided you've been doing any part of the project on a computer. Making sure that your ink cartridges are sufficient is a must, as people will become quickly aware as to the cause if the font starts getting faint by the book's end. If you lack sufficient printing equipment at home, local schools, libraries and internet cafes should be able to help you relatively inexpensively.


If you're sending the manuscript somewhere professional, it may not hurt to print using a slightly off-white type of paper; this way, you'll stand out amidst the sea of generic manuscripts.

, If you are making a DIY book, binding a book together may be in the cards. There are many ways to go about it; if you're interested in arts and crafts, construction paper and glue are your friends. Find cardboard to glue onto the back ends of your pages as a spine, and tape your laminated cover sleeve around the book binding.


Manuscripts for novels or non-fiction works that you intend on having published should not come with anything like this. Coil-binding the pages together with a basic title page will be enough. Anything too fancy or colourful in the package will detract from the potential seriousness of your work.

, It is surprising how many writers will try to get their work out there without first enjoying it for themselves. Though you've probably become all-too familiar with the characters and developments of your story via the editing process, there's a real charm in being able to relax and digest it for the first time as a consumer. If you've made it this far, you deserve the break.

, Give a copy of your manuscript to a few friends and get them to tell you what they think. Consider their edits, and give your manuscript a touch up if you deem it worthwhile.

, Whether through email or as a physical package, get your manuscript to them. Most publishing houses vastly prefer to receive submissions as well-manicured manuscripts. It's best to send them off to as many publishing houses as possible; even the ones you're not so keen on will offer you their own chances of making you big.


Publishing houses navigate through a huge array of submissions, so don't let yourself get too down if it takes them a while to get back to you.

, In the internet age, it's perfectly acceptable (and in some cases even preferable) to strike out on your own and self-publish your work online. Formatting your finished manuscript as a PDF and letting it loose on the internet is a possible way of getting your name out there. Sites like Amazon will offer you merchant opportunities for vending your finished ebook.Keep in mind, however, that you'll need to promote your book entirely on your own. If you're lucky, the novel will gain popularity through word-of-mouth, but you'll need to rely on yourself first and foremost if you plan on having success.

Revise the novel.",How to Write a Dystopian Novel," Dystopian novels often focus on current or future technology, and the impact it has on society. Maybe you are interested in self driving cars and what that will mean for people in the future. Or perhaps you want to focus on social media and the effects it will have or is having on society.Try taking a current technology and adding your own spin on it. You may add features to technology that complicate people’s lives or make it harder for them to connect.
You could also create your own version of an existing technology by adding elements to it. For example, you may create a communications network that runs on how many likes you get on social media.;
, Dystopian novels often examine a current global issue or problem and critique it. You may be interested in a global issue like climate change or the disparity between rich and poor. Ask yourself how you can explore the issue or problem in your novel. Use the problem as the theme for your novel.For example, you may tackle the issue of climate change by creating a world where cities are underwater and people live with a limited supply of oxygen.

, Use a social concern like gender or racism as the theme for your dystopian novel. Explore race and gender through your characters and your setting. You can also look at cultural issues like appropriation, corporate responsibility, or gentrification.For example, you may look at the effects of gentrification by creating a dystopian world where only a select group of young men thrive in modern, clean homes and the majority of women and old people live in sewers.

, Ask yourself, what if this happened and how would it affect our future? In a dystopian novel, the what if usually leads to dire consequences. Try to imagine what might happen if your “what if” came true.


For example, you may wonder, what if no one had any rights except for a select group of people? What if women were only used for reproduction? What if corporations ruled the world?

, To get a better sense of the genre, read several dystopian novels that have been successful. Try reading a variety of novels in the genre to get ideas and get inspired. You may read:


Brave New World by Aldous Huxley

1984 by George Orwell

The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins

The Earthseed Series by Octavia Butler

, Write down a detailed account of the rules and regulations of your fictional dystopian world. You can then refer to these notes as you compose the novel. Having a clear set of dos and don’ts will make it easier for you to immerse the reader in the world of the novel. It will also ensure you keep the world consistent and easy to follow. To create the rules, ask yourself:What are the laws of the world? Is there a legal system, and if so, what does it look like?
How are people punished for their actions? Does everyone receive the same punishment for their actions?
What is considered taboo in the world?

, A strong opening line will set the tone for the rest of the novel and draw the reader in. Come up with a first line that is descriptive and unique. It should shock or startle the reader so they pay attention and read on.For example, you may go for a descriptive, moody opening like the first line of William Gibson’s Neuromancer: “The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.”
Or you may go for first lines that gives character and personality like Chuck Palahniuk’s Choke: “If you’re going to read this, don’t bother. After a couple pages, you won’t want to be here. So forget it. Go away. Get out while you’re still in one piece. Save yourself.”

, Avoid making your dystopian novel just about the dystopian world. Have a protagonist that feels like the center of the story. Show them trying to survive in the dystopia. Make them the guide to the world for the reader. Having a strong main character will help readers feel a personal connection to the story.For example, you may have a main character who is employed by the shadowy government in control in the dystopian world. You may then show the main character struggling to help others overthrow the government.

, Do not simply let your minor characters feel like stand ins or caricatures. Make your minor characters just as detailed as your main character. Give your minor characters their own dramas, feelings, and conflicts to sort out. Show them struggling with the dystopian world and their role in it.For example, you may have a minor character who is the mother of the main character. She may try to help the main character succeed in overthrowing the shadowy government using her little known hacking skills.

, Put your reader in the dystopian world of the novel by describing how it smells, sounds, feels, looks, and tastes. Show your reader how it feels to walk in the world. Give your reader a sensory picture of the dystopian world so they can feel like they are really there.For example, you may describe the metallic smell of the government headquarters, run by robots. Or you may describe the charcoal taste of the food given to the poor and elderly.

, Use the dystopian aspects of the world to create conflict for your characters. The dystopian world should work against the characters so they feel trapped and restricted. They can then fight against the dystopia and try to get out of it or save others from it.For example, you may have a main character who tries to ignore the evil actions of the dystopian government until it affects their family. They may then decide to take on the government so they can free their family.

, Once you have a draft of the novel, spend time listening to how it sounds out loud. Read passages of it aloud to yourself and to others. Listen for any awkward sentences or shifts in tone, where the language or vocabulary changes. Notice if the novel has a sense of rhythm and pacing.

Reading the novel aloud can also help you catch spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors.

, Critiquing your own work can be difficult. Get feedback from others to help you revise the novel. Ask friends, peers, family members, and teachers to read the novel. Have them give you feedback on whether they found the novel engaging, well paced, well described, and enjoyable to read., Once you get feedback, spend time revising the novel so it is at its best. You may need to rewrite whole sections of the novel or move sections around to help with pacing and character. Be willing to pull the novel apart and rework it. It can take many drafts to get the novel to the state that you want it to be."

First make a color wheel (round or triangular) by following the instructions in How to Construct a Color Wheel.,
Make a page for each hue.,
Staple all the pages together with the color wheel on the front and the hues in order, as they are around the color wheel.

",How to Make Yourself a Color Reference Booklet1," To make yours a triangle, change the shape of only the outer circle into a triangle. Then make sure to paint magenta, yellow and cyan in the corners. Each straight side of the triangle contains colors which were made by mixing the two primaries in the adjacent corners. A straight line drawn between colors on opposite sides (or nearly opposite like red and blue) will take you closer to the black in the middle, which represents what will happen if you actually mix such colors.;
, On each page, you will draw a triangle, one straight side to the left, the opposite corner to the right. If making pages for all twelve colors is too much work, you can start with just magenta, yellow, and cyan, and perhaps red, green, and blue.


Draw a circle (or a space of any shape) at each corner, one in the center of each side, and one in the middle of the triangle.
Paint the top corner white, the bottom corner black, and the right-hand corner the bright version of the hue for that page.
Paint the space between the black and white gray. Paint the tint between white and your original color, and paint the shade between black and your original color. A tint is your original color mixed with white. A shade is your color mixed with either black or its complement (the opposite color on an accurate CMY/RGB color wheel). For more on mixing colors, see How to Mix Colors.
Finally, paint your muted color in the middle of the triangle. This is the one that has both white and black (or its complement) added to it. The triangle now shows differences in saturation (colorless to colorful) from left to right, and value (dark to light) from bottom to top.

Color on the computer works opposite of how it does for paints, so you'll have to translate.,
Staple all the sides with black, gray, and white together to make a book.

",How to Make Yourself a Color Reference Booklet2," The colors look different on the computer monitor, but when you print them, they will look very much the same as mixed paint colors. This is because your printer is using magenta, yellow, and cyan inks, which are pigments just like paint.

, Red and blue both at 100% make magenta. Blue and green make cyan. Red and Green make yellow. All three at 100% make white, and all three at 0% make black. This can be challenging at first, but you'll soon get the hang of it.

Firmly press the sheets together.,
Glue additional sheets of paper on to your foundation one at a time.,
Let the glue dry for 30 minutes.",How to Make Cardboard1," You'll need five sheets of paper and some glue. A glue stick or some craft glue will work the best.


The dimensions of your paper will affect the size of your cardboard, so use smaller paper if you want a smaller piece of cardboard.
Using more sheets of paper will result in thicker cardboard.
If using liquid glue, consider spreading out some newspaper to catch any glue that drips off of your cardboard.;
, Spread your glue on one side of a sheet of paper, then align a second sheet of paper and stick them together. The corners and edges should align as closely as possible. This will form the foundation for your cardboard.

, Run the heel of your hand across the foundation, both from the bottom of the page to the top and from side to side. Make sure all sides and corners are glued together.


If any edges or corners are loose, pull them apart as little as possible and add more glue. Reattach the sheets and press together again.

, Spread glue on the top page of your foundation, then align and attach another sheet of paper. Make sure to line up the corners and edges before sticking the pages together. Firmly press down on the foundation after each sheet of paper is added to make sure all of the paper is staying glued together. Continue to add sheets onto the foundation until your cardboard is the desired thickness.


Adding more sheets of paper will increase the thickness of your cardboard.

, Put your cardboard under a fan or in a warm location to speed up the drying process.


Be patient! If the glue doesn't dry completely your cardboard may fall apart.

The industrial process of making cardboard boxes uses a machine called a corrugator.,
The ridged sheet is made by running paper through the corrugator.,
A flat sheet of paper is glued to each side of the ridged sheet.,
The large sheet of corrugated cardboard is then cut based on the desired size and shape.",How to Make Cardboard2," Cardboard is simply a sheet of ridged paper sandwiched in between two sheets of flat paper. The corrugator organizes and assembles the three different sheets to make corrugated cardboard.The ridged paper increases the stability and durability of the cardboard while using a relatively small amount of paper.

, The machine heats the flat paper to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and pushes it through ridged rollers. The result is a sheet of paper with a repeating U-shaped design that will be used as the core of the cardboard., The corrugator applies a starch-based glue to one side of the ridged sheet, which is then pressed onto a sheet of flat paper. The same process is used to apply another flat sheet to the untouched side of the ridged sheet, creating the familiar corrugated sheet of cardboard., Further cuts and perforations are made to allow for folding into various shaped boxes and containers."

Acquire an oblong-shaped cardboard box and cut the ends off, so that you can place it around your body, over your chest and stomach.,
Get two leather straps or nylon strings and attach them to your box - using staples or quick-drying glue—so that they can be worn over your shoulders, holding the box in the right place (over your chest and stomach).,

",How to Make Cardboard Armour," Make sure the box is big enough to fit.;
, Make sure to measure them and cut them to the right length. Alternatively, you can use string for this step, as it will not be visible in the finished product. You now have a breast plate.

, Make sure that they are right size to fit over your shoulders. Tissue boxes could be ideal for this. Cut them out so there are two sides open on each one - so they can slip easily on to the shoulders, and not restrict arm movement too much. Also, they must be on firm enough to prevent them falling off at every opportunity. These boxes will form the spaulders—or shoulder plates.

, These will presumably need to be long and thin. They should be flexible at your leg joint—so you should create some sort of hinge there, possibly by cutting three sides and leaving the last.

, Cut out an oval shape for you to place your head through, and also the bottom end of the box, for you to put your neck through.

, This is by far the simplest part of the armour. You need to cut some thick cardboard into the shape of your shield. This can be square, kite-shaped, rectangular or any other shape you can think of.

, This will be rather too floppy for use on it's own, so you may want to attach a wooden stick to it.

, You will probably use a lot of silver paint, and possibly some black. Try painting some jewels, or a coat of arms, on your armour.

Choose an interesting topic.The subject of your pop-up book should be kid-friendly if you plan on giving the book to a child.,
Keep things simple.,
Plan the story out.,
Fold a sturdy piece of paper in half.,
Cut two parallel, horizontal slits in the center of the paper.,
Make your illustrations.,
Create as many pages as necessary.,
Write in the text.,
Decorate the background for each page.,
Cut and paste your pictures onto the tabs.,
Glue your pages together.,
Create an outside cover.",How to Make a Pop up Book," But what adult doesn't love a good 3D story?









It can either be fiction or non-fiction. If choosing fiction, you can either go with a short yet classic folk tale or you can write your own story. If choosing non-fiction, look for a subject that a child might find appealing, like space, dinosaurs, or animals.
You don't need to think of this as a tried-and-true ""book."" It can double as a letter, proposal, or a thoughtful addition to any gift.;
, Limit the number of pop-out elements you use to prevent your pages from looking cluttered or becoming too weak to stand. The fewer cuts you make in your pages, the more durable the pages will be.









Feel free to add other craft elements to make it better. But even too many of these can make your pages look busy and weigh them down unnecessarily.

, Create a storyboard. Write the story or script out on notebook paper, separating it into different paragraphs or lines when you anticipate needing a new page. Sketch out a rough draft of the illustrations you want to use for each page.









Before you actually create the book, it is important that you know how many pages you will need along with how many pictures you will need and where to put them.

, A 9-by-12-inch (23-by-30-cm) sheet of construction paper works well, but you can also use cardstock, thin poster paper, or scrap booking paper of just about any size.









The paper must be thicker than an ordinary sheet of printer paper. Fold the paper in half horizontally to create the book's cover.

, The slits should be about 2 inches (5 cm) long and spaced about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart. These slits will create a tab.








Open your paper. Position it vertically so that its height appears longer than its width. Use your finger or a thin pencil or pen to gently pry the tab forward.

, You can either draw and color the illustrations on separate sheets of construction paper or cardstock, or you can cut pictures from photographs, magazines, or recycled picture books and paste those pictures onto sturdier cardstock.









Make sure that the pictures you create or use roughly correspond to the size of your book page. Also make sure that you have all the characters and images you need for your entire book, rather than the single page.
Set aside an empty space at the bottom of the page for text. If you plan on having a child write the story out, you may want to use a ruler to draw lines to make it easier for him or her. You could also glue a portion of lined notebook paper in the space.

If you plan on writing it out yourself, however, you can leave the space blank or print text out from your computer and paste it onto the page later.



, Use the same folding and cutting technique to create as many pages as you need to bring the tale to an end.









Review your story. Make sure that you have the illustrations and pictures planned out accurately as well as the text. Also make sure that you have enough pages created!

, Go through the pages and write or paste the text to the bottom of each page.









If you have more text than you have room for, attach a piece of paper that folds out upon opening to the too-small text area. Problem solved!

, Sketch the background out in pencil before coloring it in with your coloring medium of choice. Leave the tabs blank.









If you have a good eraser, go back and erase your pencil lines after completion.

, Cut out the pictures and illustrations you created. Glue the back of each one onto its corresponding tab. Do not allow it to get stuck to the background portion of the page, however. Then it won't pop!









If you're using runny glue, be sure not to use too much. Apply the glue to the tab and not the picture; that way you won't risk getting glue above or below the tab.

, The pages need to be glued together back to back. The top outer half of the second page would be glued to the lower outer half of the first page. The top outer half of the third page would be glued to the lower outer half of the second page. Continue this pattern until all the pages are attached to one another.









Do not glue any of the pop up tabs together, though, since doing so will prevent them from popping up.

, Fold a sheet of heavy paper that is slightly larger than the rest over the book. Slide the folded paper away from the book, decorate the back and front outer covers, and then glue the back and front inner covers to the first and last pages of the book.









This, of course, is entirely optional. If you're using it as a story-like letter or other purpose, a cover may be unnecessary.
Enjoy! Once the glue has dried completely, the book is ready to be read.

You need not reinvent the wheel; tricks other writers have used may prove useful to your own efforts.


Maurice Sendak's Where the Wild Things Are is a great picture book to read for inspiration. It's got a simple but enticing story, and gorgeous visuals to back it up.;
, For picture books, a gripping idea is the most important early factor in a picture book's success. If the idea appeals to you, it will reflect in your art and writing. Likewise, if the idea itself appeals to your readers, they'll feel that much more interested to read your book. Think of a great high concept to build your book around. Possible topics could regard aliens, animals, fairy tales or even history.Picture books are most often written for ages ranging from 1-8 years. Keep that in mind while you formulate your story. Children aren't likely to appreciate highfalutin references to Marcel Proust so much as pure, straightforward storytelling.Recognize the limitations of a picture book. Your story is going to have to be very simple to fit into a picture book, which may prove a challenge if you're used to longer forms of writing.
If you're struggling with finding the perfect idea, go for a walk or read some existing picture books. Failing that, talking to a child can sometimes result in surprisingly handy creative input.

, Although picture books are usually 32 pages in length, only 24 of those will be for the story itself; the others are usually for things like the title and copyright information. You won't suffer any limitation if you're making one at home, but you should still have a clear idea how many pages you'll need to tell your story. Draw up a basic storyboard of what you may like your story to look like, and find ways to expand or contract your ideas as you deem fit.It's much easier to write a picture book if you clearly know what each page is supposed to be about from the get-go.

, The best picture books ware simple, yet somehow profound with the stories they tell. Think of Dr. Seuss' books; they were always very simple narratives, but the ideas used carried a lot of weight. Think of a high concept that involves something that would appeal to a wide variety of ages.Even if you feel tempted, try not to turn the story into a morality tale. Very few readers are going to be genuinely interested in reading a veiled lesson in etiquette or behaviour.
If you're more of an illustrator than a storyteller, you can always illustrate an existing story. There are countless picture books on the market that are based on classic fairy tales.
Inspiration for stories can be found by immersing yourself in media. Films, music and books are all willing templates for your own stories.

, Most stories need interesting characters to populate the action with. Having spent some time mulling up a plot, the characters should come relatively naturally. While you should have a basic idea of the role each character will inhabit in the story, it's important to give them each a personal flavour. The best characters are easy to imagine having a life of their own beyond the confines of the narrative.While you're concocting characters, you should also be thinking of the way they'll look in your illustrations. Visually drab characters with a rich psychological profile probably aren't suited for a picture book.
Animals are very popular to use in children's picture books. Animals have a universal appeal, and anthropomorphizing them to fill human role makes them less offensive to some readers. Speaking generally, animals are also more interesting to draw.

, Using a word processor, write up the story as you see fit, dividing it into a clear beginning, middle and end.At this stage of writing, you needn't worry about the proper choice of words. You're just trying to get the ideas into a basic framework. From there, you'll be able to add a writer's tone and boost your wordplay.


Keep your word count around the 500 word mark. Anything more will be difficult to fit into the book and will distract from the illustrations. It's best to be tactical and efficient with your word choice.

, With your narrative all written out, you need to divide it into as many pages as you have for the story in your book. Include at least one action per panel; anywhere from one to four sentences per page should be great.

, It will be much easier to edit out your work now that it is separated into smaller sections. Focus on one section at a time, and transform the template you have into writing with style and form.While the specifics will really vary depending on your tone as a writer and the subject matter, keeping it concise and poetic is usually essential for picture books.


Use simple, effective language that benefits the illustrations you'll be including. Simple rhymes are helpful, but don't build your writing around them specifically. A mediocre rhyme is worse than no rhyme at all.
Alliteration is an easy trick, and makes the writing sound more melodious.

, When it comes to illustrating, you need to keep the dimensions of your pages in mind to make the most of it. This includes leaving enough space for the text, and making your drawings big enough that they occupy an acceptable amount of space on the page.To get a better grasp of this, it's a good idea to make miniature 'storyboards' to visualize how big certain objects on the page should be when compared to others.


Doing a double-page illustration (where one panel of the story encompasses two pages to make a larger image) is an ambitious move if this is your first time making a picture book, but it's perfect for climactic parts of the story that somehow warrant more than a single frame.

, Before you even set them to paper in a serious way, you should have a very clear idea how you want your art to occupy space on the page. Having a notebook on the side to plan out and develop your ideas freehand is far preferred over jumping into the picture book impromptu. While you're planning out the illustrations, try to make them as close and applicable to the writing as possible. Whenever you're left in doubt, refer to what you've written in the story.Try to keep a consistent tone and style throughout the book. A picture book that goes all over the place will stand a much weaker chance of making an impression than one that drives the same point consistently.

, The vast majority of stories center around the exploits of characters. For most traditional narratives, you'll need to get really good at drawing (and redrawing) a handful of characters. It is recommended you spend some time practicing your character designs once you have a basic framework for your story. The more you draw the character, the more chances you'll have to get the look right and change things if need be.Visual design is incredibly important for characters in picture books. If you have trouble visualizing what your story's characters look like, try meditating and letting the story play out in your head. Failing that, studying the character design in other books may give you the inspiration you need., Making a picture book at home, there are lots of thing you can do to inject life into your art. You don't have to rely solely on pen and markers; other things, like tape and glued construction paper, can turn your picture book into three-dimensional art.For depth-perspective backgrounds, cut out shapes of construction paper and carefully glue them onto your background. Three-dimensional craftwork is particularly effective when you're trying to realize things like mountain ranges or hills.


If you take a liking to this type of crafts work, you could do your entire illustrations this way. Smaller details with tape or construction paper will take a much greater degree of skill to pull off however.

, If done right, planning should have taken a long time to complete. This will take a great deal of the guesswork out of your illustrating. Using your plans and storyboards as a starting point, realize your illustrations as best as you can, leaving clear space to fit your text. Should you get a couple of pages in and don't like the look of it, you can start over again or go back to practicing before retrying.


Practice is super important before you start drawing the book itself. If the images get progressively better as the book goes on, it'll show the reader that the book was more of a learning process than a finished product. Whatever you do, keep your illustrations consistent in tone and relative quality.
Be sure to be as colourful as you can, unless the content of the picture book somehow suggests against it. Picture books need to be eye-catching above all else, and monochromatic sketches are going to leave less of an impression than full-bodied, coloured-in images.

, The title page should be eye-catching and bold. It needs to be something that captures the tone and essence of your picture book, all the while getting people hooked for whatever may lie between the covers. Take extra time to make the front cover as strong as possible; make it the best demonstration of your skills as an illustrator. And don't forget to make the title itself big and prominent on the page. You're definitely going to want people to know what they're reading.


Professional picture books have a front cover and title page separately. For the sake of an at-home book, these two should be merged into one.
Adding your author's credits near the book title is always recommended, even for at-home creations.

, It is perfectly reasonable to leave your loose pages as is, so long as they're numbered and collected in one place. Making a bona fide book requires at least some regard to the physical package however. While the possibilities for bookbinding are endless, most picture books favour a hardcover. This can be done at home by taking a thin piece of cardboard and folding it into two halves, with a small creased strip in the middle to make the spine. Cut out the cardboard to match your picture book's size and glue your front and back page to the respective sides of the cardboard.If you're making the book with the specific intent of getting it physically distributed by a publisher, you need not worry about your own package. Just make sure the pages are as well maintained as possible, and digitally scanned if necessary.

, To make your pages a book, you need to bind them all together somehow. The way you go about this will depend on the material style you're attempting for the picture book. If you want the content to stand on its own without a package, you can put a hole in the top-left corner of each page, run a length of string through it and tie it together at the ends. Giving it a more thorough binding with a coil-wrap is preferred if you think the book is going to see a lot of handling.It's a good idea to number your pages from the onset. Nothing can mess up a book faster than putting the pages in the wrong order.
If you decided to give your book a spine and hardcover, you can glue the ends of your paper to the spine by folding the long edge of the paper back by a centimetre and applying a thin strip of adhesive.

, In the current age, it's actually much easier for new authors to put their picture books online as a digital version. Abode Acrobat and Microsoft are both recommended programs to use if you decide to go this route. Scan the completed pages you have for your book, and arrange them as you will in the file.Finishing your book off digitally offers some benefits. For the title and text, you'll be able to type it out over the scanned image if you haven't done it by hand already. Provided you have a basic understand of graphic design programs, you can also edit the size and dimensions of your pictures.

, Some would say a book does not truly exist until it is being read and enjoyed. In the internet age, there are lots of ways you can show off your work. Scanning the images and compiling them into a PDF file as an ebook means you'll be able to distribute (and possibly sell!) your work without an overhead cost. Sites like StoryJumper offer a platform for people to promote their picture books.Then again, it may be more special to leave the book as a one-of-a-kind and offer it as a gift.

Get a piece of regular paper and fold in into quarters; first fold it in half one way, then unfold it and fold it in half the other way.,
Unfold it again; you should have two creases making a cross on your paper.

,
Now take the two shorter ends of the paper- if you're holding it the way you would a piece of printer paper, that should be the top and the bottom- and fold them towards the crease in the middle.

,
Line them up so that the ends are lined up with the crease; fold them down and unfold.

Cut out two sheets of paper.",How to Make a Homemade Book1," For your first book, cardboard is easy to work with. Once you get the hang of it, you can move to wood or game boards.









The cover needs to be 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) wider and ½ inch (1.25 cm) longer than the inside pages. If you are using printer paper, it should be 8 ¾"" x 11 ½"" (22.2 x 31 cm).;
, Then, sew them together at the crease in a figure-8 pattern. Make sure you start and end at the same point and the knot faces inside. This will create a spine.









1/4"" (0.6 cm) is an adequate width.

, Make sure they are properly aligned. Press them down between some heavy books and measure the width of the spine.









Once they are flattened, sew the stacks together using the same formation.

, It should be as long as the pages and ¾"" (2 cm) wider than the spine.








, Use plenty, but not so much that it drips. Stick the fabric to the spine of the pages. Pull it tight. Run a ruler along it to smooth out any bubbles.









Place the book between sheets of wax paper and underneath a heavy book or two. Wait for the glue to dry. Allow it 20 minutes or so.

, Before you do this, make sure the glue from the fabric is dry. Also, be sure the pieces of cardboard are aligned with each other and also with the spine.








, They should be as long as the cardboard pieces and ¾ of an inch (2 cm) wider than the piece of fabric holding the pages together. Glue these to the spine on top of the cardboard and press them into the first piece of fabric.









Again, place the book between pieces of wax paper and underneath the heavy books. Wait to dry.

, It should be 2 inches (5 cm) wider than both the covers and the spine combined, and two inches longer than the cover.








, Make four slits in the paper to allot for the spine (which cannot be folded over upon), removing any excess.









Cut the paper so the spine is covered but so there is no paper directly above or below it. You should now have four flaps — two above the book and two below.
Fold these flaps down and glue them to the inside cover.

, They should be 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) narrower than the cover and ½ inch (1.25 cm) shorter. Glue it to the inside cover so that it covers what the cover paper doesn't, and so that it sits flush to the spine.









After all of it is dry, decorate it however you want!

Gather your materials.,
Lay out your blank paper.,
Grab the scissors.,
Cut along the lines you just drew.,
Make your outside covers.,
Glue the cardboard onto the pretty paper.,
Fold in the sides.,
Start on the inside covers.,
Hole punch two holes into the binding.,
Thread a ribbon through the holes using the Japanese bookbinding method.",How to Make a Homemade Book2," Everything for this project can be bought at craft supply stores and nothing is more than a few dollars. Clean off the kitchen table and grab the following:









Blank paper (30-100 sheets, depending on your book's thickness)
2 sheets of cardboard
2 sheets of pretty paper (2 types)
Ribbon - a few feet long, 6 mm (1/4"") wide
Hole-punch
Glue stick
Scissors
Ruler
Bull clips

, Depending on what type of book this is, you'll want thinner or thicker paper; you'll also need to consider how many sheets. For a photo album, around 30. For a journal, 50 or more.








, Cut out two sheets of cardboard that match the measurements of your blank paper. No dimension is too small or too big. Though if it's so big it's hard to carry, you've probably gone too far.









Draw two vertical lines on one of the cardboard pieces. 1"" (2.5 cm) from the left edge, draw the first line from top to bottom. The second line should be just under 1 ½"" (3.5 cm) from the left edge and going parallel to the first one. Do this on the other piece of cardboard as well.

These lines are very close to each other. This is to separate the bind from the body of the book, creating a hinge.



, That is to say, remove the ½"" (1.25 cm) between the two lines. Discard the excess cardboard. You now have two pieces of cardboard, one being 1"" wide.









A craft knife may be easier than scissors. If you have one, use it.

, Get two pieces of fancy, decorated paper for your front and back covers and cut to size. Each piece should be 1 ½"" (3.8 cm) longer and 1 ½"" wider than the inside pages. If your blank paper is 8"" by 10"" (20 by 25 cm), cut your decorative paper to 9 ½"" by 11 ½"" (24 by 29 cm) size.









Place one of your fancy pieces of paper face-down. You should be staring at a blank canvas. With a pencil, draw a ¾"" (2 cm) border in all the way around the sheet.

, Line it up with the border you drew in the previous step (that's why you just did that). Make sure that you cover the entire page with glue, not just the edges. A mess won't accumulate if you use a glue stick.









This will be the back cover. The ½"" (1.25 cm) gap in the cardboard that you cut out previously will be the ""hinge"" that makes the book open and open easily.

Apply the glue to the paper if you're using wrapping paper (or other thin, pretty paper). This prevents wrinkling and swelling and gives the paper time to get used to the moisture in the glue before application on the cardboard.


Repeat for the front cover. Make sure the pattern is facing the right direction!

, With the cardboard centered on the paper, fold in the corners over as far as they'll go. Glue them in place, creating little triangles of decorative paper that are resting on the corners of your cardboard.









Once the corners are folded, start on the sides. Folding the corners first creates a geometrical, stream-lined fold. Sort of looks like gift-wrapping.
Do this for both sides and glue everything in place. There should still be a ½"" gap between the two pieces of cardboard.

, Cut out two sheets of decorative paper that are ½"" (1.25 cm) smaller than the blank paper. If your blank paper is 8"" by 10"" (20 by 24 cm), cut out the paper for the inside-covers to be 7 ½"" by 9 ½"" (19 by 23 cm).








, Depending on what and how many materials you use, this could be very easy or very difficult. They should be about 1 ½"" (3.8 cm) from either edge.









If you don't have a hole punch (and preferably a single hole punch), you can use a drill. But before you drill a hole into the table, place it onto something you're comfortable drilling into, like a phone book. If you do use a drill, place the covers inside out so that the rough edges are on the inside.
Use bull clips to hold everything together.

, The ribbon should be six times longer than the book is tall. If your book is 6 inches (15 cm) tall, your ribbon should be 36 inches (90 cm) long. Once you've completed this, you're finished!









Place it down through the top hole. Leave a length on the right for a bow.
Place the same end down through the same hole again.
Thread the same end down through the bottom hole.
Thread the same end down through the bottom hole again.
Wrap it underneath and down through the bottom hole once more.
Pull the same end through the top hole. (A criss-cross pattern forms along the spine.)
Wrap it over the top of the book and tie with the other end in a knot. It should sit on top of the hole.
Tie in a bow.

Design a unique thumbprint art project as the guestbook.,
Record your event from your guest’s point of view with a photographic guest book.",How to Make a Creative Guestbook," You and your pals prefer to live online and want to share the day with others who perhaps could not attend? Create a guestbook blog that can be posted to Facebook, Instagram or Twitter for the rest of your friends to see.


Establish your guestbook blog on WordPress. Visit the WordPress website and follow the directions to set up a blog. Consider a name that characterizes your event.
Designate an area for the “guestbook” blog to be housed. Like with a traditional guestbook you may need a table or podium but instead of the book you’ll need to have a laptop for guest entries.
Create a card with a few instructions so your non-tech savvy guests can still participate.
Be sure you have a power source to back up your laptop (and you won’t have to constantly be checking to make sure the laptop battery doesn't expire).;
, Taken from the notion of writing well wishes with lipstick on the bathroom mirror. Ideal for a bachelorette party or shower.


Purchase an in expensive mirror from the bed and bath store. Consider the number of guests that will be attending the party to determine the mirror size.
Buy several tubes of lipstick in a variety of colors. You could even pick up a few funky colors like green or blue lipstick so guests can add a special splash of color.
Stand mirror in a designated area and fill a nearby bowl with lipstick tubes. Include a small sign telling guests what to do.

, Let your guests say it out loud by spray painting their name and well wishes on a large board at your party. Fun for a teen party or a casual bar mitzvah, the graffiti board can be transformed into a work of art for your teen’s room after the event is over.


Purchase a large piece of plywood from the local hardware store. Consider having the edges sanded down to avoid giving your guests splinters if they run their hand over the board.
Paint the background of the board. A hot pint background might be fun for your teen girl or you could paint the background black and give your guests neon colors for their message.
Purchase dozens of spray paint cans. Depending on the number of guests, you may want to purchase two to three cans per two or three guests. Also, paint pens should be included for a more intricate design.

, This guestbook could work in nearly every setting providing a unique approach to the typical guestbook.


Purchase a small mailbox from the local toy, hobby or hardware store. Depending upon your event, you could find an adorable children’s play mailbox at a toy store or a crafty mailbox from the craft store.
Create small notecards and envelopes for guests to complete. Make sure the cards fit through the mailbox slot and provide enough room for messages.
Set up a small sign or adorable chalkboard with instructions on what to do. Include a small bowl of pens so guests can easily write messages.

, This activity may be fun for a children’s party or an event where guests are not dressed to the nines. Adults may not be as inclined to put ink on their thumb to sign a guest book but kids would love it.


Purchase an empty journal or bound book with white pages from the local bookstore. This will be your guest book so look for a book that provides your guests with enough room to express themselves.
Buy several ink pads, colored pens, stickers, glitter and glue sticks. Gather as many craft supplies to allow your guests’ imagination to run wild.
Create a sample of what you want on the guestbook table. Design your own thumbprint people with a message to use as a sample. Prop your design on a small easel that is on display next to the guest book. Have bowls of pens, ink pads and craft supplies on hand for easy access.

, Photo booths are a fun way to record the mood and feeling at your event. Ask guests to paste their photo and well wishes in a book after they’ve been striking a pose in the booth.


Rent a photo booth from a local vendor for your event. Photo booth rental prices may vary so obtain up to three quotes from reputable vendors before making a decision.
Set up a table next to the photo booth at your event and include a large, bound book with empty pages, glue sticks and pens.
Post a small note that asks guests to leave a photo and a message inside the blank book.

Be sure your folds are even and you crease each one well. Consider sliding your fingernail or something hard such as the edge of a pencil over the crease.
Start by folding the paper so that it is long and skinny (long edge folded to long edge).
Then fold the paper in half short edge to short edge.
Fold the paper in half again, short edge to short edge.;
, You will see eight separate panels. These will become the pages of your book.








, You should fold the paper in half the opposite way from your first fold.








, Place the paper so that the folded edge is facing you. Then cut along the vertical fold seam in the middle of the paper until it intersects the horizontal fold seam.









Be sure you stop cutting at the horizontal seam. You are just cutting a slit in the paper, you are not cutting it all the way across.

, It should now have the original eight fold panels, but there should be a slit down the center of the paper, between the middle four panels.








, Repeat your very first fold. The cut part of the paper should fall along the middle of the folded edge.








, Turn your paper so that the cut edge is up in the air. Then push the two ends toward each other. Separate the two middle seams from each other.








You will need to reverse the direction of the fold on one of the seams.
Push the two ends towards each other until you have 4 “wings” moving outward from the center, like a cross or an X., Choose two adjacent “wings” of the paper and push them towards each other, enclosing the other pages of the book inside them.








, If you would like for the book to hold its shape, you may want to bind your book using staples or string (see “Binding Your Book” below).








"
"
Decide how many pages you would like your book to be.,
Choose the paper for your book.,
Fold your paper in half.,
Nest the pages of your book.,
Staple your book sections.,
Line up your book sections.",How to Make a Paper Book2," The number of pages you want will determine how much paper you need. Six to twelve sheets of paper make a twelve to twenty-four page book (including title pages).









Knowing the purpose for your book will help you decide the appropriate number of pages.
Consider also having one sheet of special or colored paper that you can use as the book cover.
You can use more than 12 pages, but binding may become more difficult with more pages.

, Plain white printer paper works well, but depending on the purpose of the book, you may want to select another kind of paper.









This guide assumes that you will be using standard letter sized paper (8.5”x11”), but other sizes may work as well.
Paper with a heavier weight (thickness) may be more durable than printer paper.
Resume paper or paper with a colored finish provides a nice visual effect if you plan to give the book as a gift.
Avoid using lined notebook paper if possible. The lines will be vertical and the paper book will not look as nice as it would with other paper.

, Fold each page of the paper you have chosen short end to short end.








Folding each page individually will give you a cleaner crease and more even lines than trying to fold all of the pages together at once.
Be sure the edges of the page are lined up nicely before making your crease.
Sharpen your crease by running your fingernail along it, or by sliding a hard object such as a pen or pencil along the edge.

, Put the halves inside of each other. If you have more than six sheets of paper, create sets of pages with no more than six sheets each.









If you nest more than six pages together, the inner pages will start to protrude beyond the outer pages and your book will not look neat.
If you have an even number of pages, try to make even sets of book sections (for example, 2 sets of 6, 3 sets of 4, or 4 sets of 3 pages).

, For a sturdier final project, you may want to staple each book section at this point. Place at least two staples as close to the edge of each section as you can get.









Try to stagger the staple placement on the sections so that there is not a bulge from a stack of staples all together when you bind the sections together.
Depending on your binding technique, this step may not be necessary. If you will be taping, it is necessary.

, Be sure that you carefully line up the sections of your book. Place the folded edges of the book sections together.









Check all edges for neatness and uniformity. If one of the pages is sticking out, it may not have been folded neatly. You may want to replace it with a more carefully folded page.

"
Cover your book.,
Tape the pages of your book together.,
Tape the cover onto your book.,
Use string or ribbon to bind your book.",How to Make a Paper Book3," Select a piece of paper that you will use for your book cover. Consider using colored paper or paper with a heavier weight or decorating the cover with stamps, stickers, or other personal touches.








Prepare your book cover by folding it in half short end to short end and sharply creasing the edge.
When you put the cover on your pages depends on the type of binding you choose.

, This method is particularly useful if your book has multiple page sections that have been stapled together.









Cut a piece of sturdy tape, such as duct tape, slightly longer than your book.
Carefully place the tape on the front of the book spine and wrap it around the back, so that half of the tape is on each side of the front and back book page.
Cut excess tape from above and below the book.

, If you want to affix a cover to the book sections you have taped together, begin by placing the folded cover of the book over the taped book section pages.









Cut two pieces of tape the same length of the book.
Fold the tape in half long ways, sticky side out.
Open the back of your book and place the folded tape along the crease on the inside back cover. One side of the tape will be on the inside of the back cover and one side will be on the outside of the last inner page.
Open the front cover of your book. Place the second piece of tape, also folded lengthwise sticky sides out, along the crease between the inside front cover and the outside of the first inner page.
Close the book and firmly run your hand along the folded edge to secure the taped pieces.

, With this method, you do not need to staple or tape your individual book sections.









If you are using a cover, place the folded cover over the stacked book sections.
Use a hole puncher to punch holes in the entire book where you would like the binding to be. The holes should be close to the folded edge of the book, but be sure you do not punch the folded spine.
Make at least two holes. You can have more if you would like, but be sure the holes are spaced apart evenly so that the binding is aesthetically pleasing.
If you have more than six pieces of paper, you may want to punch holes in each book section separately, but be sure to measure where the holes go so that they will align neatly when you combine the sections.
For shorter journals, try using decorative brads through the punched holes.Thread string or ribbon through the holes in your book and tie neatly. String can be woven in and out of multiple holes, then run down the back cover of the book along the spine and tied together, or separate small bows can be tied for each hole, with the string going through a hole, around the spine of the book, and being tied to itself.For much longer journals, consider sewing the book sections together with strong thread by punching holes in each section and passing needle and thread in and out of the holes until all sections are bound together."

Your topics could be as general as “a children’s book about a zebra” or as specific as “a historical-fiction novel about George and Martha Washington’s courtship.” At this stage in the process, every idea is a good idea! If you are struggling to come up with ideas, draw inspiration from your own life. What are your interests? Do you have a secret passion for car racing or anime? Draw ideas from you childhood memories. Dramatize your first trip to the zoo or your first swimming lesson. After creating a list of potential subjects, select a topic from the list that grabs your attention. You will dedicate the next few weeks, months, or years to writing about the topic, so pick a topic that excites you!To determine if your idea has legs, write an elevator pitch, a short, to-the-point speech about your topic. If it sounds innovative, thrilling, and or interesting as an elevator pitch, it should make an excellent story!If you are struggling to come up with a topic or narrow the list down to one topic, step away. Take your mind off of the book by exercising, shopping, or completing household chores. When you feel ready to tackle the task, return to the list refreshed, refocused, and re-energized!;
, Identifying your audience may give your book direction and focus. You would not write the same story for children, young adults, and adults. The plot of a children’s book would be far less complex than the plot of an adult novella. Once you have selected your ideal age group, determine which faction of the age group is your target audience. Is your reader male or female? Does your ideal reader like mysteries, thrillers, romances, or sci-fi? Once you have identified your audience, create fictional reader profiles. Name your fictional readers and give each one a back story. Note their age, sex, education level, their likes, dislikes, and hobbies. Keep their profiles handy throughout the brainstorming and writing process. You will find yourself asking, “would Jason like this character?” or “will Stephanie laugh at this line?”, Your characters will bring your story to life! Create interesting characters capable of driving the plot forward. Create a stellar and complex protagonist and a brilliant antagonist. Develop your supporting characters too! Create a detailed profile for each character you create. Find or draw a picture of the character. Don’t simply state surface level details. It is not enough to state that a character is tall, blonde, and an attorney. That information provides limited insight into the character’s personality! Instead, provide information on their family history, the academic career, their job, their worst fear, their favorite foods. Keep these profiles out while you write. Spending time on the minor details—the little things, the imperfections—will make your characters more interesting and relatable!, Writing a book of any length requires planning! Outlines will help you remain focused throughout the writing process and they will prevent you from straying from your plot. Get creative and use your strengths. If you are a visual person, develop a storyboard. If you are a more logical person, develop an outline organized by headings and subheadings, points and subpoints.When outlining, keep in mind that every plot has 5 sections: an inciting incident, complications, a climax, an anti-climax, and a conclusion. Construct your story arc around these 5 sections. Develop an incident that launches your book. Create complications that test your protagonist. Craft a climax that brings the conflict between the protagonist and the antagonist to an exciting peak. Tie up loose ends throughout the anti-climax. Bring your book to a close in the conclusion.You could also make a flowchart, use bullet points, write on note cards, create a concept map.
Sometimes it is helpful to create multiple forms of an outline. Each type of outline forces you to think through your story in a slightly different way. Storyboarding requires you to visualize the plot and your characters; flowcharts force you to consider how one subplot flows into the next subplot.
Don’t aim for perfection. Outlines are meant to be rough sketches of your story!

, Your topic will never be completely novel. To avoid completely reproducing a published work, research the market. Find 3 to 5 books that are similar to your topic and read them. Analyze how the plots differ from your plot. Determine if and how your characters are unique and innovative. Identify what makes your book special in comparison to all the other thrillers or romances on the shelves.If you are struggling to identify your book’s individuality, don’t panic. Revision is a natural part of the writing process! Return to your outline and be willing to make changes to your plot and characters. Your work will be stronger as a result of these alterations!
Don’t get disappointed when you discover a book with a similar plot. There is nothing new under the sun!

, Revisions may be stressful and frustrating, but they are always necessary! Review your outline with a critical eye and a red pen. Does your story flow? Is the climax exciting? Does the plot reach a logical conclusion? Is the conclusion too obvious? Are there any tangential sections or subplots that should be cut? Are your characters developed enough? Do you need to develop more characters? Is the setting appropriate? Will my audience enjoy the finished product? After critiquing your outline, make any necessary changes.If you feel too close to your work, ask a friend to look it over for you. They may be able to identify any plot holes or tangential sections.

, While it is ideal to write every day, it is not practical for everyone. Consider your commitments and set a realistic goal for yourself. Determine how frequently you will write. Decide if you will have time to write every day, twice a week, or just once in awhile. Some weeks or months you will have more time. Be flexible. If you see an opportunity to write for an hour, grab it!

, Set a realistic word count goal per writing session. This goal is meant to keep you accountable, focused, and progressing towards the completion of your work. If you are a slower writer, your word count goal may be 1000 words per session. If you only have one hour to devote per session and you are a speedier writer, set a word count goal of 1500 to 2500 words per session. If you are setting aside 4 to 8 hours a day to write, aim for 5,000 to 10,000 words per session.Don’t stress over failing to reach your goal in the allotted time. Instead, remain positive and try to meet the goal during your next session.

, Find a quiet place, free of distractions, and write!Don’t stress about comma placement or noun-verb-agreement. Just get words down on the page and edit later. Have your outline, audience profiles, and character profiles out on your workspace in case you need to look up a detail here or there.


If you are feeling stuck or having a hard time getting started, join a writing workshop. Talk over your problems with other experienced writers; get feedback on your work.Use one word file instead of multiple word files. Keeping your work together in one place will generate a sense of continuity. Plus, if you make a change to your plot that impacts an earlier chapter, all you have to do is scroll up to make the alteration., Open a new word document and copy-paste your novel into it. This will allow you to preserve each version of your work. Read through the document at a pace you are comfortable with. Some writers like to revise in one sitting, while others revise their work over the course of a day or week. Search for typos and grammatical errors. Pay attention to the flow of the story—are there any plot holes, is there a scene that needs to be removed, and is your climax at an appropriate point in the story? Read your dialogue carefully—does it sound realistic, does each character have a consistent voice, and is it easy to follow? After revising your book once, set it aside for a day before making your next set of revisions. When you feel confident with the story, declare it “finished.”A work is never completely finished, but at some point you must stop striving to perfect it.
If you struggle to edit your work with a critical eye, ask a colleague, friend, or family member to serve as your editor.

, Bookmaking comes with conventions that are hundreds of years old. Your readers will expect that your book follows these conventions. Before designing your book, educate yourself on the art of bookmaking! You will learn that every book has a cover page and a copyright page. The odd pages should always be on the right and even pages should be on the left. Your text should be justified instead of left aligned. Page through 15 to 20 books that a produced with a similar audience in mind. Study the books’ formats. Make note of the elements you like and the ones you dislike., If you feel unsure of your design skills, hire a professional book designer. If you are not particularly tech-savvy, consider using an online service that offers you a guided design experience and will even print the book for you! If you wish to have control over the entire process of designing the book, create the book’s look yourself. When creating your own book, you assume responsibility for every element. Remain organized and detail oriented throughout the process.

, When creating your own book, consider using Microsoft Word or InDesign. Both platforms allow you to create the book with a template. Rely on your research to guide you through the decision making process. Will your book be hardcover or paperback? What fonts will you use? Where will the page numbers be located? How will you format your chapters? How will you incorporate illustrations? These questions may appear menial, but your attention to detail will pay off! Once you have made your design decisions, start creating and styling the book. Don’t be afraid to revise your design during the process., There are several methods of printing a book. You could choose to print your book at home. You may decide to send the book to a print shop. You could have an online service print and bind your book. A professional printing press could mass produce your book. Select the option that is right for your budget and the scale of the print job.

, Save your book as a PDF. Under the file menu, select print. Since your book is shorter, select “All” under “Pages to Print.” Under the section labeled “Page Sizing & Handling,” select Booklet. A “Booklet Subset” menu will appear on the screen. If your printer can print on both sides of the paper, select “Both Sides.” If your printer can not print on both side, choose “Front Side Only/Back Side Only.” You will have to print the front side, reload the printer, and then print the backside. Click “Print.”, Save your book as a PDF. Under the file menu, select print. Select “Page Range” under “Pages to Print.” You will print your work in smaller sections of either 16, 24, or 32 pages. Under the section labeled “Page Sizing & Handling,” select Booklet. A “Booklet Subset” menu will appear on the screen. If your printer can print on both sides of the paper, select “Both Sides.” If your printer can not print on both side, choose “Front Side Only/Back Side Only.” You will have to print the front side, reload the printer, and then print the backside. Click “Print.” Repeat until all remaining sections are printed. Keep pages separated by section.Always start printing at page 2. Page 1 is your cover page and must be printed separately.

, There are several ways to bind a book. If you send your book off to a professional printing press or an online printing company, the cost of binding the book is typically included. If you have your book printed at a print shop, you may request that the company also bind your book. You may also choose to bind your book at home., Individually fold each page down the center. If you printed more than one section of pages, keep the pages separated by section. Restack the papers in the correct order. Using a sewing machine, sew a straight line down the center fold of each section of papers. Begin sewing 1 to 2 inches away from the paper’s top edge; finish sewing 1 to 2 inches away from the paper’s bottom edge. Don’t trim the loose thread, but leave 3 to 4 inches of loose thread on each end. With a needle, Pull the loose threads to the outside of the book. Repeat this process on each section of papers. Once all batches are sewn, pull all of the loose thread from the inside of the book to the outside of the book with a needle. Trim off any excess paper with a paper cutter., If you have multiple sections, place them in the correct order. Align all of the edges. Using a Workmate, secure the book tightly between two pieces of wood. The sewn edges of the book, the side with the loose strings, should be facing up. Measure and cut a piece of scrap fabric. The fabric must be 2 inches longer than the book’s spine. When placed on the spine, there should be 2 to 4 inches of fabric on each side, or wing of the book. Use a brush to apply a coat of binding glue to the sewn edges of the book and adhere the piece of fabric to the spine. Allow the glue to dry before removing the bound book., Measure the length of your book and the width of the front cover, spine, and back cover of your book. Trace out 4 pieces from cardboard. Piece 1 should be the length and width of the front cover. Piece two should be the length and width of the spine. Piece should be the length and width of the back cover. Piece 4 is the length the book and the combined width of front cover, spine, and back cover. Cut out the cardboard pieces. Use a glue stick to adhere pieces 1, 2, 3 to piece 4. Fold piece 4 along each edge of the spine. Allow it to dry.Pizza boxes work great!

, Use any type of fabric, a spare sheet or set of curtains would work well! The fabric should be 1 to 2 inches longer or wider than the book on each side. Fold the surplus fabric over the edge of the book and adhere it to the cardboard. Allow it to dry before attaching the printed front and back covers to the fabric., When the cover is dry, insert the bound book. Apply a coat of glue to the fabric attached to the spine of the bound book. Make sure to coat the flaps of fabric with glue too. Adhere the fabric attached to the bound book to the inside spine of the cardboard cover. Press the bound book and cover together using the Workman. The spine should be facing down. Wait for the glue to dry before showing off your finished product!"

Finished.

",How to Make a Lace Covered Bookmark," Decide on the color scheme for both the cardstock and the lace, and be sure to match the colors. Consider using metallic card (gold or silver) for a very elegant look, or match the colors that are your favorites, or your recipient's favorites. For the purposes of this article, the color chosen was red, with white lace.;
, The traditional shape is a rectangle. You can either taper the end of the rectangle into an arrow tip or you can simply cut it blunt, straight across. Other end finishes could include a diagonal cut or using pinking shears.

, In the examples pictured, additional lace has been measured to provide a ""tassel"". This is not essential; you can choose to finish the lace at the end of the card. However, it does provide an interesting additional element and the tassel can stick up from the book to help the reader retrieve their place easily.

, The two bookmarks shown in this article provide two design ideas. The first is to cover the card with lace in its entirety. The second is to use different widths of lace to create a special pattern effect. Play around with the lace that you have prior to gluing, to see what will look most effective.

, Use a fabric/card safe glue and carefully attach your lace. Be sure to make it fit neatly to edges, etc. Trim any excess.

, Once dry, it is ready for use or for gifting.

Fold two 8 1/2 x 11"" pieces of paper in half horizontally.,
Cut notches in the crease on one sheet.,
Fold other sheet in half vertically.,
Cut along crease from about three centimeters on both sides.,
Slide first sheet into the hole.,
Add more pages as you need to.",How to Make a Booklet1," One of those sheets of paper is going to be the cover and one is going to be the back of the booklet. Both sheets will make up the pages inside the booklet. Horizontally means hamburger style., Make sure that you're cutting them in the top and the bottom. The cut should be just over one inch (about three centimeters).

, Don't crease this sheet, just pinch it closed, since you only need it folded while you create the hole along the crease. If you crease it, the pages in the booklet will be creased.


You're folding it hotdog style.

, You're making a hole along the crease where you'll slip the other sheet (the one with the notches) through. The hole should go from about one inch on one side of the crease to about one inch on the opposite side (three centimeters).

, The most important thing is to make sure that the notches fit into the hole since they'll keep the pages in place. The more exactly they fit the neater your booklet is going to look.


It can be helpful to gently curl the sheet with the notches so that it doesn't get bent or torn while you're slipping it into the hole. You'll want to curl it vertically so that the corners come together.

, The above booklet has eight pages, counting the cover and the back. You can add as many pages as you need (within reason; you don't want to put too much stress on the center hole as that can tear it).


Fold a piece of paper hamburger style. Cut notches little more than one inch (three centimeters) on the crease on both sides.
Pick up your original booklet and find the page that exposes the hole (where this falls depends on how many pages you have).
Slide your new page into the the hole, curling it a little so that it slides in easily.
Do this until you have as many pages as you need.

Launch the Page Setup dialog.,
Change the multiple pages to Book fold.,
Change your Gutter setting.,
Click okay once you’ve made your adjustments.,
Print your document.,
Fold the booklet.,
Download good design templates.",How to Make a Booklet2," You have to change the settings on Word before you can create your booklet. You can turn a document you've already written into a booklet, but it is best to create the booklet layout first and then put the content in.Find the Page layout tab. It should be located in the icon in the corner of Page Setup.

, This is in Page Setup under Margins. You'll go to the drop down tab, which will be on Normal and you'll change it to Book fold.

, While you don't have to do this, it's a good idea to change the Gutter setting from 0 to 1 so that words don’t end up jumbled into the binding.

, You can get an idea of what the booklet is going to look like formatting-wise. From there you simply have to add the content (or make sure that content looks how you want it to look if you already had content).


You can change anything that doesn't look right and you can add anything that your booklet needs (like page numbers).

, You will need to print on both sides of the paper, otherwise your booklet is going to end up with a lot of blank pages, which you don't necessarily want. You can have your printer do this automatically, or manually (which means you'll need to stand there and feed paper to the printer).


If you are manually feeding the paper to the printer make sure that you orient the pages properly. You do not want to end up with upside down pages in your booklet.

, Make sure that you put together the booklet with the corresponding pages. This is why it's a good thing to have page numbers. When you fold, it's a good idea to start by folding each page individually and then putting them together.


You can staple along the fold once you've folded the pages.

, The above method is the most basic way of creating a booklet in Word, but you can find lots of cool design templates on the internet or through Word if you want something a little more creative or enticing.

Match the style of your booklet with its aim.,
Use good images.,
Make the information short and concise.,
Make sure odd page numbers are on the right hand pages.,
Motivate your reader to open the booklet.",How to Make a Booklet3," For a booklet, especially a professional type booklet, you want to make sure that you're only giving a quick overview about the subject. You want to inform your reader, educate, and persuade them quickly.Something like a booklet about a town should give some general historical information, a map of the town with the important landmarks marked, and telephone numbers for things like taxis or the visitor information center.
A booklet could also be something like a leave-behind after a meeting to remind the people at the meeting what they heard, or it could provide information that responds to some sort of query (if you have a specific product, this gives a potential customer the basics of it).
There's also the type of booklet that is made for people to pick up and peruse when they're standing in line. A booklet of this sort is going to need to look catchy to get people's attention.

, People like images, there is no getting around that. When you're picking what images you want to put in your booklet, keep a couple things in mind. You want the images to jump off the page, because you want to capture people's attention. You also want the images to pertain to the purpose of your booklet.


For example: you might want to create an informational booklet about your Alaskan rafting company. On the front you would want to have a color photograph that showcases the best your company has to offer (some tourists in a raft sighting a bear, for instance).
If you can't print in color (which is preferred) make sure that your images look good in black and white.

, You want to get down the very basics for your reader, whether it's tourists in your town, potential customers, or business associates. Pages that are packed with massive blocks of text are not going to entice your reader.


Break information up with headlines and sub-headlines. Information is more easily digestible when broken up into smaller chunks that are properly labeled.

, This may seem like a small thing, but it makes a difference to the quality of your booklet. Numbering starts on the first right-hand page, not the left., The goal when having a professional style booklet is to get readers. You want whatever it is you're trying to get across to have a reading audience.


It's important to have a strong selling message on the cover, so that potential customers and readers want to check out the rest of the information.

Do not use cardstock; it is too thick for this project.;
, Take one of the corners, and fold it towards the opposite corner. Run your fingernail along the crease to make it nice and sharp.

, The straight, folded edge should be facing you. The point tip should be facing away from you.

, You'll notice that your triangle has two layers of paper. You are only folding one of those layers. When you are done folding, your paper should still be shaped like a triangle, but with a smaller, upside-down triangle inside it. This will create a ""pocket"" for your bookmark.

, Take the left bottom corner, and fold it towards the top of the triangle. Make sure that the edges align, then run your fingernail along the crease to sharpen it. Repeat this step for the other side. You will end up with a diamond shape.
