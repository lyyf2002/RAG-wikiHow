Choose your duct tape.,
Fold a strip of duct tape in half.,
Reinforce the strength of your bookmark by adding layers of tape.,
Trim the edges of the bookmark.",How to Make a Duct Tape Bookmark1," Traditionally duct tape comes in shiny silver which looks like aluminum. These days you can find duct tape in a variety of colors and even tape with patterns printed on it. With duct tape crafts becoming more popular, you can find fun tape choices online or at your local craft store., Cut a 5 inch strip of duct tape. Measure 2.5 inches from one end to find the center of the strip. From here, fold the tape in half. Match the edges evenly and press the sticky side onto itself.


Do your best to line the edges up evenly, but don’t worry if it’s a little bit off and there is still some sticky sides exposed.

, A bookmark made with only one strip of tape will be pretty flimsy. Decide how thick and sturdy you want your bookmark and keep layering tape over it until it reaches your desired thickness.

, Get rid of any exposed stickiness by trimming around the edges of the bookmark with your scissors. You can get creative with the shape of the bookmark when you trim.


Round out the edges of the bookmark.
Cut a fun shape out of the top of the bookmark, like an animal head or your initial.

Thread the tassel through your bookmark.",How to Make a Duct Tape Bookmark2," Cut a 4 inch strip of duct tape. Make the tail thinner by cutting a half inch strip out of the length of the tape. Fold this in half along the length to have a tail which is 4 inches long and a quarter inch wide. Trim off any excess sticky edges., Measure 10 inches and cut a strip of tape with your scissors. Place this strip of tape on the work surface and cut another strip to match. Place your tail on the left end of the strip of tape on the table. Press it on so that extends up from the top left of the 10 inch strip. Match up the edges of the two 10 inch strips of tape and press the sticky sides together.Trim any edges that don’t exactly match to make sure there are no sticky parts exposed.

, Lay your tape lengthwise on the work surface. Measure and mark every quarter inch along the bottom of the strip of tape. Cut straight up from these marks toward the top. Stop the cut about an inch from the top of the strip.The top portion will be covered, so you don’t have to stop every cut exactly one inch from the top. Just make sure there is enough tape left so the fringe won’t break off.

, Cut a strip of duct tape four inches long and one inch wide and set it aside. Starting at the left side of the strip of fringe, where the tail is, tightly roll the strip of tape until you reach the other end. Wrap the top of the tassel with the one inch wide strip of duct tape., Using a hole punch, punch a hole in the top of your bookmark about half an inch from the edge. Thread the tail of the tassel through the hole in the bookmark and fold the tail evenly over itself. Tape the end of the tail to the other edge of the tail where it meets the top of the tassel.


Wrap a small piece of tape around the edge of the tail to create a large loop, or place a piece of tape along the length of the tail and tape the whole tail together to flatten it except for a small loop running through the hole in the bookmark.
You want to leave enough space between the hole and the edge of the bookmark to keep the tassel from pulling through the end of the bookmark.

Use the fold as your guide to cut the square into two triangles.Keep one of the triangles and set the other aside.

, Place the square on your work surface so that it is in the shape of a diamond with the corners on the top, bottom and sides. Cut a strip of duct tape longer than the square from corner to corner. Line the bottom of the strip of tape along the center of diamond so the tape will cover the top half of the diamond. Press it gently in place., Pick up the diamond and cut the extra tape from each corner. Make the cut upward in a straight line from each corner so that the sticky side of the tape will match the shape of the top of the diamond with no excess overlapping the diamond when it is folded over., Take each side of the tape and fold the sticky side over the edge of the diamond. Press the tape gently onto the poster board and stick it to the back of the diamond so the top half is completely covered., Flip the diamond over and cover the other half with tape. Be sure to trim the tape so that all of the poster board is covered and no excess tape is leaving a sticky surface.

, Place the tape sticky side up on your work surface. Pick up the triangle you will be working with and line it up on the tape with the tip of the triangle at the top of the strip of tape and the bottom of the triangle slightly above the bottom edge of the tape. Press the triangle onto the tape., There should be a small amount of exposed sticky side of the tape under the bottom edge of your triangle. Fold this over the bottom edge and stick it the the triangle to create a clean, covered edge.

, Cut the tape away by making a straight sit from the corners of the triangle straight up. This should leave just enough tape to fold over without leaving any exposed stickiness.Do not fold the tape over the triangle. This will be folded over the diamond instead to create a pocket.
The uncovered portion of the triangle will be the inside of the pocket.

, Place the square on top of the triangle. With the back side of the square facing up, match one corner of the square to the top of your triangle. Fold the excess tape from the triangle over the square and press it gently to secure your square to your triangle., Open your book to the page you would like to mark and fit your triangle pocket over the corner of your pages. Close the book back up and you’re ready to come right back to that page later."

Choose suitable paper.,
Cut the paper.,
Add your details.,
Cover your bookmark.,
Add your finishing touches.",How to Make a Bookmark2," Select a heavy cardstock-like paper to act as the support for your bookmark, and then choose an additional image or pattern to glue over the top. Feel free to make a collage of other papers or to select multiple images if you want.

, The size of the bookmark is up to you. Cut the cardstock into a small, less obtrusive bookmark only an inch long, or choose to make a more traditional sized bookmark measuring 2-3 inches wide. Don’t make the bookmark longer than six inches, as some books are this size and you don’t want the bookmark to stick out the bottom as well as the top.

, Using the decorative paper or images you may have selected, cut and glue them onto the cardstock. Try gluing a piece of textured paper or a cut-out from a magazine over the entirety of the cardstock for an easy way to add style to your craft.


Adding glitter or stickers is a great way to give your bookmark personality without much work.
Draw over your bookmark with markers or pens to add words, phrases, or quotes that you particularly like. You can also draw your own images onto the cardstock, or add details to the bits of paper and pictures you have glued on.
Make a collage of images you cut out from magazines by overlapping them on your cardstock. You can do this with your own personal pictures as well.

, In order to protect the paper from becoming frayed or damaged, add a protective covering to your bookmark. If you have the ability to, laminate your bookmark with plastic.


You can also create this effect by using wide packing tape in an even strip on both sides of your bookmark.
Consider using a craft epoxy-like liquid gel to paint onto both sides of your bookmark. Paint one side at a time, allowing drying periods between coats.

, Use a hole-punch to create a hole at the top of your bookmark. Cut a piece of ribbon to be 6-8 inches long, and fold it in half. Then place the loop-end of the ribbon through the hole punch and slide the tail ends through the loop, pulling tightly.


Add multiple ribbons for more color and texture on your bookmark.
Use beads on the ends of your ribbon for a bit of glam. Slide a few beads over the ends of both the ribbon tails, and then tie a knot to secure it.
Use a match or a lighter to burn the cut-ends of the ribbons to prevent fraying. The flame will cause the plastic to melt, creating a blunted-end to your ribbons."
"
Select your ribbon and beads.,
Cut the ribbon.,
Thread your beads.,
Use your bookmark.",How to Make a Bookmark3," Choose a ribbon that is thin and pliable, with no wire. Your beads can be of any size and style, as long as the holes are big enough to fit the ribbon. Consider also adding a charm bead to hang from the end of your ribbons.

, Use scissors to cut your ribbon to 42 inches long. Use a match or a lighter to cauterize the ends of the ribbons to keep them from fraying.

, Add the cluster of beads you want to have hanging from the bottom of your bookmark. If you chose a charm, add it to the center of the ribbon and then fold the ribbon in half, threading your other beads over both tails.


If you don’t use a charm, place a single bead in the center of the ribbon (threading it over only one tail), and then fold the ribbon in half and insert both tails through the remaining beads to make it secure.
Tie a knot at the base of these beads when you have added all the ones you would like.
Leave about a 10 inch space, and then tie another knot with both of the ribbon tails. Add any beads you would like to the top of the bookmark, and then tie one more knot to keep them from falling off.

, The fold in the center of the ribbon should have created a loop-like space between the two pieces of ribbon. Slide this over your book so that on ribbon is placed on the page you want to mark, and the other is placed on the front cover. This will keep your bookmark secure.

Decorate your bookmark.",How to Make a Bookmark4," On a piece of scratch paper, draw a square measuring 5 x 5 inches with a pencil. Take a ruler and divide the square into four sections, creating four small squares within the one large square. Then, erase the top right square so that you have three small squares forming an ‘L’ shape.

, You should have split this square into two triangles. Do the same with the bottom right square, so that only the bottom left square is left in its original shape.

, Use your pencil to quickly shade the top-most and bottom-most triangles that you’ve drawn. You should be left with a shape that is comprised of a square on the bottom right, with two triangles attached to the top and right sides.

, Cut along the perimeter of the shape you have created, cutting off the shaded-in triangles. You should be left with a shape similar to a left-pointing arrow.

, Take the shape you have just cut, and place it onto a piece of cardstock or craft paper of your choice. Cut out the shape from your nice paper once you have traced it.

, Fold each triangle along the side still connected to the square. The two triangles should overlap and form a square-shape again.

, Add glue to the top-triangle, and glue it to the top of the bottom triangle to create a pocket. If you like, cut off the base of the square along the bottom of the triangle pocket to form a symmetrical figure. Otherwise, your bookmark form is complete!

, Add additional pieces of decorative paper to the front and back of your triangle pocket. Consider drawing a picture or writing your favorite quote or song lyrics onto the front. When you’re happy with the product, you’re finished! Slide it over the corner of the page you need to mark in your favorite book."

Add the paperclip.,
Use your bookmark.",How to Make a Bookmark5," Use any fabric you would like, as long as you have a portion of it at least one inch wide and five inches long. Add a bit of fabric stiffener to the scrap pieces to harden them for the bow-making process.

, To create the bow, you will need to cut three pieces: a loop for the bow, a piece for the tails, and a center loop to hold it together. Cut the strip for the bow to be ¾ of an inch wide, and 4.5 inches long. The piece to form the tails should measure ¾ of an inch wide and 3.5 inches long, and the center piece should measure ¼ of an inch wide and 1.5 inches long.

, Fold the longest strip of fabric into a loop, and use a dab of hot-glue to combine the ends together. Pinch the loop in the center, and place the tail-piece centered to the back of the loop. Use a bit of thread to wrap vertically around the two piece to create the classic bow shape, and tie a knot.

, Place the wide end of the paper clip at the back of the bow where your knot has been tied. Take the small center piece of fabric, and wrap it so the ends meet around the paper clip at the back. Use a dot of hot glue to attach the bow, paper clip, and center strip of fabric together.

, Give a few minutes for the hot glue to cool, and then use your bookmark by sliding the paper clip over any page. The bow will stick out from the top, so be careful not to damage it."

, Take small magnets or sheets of magnetic paper, available at craft stores, and cut them into small pieces about ½ an inch by ½ an inch. Glue each piece to the inside of the folded paper opposite of each other. When the paper is folded completely in half, the magnets should connect together.

, Add other pieces of decorative paper to the front and back of your bookmark, or draw your own images or quotes onto it. To create a glitzy look, add some glitter or sequins to the paper. Seal your bookmark with a liquid gel medium to prevent the paper from fraying or glued pieces from coming off.

, The folded mark should be placed over a single page in your book, with the magnets connecting over the page. To keep it from falling out, place the bookmark near the spine of the page rather than the edge."

Attach your decorations.",How to Design Your Own Bookmarks1," You can use cardstock or matte or glossy photo print paper for the main material of the bookmark. Both options come in a variety of colors and patterns to choose from to fit your unique style, or use whatever extra material you have in your own home.Your bookmark needs to have a solid base, like cardboard, to give the bookmark some structure and to keep it from bending. Thick cardstock or papers do not always need a cardboard base, but thin construction paper or regular printer paper will need a solid base.
Look to see what you already have in your home. Use cardboard from a cereal box, an old shoe box, or a moving box.;
, Decorating your bookmark is not only the most fun part of the process, but it also gives you the opportunity to be creative and make your bookmark more unique and personal. Many decorative items can be already found in your home.


Buttons, brooches, and even costume jewelry can make creative toppers for bookmarks, and they provide an opportunity to add a bit of your personality.
Pictures of family, friends, and pets add an extra personalized touch to your bookmark and make for special gifts.Stencils can help you add your own drawings or lettering. Stencils come in a wide-variety, from animals to calligraphy.

, Before you start cutting, measure the height and width of your main material and the base cardboard to your desired size, making sure all sides are equal. Trace the measured outline of your bookmark on your main material to create a stencil for cutting.


If you want to put a design on both sides of the bookmark, cut out two pieces of paper to fasten to the front and back of the cardboard base.
After determining the size of your bookmark, measure your chosen designs, either pictures or stencils, to fit the area.

, Scissors are useful for cutting long strips of paper for the body of the bookmark. An x-acto knife is useful for cutting out stencils or other fine, delicate edges or corners.

, Without gluing anything yet, place your decorations, stencils, or pictures where you’d like them on the final product. If you are drawing your own design, use pencil. This gives you the opportunity to move things around or try out different layouts before making anything permanent.

, It’s time for your bookmark to take shape, so start by gluing your main material of paper to your cardboard base. Let everything dry before attaching your decorations.


Rubber cement works great on paper, cardboard, and pictures. But hot glue is ideal for attaching your buttons, brooches, and other hard plastic or metal toppers.
Once the glue from the main material and base are dry, glue on any pictures, stencil cutouts, or decorative toppers that you’d like. Again, let these materials dry before using the bookmark or moving on to the next step.
When all the glue is dry, color in any designs or stenciling that you may have drawn. If there are any corners or areas that need more glue, apply carefully and let dry.

, If you’re making a simple design, like a heart, use a marker to draw the shape outline on the felt before you start cutting.

, Measure one corner of the felt square to fit the corner of the book page. Fold the felt square in half, line up the corners, and cut the corners together to create two equally measured cut outs.

, Line up the two corner cutouts and sew together two of the edges along the trim. Leave one side open, or the top of your design open, to slip over the corner of your book page.

You can find these sorts of masks in arts and crafts stores and party supply shops.;
, The cardboard needs to be about 12 inches (30.5 centimeters) larger than the face mask on all sides. You need to have more room on the bottom of the cardboard than on the top., Draw around the face mask first. Next, draw the shape of Tutankhamun's headdress around it. It curves above the forehead and dips down past your shoulders.Look at reference pictures of Tutankhamun's death mask for this step.

, Begin by cutting out the entire headdress out first. Next, cut the gap between the shoulder pieces, then the inside oval., Place the mask back on top of the headdress. Use small pieces of masking tape to secure the face mask to the cardboard. Flip the whole think over, and secure the back with more tape.Alternatively, you can secure the mask to the headdress with hot glue., Cut an oval shape about the same size as your own ear out of cardboard or craft foam—the color does not matter. Cut the oval in half to make two ears., The ears near to be between the nose and eyes, with the straight edge should be facing the front, and the curved edge against the headdress. For a more realistic mask, tape the ears at a slight angle to the mask, so that the straight edge is touching the side of the mask, and the curved edge is touching the headdress.

You can use hot glue for this step as well.
Make sure that you use masking tape for this.

, Cut a 1-inch (2.5-centimeter) wide strip of craft foam, long enough to go across the forehead, from one edge of the mask to the other. Secure the strip to the forehead using masking tape or hot glue. The strip should be level with the tops of the ears., Look at reference pictures of Tutankhamun's mask for these. Start with a coil of clay for each, then twist the coils into a rough S-shape. Use your fingers to pinch a beak for the vulture, and a hood for the cobra. Add eyes using a toothpick, pen, pencil, or any other pointy object. Let the pieces dry.

Make these about the same height as the nose, with the cobra being taller than the vulture.

, Use hot glue, or any other strong glue, to secure the pieces to the 1-inch (2.5-centimeter) wide strip on the forehead. The cobra goes on the left-hand side, and the vulture goes on the right., If you don't have one, cut an empty paper towel roll in half, and use that instead. You can also roll a 6-inch (15.25-centimeter) wide strip of thin cardboard or poser paper into a tube, then secure it with tape., Each slit needs to be about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) long. Make the slits right across from each other. Your tube will now have two tabs on the top., Fold down one of the tabs to make a crease. Cut along the crease, and discard the tab. The top of the tube will now be 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) shorter on one side., Place the tube against the chin of your mask. Rotate it so that the longer edge is covering the front of the chin, and the shorter edge is under the chin. Secure it with strips of tape., It is better if you tear the newspaper rather than cut it; the ragged edges will blend in together much better. Plan on making the strips between ½ and 1 inch (1.25 and 2.5 centimeters) wide and 2 to 3 inches (5 to 3.75 centimeters) long. Try to have different sizes. This will help you fill in all those curves and angles.

If you don't have newspaper, you can use blank newsprint, tissue paper, or even paper towels., You can use your favorite recipe, or you can mix together equal parts of thick, white glue and warm water.If you don't have any glue, you can mix together equal parts of white flour and warm water instead.If the glue is too thick, stir in more water.

, Apply the strips to the seam between the mask and the headdress first. Apply them to the rest of the mask next, including the headdress and beard.Use your fingers to smooth the paper mache down, and apply no more than 2 to 3 layers.Run the strip over the edge of the bowl to get rid of any excess glue.
Work one strip at a time. Don't soak all of the strips all at once.
Your second layers may not need any glue; the glue from the previous layer may be enough to make them stick.

, Scrunch up a ball of newspaper and stick it up the bottom of the beard. Place a few strips across the bottom of the beard to cover up the hole., This will give you a smooth base to paint on, and make the paint show up better. If you want a smoother finish, you can paint it with white gesso, then sand it lightly with a fine-grit sanding sponge. You may have to do the gesso and sanding step a few times to achieve a smooth finish.

You can also use spray paint primer instead.

, You can do this with spray paint or with acrylic paint.If you need to apply another layer, let the first layer dry., You can do these with paint or with dark blue paper. The strips need to be horizontal on the shoulder parts, and vertical at the top, above the forehead. Make them curve downwards on the upper corners of the mask so the change between the vertical and horizontal strips isn't too abrupt.Make sure that the strips are symmetrical on both sides of the mask.

, You can use the same color as you did for the blue stripes on the headdress, but a pale blue or turquoise would be more accurate. For a even more accurate mask, leave the bottom of the beard gold. Once again, if you need to apply a second coat of paint, let the first coat dry completely., You can do this with a thin brush and gold acrylic paint, a gold marker, or gold puffy/dimensional paint., Outline the eyes using a thin paintbrush and black acrylic paint or a black marker. Next, draw a 1 to 2 inch (2.5 to 5-centimeter) long horizontal line in the outer corner of each eye. For an even more accurate mask, draw curved eyebrows above the eyes. Make them follow the curve of the eyes and stop at the end of the kohl."

Develop an improved sword design.",How to Make a Cardboard Sword," Above anything else, you'll need cardboard for this project. Your cardboard should preferably be thick, and in large enough pieces that you can make the sword in one piece. Other than that, the only necessary thing is a set of scissors. Other things, like markers, paint, masking tape or construction paper, can and should be added to suit the design of your sword. Gather as many of these ingredients as you can. Even if you don't end up using all of it, it's still useful to have nearby just in case.


If you don't have enough cardboard, a nearby store (such as a liquor store) may be willing to give you some of their spare boxes.;
, Even if you already have an idea what you want your sword to look like, it doesn't hurt to research some different kinds of swords. The different visuals designs are bound to factor into your own design, resulting in a more nuanced and interesting weapon. There are lots of sites online that compare and contrast swords, and historical encyclopedias should have a section on weapons you can browse for inspiration.Cardboard sword designs are also available, whether as templates or finished examples. Taking a look at what other people have made with cardboard will give you inspiration.Note the difference between one-handed, two-handed, and one-and-a-half-handed (colloquially known as 'bastard') swords. Swords were originally designed with weight considered. Due to how much lighter cardboard is than metal, you'll be able to play around with potentially bigger sizes than if you were smithing a real sword.

, Using a marker, draw out the sword on a piece of cardboard, using the exact dimensions you'd like your sword to be. Whether it's a small dagger-type blade or a major two-handed affair, all of this will be decided in the outline you draw. Remember to include a guardrail if your design suggests it, and leave enough room on the hilt to comfortably fit your hands.


Swords all end with a pointed tip, so work that into your design as well.
Put your hand (clenched into a fist) up against the cardboard to see approximately how much space you'll need for your hilt.
You should play around with some conceptual designs on paper before setting don to trace one out for real. A well-thought out design will be a lot more fun to use.

, once the outline is in place, take a pair of scissors and cut it out.Try to be smooth with your cuts, as a roughly-hewn sword will look sloppy. Depending on the type of cardboard you're using, an exacto-knife may be used as well, although you're better off using construction scissors if the cardboard is corrugated.

, Bolstering a sword with a second layer of cardboard is recommended for the sake of duelling. Put your sword cutout on a bigger piece of cardboard and trace it out. From there, cut out the tracing to make a second half. Glue the two pieces together, and cut off any excess sections that stick out from the blade outline.


For the best stability, you can add a wooden or plastic rod to the blade section, and glue the cardboard pieces on either side of and around it. This will keep the blade from bending if it's hit too hard., A sword hilt will be the part of the sword you hold when you're wielding it, so comfort should be taken into consideration as much as the look. It may be worth it to glue a third layer of cardboard on the hilt area if you think you'll need the added grip. You should verify that your hilt has enough space for your hand to grip it comfortably. If there's still not enough space, you can cut into the guard of the sword.


If you need more hilt space and your sword does not have a guard area, you can cut into some of the blade itself. In the majority of cases where extra hilt space is needed, it'll be an inch or two at max. You shouldn't have to worry about starting a new sword from scratch if there are some issues with your current design.

, Even if you have your sword's shape set in stone, there are countless ways your finished product could go once it's through the decoration phase. Do you want a relatively realistic sword, or something zany and playful? Suffice to say, a spray painted blade and taped hilt will elicit a different impression than if you colour your sword with pink crayons.


With this or any crafts project, there are no 'bad' creative decisions to be made. Take a minute to decide what you want to do, and build your decoration off of that concept.

, Using some duct or masking tape, tape off the edges of your sword. This is for safety's sake as much as for looks.Even though no one's going to be fooled that your sword is real, you still want to create the illusion that the sword has tempered edges.


Taping is especially important if the cardboard you're using is corrugated. Corrugated cardboard is great for stability's sake, but nothing kills the illusion of a sword more than be able to see into it!

, There are many different ways you can go around decorating the blade (or metallic) part of your sword. You want to make the blade distinct from the guardrail and the hilt below it. There are many ways you can go around this. A blade can be wrapped with duct tape for a vaguely metallic look.Spray paint or wrapping aluminum foil tightly around the blade are arguably the best homemade solutions for a blade look.In the end, the artistic choices are completely up to you. You might even draw a pattern on the blade if you're not too concerned with realism.
It may be prudent to draw up some concept art on a separate sheet of paper so you'll have a guide to work off of.

, Many historical swords took the guardrail and hilt as opportunities to express some artistic creativity. You may want to do the same with your own sword. If your guardrail is large enough, you can get to work on an elaborate design, or glue decorations (like crafts gems) onto it.Sword designs can be done as creatively and as colourfully as you'd like. The only thing to limit you is your imagination.


For example, you could outline a guardrail pattern in pencil, and trace the outline with permanent marker once you're happy with it.
A realistic sword should be minimal on the ornaments. After all, you still may want your sword to look slightly dangerous.

, Because a hilt should be comfortable and distinct from the blade section, you should cover your hilt with masking tape. This will approximate the look of a real sword hilt, and give a much better grip than plain cardboard. The tape should be wrapped from just below the guard to the bottom of the hilt. Following this, you can draw upon the tape if you still want your hilt to be decorated somehow.

, What's a swordsman without an opponent to duel with? If you want, you can repeat the prior steps and make a second sword. It's usually more fun to get a friend to make one of his own however. That way, your duel will be a test of your craftsmanship as well as your duelling skills.

, Now that you have a sword, you could go the extra mile and make matching armour to boot. Armour may constitute a breastplate, grieves, gauntlets and even a shield. Part of the fun is thinking up ways to transform the cardboard you have into functional pieces of armour, but plenty of fancy designs are available online as well.


Don't forget to decorate your armour! Anything from felt-tipped markers to glued-on construction paper can liven up your cardboard and bring the armour to life.
If you're tired of working with cardboard, you can make great looking armour sets using crafts foam., Duelling is possibly the most enjoyable part of having a sword. It allows you to put your sword design to the test. If your friend has a cardboard sword of his own, you should lay down some quick ground rules and jump into it. Duels are most enjoyable when there are rules of how to win. Going in blindly usually results in the swords being swung as hard as possible and getting broken within the first couple of minutes.


Bear in mind that the swords are relatively fragile when compared to real swords, and they should be used with that in mind.
Start a cardboard fighting group if the idea interests you enough. There are already groups in existence where people meet up and play fight with cardboard weapons.Instead of starting one of your own with friends, you can look online to see if there's already a group in your city.
Working some kind of live-action roleplaying (or LARPing) into the game can be fun if you're interested in fantasy or Medieval history.

, Cardboard swords are perfect for use in costumes and events like Halloween. Even if you have a costume in mind that doesn't necessarily befit a sword, feel free to mix and match ideas.You might be surprised at the response you get when you combine unexpected ideas together.

, Now that you're relatively experienced in the art of sword craft, you might go back to the drawing board and make a better kind of sword. Consider what was good and bad about the sword you made. If you were to make one again, what would you improve? There's nothing so helpful as hands-on experience, and you'll probably find the second sword is a lot easier (and more enjoyable) to make, now that you know precisely what you're doing.

",How to Make a Cardboard Box1," The side of a cereal box can make a small box for home use. Use corrugated cardboard for a sturdier project, or make a larger, decorative box from scrapbooking paper or cardstock.If you have a specific size of box in mind, cut the cardboard to fit:


A piece of cardboard makes a square box with sides ¼ the original length. For example, a 12 inch long piece of cardboard will make a 3"" x 3"" box.
The width of the cardboard forms the height, base, and top of the box. For example, if you want to make a 3"" x 3"" box out of a 12"" x 9"" piece of cardboard, you'll use 3"" of the width to form the base and top, and the remaining 6"" will form the height of the box.;
, It's easier to decorate the box before you start cutting and folding. One easy way to do this is to use a piece of wrapping paper about ½"" (1.25 cm) larger than the cardboard on all sides. Glue this onto the cardboard with strong glue, then fold over the edges of the wrapping paper and glue them onto the other side., This forms a small ""glue flap"" that you will later fold over and glue down to help keep the four sides together. The glue flap can be as wide as 2 inches (5 cm) for a large shipping box, or about ¼"" (6mm) for a small art project., Use a ruler to measure the length of the cardboard, ignoring the glue flap. Mark it at each ¼ of the length, then use the ruler as a straightedge to draw parallel lines through these marks. This should divide the cardboard into four equal sections, that will form the four sides of the box.


If you want a rectangular box instead of a square one, use sections with two different measurements. For example, to make a 4"" x 2"" box, divide the cardboard into a 4"" section, a 2"" section, another 4"" section, and another 2"" section, in that order.

, Place the ruler along the lines you just drew and press along them to make them easier to fold. Use a utility knife for extra thick material such as corrugated cardboard, using light pressure only. Use a bone folder or empty ballpoint pen for medium-weight material such as posterboard., Fold the sides inward from both ends to form a stack, then unfold. This creases the paper for easier folding later.


Bend thick material so the cut score is on the outside of the box. You can bend medium-weight material either way., Divide the length of one box side (the distance between two lines) by two. Measure this distance from one edge of the cardboard and draw a line width-wise at this point, running across the lines you folded. Measure the same distance starting from the opposite edge and draw a second line.


For example, if you are making a 3"" x 3"" box, divide 3"" by 2 to get 1.5"". Arrange the paper so the creased lines run vertically. Draw one horizontal line 1.5"" from the bottom edge, and a second horizontal line 1.5"" from the top.
If your box is not square, you can use either side of the box for this calculation. Using the longer side will give the box a sturdier base and top. Using the shorter side will make a taller but weaker box.

, Cut along the vertical ""side"" lines until you hit the horizontal ""flap"" lines. This should leave you with four flaps along the top and four along the bottom.


Score and crease these as before if using thick cardboard.

, Bend the four sides to form the frame of the box. Fold the narrow glue flap over the edge of the side and tape or glue it down., Tuck the flaps on one side together, so each one overlaps the flap next to it. Reinforce this base with tape.


If you are storing lightweight objects, you can just close the flaps together without trying to tuck them into place. Reinforce this simple fold with tape on the inside as well as the outside, to prevent the flaps from poking up.

, Tape the top as well if you are making a decorative box, or if you've put something inside for shipping. Otherwise, just leave them tucked together for easy opening.

Tape the top flaps into a vertical position.,

",How to Make a Cardboard Box2," If you need to store or ship an extra-large item, you can combine two ordinary cardboard boxes. The two boxes will be stacked on top of each other, so make sure each one is at least half as tall as the item you plan to store. You can use store-bought boxes, or create two templates yourself using the instructions above.

, Tape the base securely, but leave the top open.

, Stand each flap on the top of the box upright, to extend the height of the box sides. Tape the flaps so they stay up., Tape the top flaps of the second box in a vertical position, as you did with the first one. Leave the base flaps open for now.

, Slip the second box upside-down over the first, with the two sets of upright flaps overlapping. Tape or glue the two sets of flaps together..

, Now you have one extra-tall box, with the open ""base"" of the second box serving as the top. Insert your object and packing materials through this hole, then tape the box closed when you are ready

A small water bottle;
, Use the ruler to measure a medium sized square, about a 10 x 10 inch square. Make sure all four sides of your square are the exact same length and have straight lines.

, Use the scissors to cut out the square of cardboard. Make sure you follow the lines perfectly when cutting out your square so that you end up with a perfect square.

, It’s important that the arms of your boomerang are all the exact same size, so making it from an equilateral triangle will help. Make sure you measure accurately before cutting.Measure one side of the square and make a mark at the halfway mark.
Make another halfway mark on the opposite side as well, and use the ruler to draw a straight line between them. This should make a line running down the center of the square.
Position the square in front of you so that the line is running up to down.
Use your ruler to draw a line from the top of the first line to the bottom right corner of the square. This line should be the same size as the sides of your square. Repeat this to make a line from the top of the first line to the bottom left corner as well.
You should now have a triangle shape on your square.
Use scissors to cut the triangle out.

, One side of the triangle should already have a line drawn from the center up to the top corner, but you need to mark the center of the other two sides.

You should end up with two lines running parallel to and two inches away from the line going through each corner of your triangle.
This will make 3 lines coming from each corner and going to the center of the triangle. These 3 lines make up the arms of the boomerang.

, Use a marker to draw over the part of the lines you will cut out. Draw over the outer two lines in each corner starting from the edge of the triangle and stopping where it intersects another line coming from the next corner. It should look like you’re cutting 3 smaller triangles out of the edges of the triangle leaving 3 arms in a “Y” shape. Cut the cardboard where you have drawn with marker.


You will be cutting 3 small triangles out of the edges of the larger triangle.

, Use the water bottle to trace a rounded shape onto the ends of each boomerang arm. Place the water bottle on the end of the boomerang arm and trace the bottom of it onto the arm.

You can come up with a traditional or contemporary card such as a birthday card or you can tune in to a certain issue. Alternative types of cards are becoming more popular and card companies are expanding their lines to this market.;
,


You can go to local stores and look through the existing greeting cards to see if your idea is already a card.

Write a birthday card.,
Craft a holiday card.,
Write for a religious celebration.,
Write a get-well card.",How to Write Unique Card Greetings1," Focus on the milestone the recipient has reached. For kids, birthdays are exciting celebrations during which they get gifts and have pool parties. Teens have a couple of milestone celebrations like sweet sixteen or eighteen. For anyone over 22 or 25, birthdays indicate you’re just getting older.


For people who are in their twenties or older, you can be funny by acknowledging their age. For example, for somebody’s 45th birthday, you could say, “Only ten more years until you can start using senior discounts.”
When writing cards for younger kids, it doesn’t matter as much what you tell them. Try saying something funny in kid humor, like “rock your tail off, Cody!”
Another approach is to recall a moment you’ve had with this person. Say you met after you dropped your lunch tray and she helped you pick it up: “I can always count on you to help me pick up food."";
, Holidays like Veterans Day, Thanksgiving, or Christmas usually warrant a more heartfelt message. For these types of cards you can write about what the holiday means to you. For example: “Thanksgiving is centered around turkey and gravy, but I’m just thankful to spend it with you.”


You can also take the slapstick approach to a holiday card: “When grandma starts drinking eggnog, it’s family time,” or “All I want for Christmas is New Year’s Eve. I’ll settle with an afternoon with you.”
You might find it difficult to be unique for a holiday occasion, but if you add some of your personality, it will be distinctive enough for a greeting card.

, Greeting cards for religious events are almost always cheerful and full of love. Whether it’s a card to celebrate a Baptism, Yom Kippur, Eid, or Confirmation, you can make your message unique by writing from your heart.Describe your relationship to the celebrant in a sentence or two, and finish by noting how happy you are for the person on their special day.
These types cards rarely involve humor, but if you think of a joke, try it out. The key to adding humor to a religious celebration is being tasteful. Never shame or belittle anyone in this type of card.

, Get well cards are often written in a large format from a group of people. You can also send out a personalized get-well greeting card. Learn about the recipient’s condition briefly before writing the card. Focus on making this person smile. A good way to write a unique message is by explaining a trait of this person that makes you happy.Try something like this:


”John, lunch is my favorite part of Tuesdays, thanks to you!”
""Steph, remember when you made me laugh so hard I almost peed?”
""LaTisha, you are one of the most caring people in the office. This place feels drab without you!”

Write a card for a significant other.,
Craft a greeting card for family.,
Write to a coworker.",How to Write Unique Card Greetings2," Any message you write to a significant other must have the right ratio of compassion and interest. Regardless of how long you’ve been seeing your partner, you should include writing that shows your passion for the relationship. A good way to demonstrate this in a unique way is to write out a list of things you’ve done together.


Be creative and don’t use a bullet list, but instead include everything in a paragraph form.
You can talk about how much you love them, too.
Talk about the future in a positive way. You could say something like: “I can’t wait to make pizza with you on Tuesdays,” or “This summer we’re going to visit the Florida keys!”

, You will probably be faced with writing greeting cards the most to family members. You’ve been receiving them since you were little, and now you can write back to them. Make your family member feel extra special by adding unique qualities to the card.One way to add a specialized message is to talk about the person. Describe their character in a positive way.


Incorporate yourself and the recipient into a short story you cherish. Try to keep the story short.
Another way you can add something unique is by incorporating an inside joke you share. If you don’t have an inside joke, you could add another form of humor.
Express your love for them. Many greeting cards to family members already do this, but it’s important to show them love. They will appreciate it.

, If you are at job for a while, you’ll probably be forced to sign a card for a colleague or craft one yourself. Even if you don’t know this person too well, you can still add a unique greeting that he or she will enjoy. Reflect on your relationship with your co worker and think back if there was a special moment you shared.


Make your greeting brief, but try to include something you shared together. It can even be something as simple as driving the same car or wearing the same tie one day.
This will show you took an extra moment to think of your coworker.

Be yourself.,
Use a quote.,
Draw something.,
Be cheesy.,
Include memorabilia.",How to Write Unique Card Greetings3," If you're a talker, fill the page with a long message. If you're quiet, stick to a short and characteristic message. If you're funny, fill the page with jokes. Make your addressee smile and remember your personality through the card!


It isn’t necessary to write about something that isn’t genuine to you or your relationship with this person.
Follow your instincts when drafting a message. Your first thought is probably your best thought., If you are all out of ideas, you can borrow someone else’s ideas. Introduce a relevant quote by first saying, “Confucius once said,” then state the quote: ""Life is real simple, but we insist on making it complicated.” Then, offer a statement about the addressee of the card, such as, “Here’s to you, Jess, who never over complicates the situation.”


You can look online for quotes and even find quotes specific to holidays or birthdays.

, You don’t always have to use words to convey a message. You can show someone another side your personality by taking the time to draw something. You don’t even have to be good at drawing. It’s the thought that counts.


To personalize the drawing, try drawing something specific to your relationship. For example: your dad taught you how to ride a bike, so draw your dad teaching you how to ride a bike.

, Many people think being cheesy is too redundant in a greeting card, but it is fun and will bring a smile to someone’s face. You can even be unique by adding a cheesy, overused line because no one thinks to do it. Take some of these as examples:


”Like many women my age, I am 28 years old.”
”Birthdays are like buses, never the number you want.”
”You might not be Irish, but you sure can drink like one.”

, Look through your desk drawer or your special box to see if you have anything small you could include. Small things like a movie/concert stub or even an old photograph can liven a card. You are sure to offer something unique by including a small token that you cherish.


Cut out a page of a book and underline a passage you find relevant.
Look through magazines, like National Geographic, and find an image you find interesting.
Try to include something that you two shared together.

Make cards for your own Trading Card Game.,
Create your own baseball cards.,
Use photos of family and friends to make personalized trading cards.",How to Make Your Own Trading Cards1," Trading card games like Magic the Gathering and Yu-Gi-Oh! are popular, but it can be even more fun to create your own game. You can invent your own characters, give them powers, and write your own rules. Making your own Trading Card Game is a phenomenal way to use your creativity and will give you and your friends a fun new game to play.


Trading cards typically have unique character names, and includes details such as the character's powers, skills, strengths, any any other information you'd like to include.;
, Trading baseball cards has been a fun pastime for many years, but what if you don't have access to baseball trading cards? Whether you can't afford baseball cards, or can't find them in your town, making your own baseball cards is a fun alternative and fairly easy to do. Get a few of your friends involved to have fun with your baseball trading cards.


Baseball cards typically include the player's name, their statistics, team history (where they played in college and high school), and a few fun facts.

, Making personalized trading cards with friends or family is a fun way to connect with the people you love and can make great gifts for the holidays. Print out your favorite photos of family members (you can even include pets if you'd like) or use yearbook photos with a group of school friends.

Gather your materials.,
Cut out your cards.,
Add your artwork.,
Add details to your trading cards.,
Finish your cards.",How to Make Your Own Trading Cards2," To make your own trading cards, you're going to need paper, a pencil, markers, and scissors. Other materials, such as stickers or photos, can be used if you want to use those as your artwork.


Choose a paper with a thick consistency. Index cards, construction paper, or thick card stock paper are all good options. You want your playing cards to be sturdy so that they last longer and appear to be more professional.
Choose bright colored markers to give your trading cards a vibrant look.

, Typical trading cards are 2.5 inches wide and 3.5 inches tall, but you don't have to make your cards that size. Whichever size you want your trading cards to be, cut your paper so that all of the cards are as even as possible.Use a ruler to draw guide lines on your paper. This will make cutting your cards much easier.
Trace a trading card you already have (Pokemon, baseball card, etc.) multiple times until you've filled up your paper with outlines, and carefully cut each card out. This will help your cards be uniform in size.
Using small index cards as your trading cards is a great option that requires no cutting. Although index cards are slightly larger than typical trading cards, choosing this option will require less work and give you completely even cards to play with.

, Your artwork will depend on whether you're making a trading card game, baseball cards, or personalized trading cards.


Create a unique character on each trading card if your making a Trading Card Game. Draw each character in pencil first so that you're able to fix any mistakes you may make. Once you're satisfied with your drawing, trace and color in your character with marker to give it a polished, colorful look. If you are uncomfortable with drawing, use stickers as the images for your characters. Find stickers that you like and simply stick them in the center of your trading cards where the artwork would typically go.
If you're making baseball cards, it's best to print out photos of the players you're putting on the cards. Then, tape or glue them to the card.
If you're making personalized trading cards, print out pictures of your friends and family to tape or glue to your cards. You can also use wallet sized class photos if you're making the cards for a group of friends at school.
Be sure to leave room on the top and bottom of your card to write in details about your person or character.

, Each person / character should have a name as well as details about them. The information you choose to include is entirely up to you.


Write your character / person's name at the top of each card using legible handwriting. Make the name bold with a marker so that it stands out.
List the details about the character / person under the image. This is where you'd add the character's powers, skill level, etc., the baseball players stats, team history, etc., of the person's favorite food and color. Use a thin marker or very dark pen so that these details are easy to read.

, This step is optional, but if you'd like to preserve your cards and make them last longer, consider laminating them. You can do this by getting a laminating machine, or taking your cards into a specialty shop to get them laminated.

Print your new trading cards.,
Finish your cards.",How to Make Your Own Trading Cards3," Microsoft Word, Pages, Photoshop, or any other program that will allow you to create shapes, insert images, and make text boxes will work. Word processors like Microsoft Word and Pages are user friendly and very simple to use, whereas Photoshop is a bit more advanced. Use whatever program you are most comfortable with.


Your computer should also have access to a printer. If you don't have access to a printer, you can pay to have your trading cards printed at any store with printing services, such as FedEx Office.

, The type of artwork you use will depend on the type of trading cards you're making. Create a folder on your computer to store your images in. Using this folder, save your artwork or photos to set them to the side while you create your card template.


Drawing your own artwork is a great option if you want to create a unique trading card game. You should draw your characters in pencil, and color them in with marker to give them a finished look. Once you've drawn your characters, you'll either scan your images into your computer using a scanner printer, or take a photo of each character and upload the photos to your computer. (If you choose to take photos, make sure you have bright lighting with no shadows).
Using photos of your friends, family, or even pets for your characters is a great way to make a personalized trading card game. Simply upload pictures of each person you want to be a character to your computer.
Download photos of your favorite baseball players to you computer to make your own baseball cards.
Crop your photos / artwork into square shaped images. This will make adding them to your templates much easier.

, Open up your chosen computer software and create a new document / project. We will pretend we are using Pages since it is a simple software. Using Microsoft Word will be extremely similar, but the buttons / commands may be named slightly differently.


Click ""Insert Shape"" to insert a rectangle into your document. Drag the dimensions of your rectangle so that it is the size of your desired trading card. As you drag your rectangle, the size measurements will appear. Typical trading cards are roughly 2.5 inches wide and 3.5 inches tall.
For size reference, you can hold a trading card or playing card up to your computer screen, and drag your rectangle's dimensions so that it is the same size as that card. Be sure your document is zoomed in to 150% for accuracy if you use this method.
Give your rectangle shape a thick border for you to cut around.
Once you've created the shape of your card, it is time to insert text boxes for your character / person's name and details. Add a thin text box along the top of your card, and type in your character / person's name. Next, add a slightly larger text box along the bottom of your card. This will be where you list your character / person's details.
Use a legible font so that the name and details are easy to read.
You should now have an open square area in the middle of your card, this is where the image / artwork of your character will go.

, Remember the artwork or photos that you set aside from earlier? Now it's time to add them to your template. Open the folder where your images are saved, and drag your first character / person onto your template. You can drag the dimensions of the image so that it fits into the square space that you've left open. Now, your card should have a name, an image, and a description.

, Copy and paste your template so that you can make multiple cards out of one sheet of paper. If you've done a standard card size, your card template should fit on one sheet 9 times. If you've done a larger card size, put 4-6 card templates on one sheet.


To copy and paste your entire template (the rectangle shape and the text boxes together), click ""Edit"" in the upper left hand corner, then click ""Select All,"" and finally do your copy and paste.
Add the names and details for each of your characters into your templates so that each card is for a different character / person. Drag the image for each character / person into the templates, and resize accordingly.
Once you've done this for each card template, you should have a sheet full of individual trading cards ready to print.

, Use thicker paper to give your cards the proper consistency. This type of paper can be bought at any office supply store.


If you're unable to print at home, save your documents to a flash drive / thumb drive and bring them into your local printing store. Be sure to select a thicker paper for your print job.

, Once your cards have been printed, cut them out! Cut slowly and carefully along the edges of your borders. If you choose to get your cards laminated, you can buy a laminating machine or take your cards into specialty shop to be laminated."

A5 is a medium-sized cardstock that is sturdy but folds easily. A4 cardstock is also used in card making. You can purchase cardstock at your local craft store.


You can also use any kind of paper that you have lying around the house. Card making is a great way to use scrap paper that you otherwise might throw out. If you have a large, oddly shaped piece of scrap paper, cut it into a rectangle. Fold it in half like you would any other piece of paper.;
, This can be a picture, drawing, sticker, fancy lettering, or even a small, thin object. You could also add a photograph if it would have a special significance for the recipient. Get creative--use glitter, pipe cleaners, or anything else you have lying around the house to make your card special.


Keep in mind the person you will be giving the card to and the occasion for giving the card. Are you giving your grandma a card for Christmas? Perhaps cutting out a paper Christmas tree to glue to the front of the card would be nice.

, There are many ways to do this. Layer a few pieces of colored paper, each smaller than the last, underneath the feature.


You can also draw designs around your feature or use a ruler to create borders around your feature using brightly colored pens.
Lay pipe cleaners along the edge of your card to create 3D borders.

, You can purchase stickers with greetings on them, or you can hand-write the greeting. Do not add the greeting until you have glued everything down.

, Once you have everything laid out on the card, take everything off the card but be mindful of where everything should be glued down. A trick to help you remember the different layers is to lay everything out from bottom layer to top layer on a table. That way you won’t get confused when gluing everything down.

, This is optional. Write the greeting once you have glued everything down. If you have a sticker with a greeting on it, place it where you decided it should go when planning the card.

, It can be as simple as ‘Hope you’re doing well!’ Or as detailed as a full length letter.

, The paper should be large enough that your card will fit inside the square when two opposite sides of the card are folded in together. To test this, turn the square so that it looks like a diamond. Fold the left and right corners in towards each other. Place your card horizontally on top of these two folded corners--if it fits within the border of the square, the piece of paper is the right size.


You can either use a ruler to measure out a square on a larger piece of paper or purchase a square piece of paper with an interesting design at a craft store.

, Draw an ‘X’ from each corner to it’s diagonal corner. Draw the ‘X’ lightly with a pencil.

, Run your finger along the the outside edges of the two folded sections so that they stay folded.

, It does not need to be exactly a half inch, but it should be close to it. Run your finger along the bottom edge so that the paper creases thoroughly.

, These are the points that are touching in the middle of the paper. The tape should be place on the bottom part of the point so that it runs from the point downwards along the bottom edge of triangles A and B. The tape should be about an inch long. It should be close enough to the edge that when triangle C is folded up and pressed against triangles A and B, you cannot see any tape.


If you do not have double sided tape, you can use glue. Put a thin line of glue along the bottom edges of triangles A and B.

, The double sided tape or glue should hold the triangles together.

,, To hold the top down, place a sticker on the tip on triangle D so that the envelope is closed.


You can also tape along the edges of triangle D so that the envelope is more thoroughly sealed. If you would prefer to do this, but do not like the way the tape looks, purchase tape with pretty patterns at your local craft store.

, Your loved one will cherish your card long after his or her birthday has come and gone.

, Pop up cards are fun 3D cards that are great for kids. For Christmas, you can even make a pop up Christmas tree card.

Get a cardboard box that is big enough for you to comfortably fit inside.,
Get a bucket of silver and gold paint.,
Get some black construction paper.,
Paint the inside of the box.,
Make a keypad.,
Put an old phone in the machine.,
Get a comfortable seat.,
Bring in some more technology.,
Don't forget some other provisions.,
Start your time machine.,
Fall asleep.,
Create effects for the working time machine.,
Step out into a new time period.",How to Build a Pretend Time Machine," A box the size of a fridge is ideal, but it may be hard to find a box big enough for your needs. It should be in a rectangular shape. Here are some places to look:


Go to a supply store and buy the biggest cardboard box they have.
Go to a grocery store. Grocery stores often try to get rid of their extra cardboard boxes in the mornings or late afternoons, so don't be afraid to ask. Just don't pick a box where any really smelly food has been stored.
Ask someone who recently moved if he can spare a box.;
, Next, paint the outside of your box either silver or gold — a nice futuristic color. Make sure you're using safe paint meant for this purpose, not house paint or anything too intense, or you will compromise your health.


When the paint is dry, sprinkle some glitter on top of it.

, Cut the paper into big circles or squares. Once the box is done drying, tape them to the outside of the box. Now you have windows! They are tinted, of course.


Alternately, you can get a box cutter and cut actual windows in the machine. This may be a bit tricky.
You can also paint windows on the outside of the box.

, If you painted the outside silver, paint the inside gold, and vice versa. You don't have to put as much time or care into the inside, since you will be the only person seeing it.

, Glue a white piece of construction paper to the inside of the box, and write the numbers 0-9 on it, just like you would see on a keypad. This is what you will use to gear up the time machine.

, You'll need it for emergencies.

, Place a soft red pillow on the bottom of the machine. You'll need something to sit on since you might be traveling for a long time. You can also drape a red blanket across the bottom of the machine.


A velvet or satin material is best. The inside of your time machine should be classy.

, Bring an old computer joystick inside with you. You may need it to operate the machine. An old modem could also help you on your journey.


Anything with dials, buttons, or especially buttons that light up will help you. Just don't bring in an item that could cause you harm.

, Bring a bottle of water, some dry snacks, and a calculator with you, or you may get hungry or bored during your adventure.

, Now that your machine is ready, you just have to get it started. Talk in a robotic voice and start pushing the buttons on your keypad. Type into your calculator and move around your joystick for extra emphasis.


Inevitably, something will go wrong, and you'll need to yell wildly and pound the machine like a true mad scientist.

, For your time machine to work, you need to doze off or pass out. This could either happen while you're reading a book on time travel, or it could be from a fake ""explosion"" that occurs when you're trying to fix the dials.


Close your eyes for a few minutes, and when you open them, you will be transported!

, You need to do something to show that your machine is working. Your friends could make a buzzing sound effect, or you could play eerie ""time machine"" music. Try the music from The Twilight Zone, for example. Here are some other ways to show that your time machine is working:


Have someone flicker the lights when you're in the machine, or flicker them yourself.
Get a mist machine and have mist go off while the machine is working. Only do this if it's safe to use it in your yard, garage, or another open area where you have built your machine.
Have someone blow bubbles all around you.
Someone can throw glitter or confetti in the air, but this could get messy.
Turn on a loud fan and aim it at the machine.
When the noise dies down, one of your friends could say ""processing complete"" in a robotic voice.

, Once the time machine has run its course, you have officially made it into a new era. Before you can fully enjoy your magical trip through time, there are a few things you need to do to make the most of your experience:


Give yourself a weathered look. You have traveled through hundreds, thousands, or even millions of years, so a little bit of wear and tear is expected. As you emerge from the machine, you can spike up your hair or add some dark makeup to your cheeks to show that you've been ""blown away"" through your experience.
Make sure to surround the machine with items from the new time period.
Your friends should be dressed in the clothes from the time period as well.
As you explore your new surroundings and new friends, be utterly confused. Cause a ruckus.
You may even decide that you'd rather go back home, and you can try stepping into your time machine again. But be careful — there's a good chance your machine may not work again!

,
Write messages on the finger feathers.,
Cut out the turkey hand card.,
Fold the card in half.,
Write any other message on the card.",How to Make Turkey Hand Cards," Cover the table the children will be sitting at. You'll need at least one colored sheet of paper per child sat in front of their spot at the table. In the middle, place a container of graphite pencils, a tub of paintbrushes, paint squeezed into containers that little hands and fingers can get into and any decorative elements you might be allowing the children to add, such as glitter, craft pompoms, googly eyes, etc.;
, This will help to keep their clothes nice and clean.

, If the child cannot do this for him/herself, have a helper do this. The turkey is the hand, with the fingers and thumb facing upward.

, Have the children draw a face on the thumb part of the hand. Draw a little face and a small beak popping out to one side. You can show the children an example first, and they can then draw freely, however they like.

, Treat each of the fingers that pop up as feathers of the turkey. For each one, ask the children to color them with colors of choice, using either the ends of fingers (spots), strokes of paint or other designs.

, This is a very creative exercise, so try not to dictate colors or styles.

,, Using markers, add messages over the paint, writing things that the children are thankful for. For children unable to write, ask what they want written and write it in for them.


For example, if the child is making a card for his or her dad, write something like Thanks for ..... In the middle finger, write that he or she is thankful for something else, then something else on the pinkie, and so on.

, Glue this cut-out to another piece of colored paper, in a color different from the one used to make the hand turkey. Try to center the hand as much as possible.


The paper the hand is glued onto must be large enough to be folded in half and form a card.

, Add glitter to it, if using. If wished, children could even cut out scrap fabric pieces and glue these to the turkey as clothing.


Name the turkey if wished.

, It may just be enough to add names in the ""to"" and ""from"" spots. It's now ready to give to someone for Thanksgiving season.

Take two pieces of cardstock and punch 5-7 holes down the left side of each one.
,

Take the computer paper, match it up with the cardstock, and punch holes in the same spots.
,

Insert the computer paper in between the two pieces of cardstock.
,

Weave the twine through the holes.,

Take the strip of fabric and the superglue.,

Now, here's the fun part.,

Now it's time to fill your sketchbook.",How to Create a Sketchbook,",,, To do this, take the end of the string and carefully thread it through the head of the needle. Insert the needle all the way through the first hole of the paper and cardstock. Wrap the thread around to the left, and insert the needle into the next hole down. Repeat until you reach the bottom of the book. If you still have thread left on your needle, then turn around and continue sewing the book the other way until you run out of thread. If this wasn't clear enough, check out an article on sewing., Make sure the strip of fabric is wide enough to wrap around the sides of the book, too. Be very careful when you use superglue; it is super sticky. Squeeze superglue around the sides of the fabric. Very carefully wrap it vertically on the spine, over top of the stitches. Press it down. Let it dry before you do anything else, you don't want to inadvertently glue your fingers together., Decorate the cover of the book. Make it unique and personal; it's your sketchbook. Consider making a collage of magazine clippings, or photos, or whatever you want. Paint the front of it. Write your name in bubble letters. Do whatever., Take it with you whenever you can, and in your free time, sit down by an object that interests you, and draw it to your best ability. If you mess up, don't erase it or rip out the page. Keep it so that the next time you draw the same thing, you can look back on your mistakes and prevent yourself from repeating them. If you run out of pages, tape some more pages in on top of others. Make a sketch on a big piece of paper, then fold it up and tape it inside the cover. It is literally impossible to run out of space in your sketchbook, because it is expandable. Well, I can't really tell you what to do anymore, because it is your sketchbook and it's none of my business. Enjoy."

20-30 sheets of drawing paper – Size A4 works well or even 9”x12” or 11”x14”.Patterned paper – This paper is for decorating the outsider cover of your sketchbook. Depending on how you want to decorate you can use 3 different patterns for the cover of the sketchbook, the spine, and the interior of the sketchbook covers (endpaper).Cardboard – To make the covers of the sketchbook. Consider using thick paperboard rather than corrugated cardboard; it’ rather feeble.Glue – White school glue works just fine for painting the materials.
Needle and thread – Using a thicker needle is advised, as well as thicker thread, such as string, yarn, or hemp.Ruler
An awl or pushpin
Pencil
Small paintbrush or sponge brush;
, Create 3-4 piles of paper with six sheets of paper in each pile. Fold each pile of paper lengthwise, in half, so that you make a little booklet with multiple pages. One little booklet is a “signature” of your sketchbook.The signatures make up the pages of your sketchbook, and make binding your sketchbook a lot easier.


Depending on how big you want your sketchbook to be, you can adjust the amount of signatures you use. However, the more signatures you use, the harder it’ll be to bind your sketchbook and the bulkier your sketchbook will be., Stack the signatures on top of one another, and line up the top, bottom, and folded edges. Use a pencil to draw four, evenly spaced vertical lines across the spines of the signatures.It is very important that the marked lines are all even on the signatures. This will ensure that the sketchbook pages line up uniformly once bound.
The lines nearest the top and bottom of the signatures should be at least an inch away from the edges., Unfold each signature so it lies flat, with the outer spine facing up. Use either an awl or a pushpin tack to push a hole through the lined markings on each signature spine.Be sure to keep the pages of each signature aligned so your binding holes are all evenly placed.
Once the sharp object is pushed through all sheets of paper, consider wriggling the poking object around a bit, to gently widen the holes. This will make it easier to fit the thread through., Gauge how much binding string you need to use by measuring the length of the signature spines. Then take that measurement from the top end of the spine to the bottom, and multiply it by how many signatures your sketchbook will have.For example, if the spine is 10” long, and the sketchbook will have 4 signatures, cut your binding string at least 40” long.


Always err on the side of caution. Cut more string than you need (about 45” of string), rather than cutting too little string, and running out as you thread.

, Feed the string through the eye of the needle, and tie the ends of the string together, so it is double threaded.Your knot should leave about an inch of extra string from the end of the knot. Let the needle fall to the middle of the string.

, Take one signature and thread the needle though the bottom hole, going from the outside of the signature, through to the inside of the signature.Pull the thread all the way through, so the knot of the string is up against the spine of the signature. From the inside of the signature, thread the needle through the second hole, moving out. Pull the string taut. Then, thread the needle through the third hole, moving from the outside of the signature, back in. Finally, thread the needle through the last top hole, moving from the inside of the signature, out.


To know if the binding looks correct, the string between the two middle holes should run along the outside of the spine.

, Stack the second signature on top of the first, having both spines line up evenly.Since the needle ending at the top of the spine for the first signature, you will start threading the second signature at the top hole. Thread the strong through the second signature’s top hole, moving outward, in. Finish threading the needle through the second signature’s binding holes in the same fashion as you threaded the first signature, swapping directions.The needle should finish at the bottom of the second signature, going from the inside, outward.

, With the needle and thread coming from the bottom of the second signature, loop the needle around the knotted end of the first signature. Pull the needle around, over the knotted string to make a loop, and feed the needle through the hole to make a new knot.This newly formed knot will secure the second signature to the first signature.


Be sure to loop the thread of the threaded needle in the space between the knot and the first signature.
If the securing knot is made on the free end of the knotted string, the signatures will not be secured to one another, and the securing knot will slip off the end of the string.

, Sew the rest of the signatures in the same manner you used for the previous signatures. If you are only using three signatures, when you finish threading the third signature, there won’t be a knot to tie the third signature onto. In this case, make a knot with the needle and thread around the string holding the first and second signature together.If you are using an even number of signatures, you will finish threading on the bottom, and be able to make a securing, final knot around the original signature knot.


Once you have sewn all of your signatures, make your final securing knot, and cut off the rest of the string. Again, be sure to leave a small amount of space on the string you cut.

, The edges of the signature pages may be a bit uneven once they are all stitched together. If they are, and you want them evened out, use a ruler to measure 1/8” from the edge, mark the straight edge, and then cut off 1/8” from the pages’ edges.Consider measuring the width of the signature pages after you trim them, so you know the exact dimensions of your pages.

, The covers for the sketchbook are going to be the same width as your signature pages, but will be ¼” taller on the top edge.To find the measurements of the covers, trace your bound signatures (folded) onto the board you’re using to make your covers. Fully trace the signature pages twice, one tracing to make the front cover, and one to make the back cover. Once you have two tracings of the signature pages, measure ¼” above the top edge of the signature pages tracing. Make two marks; one mark ¼” above the spine side, and one mark ¼” above the free edge side. Connect the ¼ inch markings horizontally, so you have a straight line ¼” taller on the top edge of the original signature pages tracing.


When the tracings are finished and expanded by ¼” at the top, use scissors to cut out the two cardboard covers.

, The spine of the sketchbook will be the same height as the covers, but the width will depend on the height of the bound signature pages.Use a ruler to find the height of the bound signature pages, and use that measurement as the width of the sketchbook spine. Once you have your measurements, cut the spine out of the cardboard.

, Trace your cover cardboard onto the paper you want to use for your cover paper. Once you have two complete tracings, use a ruler to measure 1½” from the top edge of the two tracings.Make two marks on each tracing; one mark 1½” above the spine side, and one mark 1½” above the free edge side.


The finished products should be two pieces of cover paper that are equal in width to the sketchbook covers, and 1½” taller than the cover boards., Use a ruler to measure and draw a ¾” line from three edges of the cover paper. The cover board for the sketchbook should fit within the ¾” lines.The only side of the cover paper that shouldn’t be measured is the side that will be on the spine of the sketchbook.

, With the two intersecting lines that measure the top and vertical ¾” measurements on the cover paper, draw a 45-degree angle line just above the intersecting lines.Then, cut along the 45-degree line. Fold the cover paper over to the inside face of the cover board to see if the cover paper fits correctly.


The amount of left space between the intersecting lines and the 45-degree angled line should be very little, about 1/32”., Place the cut out sketchbook spine on the paper with which you’ve chosen to decorate it. Trace the spine on the paper, and then trace vertical lines extending 1½” out from both sides of the spine, and ¾” horizontal lines from the top and bottom of the spine.The end result should look like a big rectangle, with a centered skinny rectangle that’s the same size as the spine of your sketchbook.

, Cut the two end paper sheets to be equivalent in height to your signature pages, but twice the widthwise.Then fold the two sheets in half.


Be sure that the patterned side of the end paper is facing inward when folded in half.

, Lay the cover papers on a flat surface. Use the glue and a paintbrush or paint sponge to coat the cover papers with a thin layer of glue. Completely cover the inside sections of the papers with glue, where the hard cardboard pieces will be. Place the cardboard pieces onto the papers, and press out any air bubbles that form once the cardboard pieces are on the paper. Coat the cover papers edges (that are sticking out) with glue, and fold them in to the insides of the covers.To help the covers dry smooth and evenly, lay heavy books on top to keep the covers from curling or bending as they dry.
If the glue is really thick, you can thin it out a little bit by mixing it with some water in a small dish.

, Lay the spine paper on a flat surface, and cover the middle section (where the spine will go) with a layer of glue. Place the spine inside the drawn out parameters.

, Once the spine has had some time to dry, apply a thin layer of glue to one side of the spine paper, next to the spine. Place one cover on the spine paper, leaving about 1/8” to ¼” of space between the spine and the sketchbook cover.Do the same thing on the other side of the spine, attaching the other cover to the spine paper. When both covers are glued to the spine paper, add a small amount of glue to the top and bottom edges of the spine paper, and fold them in to the inside of the sketchbook.Add some heavy books to the glued pieces of the sketchbook so they can dry uniformly.


Remember, the outside covers of the sketchbook should be facing down on your flat surface.
Be sure to press the spine paper into the spaces between the spine and the covers.

, Cover the back of one of the sheets of end paper with a thin layer of glue. Make sure the entire back surface is covered. Then place the end paper on the inside of one of the covers.Align the edge of the paper to be at the edge of the spine-side cover. Glue the other end paper to the inside of the other cover, aligning the edge of the end paper near the spine-side of the cover.


There should be a small amount of space between the edges of the end papers, and the open edges of the sketchbook.

, On one of the end papers, coat approximately ½” of the spine-side edge of the end paper with glue. Fold the cover over (essentially closing the sketchbook), to align the glued portion of the end paper with the last page of signature paper.Then flip the book over and glue the other edge of the end paper to the nearest page of signature paper.


Once all the gluing is finished, lay a few heavy books on top of the sketchbook so everything can dry without warping or curling.

Open the book where the loose pages belong.,
Apply a thin line of glue along the binding of the page in the book.,
Insert the page back into place.,
Close the book and place it under weights.,
Leave the book to dry for 24-48 hours.",How to Repair a Paperback Book1," If a few pages in your book have come loose, not to worry. Open your book to the spot where you’d like to insert the loose page.


If the book doesn’t stay open on its own, make sure to weigh down the pages with a paperweight. This way the book won’t start closing before you’re done inserting the loose page.;
, Place a thin line of archival glue along the vertical edge of the page to which you’d like to adhere your loose page. The glue should be as close to the binding as you can get it. Make sure you’re using an archival glue, which should be acid free.Do not glue multiple loose pages onto one another as this will not be stable over time.
You can purchase archival glues from craft stores or an archival supplier., Carefully place the page back into place, taking care to align the edges of your loose page with the edges of adjacent pages.


To prevent any glue from oozing out, you can put a piece of wax paper along the page to soak up any escaping glue. This way your pages won’t glue together., To ensure the page lays flat within the book while it’s drying, weigh down the book with another heavier book., While archival glue will dry within a few hours, it’s best practice to leave the book for at least 24 hours to set."

Select a book, preferably a thick one with a sturdy hard cover.,
Select the first few pages that you want to have free at the end of the project (plus one more) and hold them to the front cover with plastic food wrap so they do not get messed up with the glue.,
Mix a solution of white glue and water.,
Now that you have the top cover and the first couple of pages wrapped in food wrap, brush the three edges of the book with the glue solution so that it is reasonably absorbed.,
Place something heavy on top of the book so as to apply pressure.,

Brush the ""frame"" of the hole with a light coat of glue.,
Close the book again, this time without any spacers.,
Cut the saved page neatly along the edges of the hole so that the hole is visible and accessible once again.,
Check to make sure every part of the book is thoroughly dry.",How to Make a Hollow Book," (See 'tips' and 'warnings' first, about where to get an appropriate book and not to select a valuable/antique/currently popular/important book).






;
, These pages, except for the last one, will not be cut out. This will allow the book to look like a book when it is opened up and will cover the hole itself.








, Make the consistency just enough for the glue to be runny, and more easily absorbed by the edge of the book's pages. 50% to 70% glue (30% to 50% water) or half a 35mm film canister full usually works well but use your judgment, given the thickness and size of the book. Alternatively, try a craft glue like Mod Podge.








, This will hold the book's pages together. Remember: clean the brush off immediately, or else it will harden and become useless for step 9.








, Let the book dry for fifteen to thirty minutes.








, Draw a half-inch (1.2 cm) border within the edge, on all four sides (including the spine). Drill a hole in each corner of the newly drawn box to the depth you wish the hidden compartment to be. (This makes cutting out the pages easier because the blade does not have to make a 90 degree turn.) You may leave a few of the glued bottom pages uncut.








, Try to make the cut as vertical as possible, or else try to tilt it so the hole will narrow as you go down. Using a ruler, as shown in the image, can help a lot. Apply enough pressure to cut a few pages at a time or as many as you would like. A metal ruler is advisable.








, Do not rush this step, because the slower and more carefully you do this, the smoother and straighter the inside edges will be. Remove the bits of paper from the inside that accumulate from the cutting.








, The glue dries clear, so don't be concerned if it drips a little. While waiting, apply a second coat of glue to the outside edges of the pages.








, The saved page will be glued directly on top of the hole, essentially covering it (for now).








, Allow it to dry for about 15-30 minutes. In this drying phase, the saved page will become affixed to the hole, as mentioned in the previous step.








, The insides of the book may still be moist because the book had been closed while drying. Now is a good time to let the book dry while it's open.








, Touch it with your fingers, and when you are certain it is dry, fill it with your treasured items, shut the book, and put it in the bookshelf. Only you will know that this book has a secret compartment!

Place the tape along the tear.",How to Repair a Paperback Book2," On the torn page, identify if the tear has a single direction. If it doesn’t, you’ll want to repair only one direction of the tear at a time., Cut your archival tape a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) longer than the tear so the repair will be more stable.

You should be selective with what kind of tape you use. An archival document repair tape will be safest for your book., Center the tape over the tear so the tape will extend beyond the tear in both directions.

Open the book where the binding is broken.,
Apply a thin line of archival glue along the seam.,
Close the book and use rubber bands to secure it.,
Leave the book to dry for 24-48 hours.",How to Repair a Paperback Book4," Open your book to where the glue binding has broken. You’ll know this has happened because your book will fall easily open to the break, and you’ll be able to see the binding glue. Repairing this will ensure that pages or segments of pages don’t fall out of your binding.The glue binding of thick paperbacks, in particular, are notorious for partially breaking while you’re reading.

, Carefully apply archival glue along the interior seam of the book where the old glue is exposed.

You can use a small brush if you’d like to more evenly apply the glue.

, Close the book securely and put two rubber bands around it to keep it stable. Place one rubber band towards the top of the book and another towards the bottom., While archival glue will dry within a few hours, it’s best practice to leave the book for at least 24 hours to set."

Use a dry cleaning sponge to remove surface dirt.,
Absorb grease stains with paper towels.,
Erase away pencil marks.",How to Repair a Paperback Book5," Use a dry cleaning sponge, which is a block of vulcanized rubber found at archival stores, to gently rub away dirt. Brush away any residue with a soft brush or soft brush attachment on your vacuum.Do not ever use water with your sponge. This will cause permanent damage to your book.

, If you’ve got a pesky grease stain, you can place paper towels along the stain and close the book. This should absorb the grease from a freshly made stain., Using a plastic eraser you can remove pencil marks by erasing in a forward motion. Brush away the eraser dust with a soft brush or vacuum.Ink marks cannot be removed.

Buy yourself a college composition notebook from the dollar store.,
Decide how you'd like to decorate the outside cover.

,
Using decorative cardstock, place the notebook in the middle of the cardstock.,
Using a different design cardstock but complementing the other, cover the binding of the notebook.,
Now using that same color cardstock that you used for the binding, cut two pieces because you will be using that to decorate the inside of the covers.,
If you want to use ribbon for closing the journal, place one piece of the ribbon under the cardstock from step #6 before gluing the paper down.

,
Same with if you'd like to decorate the outside middle binding.,
Decorate the outside however you'd like by placing a label with a title saying it is your journal or recipe book or ""Private"" or whatever you want it to say.

,
Then inside you will want to start with the beginning page.","How to Create a Personal Journal ""Beverly"" Style"," They are fairly cheap.;
,, Make sure you have enough on the edges of the notebook to fold in to cover the edge. You want to cut the paper in half because you are going to glue the paper on the front and back covers, getting to the binding as close as possible. Then fold the three sides inward with enough to glue down securely.

, Here you can cut it to meet the other paper perfectly or you can tear it to give it an edginess. If you do this, you will want to overlap the paper. Then you may want to ink it by running the ink pad along the torn page. You don't have to use ink if you don't want.

, Use your corner punch for the two corners that are placed on the outside edge.

,, If you want to add ribbon or decorative string, you want to add it to the outside, leaving enough on both ends so you can place it under the paper from step #6 before gluing it down on the inside of the book.

,, Date the top of the page showing when you wrote in the journal, even if the photo is from 10 years ago. But then write the date of the photo underneath it. Sometimes you can write and not add a photo but other times if you do add a photo, you want to tell the story of what was going on the day the photo was taken. You don't have to throw out the photo where it might've been ruined because you blinked or turned your head or you weren't in any of the photos that might've made it into a scrapbook. So you can take a copy or a bad photo and put it in your journal and write about it.

Decide whether or not the table and figure is really necessary.,
Make sure the table or figure stands alone with its caption and title.,
Keep it stylistically simple.,
Use appendices.,
Limit your tables and figures to the body of your manuscript.",How to Place Tables and Figures in Manuscripts1," Make sure your table or figure is really needed. Does it add anything to the paper? Does it make the information clearer? If it is just taking up space, delete it.;
, The reader should not need to refer to the text to understand it.


Place any tables or figures as close to the relevant text as possible. Always introduce the graph or figure in the text.

, Graphs, tables, and figures do not need to be overly complicated to be effective. In fact, they are probably more effective with a simple design, as the date or information is the star of the show.

, Use appendices for related information that does not directly correspond to the text.


For instance, if a graph provides population information from the last ten years but you are focusing on the last year primarily, the graph doesn’t necessarily need to be in the text.
Place it at the end of the paper, and reference it as needed.

, Most of the time, you will place graphs and figures in the main body of the text only, not in the introduction or conclusion.


That’s because your introduction and conclusion provide an overview of what you are saying, not the nitty-gritty details that graphs and figures provide.

Being creative is not only for one specific set of individuals, such as children, young adults, or the very old.,

Building a collage can help bring us back to the reality of what we want and where we wanted to go.,

Cut out the pictures that represent or remind you of where you were and are and then cut out pictures of that represent or remind you of where you would like to be.
,

Be truthful and honest, and remember, this is something you are doing just for yourself.,

Place the pictures on a large cardboard and format it before pasting.,

Be aware, that even if you did not learn anything, creating a collage is fun and enjoyable and an inexpensive pastime to remove you from the stresses of your life.
",How to Make a Therapeutic Collage," Creativity is for everyone and comes in many forms. We can write a story, paint a picture or stitch and frame a canvas. Learning who we are now and what our aims and goals were when we were younger, can help us be happier and more content adults. Somehow, many of us feel we got lost along the way and gave up our identities and our dreams to please others.
, Look through various magazines and cut out pictures. Look for pictures that reveal who you are or who you think you are and what you would like to be.,, Take your time, part of the therapy is looking, searching, and trying to find the person you seemed to have lost in the process of growing up and just where you would like to go in the future. Dream BIG, but be realistic., This is your life you are pasting, so keep that in mind when you organize the pictures. Realize that by creating a collage of what you had wanted to be, you might find that you have been that person after all, and that the imaginary person you are now making up is much like you are now. Once that realization sets in, , the unrest and turmoil within you, the anger you might feel at yourself for not being what you had wanted to be, might cease, and you can be a happier and more content person.,"

Choose your paper.,
Create your signatures.,
Gather your signatures.",How to Bind a Book1," To create your own book, you can choose to use any paper you would like. Regular 8½ x 11 printer paper can be used, as can any variety of handmade papers or cardstock. Make sure that you have enough pages prepared to fill your whole book, around 50-100 sheets. You will be folding each sheet in half, so your total number of pages will be double the number of sheets you use.;
, A signature is a grouping of pages that are folded together. Each signature should consist of 4 sheets of paper folded directly down the center together. Use a bone folder for the cleanest crease and a ruler to make sure you have the fold centered down the direct middle of the signature. Your book will contain several signatures, so make as many as are necessary to use all your paper.








, Pick up all your signatures together, and tap them into place against a hard, smooth surface so that they are level. Make sure that all the pages are lined up and even along the spine; your signatures should all be facing the same direction.

Place the table close to the text that describes it.,
Number the tables consecutively.,
Cite the table.,
Number figures, and label them “Figure” or “Fig.” Figures can be any illustration that are not tables, including charts and diagrams.",How to Place Tables and Figures in Manuscripts2," When referring to it, use the table number: “table 1.”


Double-space all text corresponding to the table, including the reference information and the caption.
Align the table to the left.

, The table number goes above the table. The caption goes below the table number.

, If you are pulling the table from another source, place the source information below the table. Use a full reference citation under the table.


Use the author’s name (inverted, followed by a period), the title in italics (period), the location (colon), the publisher (comma), the year (period), and the medium (period).”
For example: “Red, Jay. Art for Art’s Sake. Alabama, Georgia: Art Publishers, 2004. Print.”
Use hanging indention (indent the lines after the first line). You don’t need to repeat this information on the reference page.

,


Label it underneath, with capitalization: “Figure 1” or “Fig. 1.” Right after that (on the same line), write a caption or title to describe it. Follow it with source information if it came from another source.
Align them the best way for the text. Some illustrations may fit better with text to the left or right, and MLA permits that usage.

Place the table or figure near the paragraph that introduces it.,
Keep it simple.,
Label your table or figure.,
Make sure your table or figure is the correct size.",How to Place Tables and Figures in Manuscripts3," Number the figures and tables separately, with each set using consecutive numbers:


“Table 1, Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Figure 5.”

, Don’t make the design overly complicated. Use a sans-serif font. Fonts should be 8 to 14 point.

, Place the figure or table number in italics, and then write a title and caption. Both will be in sentence case, meaning only the first word is capitalized. The caption should be a short description of what is in the figure.


Use a legend to explain any symbols.

, Create figures that are 2 to 3.25 inches (5.1 to 8.3 cm) in width for one column; for two columns, they can be 4.25 to 6.875 inches (10.8 to 17.5 cm).

"
"
Cite your table or figure.,
Number your tables.,
Describe your table or figure.",How to Place Tables and Figures in Manuscripts4," If the table comes from another source (meaning you didn’t create it) you need to create a source line below the figure. You’ll place the word “Sources:” first, then make a regular Chicago reference.


That is, the author’s name (inverted), the title in italics (period), the city and state of publication (colon), the publisher (comma), and the year (period).
For example: “Red, Jay. Art for Art’s Sake. Alabama, Georgia: Art Publishers, 2004.”
Also include this information on your reference page.

, Number your tables from the beginning of the paper to the end in order; figures should have their own series of consecutive numbers. .

, Create a descriptive title for the table. Write the description in the paragraph before introducing the table. Refer to the table by its number, such as “table 1.”

"
"
Place your signatures on a textbook.,
Place weights on top of the signatures.,
Add your glue.,
Add headband tape.",How to Bind a Book2," The goal is to raise the signatures above the level of your table so that they are easier to glue. You can also use a wooden block or other thick, sturdy material if a textbook is not available. Place your signatures so that ¼ of an inch overhangs the spine of the textbook underneath; be careful not to bump the signatures so that they fall out of line.

, To keep the pages from moving around, add several more textbooks or other heavy, flat items on top of your signatures. This will also help to provide a sturdy spine for the glue. Again, be careful not to move the pieces around too much or bump them out of alignment.

, Use PVA (PVAC)glue to stick your pages together. Using other glues such as regular white school glue, hot glue, super glue, or rubber cement won’t allow your pages much flexibility and will crack over time. Use a regular paintbrush to apply a coat of the glue to the entire spine, being careful not to get any on either the front or back pages. Wait 15 minutes, and then add another coat of glue. You will need to add 5 layers of glue total, with a period of waiting in between each.








, This is a flexible fabric-like tape used for binding books that goes on both the top and the bottom of the spine. It adds extra reinforcement, and prevents the back of the spine from being pulled away from the signatures. Cut a small piece (shorter than ½ inch) and attach it to the top and bottom of your signatures near the spine.







"
"
Create your holes in the signatures.,
Sew each signature.,
Sew the signatures together.,
Add a bit of glue for extra strength.",How to Bind a Book3," Take each signature and open it so that you can see the center fold of the group of papers. Use an awl to punch holes down the side, or use an embroidery needle with the eye stuck in a cork if you don’t have an awl. Make your first hole directly along the crease in the exact center of the fold. Then measure 2½ inches up and down from this hole to make your other two points (making a total of three holes).








, Cut a piece of wax thread to a length of about 2.5 feet (0.8 m), and thread your bookbinding needle. Insert the needle and thread through the center hole, coming from behind. Leave a few inches of the string on the outside so that you can tie a knot with it later.









Thread the needle through the bottom hole, so that the thread is on the outside of the book. Pull this thread tight.
Re-enter the thread through the topmost hole from the back. Then take the thread and pull it through the center hole, this time coming from the inside of the paper. Then tie the excess thread in the back in a secure knot and cut any extra string.

, Use one foot of thread for each signature you intend to sew. Start by sewing two signatures together first, and then add on additional signatures once the first two are combined. Line up two signatures together, and insert the needle through the outside of the top hole of one of the signatures. Have a knot tied with a few inches of space on the end, to keep the thread from sliding through.









When you pull the thread through the top hole, thread it from the inside into the center hole. When you pull the thread through, insert it into the second hold of the second signature.
Take the thread from the second hole on the inside of the second signature, and insert it it into the third hole. Pull the thread through so that it is on the outside of the third hole on the second signature.
Add additional signatures by take the thread from the third hole of the second signature, and inserting it into the third hole of a third signature. use the same process to work your way back up the spine of the third signature.
When you finish adding signatures, tie the end of your sewing thread with the tail end of the first knot, and cut off the excess string.

, When you’ve sewn all your signatures together, use a bit of glue to make sure that they won’t fall apart along the spine. Brush on any glue (ideally bookbinding glue) along the length of the spine. Place several heavy textbooks over the top of the book to keep them in place while the glue dries.

Measure your cover board.,
Measure your book spine.,
Cut your fabric.,
Glue your fabric to your boards.,
Attach your signatures to the cover.,
Wait for your book to dry.",How to Bind a Book4," You can use cardboard for a soft cover, or book binding board for a sturdier cover. Place your signatures over the board and draw around the shape. Then, add an extra ¼” to the height and width of the cover. Cut out this piece and use it to create the template for the back cover of your book.








, Hold a ruler up to the spine of your signature and measure the width of the paper stack. Then use this measurement along with the total height of the papers to cut out a long, thin strip of cardboard to use as the spine.








, You can use any cotton based non-stretch fabric you would like. Lay out your two covers and spine on top of the fabric. Space each piece so that they are ¼” apart. Then measure around the three pieces, adding 1” extra in every direction. Cut out this single piece of fabric.









At the corners of your fabric, cut a small acute triangle with a point that lines up with the corner of your cover board. This will allow you to fold the fabric in without making creases in the corners.

, Place your boards back in their original position over the fabric, with the spine centered and each piece set ¼” of an inch away from each other. Completely coat the front of the board with glue (preferably bookbinding glue, but any kind will work) and stick it to the fabric. Then, fold the excess fabric over the edges of the board and use glue to stick them on the inside.








, Place your book of signatures inside the cover you have just created to verify that it fits. Then, place a piece of scratch paper under the first page of the first signature. Cover the outside of this page in glue, and then press down the cover of the book to attach it to the cover page. Remove the scratch paper.









Open to the new first page of the book, and use your bone folder to rub the cover page you just glued to the cover. Make sure that it is completely attached with no air bubbles.
Repeat this process again for the last page in your book and the back cover.

, Place several heavy books or flat objects on top of your completed book. Allow it to sit for 1-2 days to completely dry and compress all the pages. After you have waited long enough, enjoy your new book!

Fix a loose hinge.,
Reinforce a hinge.,
Replace a broken spine.,
Fix a paperback cover.,
Replace a broken hard cover.",How to Bind a Book5," If the spine of your book is loose along one or both of the hinges, use this quick fix to have it back in perfect condition. Coat a long knitting needle in binding glue and slide it down the spine of the book along the loose hinge. Turn the book around and do the same on the other side. Place the book under a heavy weight for several hours to dry the hinge in place.








, If one of the spine's hinges has come undone from the textblock of the book, use glue and a bit of tape it to put it back in place. Brush glue along the exposed hinge and on the corner of the textblock. Put the cover back in place and use a weight to hold it till it dries.









For extra reinforcement, use a strip of binding tape (or duct tape if you don't care so much about the appearance) along the corner of the hinge on the inside cover and the flyleaf page.
Use a bone folder to crease the tape along the length of the hinge and secure it in place.

, If your covers/hinge are intact with the textblock of the book, you can replace a broken spine without removing the entire cover. Use scissors to cut out the spine without cutting along the hinge. Then, cut a new piece of board to fit the spine (use the old spine for measurement). Use two long pieces of binding tape the length of the book to secure the spine to the two covers.


If you want, you can cover the board in a matching fabric before sticking it to the covers.
If you don't have binding tape and don't mind appearances, duct tape or a sturdy packing tape can be substituted to hold the spine in place. Binding tape is especially useful though, because it comes with special corners that fit perfectly around the top and bottom edges of the spine.

, If the cover of one of your paperback books has come off, brush glue along the entire spine of the textblock and put the cover back in place. Put several heavy weights on the book and allow time to dry.

, If the hard cover of your book is salvageable, use the directions above for creating a hard cover from scratch to replace your book cover. You can also choose to buy a new or used hard cover book in good condition and of the same size, cut off the cover, and use it for your book."

Examine each ticket to ensure it’s salvageable. If the ticket stub is totally trashed or cannot be restored you may want to retire it to the “circular file” or it may be better off in your jewelry drawer or even in a safety deposit box if it’s valuable.
Group tickets per frame. Since each ticket is most likely a different size and shape you’ll want to see what you have to fit the tickets together to form an aesthetically pleasing design.;
, Find the picture frame to hold and display the tickets. Look for something that has a pre-cut mat so you have a backing to hold the tickets.


Consider your overall décor when selecting a frame. Choose a frame that either complements your current style or one that is similar to what you have on display.
Choose a frame size that will easily accommodate your collection. Whether you are planning a series of frames or want to make one large statement have a plan in terms of the number and size of frames you plan to use.

, Remove the mat from the glass and frame to reveal a workspace area. Arrange tickets on the mat without using the Spray Mount adhesive to look at different designs.

, Press firmly in place so the tickets hold in place and do not fall.


Allow amply time for the tickets to dry before replacing frame. Allow at least an hour of dry time before replacing frame and hanging picture on the wall.

Find suitable cardboard boxes.,
Plan your castle design.,
Set the cardboard pieces in place to get an idea of the shape of the castle.,
Cut the ramparts design into the top of the box.,
Draw a stone design on a large sheet of tin foil.,
Cover the entire castle in the decorated foil.,
Attach the turrets to the corners of your castle wall.,
Create a moat around the castle.,
Build the castle bridge.,
Add anything else that you think completes the castle's overall appearance.",How to Build a Castle out of Cardboard Boxes1," A sturdy, nicely shaped box would be best. A good example is a box used for printer paper. Cereal boxes, tissue boxes, or shoe boxes would work as well. Also collect four cardboard rolls, these can either be toilet paper or paper towel rolls depending on the size of your castle.;
, Check photos or illustrations of real castles for inspiration and create a design on paper.In the case of this article, it's going to be kept simple with just four walls with a traditional rampart design,and four rolls to act as turrets. Then a moat will be added surrounding the castle. If you do design the castle with more complexity, consider:


Creating turrets which are cut out separately and can stand alone.
Making one central tall tower for the prince or princess to be stuck in, with a window for the unfortunate royal to stare through.

, With the box on your working surface, set the four long rolls to each corner of the photocopy paper box (don't physically attach them yet––this gets done later.) Assess the size of the turrets to the main castle box. Adjust the turret size if needed.


If you would like the turrets to be taller, you can switch to a longer roll, like a paper towel or wrapping paper roll.
To make the turrets shorter, simply cut the current rolls down to size. Be sure that you measure and cut all four rolls to the same height.

, Ramparts are the surrounding walls of the castle and commonly have alternating squares and open square spaces.Use a ruler to measure and trace evenly spaced squares on the top of your box. Using scissors, cut out every other square to create the rampart walls of the castle.


Another option is cutting a square template from a piece of cardboard and tracing that square all the way around the box.
Attempt to measure the square to a size which will fit all the way around the box in even spacing.

, Measure out enough tin foil to cover a wall of the castle. Lay this sheet of foil on your working surface and draw an alternating stone pattern using a permanent black marker.To do this, start at the bottom and draw rectangles of approximately the same size, one connected to the other, all the way across the bottom of the tin foil.
To create the next row of stones above this one, start at the center point of the first rectangle on the bottom row and draw a rectangle which covers the left half of the top of the first brick and the right half of the top of the second brick.
Continue following this pattern until you have reached the top.
If you prefer a more muted look to your castle, you can opt to use gray or tan Bristol Board or craft paper.

, This will get rid of the cardboard look and it will create the smooth, shiny surface. Apply a decent coverage of craft glue to the cardboard and press the foil in place on each wall and wrapped around the turrets. The walls should be covered on both the front and back.


Wrap the excess foil around the tops of the walls to cover any exposed cardboard.
Gather the foil together at the top of the turrets to cover the hole in the top of the roll.

, Measure the height of the corner of your castle wall. Draw a line in pencil up the side of the turret which matches the length of the corner of the castle wall. Start at the bottom and continue drawing up toward the top of the turret. Using scissors, cut slits in the turrets along this line. Place glue along the cut edges. Wedge each turret onto a corner of the box. Press and hold the glued edges to the corner of the castle wall until it feels secure.

, Cut a piece of blue Bristol Board or craft into a square shape with rounded edges, that is larger than the castle and gives the appearance of a lake or moat surrounding the castle. The reflection on the foil makes for a nice water effect.

, Cut a small piece of black craft paper into a rectangle with a rounded top for the appearance of space going into the castle. Then trace around that black doorway onto a piece of brown paper or cardboard and cut that brown shape out to form the bridge. Glue the black piece to the front wall of the castle to create the door space. Place the brown piece flat down in front of the door space and glue it to the moat.


Measure to be sure the bridge will be long enough to cross the moat.
To create a drawbridge effect, glue a piece of string to each side of the top of the black doorway. Glue the other end of the strings to top of the bridge on each side. This will create the effect of the chains used to draw up the bridge.

, In this case, the turrets have been finished with roofs and flags and some banners have been hung from the ramparts.To make turret roofs, simply make cones from paper in the correct width and glue into place over the top of each turret tube.
Cut medieval flag and banner shapes from craft paper and glue them to toothpicks to create flags which you can glue into the tops of your turret roofs. You can also glue banners on the front, top end of your rampart wall over the doorway.

Start with a large cardboard box.,
Reinforce the box with tape.,
Create a rampart wall effect along the top of the box.,
Create a window.,
Make a doorway.,
Attach a drawbridge.,
Draw details around your window and doorway.,
Draw your castle walls.,
Expand your castle.",How to Build a Castle out of Cardboard Boxes2," Some of your best options would be a wardrobe box or a refrigerator box. You want something large enough that your child can crawl inside and play.


You can purchase wardrobe boxes from a moving company.
Try getting free boxes from a local store which sells appliances.
For multiple sections and levels to your castle, choose boxes of different shapes and sizes. Washer and dryer boxes would work well for this.

, Set up the box with the top flaps reaching upward. Tape the corners of the flaps together on the inside of the box using packaging tape. This creates more height with an opening on top of the box.


If you would like to add some fun color to your box, you can use a colored tape, like painters tape on the outside of the corners instead. Consider also using this tape to create the stone effect all around the outside.

, Measure the top of one side of the box from corner to corner. Divide that length by an even number such as 12 or 8. Using a ruler, and starting in the corner of one side of the top of the box, measure out and draw a square with sides the length of one section according to your calculations. Using a box-cutter, cut out this square. You will use this as a template.If your box is 24x24x24, and you divide by 12, your template would be a 2 inch square.
Place the template next to the cut square hole in the top of the box. Line the edge of the square to one side of the cut.
Trace the other side of the template onto the top of the box, then move the template, lining an edge on this line. Finish tracing the rest of the square and cut it out of the top of the box.
Repeat this process all the way around the top of the box, creating an alternating square and cut section to make the rampart effect.

, Draw a window on the top, left corner of your castle. This should be a thin rectangle with a rounded top. You want it to be just large enough for your child to be able to peek through. Cut the window out using a box cutting knife.

, On the bottom, left of the box, draw a rectangle with a rounded top. This should be larger than your window and wide enough for your child to crawl through. Cut this door out with your box cutting knife. Only cut the two sides and the top, leaving the bottom section attached to the box.


Be careful when cutting out the doorway that you do not damage the piece which is being cut to make the space. This will become your drawbridge.

, Using a drill or screwdriver, puncture two holes in the box, one on each side of the top of the doorway. Thread a piece of nylon rope through these holes from front to back, then tie a knot on the inside of the box. Puncture two more holes one each side of the top of the drawbridge section you have cut out. Push the other end of each rope through these holes and tie knots on the section that is touching the ground to secure the rope in place.It is helpful to reinforce these holes by taping around the cut edges with packaging tape. This will make the area more durable.
Your child can raise and lower the drawbridge by pulling on the knots in the rope from the inside the box.

, Using a large marker or paint, draw a keystone at the top of the arch of the doorway.This is a quadrilateral slightly larger than a square, with the two sides expanding at a slight angle. The top side will, consequently, be slightly larger than the bottom. You can make this top side slightly rounded.


Using the keystone as your starting point, draw similar quadrilaterals from the top of the arch, all the way to the bottom of the doorway. Repeat this on the other side.
Use this same technique to create detail around the window. Also draw squares along the bottom of the window. These should be roughly the same size as your quadrilaterals.

, Using paint or a thick, permanent marker, draw a stone design onto your box. Start by drawing a horizontal rectangle along the bottom of your box and connecting equally-sized rectangles all the way around the bottom.To draw the second layer, Start at the center point of one of the rectangles and draw a line upward from there to create the side of the rectangle to begin your second layer of stones. The other side should rise up from the center of the next stone on the bottom layer. Connect these sides with a line on the top.
Repeat this system until you have covered the walls of your castle in stones.
This step is great for getting your child involved. You can also draw the lines in pencil and have your child trace them with a marker or paint.

, If you would like to make a larger castle, attach another box to this main one. Using a smaller box than the original, line it up to the side of the main box and trace the square where it will fit. Cut this square out of the main box. Slide one set of flaps from the new box through the square and tape them to the inside of the main box to hold it in place.


Proceed with adding windows, details, and drawing stones on each new section which is added to the castle.

If you want to have a removable roof, you should leave the bottom on.

, Cut flat lines on two opposite sides. On the other two sides, go up to a point in the middle, like a roof. Basically, you're creating a triangle shape on top of a rectangle or square shape. For this part, you can use scissors., The roof should be a single piece of cardboard large enough to reach over the edges of the roof space. Bend it in half so it rests correctly over the roof angle., Use a pencil to draw where you want doors and windows. Use a craft knife or scissors to cut them out. For the doors, leave one edge uncut, so you have a door that opens and shuts., Use hot glue to glue the roof in place. Trace the glue along the top edges of the cardboard, and then set the roof in place.


You can leave the roof off if you want a removable roof, as long as you left the bottom on for structure., It should have large sections that aren't bent.


This type of dollhouse has a center wall with pieces fitted through the center to create rooms on either side.

, Follow the folding lines to create large pieces of cardboard., This piece will be the largest one for your dollhouse, and it determines the length., These should be the same height as the original wall and should be able to extend out on either side of it to create good-sized rooms.How many of these walls you make depends on how long you made the original wall. You need a wall on each end, but you may have one, two, or three dividing walls in between. One wall in between will create four rooms, while two will create six rooms and three will create eight rooms.

, You should measure lengthwise, and use a pencil to mark the middle. Also measure to the middle height-wise., Cut into the middle lengthwise, going down to the middle height-wise.Repeat for each smaller wall piece.

, Place the pieces on the long piece of cardboard, lining them up where you want them to go. Use a pencil to mark the places.Use the strip you cut to line them up. Insert the large wall into the cut strip. The smaller walls will sit up too high, which is why you will cut strips in the large wall in the next step.

, The strip should run the same direction you had the walls standing up.For the end pieces, move in a half-inch or so from the outer edge to cut the strip.

, Draw and cut out windows and doors in the walls., Put the walls together. The small walls should fit into the large wall like a puzzle piece, with each side straddling the other. Glue the walls in place with hot glue., The best boxes for this activity are refrigerator boxes or other boxes of that size. Dishwasher boxes also work fine., Reserve the flaps for later., On the door, leave one edge uncut. Bend it back to make the door open., Bend the flaps or tape two together to create the roof, resting it on two edges of the top of the box. You will need to add a triangle piece of cardboard at the front and back to match the slope of the roof. Glue the roof in place., Attach them to the roof in a shingle pattern. Beginning at the bottom edge, glue the shingles on in a row with the bottom part hanging over. Only glue the top edge on. Glue the next row in, also leaving the bottoms unglued. Each layer should hang over the layer below., Cut out scalloped pieces of cardboard, and glue them under the front edge of the roof to create eaves., The decorating process can be messy, so make sure you protect your table or other painting surface by spreading out newspaper.

, It dries hard and white, both covering up the brown of the cardboard or any ink on the cardboard and providing a smooth surface for the even application of paint.


Gesso can be purchased in any craft or art supply store.
Using a clean brush, apply the gesso in an even coat to the entire surface of the house.
Use long, parallel strokes to ensure an even coating.
Let the gesso dry completely before painting the house.

, Using your ruler, sketch out flowers, eaves, or anything else you want to paint on your house. If you don't want to cut out windows in an earlier step, you can draw and paint them instead.

, Use a small brush on the smaller house so you can control the detail, or else you might end up with a smudgy door or windows. For the playhouse, you can use a larger brush.


Paint the exterior walls first, being careful not to let the paint bleed over the lines you’ve sketched for your doors and windows.
Paint the background first, then add the details.
Clean the brush with fresh water when switching between colors.
If you have to apply one color over another — a black doorknob on a red door, for example — let the bottom layer of paint dry completely before applying the second color.
Apply the paint in thin layers, so it doesn’t drip down. Even if you have newspaper under the house, the dripping will leave an uneven texture on the surface of the house.

, Leave the house in the sun, if possible, to speed up the drying process. After an hour or two, lightly brush your finger along the paint surface to see if any comes off on your skin. If not, you’re ready to apply a second layer of paint to cover up the gesso underneath.


Once your second layer of paint has dried, you’re finished.

, For larger houses, try wrapping paper.For smaller houses, try scrapbook paper., Inside, it works as wallpaper and carpet. Outside, it can work as paint.

, Measure the size of the space, and cut the paper down to size.

, Smooth out the paper as you go.

, You can make flowers out of paper and create a yard or window box.

For a simple paper flower, cut out a round circle of paper. It should be about an inch across.Cut out a simple spiral with two edges. Wave the lines as you cut.
Beginning on the outside of the paper, roll up the spiral tightly. Once you've got it curled up, let it unravel slightly to form a flower.
Glue the bottom of the spiral to the circle you made in the beginning.

Photo collages are often created for holiday decorations or gifts. For instance, you may create one to celebrate Mother's Day, Father's Day, an anniversary, bridal shower, baby shower, graduation, birthday, or major holiday like Christmas. Many collages created for such occasions include photographs and decorations that are themed around those occasions.
Photo collages can also be created to showcase pictures from a memorable event, like a vacation or family reunion. In these cases, the photos chosen will be restricted to photos from that event.
You may also end up creating a collage for an art project. This occasion is less restrictive, but you should still factor in any submission guidelines if you plan to enter your work into an art contest.;
, Theme is usually tied into occasion, but if no special occasion governs the creation of your work, you will need to spend more effort coming up with a cohesive theme to tie your work together.


Photo collages are a great way to document and display happy memories with loved ones. You could consider a theme that showcases such memories with relatives or friends.
A photo collage can also be used to document your life or the life of someone else.
From an artist's or photo journalist's perspective, a photo collage can be used to showcase something significant, like a location or event. For instance, an artist may create a college of photos that illustrate the beauty of a natural habitat. On the other hand, a photo journalist may create a college of photos that illustrate the harsh conditions of those living in poverty.

, You could opt for a simple rectangular arrangement, but you could also change the shape or plan on a more artistic arrangement.


For lighthearted collages, the photographs can be arranged in non-standard shapes, like hearts or stars.
For a more artistic approach, you can consider arranging the photographs into a more complex shape, like a face. For added effect, each photo can be tinted slightly so that the colors better match those of the design you plan on attempting.

, The manner in which the photo collage will be displayed should be taken into account when deciding on the size and shape of the collage.


If you plan to display the collage in a personal office or similar space, you should choose an unobtrusive design and keep it fairly small.
For a collage meant to serve as the centerpiece of a special occasion, you should keep the design fairly simple, but the collage itself should be somewhat large and easy to see.
If the collage will be displayed in an official capacity as a piece of artwork or photo journalism, you should consider making it both large and intricately designed.

, The number of photographs can usually be determined by the intended purpose, size, and design of your collage.


A small, personal collage meant to serve as a decoration or gift should usually be somewhat small, consisting of 10 pictures or less.
A larger collage with a simple design can include anywhere from one to two dozen photographs.
A larger collage with a more complex design will usually need many photographs. In general, the more complex the picture or design you intend to create, the more photographs you will need in order to create it.

, This step seems simple and obvious, but it requires you to carefully consider whether each photo you select truly fits your theme or if you are choosing several photos simply because you like them, even though others might fit your theme better.


This process is usually fairly simple with straight-forward themes like vacation photos or photos honoring a loved one.
This process becomes more difficult, however, when dealing with abstract themes like the beauty of nature or the nature of humanity. When dealing with an abstract theme, you need to consider whether or not each individual photo can speak to the theme on its own, and you must also consider whether or not each photo speaks to the theme in a manner that seems compatible with the other photos.

, A good photo collage will use high-quality photographs. Weed out any photographs that seem blurry, as well as any that show red-eye or those with major imperfections in the film.


Note that some imperfections can be corrected digitally. If you have a photo that you really want to include that has a minor imperfection on it, consider correcting it digitally to determine if it can still be salvaged.

, Since most photographs can be enlarged or shrunk to size, this usually presents little problem. You should consider what may happen to the quality of the photo after altering it, though.


A large, detailed photograph may lose some of that detail if you shrink it down too much.
Conversely, a small photograph may become blurry if enlarged too greatly.
Shape and orientation also plays a role in photo selection. Many collages include a mix of vertical and horizontal photos, but you should consider the balance between these orientations when choosing your pictures.

, Choose more photos than you will need. Among the photographs you choose, separate the ones you intend to use from those that can be used if necessary.


As you arrange your photographs, you may notice that a certain photo does not fit the theme or appearance as well as you initially thought it would. This is a good time to rummage through these extra “back-up” photographs for an option that can replace it.

, Place all the photographs on your background before you glue any of them down. If you paste the photos as you arrange them, you may make a mistake and find yourself unable to correct it.


If you are concerned about the pictures sliding around as you work, use a temporary way to fix them in place. A piece of double-sided tape or a single-sided tape folded into a loop words well as long as the tape is standard office tape.

, If the arrangement you chose will permit some of the background to show through, you need to make sure that the background you choose fits your theme.


Plain colors work well for most occasions and themes, but you should make sure that the color works well. You can use holiday or seasonal colors for seasonal collages. Alternatively, if a certain color runs through the majority of your photos, you can choose a coordinating shade of that same color.

, If you determine that a given photo will not work within your collage as you work, select a different photo to include in its place.


Reasons a photo may not work for a collage can include the orientation, size, content, color, or overall appearance.

, You do not need to use your photos as they are. Instead, consider cutting them into shape to make them work with your collage.


Trim and crop portions of your photos that do not belong or do not fit with the theme of your collage. You can also trim and crop photos in order to make them fit onto your collage better.
You can cut your photos into various shapes, too, including ovals, circles, stars, and hearts.

, Stand back and take a good look at your finished collage before you decide to glue everything in place.


Pay close attention to detail. Ask yourself if it satisfies your original vision and theme, and look for any areas that could be improved.
Consider taking a snapshot of your arrangement. Doing so will allow you to see it in a new light and from a new angle. Additionally, it will also allow you to see how everything was arranged in case your work gets disturbed before you can glue everything down.

, Apply a thin coat of glue to the back of each photograph before carefully placing it on the background.


Do not use a huge glob of glue, since doing so may create wrinkles, bubbles, or bulges.
Start with the photos on the bottom of the arrangement before gluing the ones that overlap.
Once the glue dries, carefully check each photo. If any still seem loose, carefully apply more glue beneath them.
Seal the collage if needed. You can use a crafting sealant that dries clear or make a paste from one part clear-drying glue and four parts water. Mix well and apply the sealant over the entire collage using a foam brush.

, You can add themed embellishments to your finished collage to further draw out the theme. Potential embellishments include:


Borders
Stickers
Stamps
Autographs of those in the photographs
Seashells or other small trinkets

,


Basic photo editing software is often sufficient if you only plan on creating simple collages, but it may not provide the right sort of tools needed to create more complex designs.
If you use photo editing software you already have, you save on expense. Some special photo collage software is free, but the highest quality options do cost money and can be fairly expensive.
Creating a photo collage with basic photo editing software can be labor intensive and time consuming.
Special photo collage software often comes with templates and tools that make collage creation easier.

, Every program you might consider using has different tools, so you will need to look up a specific guide for your software in order to learn how to use it effectively.


Begin by searching through the software help files or the software's instruction manual.
If you find nothing within the help files, search the Internet. Tutorials can come in all-text form, pictorial form, or as video tutorials. Browse through a variety until you find one that seems helpful.

,


Knowing how to rotate photos will allow you to turn and flip photos as needed in order to make them fit.
Knowing how to resize photos will permit you to enlarge or shrink a photo as needed.
Knowing how to crop photos will allow you to remove portions of the photo that are unneeded or that upset the balance or appearance of the collage.

, Many programs allow you to undo your changes if you decide later that you do not like them, but just in case, it helps to save your collage each time you feel satisfied with your progress. That way, you can return to an earlier version if you later decide that you do not like the most recent changes you made to your collage.


Saving frequently also helps to prevent you from losing your work.

, The quality of a digital collage can be dramatically affected by the quality of the paper you print it on. Standard printer paper is light and has a poor effect. You should at least consider using cardstock or photo paper.


On the same note, you should also use a high-quality printer to ensure vivid coloring and depth.

Cut a circle out of a stiff board material.,



 Pieces of paper on top, piece from circular box on bottom

Cut two pieces of paper into a circular shape of the same size as the board piece.,
Stick the pictures on the front and the back of the board piece using glue.,





Make two holes as pictured.,





Insert a rubber band in each of the two holes.,





Wind up both rubber bands.",How to Make a Thaumatrope1," The stiffer the material, the better. If using corrugated cardboard, you can use this method, or the method below.




 






One option is to find a circular box such as the one pictured here. Separate the frame from one of the board pieces. You can use a craft knife for this purpose, but this should be done by an adult, not a child.;
, You can do this by tracing the board piece on the paper twice, then cutting along the outlines. Draw a picture on each piece of paper. In this example, there is a cat on one piece and a teardrop and fishbowl on the other piece., Be careful about the placement of the pictures in relation to each other. It must align precisely with where you want the moving image to appear on the front image. For instance, here you can see the goldfish bowl and the teardrop aligned carefully on the back piece so that when it is twisted later on, the teardrop appears underneath the eye and the bowl above the cat's head, as if it is a thought bubble.
To test and make sure that the pictures align correctly, you can attach them with a paper clip and flip the card rapidly a few times to get an idea for how they will match up.

, They should be at opposite sides of the image (on the far right and the far left)., Put one end of the rubber band a little bit through the hole, then pull the rest of the rubber band through the loop that you just pushed through the hole, and pull tight.
Alternatively, you can use string or yarn.

, Hold a rubber band in each hand and have someone flip the card over and over until totally twisted tight. Pull each rubber band apart quickly and the card will start spinning. If you used string or yarn instead, pull them tight, holding the ends with your index finger and thumb, and rub the fingertips together to turn the string (as shown in the video below). Your thaumatrope creation is transformed into a single picture by the twisting action. Repeat as often as wished. Children will be mesmerized.

",How to Make a Thaumatrope2,", Make sure it goes all the way through, as close to the center of the circle as you can get it. If the corrugation holes are small, you may need to use a thinner stirring straw, which can be found at most coffee shops., The wire can be bent from a hanger with pliers., Here it is a face on one side with spectacles and tongue poking out on the other side.,"

Purchase an acid-free book or binding glue.,
Remove the loose pages.,
Apply a thin layer of the glue.,
Set the pages back on the spine.,
Hold the book closed with a rubber band.,
Let the book dry for 24 hours.",How to Repair a Book's Binding1," Most craft or hobby stores carry book or binding glue. It usually comes in a tall, thin tube. Make sure you purchase an acid-free glue: if you use a glue with acid in it, it can cause the pages of your book to disintegrate or eat away at the spine of the book., Set them aside so you don’t get any glue on them. Make sure you set them aside in the right order. You don’t want to accidentally glue them back into your book out of order!, Open the book and squeeze some glue onto the inside of the book’s spine, where the pages have pulled away. Using a popsicle stick, spread the glue so that it covers the spine evenly., Make sure you have them in the right order first! Then carefully line up the top and bottom of each set of pages so they’re even with the pages still attached to the spine of the book. Firmly press the edge of the set of pages to the spine so that the edge evenly attached to the spine.You might need to wiggle the pages a bit to get them to line up exactly with the rest of the book. That’s okay, but work quickly so the pages don’t end up sticking where they’re not supposed to!

, This helps keep all the pages evenly in place while the glue dries. You can also stack other, heavier books on top of the book you’ve repaired., After the 24 hours are up, carefully remove the rubber band (or other books) and gently flip through the pages of the book. They should all feel secure. If they don’t, you may need to repeat the gluing process."

Gather your equipment.,
Stand the book on its tail.,
Dip the needle or rod in adhesive.,
Lay the book flat.,
Place a piece of wax paper between the cover and pages.,
Run your flat piece of plastic along the hinge.,
Press the book overnight.",How to Repair a Book's Binding2," You’ll need book adhesive, knitting needles or plastic rods (for applying the adhesive), wax paper, and a piece of flat plastic. It’s best if your adhesive is in a tall bottle, since this will allow you to cover the needles or plastic rods for application to the spine., Then very gently, use one hand to open the gap between the pages and the hinge as far as possible without causing more damage., Then gently insert the needle or rod into the gap between the pages and spine and twirl it against both the text block and the spine. This should ensure an even coat of adhesive to both parts, which will help it adhere better.If there is a gap all along the entire spine of the book, you’ll need to flip the book over so it’s resting on its top and repeat the process.

, Firmly and evenly press the text block so that it is flat against the spine. Then use your piece of flat plastic to press the endpaper (the blank pages at the beginning of the book) into the hinge. This helps make sure that all of the pages stick to the spine and none of them tear., You should press it back as far into the hinge as it will go. This prevents any adhesive from leaking out onto the cover of the book and will make sure your book opens properly when it’s dry., This is the little indent between the edge of the spine and the cover of the book. Apply even pressure as you run your plastic along this ridge., Set the book on top of a flat board, with a knitting needle slightly thicker than the cover of the book resting on top of the bottom board. Place the book on the bottom board, lining up the knitting needle with the hinge of the book. Repeat this process with a knitting needle resting on the top hinge and another board on top. Set about 10 lbs (4.5 kg) of weight on top of the book and leave it overnight."

Press the spine firmly against one tab.,
Attach the last tab to the cover.,
Secure with rubber bands and let dry overnight.,
Remove the rubber bands and waxed paper.",How to Repair a Book's Binding3," It’s harder to repair a hinge that’s still clinging to the book by threads, so removing it actually makes your life easier. Cut away any threads or loose paper so that the text block is even and clean., You can find this type of tape in most craft stores. Cut the tape so that it’s the same height as the text block. Don’t use the height of the cover for measuring the tape since the text block is usually shorter than the cover and you’ll end up with too much tape., It’s best to use a brush for this application since it lets you apply the adhesive evenly., Hold the tape by the dry tabs and line up the stitching with the edge of the text block. Stick one tab with adhesive to the first page of the text block and the other to the spine of the text block. Use a flat piece of plastic to rub the tape, ensuring that it sticks to the text block., This can take anywhere from a few hours to overnight. You should be able to tell if the adhesive is dry by running your finger over the top – you’ll be able to feel if there’s any wetness under the tape., You should lay it on top of the binder tape that is already glued to the text block and under the binder tape that hasn’t been glued yet., Then gently bring the cover up so the edge of the cover fits along the seam of the binder tape., This should be the tab sitting parallel to the spine, between the spine and the text block. When you pull the cover up, the spine should lay flat against this tab., Smooth it with a flat piece of plastic so that it lays flat against the cover. Close the book and run your flat plastic piece along the spine so that the tab sticks to the spine., The rubber bands will help all of the adhesive dry evenly and make sure that the tabs all lay flat against the spine and text block. Let it all dry overnight so that it doesn’t fall apart when you pick it up., Open your book carefully and flip through the pages so the book can adjust to the repair."

Get some good-quality cardstock.,
Assemble your other crafting materials.,
Cut the basic shape of the card.,
Fold the stock carefully in half.,
Consider forgetting the fold and making a post-card.",How to Make Cards1," cardstock, like the name suggests, is perfect for making your own cards. It's basically thick, high-quality paper that you can buy at any craft store in a variety of vibrant colors and prints. Depending on the kind of card you want to make, it's usually good to get a few different colors and layer them for a cool effect.


For a professional-looking card, it's common to get two different varieties of complementary colors to make each card. After cutting different shapes or sizes of cardstock (one smaller and one larger), you can paste the smaller evenly into the center of the larger to create a unique look. When you fold other, this creates a nice surface on which to write your message. You could even use basic printer paper on the inside to avoid bulking up the card.;
, Depending on what kind of card you're making, you'll likely need:


glue or a glue stick
fine-point pens
scissors
photographs or magazine clippings
a ruler
any other decorations you'd like to include

, Once you've selected the outside color for the cardstock, cut it to size. A standard-sized greeting card is a rectangular shape, about 5 x 7 when folded in half. Because you haven't folded it over yet, use your ruler to measure out a square roughly 10 x 14 and cut very carefully with your scissors. You want the straightest edge possible, so use a paper cutter if you've got access to one.


Also cut a piece or two from a different color of cardstock. Cut these a bit smaller than the card by an inch or two on each side and center it on the outer piece. Glue it securely with your glue stick and let it dry thoroughly before folding it in half.
You can also do the same thing on the other side of the card, give it both a unique inner surface with texture and an outer surface. Experiment with shapes and placements depending on your style, mood, and the season.
You could cut diamonds or other shapes from the interior piece to give it an extra flair. A snowflake would be perfect for a wintertime card, or a heart might be perfect for Valentine's cards.

, Make a sharp and even crease, then weight the card under a heavy book to make sure it stays sharp and as flat as possible. When you're done with that, you're ready to write your message on the interior of the card and decorate it!

, Alternatively, you could forego the complication of the fold and merely cut a piece of cardstock to the proper size and decorate one side, leaving the other side free for a personal message, address, and postage. Couldn't be easier.

Consider adding pressed flowers, shells, or other decorations.,
For a simple touch, collage a few pictures.,
If you can, include original drawings on or in your cards.,
Go for elegant and simple.,
Don't be afraid to make it weird.",How to Make Cards2," The outside of the card is where you'll do the most adornment. Pick a theme based on the season, the occasion, or the person you're making the card for.


Pressed flowers that you lightly glue to the card can make wonderful and eye-popping 3D decorations in the springtime, sprucing up a card with a natural highlight of color. It's a great idea for people with a green thumb.
You could also add shells to summertime cards for a unique touch. This works especially well for gift tags or other types of place cards.

, Saving old school books, kids' books, magazines, and newspapers can be a great source for making cards. If you don't have a big store of them laying around, hit up a local thrift shop for extremely cheap (or even free) piles of cut-up magazines that you can repurpose for your cards.


Nature magazines are a great source of card-material, as well as magazines that feature lots of advertisements. The high contrast colors in magazine ads look great when cut up for cards.
For a real shortcut, you could even consider saving your old cards and cutting shapes from them to reuse in new cards. Repurpose those old Christmas cards you always recycle by cutting out the manger scene or the Christmas tree from the front and putting it front and center on your own card. No one will know the difference, and you'll save money.

, You don't have to be a great artist to be a great card artist. Depending on your audience, a silly stick figure comic or a diagram of your feelings would be a hilarious gift for a holiday or other special occasion. If you can actually draw well, even better. Decorate the card with your own artwork for a personalized touch your friends and family will treasure.

, Adding a few tasteful adornments to your card is generally better than making something too busy or too cluttered with decoration. A simple white card with a pressed flower on it will look thoughtful and elegant, making a great message to give someone.Avoid making your collage too busy. A good combination of two pictures culled from a magazine or book can be poignant, cute, or hilarious. Don't clutter it with fifty pictures of your friend's favorite Baseball player for a birthday card. Maybe go for one good one with a well-timed funny caption for effect. Do more with a little., Quirky holiday cards are usually better received than deadly-serious ones. Little jokes, non-sequiters, or weird pictures of sea creatures should be welcomed and embraced in the card-making tradition.


Your family's never heard of the Hannukah Squid? Time to change your traditions. Cut out an idyllic holiday scene being attacked by floating clouds of squid with Santa hats and HAPPYNESS in all caps on the inside. The less sense, the better.
Making something weird doesn't mean you should send a crude card to your mother-in-law for her favorite holiday, or that you should try to make a funny sympathy card, but you should send something that the receiver will appreciate. Know their sense of humor and make them chuckle.

"
"
Write a simple, brief, and heartfelt message in your card.,
Use quotations if you feel stuck.,
Don't be afraid to get weirder.,
Instead of writing a long card, send a letter.",How to Make Cards3," You don't need to stress over making a card coded or complicated to make it effective. On the inside of the card, write a few sentences for your message, sign it, and send it on its merry way. If you've gone to the trouble to make your own unique card for a gift, you don't need to include a long-winded message. ""Merry Christmas!"" would be perfectly appropriate for a holiday card.



For a birthday card, it's appropriate to use your own sense of humor to offer a birthday greeting: ""Happy Day Old Man"" might be funny for your dad or your brother, but not necessarily for your boss. For casual but sincere messages, here are some possibilities:

Many happy returns. Stay young, buddy.
Happiest of Birthdays! Here's to a whole bunch more.
Analog Text: Happy Birthday.
So proud to know you. Happy Birthday!



For romantic cards, get mushy as quickly as possible without going over the top. Some simple but romantic messages:

You mean so much to me. Love you.
So glad we could spend this day together. Loving you.
I'm crazy about you. Here's to the future.
I'm so glad you like me more than your dog does. Love.



For a sympathy card, it's especially important to go for simple and sincere:

Thinking of you during this difficult time.
Our thoughts are with you.
So sorry for your loss., It's perfectly common and appropriate to use an attributed quotation on a card, especially for religious holidays. If you're feeling stuck on thinking of a message you'd like to include, feel perfectly free to quote something and let someone else speak for you, or to go for the ultimate simple message: ""Merry Christmas"" or ""Happy Birthday"" or ""My sympathy.""


Bible verses are particularly common for Christmas and Easter cards, though might be somewhat preachy for other kinds of cards. Know your audience and send them the appropriate kind of message.

, The message can especially be the time you can let your freak flag fly high and be quite funny, if your friend or loved one would appreciate it. Here are some possibilities:


""Your birthday is not a reason to drink depressed and alone just because you're so old. Like really really old. That's why we're going out tonight.""
""Happy Nondenominational Winter Celebration. ALL PRAISE BE TO THE SOLSTICE SQUID.""
""I drew a mustache on Captain Kirk for your birthday because I know you like having your time wasted. Happy birthday.""

, If you've got a lot to say and want to catch up with someone you haven't talked to in a long time, include a separate letter within your card, and a shorter message in the card. Cards work best without a long letter within them. If you want to write several paragraphs, update your family or friends about your life and adventures, write a letter."

Send cards for the holidays.,
Send cards for the birth of a child.,
Send seasonal cards, just because.,
Send someone a card who might need it.",How to Make Cards4," During the Christmas-New Years-Hannukah winter holidays, it's very common to make personalized cards and get them in the mail to friends and family as a way of keeping in touch. It's typical to include a recent photograph of yourself or your family, especially for extended family you might not often see. The end of the year is a good time to get in touch and let everyone know what you've been doing and that you're thinking about them.


Include a recent picture of your family, along with a brief note out the year's accomplishments and activities. To make it easier on yourself, make several copies of a basic card, but then handwrite a brief message in each and include a longer form note that you send out to everyone.
If you choose to write a year-in-review note, think about the right tone. Avoid the bragging about the litany of destinations on your European tour when you're writing to your working class relatives in Tulsa. Instead, say, ""We were fortunate and lucky to travel some this year."" Likewise, a holiday letter isn't the time to depress all your family members with a list of everything that's gone wrong for you in the year. Stay upbeat. It's the holidays.

, If you've just given birth to a new child, you've likely got your hands full. But if you want to make custom cards, including a nice highlight like a copy of the baby's footprint, or a recent photograph would be a welcome and exciting gift for your friends and loved ones.

, Everyone sends cards during the winter. What about Springtime cards? Dog days of summer cards? Stand out from the pack and send your friends cards just because you're thinking about them, or whenever you come up with a reason to make some up.


Look up obscure holidays like Nunavut Day (July 9) or Submarine Day (March 17) or Beer Can Appreciation Day (Jan 24) and use it as a reason to send out cards and shake things up.

, Think of someone you know, or might not even know well, who's seemed down lately. Sending a card out of the blue can make someone's day more than an expensive gift or another token of affection. Making a card for someone who needs it is always a great idea.

Gather your materials.,
Fold a sheet of paper in half.,
Draw a design on front.,
Write a message on the inside.,
Trim the edges with decorative scissors.",How to Make a Simple Birthday Card at Home1," To draw a birthday card, you'll need unlined paper and drawing tools. You can use crayons, markers, colored pencils, pastels, or any writing implement that you prefer to design your card.


Plain white paper works well for drawing a birthday card, but you can also get creative and use colorful construction paper. Light shades work best, though, because you don’t have to worry about the pencils, crayons, or whatever writing tools you are using showing up on it.
If you enjoy painting, you might want to use watercolor paints to draw your design. Make sure that the paper you’re using is thick or heavy enough for the paint.;
, To form your card, you should fold a piece of paper so it opens like a book. You can fold the paper in half once to create a larger card, or fold it in half twice to make a smaller card.Keep the size your paper in mind because the larger the piece that you start with, the larger your finished card will be. When folded in half once, a standard 8.5”x11” sheet of paper will create an a card that’s similar in size to most greeting cards that you would purchase.
After you fold the card, you can use it vertically or horizontally, depending on the type of drawing that you want to create.

, On the front of the folded paper, use your colored pencils, crayons, markers, or your favorite writing tool to create a design for the card. A birthday-related image, such as a cake, balloons, or a wrapped gift box, is an ideal option, but you can draw whatever you prefer.Instead of drawing a generic birthday image, you might tailor your drawing to the interests of the person who you’re making the card for. For example, you might draw puppies for someone who likes dogs, or a race car for someone who enjoys NASCAR.
You can create additional drawings on the back and inside of the card if you want.
To steady your card while you’re drawing, it helps to use painter’s tape to the paper to the desk, table, or other surface that you’re working on. That will keep it in place and limit mistakes while you’re drawing. The painter’s tape will easily peel off too.

, Once you’ve finished drawing on the card, you can write a message on the inside. You can keep it simple by just writing “Happy Birthday!” and then filling it out with the person’s name and signing it with your own as you would with a card that you bought.You may want to write a joke in your card as is often done in greeting cards that you’d buy at the store. It helps to tie it into whatever you’re drawn on the front of the card, so you may want to plan ahead.

, Once the card is finished, you can give it more flair by using craft scissors with a decorative edge, such as a scalloped or zig-zag pattern, to trim the edges of the paper. You can cut just the edges of the front of the card or trim all of the way around.


You can even find scissors with multiple blades to make cutting a fringe along the edge of the card very easy.

Collect your supplies.,
Fold a sheet of cardstock.,
Use craft supplies to decorate the front.,
Decorate with items from around the house.,
Personalize the inside of the card.",How to Make a Simple Birthday Card at Home2," To create an embellished birthday card, you'll need a material that's heavier than standard paper, so cardstock is the best option. You'll also need crafting supplies, such as sequins, pom poms, and ribbons. Have a glue stick or other type of adhesive ready to attach the embellishments to the card as well.


Scrapbooking supplies are ideal for decorating a birthday card. You can find birthday cakes, balloons, flowers, and other shapes that would fit your card well.
If you're attaching heavier items to your card, you may also need a hot glue gun to ensure that your adhesive is strong enough.

, Just as you would with with a homemade card that you’re drawing, you need to fold a piece of paper in half to create the card. However, when you’re making an embellished card, it’s best to use heavier paper that can support the decorative elements you attach. That’s why cardstock works best.You can use crafting scissors with a decorative edge to trim the sides of the cardstock just as you would with paper, but you can also use a circle cutter from the craft store to make a round birthday card with the cardstock.

, Instead of drawing on your card, create a design using sequins, pom poms, ribbons, and your other favorite crafting supplies. Use a glue stick that’s safe for scrapbooking to attach them so the adhesive doesn’t warp the cardstock.You can also use stickers and rubber stamps create a birthday design on your card. They’re especially easy to work with because they don’t require any adhesive, and typically come in a wide variety of shapes and designs.

, In addition to items that you might find at the craft store, you can decorate your card with items that you might have around the house. Pressed or artificial flowers can make pretty decorations for the card, but you can also use buttons, pieces of wrapping paper, and postcards to embellish it.If you’re attaching heavier items to your card, a glue stick probably isn’t strong enough to adhere it. You may want to use a hot glue gun instead. However, keep in mind that a wet glue can often cause paper and cardstock to warp.
Be creative when you’re looking around your house for items to decorate the card. For example, you might cut a cupcake liner in half, glue it the front of the card, and use pom poms or sequins to fill in the top of the cupcake. Complete it by gluing an actual birthday candle to the top., Once you’ve decorated the card, use a marker to write a message on the inside of the card. For a fun touch, you can also add a few decorative embellishments, such as some sequins, stickers, or stamped images.It’s best to use items that are flat to decorate the inside of the card. If you use a three-dimensional item, such as a pom pom, the card may be difficult to close.

Customize the card with a message.",How to Make a Simple Birthday Card at Home3," To make a birthday card with washi tape, you'll obviously need several rolls of washi tape. Make sure that you have at least two different colors or patterns. You'll also need a piece of cardstock to serve as the card itself, and a craft knife to trim the tape.


You can find washi tape at craft stores and various online sellers.
You may also want to have additional supplies on hand, such as a rubber stamp and ink and markers, for finishing off the card.

, Choose a piece of cardstock in a shade that you like, and fold it in half to create a card. Think about which way you want to create your design, so you can decide whether you want to hold the cardstock vertically or horizontally.Depending on how large you want to make the card, you may want to cut your cardstock to form a smaller card.

, Washi tape is ideal for decorating birthday cards because it comes in a variety of colors and patterns. Choose two or more patterns, and rip off pieces of tape to crisscross them over the cardstock to create a striking design for the card.You may want to practice your design on a scrap piece of cardstock so you can figure out the best way to arrange the tape without ruining your card.
You aren’t limited to crisscrossing the tape. You can also place pieces side by side to create stripes.

, You don’t have to worry about the pieces of tape fitting the card exactly. Once you’re done placing it on the cardstock, use a craft knife to trim off any excess along the edges. You can trim as you go, but it’s usually easier to wait until the end and cut all of the pieces at once.Make sure that you’re cutting on a surface that you won’t damage with the knife. You can use a cutting mat from the craft store or work on a cutting board from the kitchen.

, Once the washi tape is in place, you can personalize the card by using a marker to write Happy Birthday in a free space on the front of the card. Be sure to write a message on the inside of the card as well.If you don’t have neat handwriting, consider using a rubber stamp and ink to add a message to the card. You can find one that says “Happy Birthday” and add it to the front or inside of the card.

Any type will do, but if you plan to use photo paper to print a copy of the the photo, a heavier type, such as construction paper, is a better option that basic printer paper. You'll also need paper to print a copy of the photo, scissors for trimming, and a glue stick for adhering the photo.


You can also add extra embellishments to the card, such as stickers, stamps, and scrapbook supplies.

, Look through your digital photos to find one that is appropriate for the occasion. For example, you might use a baby photo or recent snapshot of the person whose birthday it is. You can use a photo of birthday cake that you might have, or a picture of the addressee’s favorite location, such as the beach.You can use a single photo or multiple photos. For example, you might want to place a baby photo side by side with a recent picture of the person who you’re giving the card to.

, Take the piece of paper that you've chosen for your card, and fold it in half. If you're using multiple photos for the card, it's best to only fold it once. If you're using a single picture, you may want to fold the paper in half twice., Once you’ve settled on the photo(s) that you want to use, print a copy of it from your computer. Use scissors to trim the picture so it will fit on the card once it’s folded.You can use photo paper or printer paper to print the copy of your photo(s) on.
Depending on the look that you’re going for, you may want to apply some type of filter to the photo with photo editing software before printing it. For example, you might create a black and white copy for an artsy look or use a sepia tone to give the photo an old-fashioned feel.
When you trim the photo, you can cut it into any shape that you like. Keep it rectangular, or trim it into a heart or star shape if you prefer.

, When you’ve trimmed the photo to the desired shape and size, use a glue stick to attach it to the front of the card. Make sure to leave some room to write “Happy Birthday” or any other message that you might want on the front of the card when you place it.Make a more eye-catching card by decorating around the photo. You can draw a design around it, or use embellishments, such as stickers, stamps, and scrapbook supplies, to dress up the card.

A wedding theme: the shaking filler would probably be confetti
A winter theme: the shaking filler would probably be glitter snowflakes or similar.;
,, This forms the back of the card, aka the ""card backing"".

, This should be done on quality paper in a contrasting color to the card backing. This paper sheet needs to be smaller than the the frame area (which is smaller again than the card backing), otherwise the frame will cover the words, so set the margin on each side well in, to keep the words and designs obvious and to align with where the frame hole will allow it to show.

, Center it right to the edges where the inside hole of the frame will sit. Use double sided tape or glue to attach.


If it's easier, this step can be done after you've made the frame but before you attach the frame, just to check that everything is lining up properly.

, This frame will be made from cardstock and held out from the card by foam tape. This provides ample room for inserting the filler, and a transparency is placed over the top to prevent loss of the filler. Use a color that complements but contrasts with the backing piece and the writing paper piece.

, Use the card measurements to guide the end size of the frame; bear in mind the need to ensure no words are covered up and that the frame should be smaller than the card backing. At the end, plenty of the outside edge of the card backing should frame the frame.


On the backside of the cardstock being used for the frame, draw a straight line from the top to the bottom and side to side, 1/4 inch/0.635cm in from the edge on each of the sides of the cardstock.

Pull the other elastic band’s loose end towards the bottom of the card until both bands are taut, but not stretched.

,
Secure the second elastic band in the same manner as the first, but staple it to the bottom of the card.

,
""Wind up” the split ring attached to the elastic bands, being careful not to over wind and tear the elastic out from under the staples, and then “trap” the split ring so it lies flat to the card when you close it.

,
Tack down the front of the card to the back, as it has a tendency to try to pop open when the ring is wound up.,
Pass the card to the recipient.","How to Make a Greetings Card ""Rattler"" / Noise Maker",";
,,,,, Use a small amount of paper glue, or Blu-Tack to hold the corners lightly together, so that the card can still be opened.

, Hopefully, he or she will open it, the split ring will be freed and spin around releasing its stored energy, and it will frighten the life out of your intended victim.

Find an old game board.,
Cover the board with paper or a material of some sort.,
Decorate your card.",How to Make a Giant Card Using an Old Game Board," This board should be fairly big and should only fold in half, such as a Monopoly game board. Some boards fold up four times - you can't use these to make your card as it will not stand up properly. You can use an old game board from a game that you have lying around at home that you never play, or go to a thrift store and pick one up.;
, Get colored construction paper or colourful poster board and glue it on to the board until fully covered. If you want to be even more unique, you could use felt or fabric to cover the card; since it's made out of a cardboard game board, it will be structurally sound, so you can cover it with basically anything. If you're making a Christmas card or a birthday card, you could even cover it in wrapping paper.

, You might want to cut a piece of white poster board to glue on the inside of the card so it's easier to write a message on, especially if you've decorated the card with fabric or felt. Other than that, it's really up to you what you want to do when it comes to decorating, although you might consider:


Cutting large letters out of felt, paper, or fabric to glue on the front
Cutting pictures out of felt, paper, or fabric to glue on the front
Writing or drawing on the card
Putting ribbons and/or bows on the card
Using glitter glue or sparkles
Gluing sequins on
Printing out pictures on-line or cutting them out of a magazine to glue on
Painting on the card
Putting stickers on the card

First take a piece of lined paper and write an old fashioned letter written in extremely small cursive.,
Write something like this or something else you want to write:


January 3rd, 1843
Dearest Mother,
Against your wishes, Benjamin and I have married.,
Use a pan that you would make brownies in.,
Take strong tea.,
Let the tea cool almost to room temperature.,
Put a paper clip on each side of the paper to hold it under.,
Take it out and dry.

",How to Make an Ancient Letter1,";
, Give my best hope to Papa and Mary and to the new baby boy. I hope he gets well soon.

Your daughter, Amelia Jane



, Fill it with hot water.

, Fill the pan deep enough to cover the paper.

, Hot water will make the paper curl. That's not a bad thing, because it will infuse the color into the paper better.

, You may have to move the paper clips occasionally to keep them from leaving stray marks. You don't want to go through all the effort of making paper to look old, and end up with paper clip shadows on it. Leave it in overnight.

,"
"
Prepare the letter first.,
Boil a little bit of water a small transparent pot.,
When the water starts to bubble and starts to dry, put in 2 tablespoons of tea.,
Take the water off the stove.,
Hover the letter just slightly over the water.,
Allow to dry on a towel.",How to Make an Ancient Letter2," Write whatever you need on a piece of blank paper. Add an old date.

, The transparency will allow you to see the depth of the color and you can add more tea if wished.

, If it doesn't seem dark enough, add more.

, Pour it into a pan.

, Do not dip it in completely. Instead, use a paintbrush to brush on texture. Dip in the tea tray and paint over the paper.

, When dried, the letter is ready for use.


Touch-ups can be made using the paintbrush.

Frame or mount the map.",How to Draw an Old Explorer Map," A brown paper bag with crinkling is ideal for creating a weathered or parched look for your ancient explorer's map.;
, If you are trying to make the map look tattered and worn, distressed edging would be best, with a few holes, gashes and tears here and there. Perhaps considering burning the edges in the way of the treasure maps. Or, you could cut it nice and straight into a rectangle or square, common map shapes. Consider how the map will end up being mounted as you make the shape too–the framing or board for mounting might determine some of the sizing.

, Work out the key places in the world or area that they visited, as well as some important features of their exploration.

, It is important to try to make the map as they would have know it in their time, most certainly this will not be a modern day map. Look online or visit the library to find old maps. Map shop staff might be able to help you out with older map versions if you're having trouble finding them.

, This line should represent the voyage that the explorers have taken, from start to finish. Along this line, place stars, or some other clear symbol, to highlight points of great interest in the exploration.

, Write down the names of the areas, and add any facts in speech bubbles or similar externally stuck on notes. Use arrows if needed to make it clear. Alternately, you might like to use pictorial representations of what the explorers discovered, such as pictures of fur, coal, gold, local people, pastures, housing etc. Look online for good photos and print off high quality versions. Photoshop anything that needs to be made to fit or to stand out in a certain way etc.

, Add your signature or a mock explorer's signature if wished. If you are using the map for promotional purposes, add any extra details to promote your business, product, hobby, display, etc.

, Once you are satisfied with its contents, frame or mount it as you wish.

Choose a design motif for your project.,
Be guided by the lace pattern.",How to Decoupage a Bowl with Lace1," How would you like the bowl or container to look once it's completed? Are you setting the scene for a classic tea party or are you creating centerpieces for a bridal shower or wedding? Maybe it's meant to fit in with existing rustic or frilly décor, in which case, there may be a pattern theme you'd like to replicate.


A simple design is to wrap the lace around the base or the top of the bowl and leave it at that.
A more complicated design could involve several lines of lace around the bowl.
A very complicated design would involve cutting the lace into an actual shape, such as a flower, a boat or an animal.;
, The type of lace or eyelet fabric you're going to use will help you to communicate your design intent. Do you want something on the frilly side or more of a classic, understated pattern? Color is important too, since lace comes in a variety of shades and hues.

"
"
Measure the bowl.,
Cut the lace or eyelet fabric to the bowl’s specifications.,
Apply Mod Podge to the bowl or other item using the foam brush.,
Wrap the bowl or other item with the fabric.,
Add another thin layer of Mod Podge over the fabric.,
Finished.",How to Decoupage a Bowl with Lace2," The lace or eyelet fabric will need to fit the bowl exactly, so take precise measurements of the diameter or area you're planning to cover.


To make sure that the template will fit properly on the bowl/item, hold it up to compare.

, You may want to measure and re-measure to ensure the perfect fit. Once the lace or eyelet fabric has been cut out, hold it up to the bowl to see how it will look before you decoupage it.

, Cover the surface evenly so the fabric can be applied smoothly.

, Since the Mod Podge is still pliable, you will be able to move the fabric into place to achieve the desired look.

, Allow it to dry. Depending upon the humidity levels, drying time can take up to several hours.

, The lace decoupaged bowl or item will make an excellent display item. These can also be made to give away as gifts or to sell at school fundraisers.

"
Get your materials ready.,
Cut your cut-outs.,
Plan your decoupage project.,
Prepare the surface.,
Protect you work area by covering it with newspaper.








,
Use a glue appropriate for both your surface and your cut-outs.,
Apply the glue.,
Glue the cut-outs, piece-by-piece, to the object.,
Let glue dry.,
Apply varnish or lacquer.,
Sand the sealed decoupage.,
Continue applying varnish or lacquer.,
Finished.








",How to Decoupage," Select an object you want to decorate, and collect materials to decorate it with. You can use just about any materials for decoupage, including cards, tissue paper, wrapping paper, paper shopping bags, magazine clippings, rice paper, thin fabric pieces, or (of course) decoupage paper. You can even Make Paper to use. Generally, however, the softer and more flexible the material, the easier it'll be to work with if you're decoupaging a curved surface.









Don't use any images printed on an ink-jet printer as the color will smear with the top-coat. Instead, make copies on a color copier which uses toner that won't blend.
Try using fabric or wallpaper to cover a large surface area very quickly. You can even use these as a background before adding other decoupage items.
Avoid using anything too thick, as it will stick out from your project and be more likely to be knocked off accidentally. You want to keep your surface as smooth as possible.
Use found goods to decoupage to save money on supplies. Clippings from junk mail, free hand-outs, newspapers, and old books and magazines work perfectly for this.;
, You can use whole pieces of paper, you can tear it, or you can cut your paper to make interesting shapes and designs. Use scissors or a craft knife to cut around out the shapes you desire, holding the scissors so that they are angled slightly to the right. This will create a smoother, beveled edge.









Tearing your paper will help to create smoother edges. To tear your paper smoothly, fold it along the tear-line and create a strong crease with your nail. Do this again in the opposite direction, and then tear the paper.
Don't feel like you must completely cover your surface area with cut-outs. Only prepare as many as you feel you will use for your project.

, Make a sketch of the layout or simply put the cut-outs into place without gluing them and then take a picture so you'll remember the arrangement.









If planning isn't your style, feel free to glue your pieces as you go without deciding ahead of time. Keep tabs on your composition to make sure that you are gluing things in a consistent manner.
Consider the color and texture of the things you are gluing. Mix and match different colors or try color-blocking areas of your project.

, Make sure the object you are decorating is clean and dry, fill in deep gouges, and sand it down to remove bumps and imperfections if necessary. If you want to paint it or refinish it, you should do this before pasting anything onto it.









For some materials, such as wood and metal, you may need to prime the surface with a coat of latex paint to help the cut-outs stick better.
If you wash off the object, make sure it is dry before you start gluing so that everything sticks better.

,, You can generally use plain white glue, but it'll be easier to use if you mix it with water it should be the ratio of 50% glue and 50% water. Make sure your lid is closed and shake, shake, shake.








, Use a paintbrush to brush a thin layer of glue onto your surface and onto the backs of the cut-outs. Make sure you apply the glue evenly and over the edges of the cut-outs.








, Lay a piece of your cut paper onto the area to which you applied the glue. Apply the paper carefully to avoid bending or crumpling it, and smooth it out with a brayer (a small roller) or with a Popsicle stick, rubbing outward from the center. Repeat with each piece.









For a more complex appearance, make several layers of cut-outs. Lay down the first layer and then glue subsequent layers on top, partially overlapping the layers below.

, Make sure the whole piece is thoroughly and completely dried before proceeding. If you are applying several layers, make sure each layer is dry before starting on the next.









If there is a rim or an edge that the decoupage wraps around, you can trim it with a razor for a cleaner look.

, Seal the decoupage with a couple coats of an appropriate sealant, such as specially-formulated decoupage finish (available at art and hobby stores), varnish, or lacquer. Let each coat dry thoroughly before applying the next.








, When the sealant is dry, sand it with 400 grit sandpaper to remove imperfections. Use a damp cloth to remove residue from sanding. Do not sand until you have enough coats of sealant to completely cover the underlying surface and cut-outs.








, The unique appearance of decoupage is created by multiple coats of sealant. The number of coats is up to you. Depending on the sealant you are using, you may need as few as 4 or 5. Some decoupage artists use as many as 30 or 40 coats. Remember to let each coat dry before applying the next, and sand the decoupage after every couple coats for best results.

Clean the chair first.,
Lay down newspaper on the work surface.,
Sand the chair.,
Paint the chair.,
Decide whether you want to use paper or fabric decoupage pieces.,
Find or purchase the relevant decoupage paper or fabric.,
Create a design plan.,
Check that the chair surface is clean.,
Paint the back of the first decoupage piece with the decoupage glue.,
Affix the piece to the chair seat in the appropriate placement for your design.,
Repeat the same process for all remaining pieces of the decoupage design.,
Set aside to dry.,
Finish the whole design by painting a layer of decoupage glue over everything glued on.,
Consider whether or not to add a sealant or topcoat.,
Done.",How to Decoupage a Chair," Wipe down the chair and remove any cobwebs, grime or other debris from the chair. Allow to dry.
, It's easiest to work over the floor but you can work over a bench provided it has plenty of space and you can stand over it with ease. Wherever you work, ensure that there is plenty of room to move and that it is well ventilated., This step requires a bit of effort but it's necessary as the paint won't stick unless the chair is smooth and crusted old paint parts have been smoothed down or taken off. If possible, use an electric sander for easier work. However, even with an electric sander, you'll need sandpaper on a block to get into the corners and harder parts. Brush away the sanded wood dust and clean up the area in readiness for painting.

This step can be skipped if the chair is already very smooth and perhaps fairly new.

, Painting the chair is essential to creating a single color backdrop for the decoupage pieces. Use a paint color that will complement your decoupage design and ensure that it won't overwhelm the decoupage pieces; suitable colors include beige, white, black or pale yellow. Paint at least two to three layers to coat the entire chair evenly and thickly enough. Allow to dry in between each layer, then before proceeding with the rest of the project.

You can spray paint the chair if you know how to do so; this will speed up the painting.
Paint in a well-ventilated space.

, You will need to decide on your theme (some theme ideas are suggested next) first, as this may affect whether or not you can find the designs on fabric or paper.

Theme ideas include Victoriana, the beach, tropical, cats or dogs, stars and moons, clothes, animals, cupcakes or doughnuts, woodland critters, flowers and leaves, a safari, makeup items, butterflies, photos of family, pets or friends, etc.
Do a search on Instagram, Pinterest or other sites with themes of photos and pictures, to give you some ideas.

, Cut out lots of pieces from the paper or fabric and place into piles. The piles should reflect size, type of picture/shape and perhaps colors, depending on what makes it easiest for you to use them when creating the decoupage design.

Suitable paper or fabric would include decoupage paper made specifically for this purpose, magazine pictures, photos, scrapbooking paper, labels off groceries or clothing, printed fabric, craft fabric, quilting fabric (fat quarters might be useful), CD or DVD paper covers, stickers, etc.

, Once you have made the decision on the theme and obtained the paper or fabric pieces, plan how the paper or fabric pieces will be affixed to the chair. To do this, place the pieces on the chair seat and arrange until you like how it looks. When you're happy with the design, take a digital photograph of it and print it out, or do a quick sketch of where each piece is to be placed. Use this photo or sketch to guide placement of the pieces when adding them.

The decoupage can overlap or be separated to allow the viewer to detect each individual piece (the paint color will show through nicely if you leave gaps).
Cut out more design pieces if needed. This isn't the time to be skimping on pieces.
You don't need to confine your efforts to the seat; if the design looks good going up the chair back and down the chair legs, that's fine but just check the design looks good. Use poster tack to keep the pieces in place and stand back to check how it looks as a whole.

, Although you've already sanded it and painted it, the chair should be checked another time before adding the decoupage pieces. Wipe it down with a cloth to remove dust and fluff before beginning., Paint the area where you are going to stick the piece onto the chair with glue as well. Keep the glue layers thin., Press down on each part of the paper or fabric piece to prevent bubbles or wrinkles from forming. If needed, use the cloth or ruler to press across the decoupage piece and smooth it on., Do not rush this process; it takes time to do it well. Be careful to avoid using too much decoupage glue; always keep the layer of glue thin on both the chair and the decoupage piece., Leave it for 12 to 24 hours to be sure it has dried completely. Also follow the drying instructions provided on the decoupage glue.

Fabric pieces may take longer to dry completely.

, Let this dry and do another layer. Repeat at least one time more to ensure a strong layer of sealant over the design. This provides a seal and helps to prevent the decoupage pieces from lifting up when the chair is in use.

Always wait for the decoupage glue to completely dry between each layer.

, This can help the decoupage design to last longer and can be matte, glossy or satin. Follow the manufacturer's instructions if using. It's not essential but if the chair is going to used to sit on often, it is a good idea as an extra barrier against rubbing and scratches. Wait at least 24 to 48 hours after adding, to ensure it is completely dry before using., The decoupage chair is now ready for use. Enjoy your new piece of artwork!"
"
Choose a suitable box before deciding on the design.,
Clean the box before using.",How to Decoupage a Box1," The box can be as large or small as you like, provided you have sufficient decoupage materials to cover it and it will work for its intended purpose. Sources of suitable boxes include:


Hat boxes, papier mâché boxes, dollar store boxes
Grocery or food packaging boxes
Homemade boxes
Craft boxes.;
, Tip it upside down to remove any debris, fluff or dust. Give it a good dusting if it's dusty (you can also use the brush nozzle of a vacuum cleaner). If the box is coated with a shiny layer, you may be able to gently wipe down with a damp cloth as well.


Remove any parts of the box that you don't want to keep, such as flaps.
Smooth and/or tape down any tears or holes.

"
"
Decide how the box will look.",How to Decoupage a Box2," There are various options available here:


Choose a different layer for each part of the box: An outside paper layer, an inside paper layer and a lid layer.
Choose the same layer for the whole box. Or dual layers of all the same inside the lid and box, and a different all the same outside of the lid and box.
Choose a layer of paper for inside the box and decoupage pieces for outside the box.
Paint or fabric line the inside of the box and only decoupage the outside of the box.

"
"
Cut the paper to the sizes required.,
Apply a thin layer of decoupage glue to the box before adding paper.,
Start from the inside of the box first.,
Do the outside of the box next.,
Repeat with the lid.,
Finish with an even brushed-on application of decoupage glue over all of the attached paper.,
Embellish.",How to Decoupage a Box3," If you're using single pieces of paper, cut to the dimensions of the box as required. If using many different pieces of paper, cut these out separately, to be pasted onto the box in the order of your choice.

, If working with large single pieces of paper, it is recommended that you work only 7.5cm/3 inches at a time.

, Attach the paper to the base, then sides of the box. As you stick the paper in place, always run your fingertips across the paper to smooth away air bubbles and wrinkles. Work from the middle to the outer edge on each surface.

, The same application principles apply. However, outside edges should always fold over to the inside, to provide a smoothly seamless and finished look. Press down neatly when overlapping edges, to ensure that the lid will sit in place properly.


If using individual pieces of paper, overlap them neatly and in interesting ways. It can sometimes help to make a plan of where particular images will go, to make sure that they stand out well.

, Attach the paper to the underside of the lid first, then the inside edges. Then cover the outside of the lid.


In some cases, you may prefer the inside edges to neatly cover any overlapping external paper(s). In this case, do the outside edge first, then the inside edge.

, Do this both inside and out of the box. This layer protects the paper and gives a nice glossy finish to the box.

, This isn't necessary, as the paper will already look great. But if wished, you can also top with a bow, flower or other decoration.

, Anything that you like to read is OK as long as it is yours or you have permission to do so. Place them un a stack in most likely to have things you like to least things you like. If you have no magazines or newspapers, can't cut up friends, or libraries don't trust you, then you can take pictures yourself.

, Look through the entire stack of things, folding back edges of a page you think might have something that you like on it.

, Go through all the pages you marked and cut out the pictures you think you might want. Be careful to cut only around the pictures, not on the pictures.

, Decide which ones stay and which ones go. You will only need about 5-10 pictures depending on the size of the paper. Don't eliminate to many or you won't have enough.

, Fold the corners to their original position. Tape all of the corners down to the paper. Don't tape over the picture or it won't fit. Put about an inch of tape down every corner

Cut some cardstock or construction paper into small squares.,
Draw a heart on a sheet of cardstock or construction paper.,
Glue the paper tiles along the outline of the heart.,
Glue the rest of the paper tiles to the inside of the heart.,
Fill in the background, if desired.,
Let the mosaic dry, then erase any pencil lines.,
Coat your work with some sealer, if desired, to make it last longer.",How to Make a Mosaic Heart1," Start by cutting the cardstock into narrow strips first, then cut the strips into squares. ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) squares will be fine for most projects, but young children might find 1-inch (2.54 centimeters) squares easier to work with.


Plan on having at least two different colors: one for the heart and one for the background.
For a more interesting design, consider using various shades of the same color: light pink, medium pink, and dark pink.
Consider using some patterned or textured paper in your design. You can even use pages cut out of a magazine.;
, Sketch the heart lightly in pencil so that you can erase it later. To make the colors of your paper tiles really stand out, choose white or black paper. This will make the ""grout"" part of your mosaic.

, Apply the glue directly to the paper, then press the tiles into the glue. Work in small sections at a time so that the glue does not dry out too fast. Be sure to leave tiny gaps between each tile for a true mosaic look.


You can use a glue stick, or you can paint on a thin layer of liquid glue using a paint brush.
You might find it easier to glue the tiles along just the inside of the outline.

, As before, work in small patches so that the glue does not dry out too fast. You can glue these tiles down randomly, or you can continue following the curve of the outline. Don't be afraid to cut the paper tiles to fit, and remember to leave tiny gaps between each tile.

, If you'd like to add a background, now is the time to do so. You can make your background a solid color, or you can make it different shades of the same color. To avoid detracting from the heart, choose a contrasting color for the background. You can arrange the tiles in neat, little rows, or glue them down randomly.

, Be very careful while erasing the pencil. If you can, try to only erase between the tiles instead of right over them. This way, you won't accidentally bump them off the page.

, You can use a spray-on acrylic sealer, a brush-on varnish, or a glossy decoupage glue, such as Mod Podge. Let the sealer dry before displaying your work.

Roll some air-dry clay into a flat sheet.,
Cut a heart out using a heart-shaped cookie cutter.,
Press some beads or tiles into the clay.You can also use glass gems or even sea shells.,
Wait for the clay to dry completely.,
Paint the piece with gloss or varnish, if desired.",How to Make a Mosaic Heart2," You can do this using a rolling pin or even a glass bottle. The sheet should be about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) thick. Avoid making it too thin, as it may break after it hardens. At the same time, avoid making it too thick, or it will take too long to dry.


You can buy air-dry clay from the craft store. Look for the kind that dries white; it will be gray while it is still wet, however.

, If you don't have a cookie cutter, you can cut it out using a knife. As a last result, you can always form a flat heart using your hands.


This can make a wonderful ornament. Consider poking a hole near the top of the heart with a skewer so that you can thread some ribbon through it later.

, Make sure that the ""tiles"" are flush with the surface of the clay. If they are sticking out too much, they may fall off.


If the clay starts to harden and crack while you are working with it, dip your finger in water and smooth the cracks down.

, As the clay dries, it will lighten in color. Depending on how humid or dry it is in your area, this may take 1 to 2 days., You can even use a glossy decoupage glue, such as Mod Podge.This will make the colors of the tiles more vibrant. It will also help seal them into the clay and prevent them from falling off.


If you poked a hole in your mosaic, you can thread some ribbon through it after the varnish dries, and then hang it up.

Pour about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of cement into the cake pan.,
Tap the sides of the cake pan for 2 to 3 minutes.,
Wait for the cement to harden.,
Remove the stepping stone from the cake pan.,
Peel off the contact paper and wipe away any excess cement with a damp towel or sponge.,
Let the cement finish curing completely, then varnish it, if desired.In most cases, the cement will need to cure after it dries.,
Place your finished piece in the garden.",How to Make a Mosaic Heart3," Trace the cake pan onto a sheet of contact paper, then cut it out. Peel the backing off of the contact paper, then insert it into the pan. Make sure that the sticky side is facing upwards.The sticky side of the contact paper will hold your tiles in place while you pour the cement.

, Press the tiles firmly onto the contact paper so that they don't move. Make sure that you leave small gaps between the tiles and that the backs of the tiles are facing you.You don't have to use just mosaic tiles. You can also use seashells, glass gems, and pieces of broken china for a more interesting look.

, Be careful not to touch or disturb the tiles. The Vaseline will make it easier to remove the finished stepping stone.

, Each cement will be a little different, so be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions closely. Also, make sure that you wear gloves, a dusk mask, and safety goggles to protect yourself from the dust. The cement is ready for pouring when it feels like porridge.Consider saving some unmixed cement for later. If your stepping stone has any gaps or cracks, you can use this excess cement to fill them in.

, For a stronger stepping stone, fill the cake pan with 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of cement first, then insert some chicken wire. Add another 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of cement on top. Smooth the cement down with a trowel.Be sure to cut the chicken wire to a heart shape first using wire cutters.

, This will release any air bubbles that might have been trapped inside the cement. Any trapped air bubbles can weaken the stepping stone., Depending on how dry or humid it is in your area, this can take 2 to 3 days.Do not touch or disturb the stepping stone while the cement is drying. This does not include the curing time.

, Turn the cake pan upside down onto a flat surface; the stepping stone should slide right out. If it doesn't, you make have to wiggle and tap the pan until the stepping stone comes out.

, If there are any gaps in your piece, you can fill them in with extra cement. You will need to mix up more cement for this, then rub it into the gaps using circular motions.When you are done, wipe off any excess cement with a damp cloth or towel.

, Once the cement has cured, you can brush on some clear, glossy varnish. This will help protect your work and make it last longer. It may also help bring out the colors of the tiles.

, Dig a shallow, heart-shaped hole in the soil, then push the stepping stone into it. Pat the soil around the stone, and brush off any excess dirt off the tile work.

Choose a style of collage.,
Choose a suitable backing.,
Hoard the materials for future collages.",How to Make a Candy Wrapper Collage1," By definition, a collage should be made up of several different pieces. Those pieces can be made of all sorts of items, such as paper, yarn, fabric, stamps, magazine cut-outs, plastic, raffia, foil, labels, lids, matchsticks, corks, natural items (bark, leaves, seeds, eggshells, seashells, twigs, etc.), buttons, and so forth. You can either choose one medium such as paper or fabric, or you can make an eclectic mix, such as paper, buttons and foil., While a paper or cardboard backing is the usual choice, the backing can be anything you consider will work well. For example, a backing could be blotting paper, cardstock, fabric such as a piece of hessian (burlap), newspaper, old book covers, wood, smooth bark, plastic, etc. If the surface is usable and items can be stuck to it, you can probably use it for making a collage., As you become more proficient at and enthused about making collages, you'll probably start seeing opportunities in all sorts of materials. Be sure to keep a special collage materials box for collecting the pieces in."

Decide how big you want your wall collage to be.,
Figure out what to put on it.,
Before you can even start you need to have material to put on your wall.,
Sort them into piles.,
It's easier if you have a base point on your wall to put the things around.,
After you have stuck all the bigger things on, start using the smaller images to fill in the small gaps.,
Do not get frustrated if you don't fill the wall immediately.",How to Create a Wall Collage," Do you want it to cover a whole wall or just a segment of the wall? Do you want the things on the wall to be lots of little things or bigger things. If you are planning to cover an entire wall you have to be aware that it will take a while to fill it, and if you are doing a whole wall collage I would recommend filling it with larger things.;
, So with wall collages there is no limit of what you can put on. Whether its sweet wrappers or just photos of you and friends, its your wall collage and so it just has to represent you and your creativity. Some ideas for what you could put on are photos (of you, friends, family, pets, holiday destinations, animals you want to see, celebrities you like etc...), or you could put your own drawings on (perhaps cartoons, portraits of celebrities, Disney characters.. anything you feel like drawing, Quotes which inspire you or maybe even film quotes, song lyrics, concert/cinema/bus/train tickets, album or dvd covers and even wrappers of your favorite food or drinks.

, So begin by going through photos, magazines and newspapers and just look for things that you would not mind having on your wall.

, Its easier to sort your images and quotes into piles before going about sticking them on your wall. You could sort them into your photos, quotes, tickets and magazine and newspaper clippings. This will mean that when you are sticking things on your wall you are less likely to have similar things next to each other as you want your wall to look like a scrapbook not an organized photo album.

, This could be a picture in a photo frame, canvas or a poster. You do not need to do this, you can just begin your wall collage but it does make it a little easier to know where to start. Start by putting bigger things on the wall, it doesn't matter if there are gaps because you can fill them in after or over time.

, It doesn't matter if the images overlap because the whole point of a collage is to look messy.

, Once you have stuck all your things onto the wall, it may not be full. This doesn't mean you have failed; you can just add more things overtime.

Collect the materials needed for making a paper collage.,
Fold, cut or tear the paper into different shapes.,
Develop a theme.,
Consider adding embellishments.,
Figure out what you're going to glue the collage onto.,
Assemble the pieces before you glue them.,
Glue the collage.,
Let the collage dry.",How to Make a Candy Wrapper Collage2," Here are some possible materials:


Use construction paper, copy paper, paper bags, tissue paper, marbled paper, handmade paper, etc. The paper can be either soft or hard, or a mixture of both.
Use cut-outs from magazines or newsprint. Fashion and news magazines can feature several collage-worthy images. Newsprint can add a fun texture to a collage, as well; just be aware that dyes may run sometimes.
Find old scraps of wallpaper. You might have some leftover in a closet, or you can buy small sample swatches from a wallpaper store.
Make use of different foils or tapes. Use the aluminum foil from the kitchen, or color masking or duct tape.
Use photographs. Cutting images from old photographs can lend your collage a retro feel. Just make sure you're not cutting up the only copy you have of a photo that you might need later.;
, You can use scissors or a craft knife to make different shapes. Alternatively, you can make rough tears on the ends of the paper pieces for more texture or a less controlled look.


Cut out a whole picture, an identifiable part, or just enough to evoke texture, color or feeling.
To make a word, cut out letters from different sources and fonts.

, You might have been assigned a theme, or maybe you came up with one as you collected materials. Either way, build your collage around a central idea or image.

, While not essential, embellishments can take the collage up a notch by adding depth, interest and sparkle. Use ribbons, beads, string, feathers or fabric in the paper collage. Find these items around the house, or purchase them at a craft store.

, You can use a a piece of paper, a large piece of cardstock or part of a cardboard box, for instance. Whatever you choose, make sure it's strong enough to handle several more layers of weight and that it will be easy to display.

, Although optional, it's recommended that you try Once you have everything you want to put on your collage, spread it to design the collage before proceeding. Lay it out on a large surface like a table or floor. Build the items in layers, starting with the background and moving forward. This should give you a good idea of what your end product will look like before you commit to any gluing. If you want to remember it exactly, take a picture of your test run. Ideas for collage designs include:


A landscape or a seascape
A fractal
A person's image, such as a pop star or someone who wears highly identifiable clothes or head wear, such as a tiara
Newspaper people - use the time-old tradition to make newspaper people and then design them into the collage
Animals; for example, use small paper pieces or stamps to form a shape of an animal such as a cat, crocodile or bee. Draw the shape on the paper first and fill in the space by gluing the paper pieces inside the lines
A mosaic or an eclectic jumble; the mosaic can follow a shape or it can simply be a pattern or a jumble
The alphabet; cut letters out of the paper and either make the alphabet or words on the collage
Patterns using only a single shape, such as circles, squares, etc.; repeated patterns are also very effective as a collage.

, Starting with the background and working forward, glue the pieces of the collage onto the base. Use regular white glue, a glue stick or rubber cement, and work with precision.


Try to arrange the collage around one central piece that you think is striking or interesting.
Remember that not every piece has to be glued flat. Try crumpling or folding to achieve a different texture.

, Given that the collage might contain several layers of glue, allow it ample time to dry.


For a small collage, an hour or so should be sufficient.
For a larger piece, you might want to let it sit overnight.

Collect the pieces of fabric you're going to use for making the collage.,
Check the textures.,
Select a suitable background.,
Create the design on paper by drawing it into place.,
Cut and arrange the fabric materials following your design.,
Allow to dry.",How to Make a Candy Wrapper Collage3," Look in your own fabric supplies, in your wardrobe for unwanted clothing, in thrift stores and in craft stores for great sources of fabric. Some examples include:


Leftover scraps from sewing projects
Cut-outs of fabric designs that you love
Cut-outs from beloved pieces of clothing that are past their wearing date (great for memory sakes of children's clothing)
Quilt fabrics/fat quarters
Special fabrics like tulle, organdy, silk, satin, etc.
Thread, wool, yarn, string, ribbons, lace, netting, etc.
Sewing embellishments such as buttons, sequins, sew-on patches, etc.

, Fabrics tend to come in a range of textures and thicknesses, meaning that you'll need to incorporate these differences to best effect in the collage.

, There are some suggestions for backgrounds outlined above but always bear in mind that fabric may stick differently from paper, so not all options will be useful. Do a test glue on the background you'd like to use before proceeding, to make sure that the fabric will stay in place. Some ideas for backgrounds include: other fabric, an unwanted wall-hanging, an item of unwanted clothing, paper or cardboard, an object such as an old stuffed toy needing a facelift or a lampshade, etc.


Use clear drying glue that is suitable for both fabric and the backing you're using.

, For design ideas, see the suggestions outlined in the method above for making a paper collage. Once you have a design in mind, match the appropriately textured and colored fabric pieces accordingly., It's fine to stick one piece on top of another, so be bold.


Keep the textures in mind when creating impressions of items, animals or faces. For example, use wool or fluffed up fabric to create a sheep's body or use yarn to create hair around a face.
Wool, thread or yarn can be wound around in spirals to create flowers, a sun or moon, faces, etc.
Buttons and sequins are great for all sorts of image creation, such as making flowers, eyes on a face or animal shapes.

, Place on display.

Assemble the materials needed.,
Draw the design you'd like onto paper.,
Follow the lines or insides of the drawn lines with glue, using the glue brush.,
Sprinkle the sand over the glue.,
When done, tip the excess sand off.",How to Make a Candy Wrapper Collage4," These are simply - a paper or cardstock background base, clear-drying craft glue, sand, a pencil and a glue brush.

, Simpler designs are best for small children; let them draw whatever they like., If the design is intricate or large, do this in small steps, to allow you to work with the glue while it's still wet.

, This can be done using your hand or a small paper cup.

, The remaining sand will outline the design.

Find suitable items out in nature.,
Make sure that the items are dry before using them.,
Choose a suitable background.,
Design the collage.,
Glue the items in place.,
Allow to dry.",How to Make a Candy Wrapper Collage5," This collage is a good one after you've been hiking or walking in natural areas and you've collected things you found along the way. Suitable items include:


Seashells, broken and whole; carapaces of insects
Flowers (these can be pressed and then used)
Dried grasses
Leaves
Seeds and nuts,
coconut shell '
straw,
and others,etc...

, If not, they may rot or go mildewy on the collage.

, Paper, smooth bark, cardstock, recycled cardboard, etc. are all good choices for the background.

, Perhaps you'd like to make a nature scene, such as arranging dried flowers as they'd appear in nature, or a clump of dried grasses. Or, maybe make a landscape or seascape using the items.

, Use clear-drying craft glue. Double check that the items are actually sticking to the background.


If you want to preserve plant material used in a collage, make a ""glaze"". Dilute PVA glue with a little water. Brush this over the whole of the paper; this glazes the paper. Arrange the plant material on the glazed paper. Brush over all of the plant material with the same glaze. You must cover every possible bit of the plant material. Once fully dried, the glaze will protect the plant material for years and the effect will leave the collage shiny. Note that this can damage more delicate plant material, so be careful.

, Place the collage on display or take photos of it and share online.

Choose an easy-to-use photo program.,
Develop a theme.,
Assemble suitable materials.,
Alter the images as required.,
Build layers.,
Save often!,
Print out the collage.",How to Make a Candy Wrapper Collage6," You can edit photos in several different forms of software depending on your computer and your budget. Choose a basic photo editor unless you're already skilled in a more advanced version; you can improve your skills as you make more collages this way.

, You might have been assigned a theme, or maybe you came up with one as you collected materials. Either way, build the electronic collage around a central idea, image or pattern. Having a theme will help you to find photos and images more easily., Search the internet for images or fonts that you think will be ideal for the collage. Or, you could scan in old photos, fabric swatches, magazine clippings or other items you would use on a paper collage. Use images that inspire you.


Visit Pinterest for inspiration; simply look for photos following themes that you like, such as cupcakes, horses, racing cars, beautiful people, whatever!

, Shape and color the images into interesting shapes or forms using the photo program's cropping and shading tools. Don't be a slave to the contour of the image exactly––go with what works best for your design.


Additionally, you can play with transparency, clarity, tone and any other quality the photo program allows for.

, Start building your collage in layers. Begin at the bottom, with the digital background, and work up.

, Click the Save button often, in case the computer program crashes. You don't want to lose all your hard work.

, This step is optional, if you'd like to display the image on a wall, etc. Choose a type of paper on which to print the collage. You could choose a shiny, high-gloss paper or a more matte, flat option. Whatever it is, it should match your overall theme and be suitable for the end use.

Consider how you'd like to display the final collage.",How to Make a Candy Wrapper Collage7," There are several choices, such as:


Simply hang on the wall as it is
Frame it either using cardstock or a wooden frame, then hang or lean on a shelf
Take a photo and share it online (if it's not already digital)
Share online if digital; use photo and craft sites, as well as social media sites to let people know about your craft efforts
Consider ways of including the collage into other art or craft projects, such as varnishing it into a wardrobe panel, decoupaging it onto a wooden box or sewing a fabric one onto clothing.

Gather your supplies.,
Take out a blank card, or fold a piece of paper in half.,
Add decorations to your card.You can have a lot of fun here.,
Consider the text you want to include.,
Try decorating your card with letter patterns.,
Use a distressed look.,
Include personalized text.The best part about a card is that it includes personalized writing.,
Find an envelope.",How to Make a Greeting Card1," It’s always helpful to have all your supplies laid out in front of your before you begin your project. This way you can stay focused without the interruptions that would otherwise occur as you had to search for new materials.


Depending on what kind of greeting card you plan to make, you’ll need glue, scissors or a paper cutter, paper or blank cards, envelopes, small decorations to put on the card, and a pen or pencil.
Buy some materials at the store to start off with when making cards. You can also recycle things around the house. Items such as buttons, ribbon, and old belts, all look great when properly attached to cards.;
, If you decide to use a piece of paper you have plenty of options. You can cut the paper down to a smaller size using a paper cutter, or even cut it into different shapes. Consider using construction paper if you want a tougher material or something more colorful.If you plan on cutting your paper with a paper cutter, use a ruler to define the lines before you start cutting. This will make it easier to keep everything straight and even.

, You can draw something running throughout the card, like a sea monster or a landscape. You could draw a scene in the daytime on one side, and another scene in the nighttime on the other side. If you know the person you’re giving the card to, try to make something that would appeal to them. If you’re just trying to make a general card, try to decorate the card in such a way that would match the theme of the greeting.


For example, if you’re making a birthday card maybe you should include cakes and balloons.
Another option for decorating is to use scrap book materialsor other craft items. You can cut out pictures from magazines and glue these into your greeting card.

, Most greeting cards have generalized text before you get into the personal greeting. You can skip this part if you want, but if you’re trying to emulate a greeting card that you would find at a store, you might want to include some sort of greeting. Write something that matches the occasion. For example, you could write “Congratulations on your wedding and your many happy years ahead” for a newly married couple.

, Take letters from newspapers or magazines of varying sizes and fonts and paste them around your card in a mix-matched manner.You could even choose to take your greeting from a line of text in a newspaper story.

, Buy some patterned paper and cut a piece about the size of your card. Now tear it in half diagonally so that you can see the tear running across the paper. Paste this torn piece of patterned paper on top of your greeting card to give it a unique distressed or vintage look., Generally this text wishes the person well and includes more detail. If you’re making a greeting card to give to someone else so that they can write in it and give it as a gift, skip this step. Consider putting your signature on the back of the card so that the person it is being given to knows who made it.

, Place the card in an envelope that fits the size of the card. If you’re planning on giving the card away or writing in it immediately, you’ll need the envelope eventually.

Cut a 4x5"" rectangle out of thick double sided paper or cardstock.,
Make an opening.,
Smooth the fold lines.,
Fold the pieces of the ‘X’ cut back.,
Add decorations as you see fit.,
Add your greeting.",How to Make a Greeting Card2," You can get double sided paper at any craft store. Don’t use regular paper, it won’t be strong enough to make this kind of greeting card.

, You can make an opening in your paper rectangle by folding the paper in half lengthwise. Now make another fold two inches from the top. Once you’ve done that, you need to draw a one-inch line from the corner of this fold at a 45 degree angle inward. Cut along that inch line.When you unfold the paper, you should be left with an ‘X’ cut in your original paper. The cut that you make will be going through multiple layers because of your folds to form this ‘X’.

, You should also erase the pencil mark at this time. You want to smooth the fold lines so that the card doesn’t look bunched up and unprofessional.

, Place the paper on its front side and take each triangle of the ‘X’ cut and fold it back toward you. There should be four triangle folds that leave you with a square window once you fold them back.Once you have folded the flaps back, glue them down.

, You can now design an image to put inside the window, put a stamp in there, or anything else. Draw patterns or other elements on the face of the card for added personality.

, If you want it to be a greeting card, you need to write something on the card that indicates what the event is. Make the theme of the card appropriate for this event. Birthdays, anniversaries, and marriages are all appropriate events for a greeting card.

Find a die cutting machine and other materials.,
Cut your border shapes.,
Glue your shapes to each other.,
Cut the front of your card.,
Place clear acetate over the window.,
Place your border shapes on the card.,
Fill in the shaker window and add text.",How to Make a Greeting Card3," Shaker cards are slightly more difficult to make than other cards because you’ll have to invest in a die cutting machine.You could also try to cut the shapes out manually but it is much more difficult to make them all exactly the same shape and size.


Other materials include card stock, a paper cutter, a glue pen, craft glue, acetate, and filler material such as beads and sequins. All of these items can be purchased at a craft store.

, Your shapes should have an empty space on the inside. For example, if you draw a circle, make the center hollow. Use your die cutting machine to cut the border shapes from the cardstock. Make sure they are all exactly the same size – you’ll be placing some of the shapes on top of each other., For example, if you made circles you should put glue on the backside of one circle and then glue another circle to it. Continue to glue pairs of circles together until you have paired all your shapes.

, The front of your card can be as large or small as you’d like, but a standard size is 3.75” width x 5” height.Remember to cut a hole in the card that fits your border shapes – the window should have the same diameter as your border shapes. Place glue around the edges of this window.

, The glue will hold down the clear acetate but you should make sure you cut it in the same shape as your border shapes too. The border shapes will sit on top of the acetate while your beads and other accessories will be glued directly on top of it.

, Use the craft glue to glue your border shapes over the acetate. They should cover up the edges of the clear acetate but leave the middle of the shape see through., The window is the opening in your border shapes. Use your craft glue to add your beads and sequins to the acetate as you see fit. It will look like they are floating in thin air. Once you’ve finished the design aspect of the card you can begin to write a greeting.

Choose your software.,
Develop a vision for your card.,
Choose your layout.,
Include graphics.,
Modify your images.,
Set up your text.,
Print your card.",How to Make a Greeting Card4," This all depends on your skill level. There are some online card making sites available that you can use, but most of them are of lower quality than downloadable software.


If you already have some design skills, consider using a program like PageMaker or InDesign. If you’re new to making greeting cards, you can use user friendly program like Art Explosion Greeting Card Factory or Hallmark Card Studio.

, Do you want it to be large, small, serious, funny, neutral, colorful, or any other combination of characterizations? If you’re making your own card then you probably already have an idea in mind. If not, you can always start by using a template available in the software. These templates offer pre-made styles that may inspire you in the rest of your design.


When in doubt, try to make a card that matches your greeting or event. Anniversaries are different than birthdays, which are different than funerals. Try to thin of a way to express each of these holidays in card form.

, You can choose a template or designate your layout based on the size you want your card to be. You can choose from different shapes and sizes. Once you choose your layout you will only be able to design on the space that you chose.

, The great thing about designing a greeting card on a computer is that you can include all sorts of graphics. These graphics can be as simple as clip art, or you can use a photo of you and the individual you are giving it to, or any other photo that you have on your computer.


You can even use photos from the internet as long as you don’t plan to sell your greeting card. There are a huge variety of options available to you

, Change the color and size of the image to fit into the scheme and layout of your greeting card. Don’t make your card too busy. Try to maintain a consistent look.

, Decide on the type of text that you want to include in the greeting card and choose a font that matches the theme of your design. Don’t use bubble font for a funeral. Try to make sure your text is complimentary with the graphics that you have included and the theme of your card. This means you have to consider both the style and the content of your text.

, Once you have proof read your card, all you need to do is print your card out. It will print out onto whatever piece of paper you insert into the printer in the format that you desired. Now all you need to do is fold the piece of paper and you have your greeting card.

Write Get Well Soon at the bottom of the card.,
Write a message inside the card.",How to Make a Get Well Soon Card1," This card features a print of your hand holding a bouquet of flowers cut out of paper. It's the perfect card for anyone who will be cheered up by the sight of pretty flowers. To make this card, you'll need the following:


A piece of construction paper in any color, to use as the base of the card.
Construction paper in at least two colors you can use to create the flowers.
Paint in a color that contrasts the with the color of your base paper. This will be used to make a print of your hand, so choose a color that matches your skin if you want.
A tray or dish to hold the paint.
Markers in any colors you like.
A pair of scissors.
A glue stick or white school glue.;
, This is the base of your card, so choose your favorite color, or the favorite color of the person you're making the card for! Line up the short edges of the construction paper and crease the fold with your finger.

, You only need enough to make one hand print, so just pour in a few tablespoons of paint. Swirl it around so it coats the bottom of the tray evenly.

, Try to get an even coating of paint on your entire hand (except the back).

, Spread your fingers slightly and tilt your hand so that your fingers point off the to side of the card. The space between your thumb and forefinger should make a ""v"" shape. Place the heel of your hand a few inches from the bottom of the card and press your hand on the card to make your print. Carefully lift away your hand to avoid smearing the paint.


The print you leave behind will look like a hand positioned to hold a bouquet of flowers.
If you don't like with the way it looks on the first try, try again on a second card.
When you're done, wash your hand.

, Set the card aside to dry while you create pretty flowers for your bouquet. You can make any type of flowers you like for your bouquet! Cut out five to ten flowers to make a full bouquet. Here are a few ideas:Make daisies by cutting out yellow circles for the centers and white half-circles for the petals.
Make violets by cutting out small purple petals and blue centers.

, After the handprint is completely dry, use either a glue stick or school glue to attach your flowers near the top of your card, so that the bouquet takes up the top half. Leave a few inches between the flowers and the hand print.

, Use a marker in any color (green is a great choice) to draw a stem from each flower down to the hand print, stopping when you reach the top edge of the hand. Try to make it look as though the hand is holding the bunch of stems. Draw the tips of the stems in a bunch jutting out from the bottom of the hand.

, Use pretty handwriting to write these words across the bottom of the card, under the bouquet. You can write the words in all caps, use cursive, or simply write the words neatly in your regular handwriting.

, A signed message is the cherry on top, so don't forget to write it. A simple note will go a long way! Start by writing the person's name, then write a sentence or two saying you hope the person feels better soon. Sign your name at the end, and you're finished.

, Starting with the background and working forward, glue the pieces of the collage onto the base. Use regular white glue, a glue stick or rubber cement, and work with precision.


Try to arrange the collage around one central piece that you think is striking or interesting.
Remember that not every piece has to be glued flat. Try crumpling or folding to achieve a different texture.

, Given that the collage might contain several layers of glue, allow it ample time to dry.


For a small collage, an hour or so should be sufficient.
For a larger piece, you might want to let it sit overnight or use a very low air blowing fan.

Three plain band-aids.A permanent marker.
Three pair of googly-eyes (optional).
Construction paper in your favorite color.
Clear tape.

, This is the base of your card, so choose your favorite color, or the favorite color of the person you're making the card for. Line up the short edges of the construction paper and crease the fold with your finger.

, Turn ordinary band-aids into a cute little decorations that will cheer up your friend. In the center of each band-aid, draw a funny face using your permanent marker. You can make a happy smiley face or a sick frowny face, depending on what you want. Try to make each one different.


If you have googly eyes, use them as part of the faces. If not, just draw the eyes with your permanent marker.Regular markers will smudge, so make sure to use a permanent marker.

, Space them out evenly on the front of the card. You'll have a top, middle and bottom band-aid, with an inch or two of space in between them. Use two pieces of clear tape to tape down the ends of the band-aids.


Keep the paper backing on the band-aids so your friend can remove the tape and use them.
If you don't want the tape to show, make tiny tape loops, sticky-side out. Stick them to the undersides of the band-aids, then affix them to the card.

, Write the word ""Get"" under the first band-aid, ""Well"" under the second band-aid, and ""Soon"" under the third band-aid. Use all capital letters or cursive handwriting if you want.

Collect the pieces of fabric you're going to use for making the collage.,
Check the textures.,
Select a suitable background.,
Create the design on paper by drawing it into place.,
Cut and arrange the fabric materials following your design.,
Allow to dry.",How to Make a Collage3," Look in your own fabric supplies, in your wardrobe for unwanted clothing, in thrift stores and in craft stores for great sources of fabric. Some examples include:


Leftover scraps from sewing projects
Cut-outs of fabric designs that you love
Cut-outs from beloved pieces of clothing that are past their wearing date (great for memory sakes of children's clothing)
Quilt fabrics/fat quarters
Special fabrics like tulle, organdy, silk, satin, etc.
Thread, wool, yarn, string, ribbons, lace, netting, etc.
Sewing embellishments such as buttons, sequins, sew-on patches, etc.

, Fabrics tend to come in a range of textures and thicknesses, meaning that you'll need to incorporate these differences to best effect in the collage.

, There are some suggestions for backgrounds outlined above but always bear in mind that fabric may stick differently from paper, so not all options will be useful. Do a test glue on the background you'd like to use before proceeding, to make sure that the fabric will stay in place. Some ideas for backgrounds include: other fabric, an unwanted wall-hanging, an item of unwanted clothing, paper or cardboard, an object such as an old stuffed toy needing a facelift or a lampshade, etc.


Use clear drying glue that is suitable for both fabric and the backing you're using.

, For design ideas, see the suggestions outlined in the method above for making a paper collage. Once you have a design in mind, match the appropriately textured and colored fabric pieces accordingly., It's fine to stick one piece on top of another, so be bold.


Keep the textures in mind when creating impressions of items, animals or faces. For example, use wool or fluffed up fabric to create a sheep's body or use yarn to create hair around a face.
Wool, thread or yarn can be wound around in spirals to create flowers, a sun or moon, faces, etc.
Buttons and sequins are great for all sorts of image creation, such as making flowers, eyes on a face or animal shapes.

, Place on display.

"

Assemble the materials needed.,
Draw the design you'd like onto paper.,
Follow the lines or insides of the drawn lines with glue, using the glue brush.,
Sprinkle the sand over the glue.,
When done, tip the excess sand off.",How to Make a Collage4," These are simply - a paper or cardstock background base, clear-drying craft glue, sand, a pencil and a glue brush.

, Simpler designs are best for small children; let them draw whatever they like., If the design is intricate or large, do this in small steps, to allow you to work with the glue while it's still wet.

, This can be done using your hand or a small paper cup.

, The remaining sand will outline the design.

Find suitable items out in nature.,
Make sure that the items are dry before using them.,
Choose a suitable background.,
Design the collage.,
Glue the items in place.,
Allow to dry.",How to Make a Collage5," This collage is a good one after you've been hiking or walking in natural areas and you've collected things you found along the way. Suitable items include:


Seashells, broken and whole; carapaces of insects
Flowers (these can be pressed and then used)
Dried grasses
Leaves
Seeds and nuts,
coconut shell '
straw,
and others,etc...

, If not, they may rot or go mildewy on the collage.

, Paper, smooth bark, cardstock, recycled cardboard, etc. are all good choices for the background.

, Perhaps you'd like to make a nature scene, such as arranging dried flowers as they'd appear in nature, or a clump of dried grasses. Or, maybe make a landscape or seascape using the items.

, Use clear-drying craft glue. Double check that the items are actually sticking to the background.


If you want to preserve plant material used in a collage, make a ""glaze"". Dilute PVA glue with a little water. Brush this over the whole of the paper; this glazes the paper. Arrange the plant material on the glazed paper. Brush over all of the plant material with the same glaze. You must cover every possible bit of the plant material. Once fully dried, the glaze will protect the plant material for years and the effect will leave the collage shiny. Note that this can damage more delicate plant material, so be careful.

, Place the collage on display or take photos of it and share online.

Choose an easy-to-use photo program.,
Develop a theme.,
Assemble suitable materials.,
Alter the images as required.,

Print out the collage.",How to Make a Collage6," You can edit photos in several different forms of software depending on your computer and your budget. Choose a basic photo editor unless you're already skilled in a more advanced version; you can improve your skills as you make more collages this way.

, You might have been assigned a theme, or maybe you came up with one as you collected materials. Either way, build the electronic collage around a central idea, image or pattern. Having a theme will help you to find photos and images more easily., Search the internet for images or fonts that you think will be ideal for the collage. Or, you could scan in old photos, fabric swatches, magazine clippings or other items you would use on a paper collage. Use images that inspire you.


Visit Pinterest for inspiration; simply look for photos following themes that you like, such as cupcakes, horses, racing cars, beautiful people, whatever!

, Shape and color the images into interesting shapes or forms using the photo program's cropping and shading tools. Don't be a slave to the contour of the image exactly––go with what works best for your design.


Additionally, you can play with transparency, clarity, tone and any other quality the photo program allows for.

, Start building your collage in layers. Begin at the bottom, with the digital background, and work up.

, Click the Save button often, in case the computer program crashes. You don't want to lose all your hard work.

, This step is optional, if you'd like to display the image on a wall, etc. Choose a type of paper on which to print the collage. You could choose a shiny, high-gloss paper or a more matte, flat option. Whatever it is, it should match your overall theme and be suitable for the end use.

Consider how you'd like to display the final collage.",How to Make a Collage7," There are several choices, such as:


Simply hang on the wall as it is
Frame it either using cardstock or a wooden frame, then hang or lean on a shelf
Take a photo and share it online (if it's not already digital)
Share online if digital; use photo and craft sites, as well as social media sites to let people know about your craft efforts
Consider ways of including the collage into other art or craft projects, such as varnishing it into a wardrobe panel, decoupaging it onto a wooden box or sewing a fabric one onto clothing.

",How to Create a Collage in the Style of Art Deco,"  Divide the page into equal quarters. Along the top edge, make a mark at 4 1/2 inches and draw a light pencil line from top to bottom.  Measure down 5 1/2"" and draw a light pencil line from side to side. These lines are to keep your strips straight and on track.;
,  Be sure to cut an equal number of strips of any of the colors you have chosen.  Begin work by placing a colored strip along the left edge of the paper.  Add a second and third contrasting colored strip next to it.  Use a glue stick to secure these strips to the base.  You will be working vertically.

,  Continue gluing colored strips, first on the left side and repeating on the right side until they meet in the middle.  Your entire base will be covered with colored strips in a precise mirror image pattern., Place short strips horizontally.  Keep the center line in mind as you work the left side of your design first.   Layer thinner strips over the existing strips.  Add triangles and circles.  Cut some metallic tag board strips and geometric shapes and add them.  Remember to stop at the center line.  Replicate what you have done, working in from the left side to the center., Cut out this rectangle by poking into the center with scissors and carefully cutting it out, or use a utility knife and ruler.,"

When determining a card size, bear in mind the envelope size as well, to ensure it will fit. Of course, you can always make your own envelope, if needed.;
, Print it off onto photo or standard paper. It will be glued onto the card, so the finish is up to you.

, Search online for photos and print them out. It's best if they can be slotted in with your friend's images, to make it appear as if they're interacting in some way., Glue the picture(s) onto either a homemade or store bought card.

Deliver the card!",How to Make a Beautiful Handmade Card in Ten Minutes," The color you choose will be featured prominently in your finished product, so keep that in mind when choosing your base card.


Craft stores sell blank, plain cards for this purpose.These are already folded and creased, making them easiest and fastest to use. The blank cards come in boundless varieties. If you really love making handmade cards, definitely pick up a pack of blank cards (or cardstock) next time you’re at the craft store. That way it’s on hand and ready for you at a moment’s notice!
You can use any kind of paper you want, but the best choice is a durable paper that has some weight to it.
The most popular choice is cardstock, which is a nice heavy paper made specifically for card making. All craft stores carry cardstock and the variety is usually vast.
Your base card choice can be as simple as plain white paper! Paper that is any color of the rainbow and patterned paper are both great options as well.
If applicable, consider upcycling your child's artwork for the base card, or even your own artwork! This is an even better idea if you need to make the card at the last minute and don't have a lot of craft supplies on hand at the time.;
, If you’re using a full piece of paper rather than a pre-folded card, you’ll need to go ahead and fold the paper so that it will be in card form. The best looking cards have a nice, crisp crease. This is something you can do very easily with items you already have at home.


With your paper horizontal in front of you, take a ruler and measure the horizontal center of the card in two places – near the top and near the bottom.
Mark the center lightly with a pencil dot in both places, and then use the ruler to connect those dots with a straight line, from the bottom to the top of the page. Use the pencil with a very light touch.

, If you are crafty and already have a bone folder, this is the tool you will use to score the card. However, you can use a dull butter knife and get the same results. Scoring the card will ensure a nice, crisp fold.Line your ruler up next to the center line you’ve just drawn and take the butter knife to score the card along that line. Scoring means to push firmly into the paper so that a visible indention occurs. Be sure not to push too hard!
Once scored along the drawn line, lightly erase your pencil marks.

, Do this by carefully folding the paper along the scored line. Once folded, use the bone folder or some other flat tool to flatten the fold very crisply.


Using the spine of a book would be a simple solution if you don’t have a bone folder.
You should now have a crisply folded piece of paper that looks almost exactly like a store bought card!

, A calligraphy pen or nice writing utensil are the best choices. However, any tool you have that will look official and special when written with will do.


Calligraphy pens work best for this, but in a pinch you could use a Sharpie or even a regular marker.

, You need less than a yard of ribbon for this. Any ribbon will do, but if you are working with a particular color palette in mind, choose according to that.

, These are widely available on any school supply aisle in almost every grocery store. Craft stores also carry them.


You could also use double sided tape, but a glue stick is much more preferable.

, If there are any additional embellishments you want to use, pick those out now.Some fun choices are glitter, stamps, cut out paper shapes, stickers, stick-on rhinestones, additional ribbon and fake flowers. Get creative!

, Children love this card making project and since you're trying to complete the card in 10 minutes or less, a helping hand can be very useful. Ask your child to gather some embellishments and collaborate with you!

, Once you know, lightly pencil the words onto the card so that you can trace the lines with your pen.


You can write on the inside only, or on the inside and outside front cover, it’s entirely up to you.
Relax so that your hands won’t shake while lettering the card. Imagine you are writing a simple note to yourself (except make sure it’s legible!) if you feel yourself starting to get nervous.

, Do this slowly and carefully, taking care not to smear the ink.


If you’re lettering on both the front and inside of the card, you’ll want to letter the front first and allow it to dry completely before moving on to the inside lettering.

, You’ll want to make sure the ink has dried completely before moving on. Blow lightly on the ink to help it along. Most inks take 60 seconds or less to dry.

, Experiment with horizontal and vertical placements, as well as using multiple pieces of ribbon. Be as creative as you like!


Make sure your final ribbon placement won't conceal any of your writing before gluing it down.
Cut your ribbon (if necessary) to fit the dimensions of your card before gluing it down.

, Once you decide on the position and placement of your ribbon, you’re ready to affix it permanently. Lightly spread glue on the underside of the ribbon and press it down into place firmly.

, This should only take about 60 seconds or so. You can check by lightly nudging an element, such as the ribbon, to see if it moves at all. Be careful doing this, however!

, This is optional, but if you do have other elements ready that you want to add, such as cut out paper shapes, stickers or fake flowers, this is the time to add them. It's best to add them last, so that you can truly size up what your card looks like and choose the best embellishment possible!


Decide on placement and glue them down carefully. Allow these elements to dry completely, as well.

, This is also optional, but it can be a nice touch. Many craft stores will sell envelopes in a variety of colors and sizes for this purpose. These are generally located right next to the cardstock items in the store.


Carefully slip the card into the envelope and seal it as you normally would. Write the recipient’s name on the front of the envelope, if desired.

, Your card is now complete and ready to be given to the recipient. Handmade cards are always lovely to receive, and much more personal than a store bought card. It will be a hit!

Use construction paper.,
Consider basic sketching paper.,
Try scrapbook paper.,
Experiment with cardstock.",How to Find Materials for Making Greeting Cards1," Construction paper is a great option for creating your card base; packs of construction paper include multiple color options and the paper itself is thicker than normal computer paper.For a larger card, fold your construction paper in half, one time.
For a smaller but sturdier card, fold your construction paper in half, then fold it in half again.
Check your house – many people have construction paper hidden amongst their art supplies.
If not, construction paper can be purchased at craft stores and drug stores.;
, Sketching paper is ideal for card making because it is fairly sturdy and also absorbs color well, making it easy to decorate by drawing with colored pencils, markers, crayons or by using paint.If you have a drawing on sketch paper that you love, you can scan this drawing into your computer, then print it out on heavier paper, like cardstock.
Sketching paper can be purchased at craft stores and at big-box retailers like Wal*Mart.

, Scrapbook paper is great for card making because it is usually sold in books and each book contains many different sheets, each with different patterns and designs.Scrapbook paper is thinner than some of the other paper options, so you’ll want to fold your paper in half two times to construct a sturdier card.
You can also cut shapes out of scrapbook paper and use them to decorate the card you’re constructing.
Scrapbook paper can be purchased at specialty arts and crafts stores.

, Cardstock is one of the most preferred options for creating greeting cards because it’s heavy enough that it can stand on its own without toppling over. The thicker and smoother the cardstock, the more high quality your finished card will look.Score your cardstock by running a blunt piece of metal down the center of your card; this will make folding your card easier and will make your card look more professional.
You can also purchase card making kits that have pre-cut cards made of cardstock. The benefit to using pre-cut cards is you’ll be able to start decorating your card faster.
Cardstock and card making kits can be purchased at specialty craft stores.

Use your scrap paper to create greeting cards.,
Incorporate real flowers.,
Create a grid of stickers.,
Decorate your card with sewing supplies.,
Use paint chip samples to decorate the card.",How to Find Materials for Making Greeting Cards2," If you’re a painter, chances are you use scrap paper to remove excess paint from your brush while painting. Instead of throwing out these scraps of paper, save them and use them as decoration for your greeting cards.


Use cardstock to clean your brush in between paint colors.
Cut the cardstock paint designs into squares and paste them onto your greeting card base.
Use a Sharpie marker to write your message across the design (try “Thank You” or “Happy Birthday”).
Use the Sharpie Marker to create a scalloped edge for your design.

, If you have a beautiful bouquet of flowers in your home that are going to waste, try pressing them and using them to decorate your greeting card. Place your flowers facedown in a telephone book lined with parchment paper and allow them to press for a week before removing them.Attach the flowers to your card using dry adhesive dots.
Make sure your flowers are completely dry before using them in your project.

, Most people have stickers lying around their art supply area. Take your card base and use the stickers to create a grid by laying them out in three rows of three stickers each. Attach the stickers and decorate the rest of the card however you please.Use a ruler to find the center of your card before attaching the stickers.
Place an unusual material like a flower in the center of the grid to give the card some additional visual interest.

, If you have a sewing kit, the contents of that kit are perfect for decorating your greeting card. Create a flower out of safety pins by stringing beads onto your safety pins, then gluing the safety pins on the card base in a circular formation to create the flower’s petals.Glue a button in the center of the safety pin circle to create the flower’s pistil.
Glue a piece of ribbon along the bottom of the card to add some more texture.

, If you’ve recently painted your home, you probably have some paint chip samples lying around. Cut the paint chips into interesting shapes and glue them onto your card for a unique design.Try cutting a green paint chip card into a triangle to make an ombre Christmas tree for the holidays.
Cut small triangles out of a variety of different paint chip colors and use the triangles to create a banner to glue on your greeting card.
If you don’t have paint chip samples lying around, you can go to your neighborhood paint store to request some.

Try chalking.,
Experiment with inking.,
Use brads.",How to Find Materials for Making Greeting Cards3," Chalking is a soft coloring technique involving a chalk palette, a dazzle sticker and a Q-tip. To try chalking, take a dazzle sticker and stick it on the greeting card. Dip the Q-tip into your color of choice on the chalk palette, then use the Q-tip to lightly color in the dazzle sticker.A dazzle sticker is a raised sticker you can use to create an embossed effect.
Chalk palettes and dazzle stickers can be purchased at specialty arts and craft stores.
You can also just stick the dazzle sticker on your card without coloring it in.

, Inking is a technique used to make the edges of a greeting card more defined. Take an ink pad and gently run it around the perimeter of the card. This should darken the edges of the greeting card.For a more distressed look, let the ink spill over onto the front of the card.
For tricky edges, use a Q-tip to spread the ink on the card.
Ink pads can be purchased at office supply stores and craft stores.

, Brads are paper fasteners that come in both circles or other decorative shapes. To use a brad on your greeting card, make a small hole in your card using a needle or pin. Stick the prongs of the brad through the hole, then spread the prongs to attach the brad to the card.Apply pressure on the legs of the brad to fold them into place.
Brads can be purchased in specialty craft stores.

",How to Put Old Greeting Cards to Use," This is particularly important if you need to send thank you notes to people who gave you gifts. It's also a much neater and easier way of storing the lovely things people have sent to you in the past than simply hoarding piles of old cards; you can even catalog them if it helps!;
, There are many possibilities for using old greeting cards, limited only by the materials you have to hand and your own preferences. The following steps make a number of suggestions to help inspire you.


Keep the cards in one easy-to-access box. A large shoe box is ideal, such as the types that hold hiking boots. Or, use any box that is no longer needed, provided it has a lid to keep off dust and to prevent the cards from slipping out. You'll be able to delve into this box every time you start a new project, and if you order the cards by color, texture, size, etc., this will make it easier to be inspired.

, Turning old greeting cards into new ones is a simple process and fun too. Glue the front cover of the card onto a new, blank card or cardstock. If you want, you can also redecorate or improve upon the design of the card and add your own new embellishments, such as small ribbons, costume gems, glitter, etc.


Read How to make a birthday card, How to make a Christmas star card, and How to make Christmas cards for more inspiration.

, Cut the greeting cards into smaller sizes to turn them into gift tags. Simply cut a strip or rectangle out of the card, fold it down the middle, and write the ""to"" and ""from"" in it.


Another method is to add interesting features from the original card to small cardstock tags that you've already made. Simply glue in place and write the ""to"" and ""from"" on the blank part (as shown in the image).

, This can make use of several greeting cards that look good together, whether by color, theme, or texture.


Read How to make a gift box out of a greeting card for more details on this project.

, Gift cards can be turned into a notebook or portfolio by cutting the card in half and inserting blank paper or even other greeting cards (as a memento) in the middle portion. Then, simply punch holes through the lot, including the front and back of the card, which will also form the front and the back of the notebook or folder. Sew or weave through a binding thread or coil and knot or tie at the end of the looping. Check that it can move freely, and make any adjustments needed.

, Cards can be reused to create a pouch for the insertion of a small gift such as jewelry, a CD, an MP3 player, a gift voucher, perfume, etc.


Read How to make a gift pouch from a greeting card for the instructions on making this project.

, Greeting cards can make excellent bookmarks and they're as simple as anything to produce quickly. Cut the greeting card into strips about an inch and a half (4cm) wide and 6 inches (15cm) long. Punch a hole near one end and add a tassel to the hole. Tuck a homemade bookmark into each book you give away.


Read How to make a bookmark tassel for more details.

, Agree with a friend to send the same greeting card back and forth year after year, or trade two cards between yourself and a friend. Over the years, the card accumulates notes and becomes a memento, and it might just keep both of you in touch longer. Feel free to enclose sheets of paper as many years' notes accumulate in the card, or use the portfolio method suggested above to keep cards together.

, There are numerous paper crafts that are just ideal for using old greeting cards. Here are just some possible ideas, using the most interesting or colorful parts of old greeting cards:



Use the cards for decoupage,

Do a collage,

Make scrapbooks.

, Pretty card designs can be treasured while eating or enjoying a drink, especially great for nature, animal, and seasonal themes.


See How to make placemats from greeting cards for further instructions.

, The stiff, colorful paper makes an excellent background for them.

, Simply cut off the front ""cover"" of the card if it is flat and send it as a postcard to someone else next year. Postcards usually cost less to send, too.

, You can also make matching or other themed cards into envelopes to accompany the card.

Before you make the actual craft, take a piece of construction paper, trace your hand (or have a friend do it for you) and cut it out.,
Take another sheet of construction paper and fold it in half.,
Get your hand you cut out earlier.,
After it is traced, cut the hand out, including the gap between the hand's thumb and index finger.

, Place it on the paper with the fingers pointing toward the creased side of the paper. Angle it slightly to your left, and trace it.

,, If done correctly, there should appear to be two hands, and in the middle, (the ""blank space"") a heart.

, You may have missed a few spots, and want to trim them off afterwards. If there happens to be a missed space in the heart, fold it up again and then trim.

Choose your felt.,
Cut your felt using scissors or an X-Acto knife.,
Select the proper glue for your project.",How to Decorate Greeting Cards with Felt1," If you decide to add felt to your greeting card and venture off to a craft store, you’ll notice there are several different kinds of felt. These are good for a variety of different purposes, so choose the kind that will work best for the craft you want to create. You certainly don’t need to buy any special felt, but it doesn’t hurt to have a few types of felt in your craft drawer.Ordinary acrylic felt is the most common felt you will find – you’re probably familiar with this type of felt. It’s cheap and works great for creating shapes and designs and gluing them to your paper.
Stiffened felt is a sturdier, more rigid type of felt. If you want to create your entire card from felt, the stiffened felt can work as the background. It can also be used to create three-dimensional forms on your card, because it holds its shape.
Shapes and felt with adhesive backings make crafting easier. You can purchase pre-cut shapes to save you from having to cut your felt, and felt with an adhesive backing doesn’t require any glue.;
, Luckily, you don’t need any special tools or fabric scissors to cut felt. Your regular scissors will work fine. Use a pencil to mark or trace what you want to cut, and use your crafting scissors to cut it out. If you are working with stiffened felt or very thick felt and want to create a perfectly straight border, you can use a straight edge and an X-Acto knife to create it.Place your straight edge where you want your border to be. Then, drag the X-Acto knife along the felt (against edge of the straight edge) until you’ve cut through the felt.

, When decorating a greeting card with felt, you probably have two scenarios: gluing felt to paper or cardstock, and gluing felt to felt. For these two cases, it’s good to have two types of glue on hand. To glue felt to paper or cardstock, you will be fine with everyday white glue.To glue felt to felt, you will need something a bit more intense. Purchase special felt glue for this task, or use a hot glue gun if you have one available."
"
Brainstorm for the occasion.,
Use stencils or freehand your designs before cutting.,
Layer pieces of felt.",How to Decorate Greeting Cards with Felt2," There are lots of different reasons you could be making a greeting card. If it’s truly just a greeting card, you have lots of options. You can decide to spell out their name in felt, you could add images of their favorite things, or you could just have fun creating an abstract felt design. If this card is for a birthday or a wedding, you can create things like cake, balloons, flowers, and so on!


Gather inspiration by looking at greeting cards in store or online. Search Pinterest to see homemade cards others have created for the same occasion.

, Unless you’re an absolute pro with scissors, it’s a good idea to outline your felt shapes or designs in pencil before cutting into the felt. You can purchase stencils at the craft store, or even print out stencils that you can find online. If you have a design in mind but aren’t sure how to draw it, printing an outline or stencil online can be hugely helpful. Otherwise, simply freehand the design onto your felt. You can ensure it looks good before you do something irreversible with your scissors.


Don’t worry about leaving marks on the felt with your pencil. You can glue the felt to your cardstock with the marked up side down, so no one will ever see it!

, While adding one piece of felt to a piece of cardstock or paper can add a lot as is, adding layered, three-dimensional designs can take your card to the next level. Before you glue any felt to your paper, try layering and building on your designs with different colors of felt. Even if the design doesn’t require it, it can add a lot of interest to an otherwise simple design.


For example, say you created a bright yellow sunshine to glue on your paper. Before gluing it down, why not add a bit of orange to the sun? Cut out the exact same shape in the orange felt, only smaller. When you glue it on top of the yellow shape, it will look like an orange sun with a yellow border.
If you don’t want to layer your shape entirely, you can just add little details with other colors. It doesn’t have to be perfect to look great!
Remember to use hot glue or felt glue to glue felt to felt. Regular glue may not be strong enough to hold felt together, and you don’t want your greeting card to fall apart!

"
"
Create a felt pouch for a gift card or money.,
Make a felt envelope.,
Add some realistic flowers.",How to Decorate Greeting Cards with Felt3," It’s always a pleasant surprise when you open a card to find a bit of money inside. Give your recipient this treat, but create a little pouch to hold the gift card, gift certificate, or bills! It’s a very simple addition, but it can really make your card look polished and customized.


Decide how big the pouch needs to be in order to hold the money or gift card. Measure out a square of felt that size, adding about 1/4 an inch on the sides and bottom.
Once you’ve cut out the square of felt, apply a line of glue to the bottom and the sides. This is why you made your felt square larger than the actual. Then, firmly press it onto your card.
Allow your glue to dry, and slide the money or gift card into your new pouch.

, If you’re hand delivering your card, you can make the entire envelope out of felt! This will make your greeting card even more special, and your recipient can keep or even reuse the adorable envelope. To create your envelope, you’ll need a full sheet of felt (the size of a sheet of paper), a button, and some string, plus any decorations you want to add!Fold your piece of felt in half widthwise. It should now form a rectangle.
Cut the folded felt in half. To make sure you cut it at the halfway mark, measure the length of the folded rectangle and make two marks on the top and bottom, exactly at the halfway mark.
Grab one of the felt halves. Unfold it and cut three inches off of it at the top or bottom.
Fold your felt in half lengthwise, so that it forms a long, thin rectangle. Now, you want to create a point on one end. Cut diagonally from the bottom corner (where the fold is) up to the other side. The felt that you’re cutting off should be in the shape of a triangle.
Unfold your felt. Position the pointed end at the top. Then, fold the bottom half upwards, forming the pocket of the envelope. Fold the pointed end overtop, forming the flap of the envelope.
Use your glue to seal the sides of the envelope closed.
Thread your button from the back and going through both holes. The two ends of your string should both be coming out of the back of the button. Then carefully make two slits on the front of the envelope pocket, thread your string through the holes, and tie it in a knot inside the envelope pocket. This will secure your button to the envelope pocket.
Create another slit on the envelope flap, where it hits the button. Carefully push your button through that slit. This creates your envelope closure!

, After all, nothing pairs better with a sweet card than a few flowers. You can glue these flowers to your card or decorate your envelope with them. Grab a piece of your desired color felt, and trace a circle in it. You can trace a CD, the base of a cup, or anything circular to get the perfect circle. Cut out your circle, and you’re ready to construct your flower.Once you have your circle, start cutting it from the outside in a spiral pattern. To do this, simple cut a strip off circle around the perimeter, slowly moving inwards so eventually you’ve cut the entire circle into one, long strip.
At the outside end of the strip of felt, start rolling your felt like a burrito. As you roll along the length of the felt strip, focus on keeping one end of the roll tightly wound, with the other end a bit looser. If this step is confusing, visualize the flower you’re creating. One side of the roll is tight, where it would attach to the stem. The other side is loose and open, showing the “petals.”
When you reach the end of the felt strip, add hot glue or felt glue to the tightly rolled end. This will secure the shape of your felt flower.

",How to Make a Halloween Pumpkin Cut Out Card," These are listed below. Then, cut and fold the colored cardstock to create a card shape.;
, Do this with a pencil lightly enough so that you can see it but can also easily erase it.

, Lay it flat, having the drawing you traced on facing outward.

, It does not matter if you slice through the shape itself, as the part that is to be been removed will not be used again.

, Close the card so that the parchment paper is sandwiched inside. Trace the outline of the card on the parchment paper with a pencil so that it makes a rectangle the same size as the front of the card.

, Glue the edges of the parchment paper rectangle to the back of the front flap of the card. Only glue the edges. This now becomes the highlighting background to your cut-out pumpkin image.

, Once dried, decorate the parchment paper to complete the pumpkin. One idea is shown in the image.


You may also wish to add extra decorations, such as a border, glitter, etc. or write a message on the front.

Choose the colours you want to use.,
Make guidelines on the back side of the front cover.,
Stick the embossing pattern with scotch tape along the guiding lines.,
Take an embossing needle (as you can see in the picture here) and start outlining the pattern on the front cover, much like moving a pen around on a stencil.,
Outline the inner pattern after you're through with the outer pattern.,
Keeping the edge of the embossed pattern in mind, cut the bronze (or whichever colour you want) paper ribbon and paste it as shown.,
Paste the second mold on the “outside” of the front cover (it's a positive embossing pattern).,
Start embossing with the needle on the reverse side.,

",How to Make an Angel Card Using Embossing and Paper Cutting," This example shows use of bronze and white papers for the card. You can vary the colours as per your requirement. Take a more than 160 grams per square meter weight paper (250 gsm paper is used in this example), preferably A4 sheet but you can really use any size you want. Fold it into half and decide which side you want to use as the front of the card.;
, In this case, guidelines are made 2.5 centimeter (1.0 in) from the edge, leaving enough room for the design to be accommodated.

, Don't use ordinary cello tape as it's hard to remove. Scotch tape comes off easily.

This is how it'll look after finishing.

,


Make one or two rectangles with this ribbon depending on your preference.
This is how it'll look after you're finished with pasting the ribbons.

, You can use a negative embossing pattern also. In that case, you need to paste it on the back side, much like the angel embossing pattern.

, This is how it'll look from the back as you emboss.


After you're through with embossing, cut out the portions from in between and if you wish to, make a thin border cut.

Cut out a rectangular piece of the colored paper.,
Fold it in half, short sides together.,
Make two cuts.,
Crease the pop-up.,
Decide what you want to pop up.,
Finish the card.",How to Make a Pop Up Card1," For best results, make sure the actual card is twice the height of the envelope and the pop up shape one half the height of it. A pop up that's too big will prove cumbersome and hard to manage.


Scrapbook paper makes for good greeting card material. Cardstock works well, too -- just make sure your crease is straight and firm.;
, Give it a firm crease with your fingernail or a ruler's edge. Make sure it's straight!








, Make these about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. The cut should be made in from the folded edge of the card in order to make a flap. You can make your cuts deeper or more widely spaced if you wish; take into account the size of your pop up. A bigger pop up needs a bigger flap.









If you don't like the fact that there's now a gaping hole in your card, cover it up! Take a piece of paper, cut it to size, fold it in half, and voila! You now have a border for the edge of your card. Problem solved.

, Fold the flap over on to the front, then fold it on to the back of the card. Open the card and push the flap up toward you. Pinch the middle to crease it.








, It could be a picture of a gift, a name, a heart, a part of a photograph, or anything that takes your fancy. Cut out your pop-up shape and glue it on to the front of the pop-up - i.e., the part that is vertical when the bottom, inside portion of your card is flat against the table and the card is open. Allow the glue plenty of time to dry.









For this part, it's best to use a glue stick. You don't want a soggy mess being made of you and the card.

, Write your message, put it inside the envelope and give it to your intended recipient. They'll love it!


If you have ribbon, glitter, stickers, stamps, or any scrapbooking materials around the house, use them!

, You can rummage through your scrap papers for this part; your pop up should be about half the size of your card. If the paper is too big, cut it to size. Once you've found one that fits your needs, fold it in half, short ends together, just like you did with the primary card.








, For this method we'll use a heart shape. Draw half the heart with the center on the fold; cut it out, open it up, and fold it the other direction. Your heart needs to be very bendy as it's doing the popping!








, These are tabs at the bottom of your heart that will make it pop up when the card is open. About 1/4"" (.6 cm) from the bottom, draw a 45° angle both ways, starting from center. If you have a knitting needle or bone folder, score the paper on that line. If you don't, just form a really firm crease.









Fold it back and then fold it forward along that crease. This is the tab that will attach the heart to the card.

, Make sure the center of your heart matches up with the center of the card! The tab should be facing out, visible when opened. After all, it completes the shape of the heart.









When the heart is attached, force it to fold outward and down. That way, when the card closes, it hides in the center.
Glue does work, but it's much messier and less reliable.

, Pop up complete, now it's just time to add your message and final touches! Write on the front, the heart, or anywhere in between. Sprinkle on some glitter, a ribbon, or whatever you can find in your craft drawer. DIY success!

Try out your card.",How to Make a Pop Up Birthday Card," Run a quick search online for “pop-up card templates” to find a template you want to use for your card. There are many different kinds of templates available, so you’ll have plenty of options. Try to find a template that is not too difficult to cut and glue correctly. For the purposes of this tutorial, follow along with the steps using the birthday cake template linked here (PDF)., Cut out the cupcake section of the template and fold it along the center dashed line. This will serve as the base of the pop-up part of the card. Make sure you’re cutting out the full, symmetrical portion of the template. The individual parts will be cut out later to decorate the pop-up shape.









Some pop-up card templates will be a single shape, while others will include duplicates of certain shapes that can be cut out in different colors and superimposed over the pop-up shape to allow you to use different designs.

, Choose a piece of thick cardstock in a color you want to use for the bottom of the cupcake. Place the template over this piece of cardstock and cut it slightly larger than the template. Once the cardstock is cut, fold it in half along the center as well.








Use 65lb cardstock. This is thicker than paper, but not too thick to fold and open neatly. You can buy 65lb cardstock at any craft or office supply store.

, Double-back a piece of tape to secure the template to the cut card stock. You’ll be cutting the cardstock to match the shape of the template, so make sure the two layers don't slide around while you're cutting or you might make a mistake and have to start over. Tape the back of the template on either end since you’ll be cutting in the middle, then fold both template and cardstock in half together.









Double-back tape by folding a piece approximately two inches long back on itself and sticking the adhesive side of one end onto the top side of the other, making a small loop with the adhesive side outward.

, Follow the lines on the template to cut the cardstock for the pop-up shape. Cut the vertical lines at the bottom first, then move on to the outline of the shape. Be precise: this is the shape that’s going to be displayed when you open up the card. Make sure to cut through both halves of the folded cardstock.









Make sure the scissors you’re using are sharp and the blades are thin enough to handle fine line work. You may want to pick up some specialty crafting scissors, just in case, as conventional kitchen scissors may be too wide to neatly cut out small details., Find the dotted lines on the template that indicate where to fold along the bottom and use them to fold the cardstock shape you just cut. Accuracy is important while folding these lines. If the fold is messy or crooked, the card may not open or shut properly. There should be two folded edges when you’re done, along with the original crease you made when you folded the template.









The first crease created by folding the template and cardstock down the middle is where the pop-up design will fit into the fold of the card.

, Pick another piece of cardstock to serve as the body of the card. This piece can be in a different color, or you might find a certain pattern you like that will make the pop-up portion stand out. Cut this piece of cardstock so that it is roughly 4.5”x11”, then fold it in half.









The folded card will fit a standard 4”x6” invitation envelope., Dab a small dot of glue on the flat surfaces where you folded the bottom of your shape. Place this side of the shape downwards and attach it to the backing card (the creases in the center of both pieces of cardstock should fit together, as this is where the card will open). After the glue dries, the shape will be secured and the other side will be able to move freely once you open the card.









Only glue one side of the shape, and do not glue above the folded lines.
A hot glue gun might work best for this task, or you might find a craft glue with a strong hold. Ordinary Elmer’s glue will suffice but may eventually come unglued after drying., Use another blot of glue to put together the candles on the top half of the cupcake. Close the card and press firmly to make sure that the glue sticks properly. Keep the card closed until the glue is dry, then open it to make sure both halves of the top of the pop-up shape are in alignment.









Remember to connect only the top halves of the cupcake; the bottom section should remain unglued to allow it to ""puff up"" when the card is opened.

, Return to the template sheet and cut out the remaining shapes. There should be two or more of each shape on the template, including outlines for the frosting and candles. You'll be using these template shapes to cut them of colored cardstock, like you did with the original pop-up piece, and layer them onto the pop-up portion of the card.









Leftover pieces can be saved or else used to make your own embellishments to the pop-up designs (i.e. adding more candles).

, After you’ve cut out the individual template shapes, choose what color cardstock you want to use for each on the finished card. Attach these shapes to the selected cardstock and cut them out. If you desire, you can fold these pieces of cardstock in half before gluing and cutting; this way you can cut out two pieces at once.








, Once you’ve got all the individual pieces of cardstock cut and ready, glue them in the appropriate places on both sides of the pop-up piece already in your card. For this template, the candle will be placed at the top above the frosting shape, and the frosting in turn should overlap the first pop-up piece you cut which serves as the base of the cupcake. Press these pieces flat inside the closed card and give them ample time to dry.








, Open up the card and see how it works. If you’ve cut, folded and glued the base shape correctly, it should pull a little on the outer edge where it’s been glued to cause it to stand up when the card is opened while still lying flat once it’s shut. It’s alright if the pieces aren’t perfectly aligned or the shape doesn’t quite stand up on your first attempt. Try again until you have a neat, colorful handmade pop-up card. Decorate the card with markers, glitter, stickers or paint, then give it to a friend and watch their face light up!









If your pop-up shape doesn't stand up correctly, it most likely means a slight mistake was made cutting the cupcake shape or gluing it down. Give it another attempt, making sure to cut the pop-up shape as precisely as possible and gluing only the folded edge of the underside to the base cardstock.
Misaligning the candles at the top of the cupcake can make the pop-up shape look crooked and may prevent it from lying flat when the card is closed. Both candle halves should be perfectly superimposed before you glue them.
It might be helpful to print out multiple copies of the original template in case you need a practice run or two.

, Using the ruler, draw a rectangle from the card measuring 8.25"" (21 cm) x 5.5"" (13.5 cm). Cut out the rectangle with the scissors, and fold it in half so it forms a card with a surface measuring roughly 4"" (10 cm) x 5.5"" (13.5 cm).

, Measure this piece into a 3.5"" (8.5 cm) x 5"" (13 cm) rectangle. Cut it out.



Glue it onto the front of your card. Make sure it is centered, so that an even border of the first colored paper (the card) shows right around it evenly.

, Preferably, this is a light-colored piece of paper to ensure that your writing will show up on it.


Cut out the rectangle.
Attach it inside the card, again leaving an even border around the edges. This is where you will later write your message.

, Lightly sketch the design you want to create on the front of the card in pencil. As you're designing the card, consider where you want the seed beads to be applied; for example, if you only want beads in certain parts, designate the areas.


If you want to solidly cover an area in beads, it's best to start at the center of each design element, and work your way out.

, Once you're happy with the design, start adding the beads to it, bit by bit.


Squeeze a very thin line of glue over the pencil lines of the design. Cover about an inch (2.5 cm) of its length.
Apply the beads onto the glued area using your fingers. Use the toothpick to help shape or move beads into place as needed. Be sure to have each bead sit on the card with the holes visible from the top.

,


Work the design in parts or areas, so that you're not dragging your hands over glued areas. Once an area is coated with beads, move on to the next one with the glue, and then the beads.
Continue adjusting any parts of the design as you go; sometimes new design additions will appear to you as you're working on the card.

, Write your message inside and place in an envelope for completion.

Allow card ample dry time once the front design has been completed.,
Finished.

",How to Design a Greeting Card with Buttons," Or create the card shape and size using the heavy cardstock. You only want to use heavy cardstock because even though the buttons are lightweight, they will add some weight to the card--only heavy material can support them. Also, when using hot glue you will need strong material in order to avoid having bleed through the card.;
, Instead of just gluing buttons on the card, go into the design with a plan. Consider the overall message (such as “Happy Birthday”) and card size. Also, determine if you plan to create an abstract design or something more traditional, like a birthday cake or balloons.


Sketch the design directly on the card using pencil. Make light sketch marks to use as your guide. You can erase any remaining marks after the card has been completed.






Map out where the buttons will be placed. Obtain a general idea of button placement by laying them along the sketch without gluing them in place. This way you can see what your design might look like without making a commitment.







, Use the paint pens or markers before adding the buttons. The buttons will enhance the design so include your message and base design first.


Allow paint or marker to dry on the card before adding the buttons.






Place a small dab of hot glue on the back of the button before applying it to the card. Add glue for each button immediately before it is placed.







, You may want to let the card rest overnight to ensure the glue and marker/paint is completely dry.

Create your design.,
Draw an inverted triangle on your card.,
Measure the dimensions of your centerfold flower.,
Cut a triangle out of construction paper.,
Draw your design.,
Glue the edges of the centerfold to your card.,
Crease the center of the triangle and glue on flowers.,
Carefully close your card.",How to Make a Pop Up Flower Greeting Card1," Start with a card that says all the words you need to. Put your messages where you want them to go, so you know where your center design will go. Make sure nothing you want to be visible will be underneath your centerfold design.;
, Picture a spot around the centerfold that you want to be covered by flowers. Draw a rough outline around this spot so you know what spots it will cover. It should start at the bottom of the card and extend upwards and outwards, like the shape of an ice cream cone.

, You don't want your centerfold flower to be wider than your card. Fold your card shut and measure the width.The widest part of the pop out flower should not be more than this amount.

, The top dimension should be no wider than your card's width (when closed). You can make a centerfold design much smaller than this, however. As long as your design is not wider than the width of the card, folded, you can place it at any height on the centerfold.

, This is where you use markers or construction paper to create a design. It is advisable to make it symmetrical, but you don't need to. Keep track of the design you will want to cut out of the top once you have finished drawing the design.


After you're done, cut any excess paper from the top and sides.
Erase and pencil marks you made to plan for the centerfold design.
Fold your design in half.

, Lay out your card and your centerfold design. Line up your centerfold design with the crease of your card. Rubber cement will hold your centerfold the best, but standard glue will work as well. It will make your card more secure to fold an inch along edges of the triangle so it doesn't come off the card., You want to fold the triangle the opposite direction of the way the card folds. In other words, if you open the card, the triangle should pop out toward you. Now glue the flowers on the triangle. If they are going over the center crease of the triangle, fold them as well so they will not get damaged when the card closes.

, Once the glue holding on the triangle and flowers have dried, carefully close your card. When it is opened again, the flowers will pop up. The centerfold flower is different from the regular pop out flower.

Start with your card.,

Cut out your flowers.,
Add extras to your flowers.,
Make the pop up springs.,
Wait for your card to dry.,
Glue the springs to your card.,
Glue your flowers on.,
Carefully close your card.",How to Make a Pop Up Flower Greeting Card2," Take any size piece of paper and fold it in half to make your card. Of course, you can make the card as big or small as you want and fold it to open sideways or flip up. Decorate the front and inside of your card however you wish. Add bows or glitter to make it original.When you decorate the inside, plan how many flowers you want, how large you want them, and where you want them.

, Once you’ve decorated your card, open it and use a pen to mark with an X where you plan to place your pop up flowers. This will give you a final number of how many you need to make. Once you mark the spots, put your card in a safe place so that you can make your flowers.

, Using colorful paper, outline as many flowers as you had X’s on your card. You can make them all the same kind and color or you can vary them. Try cutting out two flowers and gluing them together. Rather than gluing them directly on top of one another, twist one so that the petals from the bottom are seen in between the petals of the other.The size of your flowers and the length of your springs depends on how much wobble you want the flowers to have. Larger flowers will be heavier and flop around more, while smaller flowers will stay in place easier. Make sure you aren't obstructing your text with overly large flowers.
The easiest flower to draw will have four to five petals and you can easily draw one by placing a small circular item on your paper (a penny is a good starting point). Next, simply trace a bubbled outline around the circle to make your flower.

, Now that you have all of your flowers cut out, you can decorate them. Use glitter, markers, or chalk to add fun to the future pop up flowers for your card. To make them 3D, you can fold the petals to give them some structure. Simply crease the petals down the middle so that the petals stand up.

, There are 2 methods for this. For one, cut strips of construction paper three inches long and the width of your flowers. Cut as many strips as you have flowers. Take a strip and fold ½” up. Keep this fold and make a second fold by going the opposite way. This will create a Z shape, with one strip longer than the other. Repeat this back and forth fold all the way up your strip of paper. Notice that it creates a spring.Alternately, you can cut strips an inch or two longer, and fold them like an accordion. This will really make your flowers pop.

, If you’ve added glitter, glue, or anything else to your card that needs time to adhere, wait for it to dry before you add your flowers. This way you can move your card freely to place your flowers where you want.

, Rubber cement will hold your springs the best, but standard glue will work as well.Place a drop of adhesive on your X and place the bottom fold of your spring on it. Hold it in place for a few seconds. Repeat with all of your X’s and springs.

, Now that you’ve glued your springs to your card, place a drop of adhesive to the top flap of a spring. Using both hands, place one of your flowers on this spring. Pinch the top flap of your spring and your flower together to ensure it sticks.

, Once the springs and flowers have dried, carefully close your card. When you do so, it will squish the flowers to the card. When it is opened again, the flowers will pop up.

You will need a flat surface to work on. Because you are using glue, you may want to cover your surface in newspaper before beginning.


If you want to decorate your shield, you’ll also need markers, paint, stencils, glitter, or any other decorating materials.
Keep in mind that this specific shield is made entirely out of paper products, so there may be better DIY options for anyone looking for an extremely sturdy, polished shield.;
, You will want to create about thirty in total. These tubes will create the width of the shield. This requires slow and steady work, so take your time! This step will probably be the most time-consuming step of this craft.Start at the corner of the paper, and roll diagonally. Roll it tightly, so that it ends up about the width of a chopstick.
Once you’ve rolled the paper completely, tape down the remaining loose corner.
This will require about thirty sheets, but you may end up using slightly more or less.

, They may vary slightly in length, but that’s perfectly fine. Line them up side by side so that they form a rectangle. To envision what you are creating, think of the wall of a log cabin. It’s created of logs laying side by side. The tubes will be forming a three-dimensional rectangle, like the wall of a log cabin., Take long strips of tape and lay them across the tubes. Once the tubes are all held together pretty well, you can add reinforcement by wrapping long pieces of tape across the front and around to the back. Make sure that you are taping the top, bottom, front, and back of the tubes evenly. Do this repeatedly, and use a lot of tape, until the tubes form one study rectangle that you can pick up and gently shake without any coming loose.

, You'll need to tear enough paper to cover the surface of your shield. It doesn’t matter what kind of paper you use or the size of strips you create in this step, because it won’t show anywhere when the shield is completed. This paper will simply be used to create a flat surface between the paper tubes and the decorated paper you will eventually be placing on top., Spread a thin layer of glue evenly over the paper tubes. Ordinary squeezable Elmer’s glue will do the trick. Glue the torn strips of paper all over the tubes. Only one side of the tubes needs to be covered, and don’t worry about covering the sides of the tubes. Make sure all of the tubes are covered by scrap paper. Let this dry completely., You can use either construction paper or thin poster board for this step. Obviously, the shield will be larger and more heavy-duty if you use poster board, but you will also need to create more paper tubes for the backing. This colored paper will be used to cover the paper tube structure you’ve created.Large sheets of paper work great, but you can also simply tape regular size sheets together.

, To make sure that the design you create will fit onto the tube structure you’ve created, you may want to lay down the tube structure first and trace around it. Then, you can draw any shape you desire within the outline of the tubes. Once you’ve traced your shield onto the colored paper, cut it out.You can use a traditional shield shape, a circle, or find a unique shield design online.
Shields can be pointed, rounded, simple, or intricate. Different shapes and styles can designate different time periods or geographic regions, so you can put some thought into the design you choose., Taking a pencil, lightly trace the outline of the shield onto the side of the tubes covered by the newspaper strips. The surface may be slightly bumpy from the tubes, so go slow and get the best outline you can. After you’ve traced the shield onto the tube structure, use the scissors to cut the shape.Complete this step slowly and carefully. Since you’ll be cutting through the taped together tubes, this can be kind of tricky. You can cut out the general shield shape, and then clean up any sloppy edges afterwards.
Lay your colored shield outline onto the tube structure to make sure they are both the same shape.

, It is easiest to do this before you glue it onto the tubes, because you can draw, paint, stamp, or write on a flat surface. Get creative! You can draw a picture, create a bold outline, write something, or anything else you desire.


One popular shield design is a family crest. You can find your family crest using a Google search, but be aware that you may find several different ones for your name., The paper shield and the tubes should be in the exact same shape, but you can trim the tubes if they do not line up perfectly. Remember to glue the shield onto the side of the tubes covered by newspaper. Put a flat, heavy object on top of the shield as it dries, so that it dries smoothly and firmly., If you've created a pretty large, heavier shield, you may want to use poster board for this step. If you used regular paper for your entire shield, than a few stacked sheets of regular paper should work fine for your handle. Use your judgment to choose which material will best support the weight of the shield you've already created.If you are using poster board, simply cut a rectangle about the length of a standard piece of paper. The width should be a width that you can comfortable wrap your hand around.
If you choose to use sheets of paper, line them up evenly. Then, begin rolling the stack length-wise. The width of the final rolled strip should be about one inch, or whatever width you can grip comfortably.

, Taking a pencil, make dashes on the surface on either side of your hand, so that you’ve marked the width of your hand. This step is necessary so that the handle is wide enough for you to grip. Remove your hand, and fold the strip where you’ve made the marks, creating a handle shape.To help you visualize this, imagine folding the paper into a geometric U-shape.
The trough of the U is where you will be gripping the handle, and the tips of the U will be where the handle attaches to the shield.

, To do this, you will need to create two more folds at the ends of the paper, flattening the ends so they can be taped down to the surface of the shield. You can place it directly in the middle of the shield, or wherever you prefer holding it. Use several strips of tape so that it is very sturdy. If your handle falls off during battle, your shield will be useless!"

Origami paper
Construction paper
Cardstock;
, First, fold and unfold it diagonally through the center from top right to bottom left, and then diagonally through the center from the top left to bottom right., Look at the folds you’ve made (the paper will be folded into four triangles). Either with a pencil or in your mind, label the four folds that divide the paper into quarters as A, B, C, and D (in order, going counter-clockwise).

, You want the paper in front of you so that the triangle labeled side D and A has its bottom edge facing you.

, Start by folding the left side of the triangle in half in on itself, so the outer edges of sides C and D meet. Repeat on the other side, so that the outer edges of sides A and B meet., Start on one side, and fold the bottom corners in toward the center, so that each bottom corner comes to meet the top corner. Repeat on the other side.

, Orient the square so it looks like a diamond, with all the folded flaps at the top and the neat bottom point facing you. On each side of the paper, fold the two side points of the diamond in to the center so the bottom edge of the diamond lines up with the center edge of the square.

, On each of the four kite faces, open each fold one at a time until you get a small right triangle sticking out the back of your fold. Fold this little triangle down over the front, and then refold all the original folds. Repeat with each kite face.

, Fold it back and forth to create a nice crease.Now, stand the kite up on the bottom tip, and gently press the center tip at the top. The paper should begin opening up and unfolding at the base at the last crease you made. Once it unfolds into a triangle, you can square off the edges of the base and the sides of your paper pyramid.

,, Either use a square piece of paper to create your own template, or print one off and use it as either the paper for the pyramid or a cut-out template that you can trace onto a different piece of paper.


A proper pyramid template pattern will have a square base, and off each side of that base there will be an attached triangle. Two or all four of these triangles will have tabs on them. Once cut out, the four triangles will come together and join at the top to form the pyramid faces.

, The tabs on the side are important (so don’t cut them off) because these will be used to glue or tape the sides of the pyramid together.

, Now that the pattern has been cut, you have the basic shape for your pyramid, and it can now be decorated any way you like. Remember that the faces on the underside of the paper will become the outside, so be sure to decorate the right side!


Try drawing an overlapping grid pattern to make it look like the bricks of an Egyptian pyramid.

, After decorating, flip the pyramid back over to create creases so that the faces will come together nicely. Make sure to direct the creases inward, and don’t forget to crease the tabs as well. ]


If you are using thicker paper, such as cardboard, consider using a hobby knife or scissors to gently trace the lines where the pyramid will bend and fold.

, Apply glue or tape to the outside edges (the decorated side edges) of all the tabs. Bring the four faces of the pyramid together, securing them to each other by positioning the sticky tabs on the inside of the pyramid faces.Gently press the sides to the tabs and allow the glue to dry.

Several pieces of durable paper (8.5x11"", any color)
Scotch tape
Scissors
Ruler
Marker
Hot Glue
A rubber band;
, To start, select one piece of paper. Roll the paper into a thin tube. Gently roll the origami paper into a cylinder shape, leaving a space in the middle if possible. It should look something like a small cardboard paper towel roll. This is your mold, and you'll use it to help roll the rest of the paper tubes needed to make a paper pistol.It should be about the diameter of a pencil. If in trouble, you can even use a pen or pencil to help you get the shape right.

, To make your gun, you'll be sliding the first tube into a second, larger tube in order to shoot. To create the second tube, roll a second piece of origami paper around the first tube you created. When the second paper is completely rolled up, gently slide the first tube out of your new tube. You will now have another tube, slightly bigger than your first. Like the first tube, this tube should something like a cardboard paper towel roll., Once you've rolled up your tube, secure the tube with your scotch tape. Place one piece of tape on either end of the tube to keep it together. Then, trim down the sides of the tube using your scissors. You want the sides to be smooth and even, with no awkward bits of paper slipping out on the sides., Keep rolling your tubes up the same as the first time. Then, use scissors, a ruler, and a maker to cut your tubes into the following lengths.



For the barrel: You need to have two 15cm tubes.

For the handle: You need to have seven 5cm tubes

For the trigger: You need to have one 8 cm tube.

, Stack all of the tubes on top of each other, then slightly offset them by moving the bottom ones to the right, diagonally (this mimics the shape of a normal pistol handle). Hot glue them, one on top of the other, together to make a long, thin handle for your gun.


You can also glue them on straight, then cut one end of the handle diagonally, forming a slight angle. Trim down the angle with your scissors to smooth out the sides., The excess tube should be on the side the handle slants towards. In other words, if you were holding the gun up to shoot, the extra 3cm would point back at you. This is going to be the ""trigger tube"" of the gun.

, This is the barrel of your pistol, so it needs to point away from you, of course. Line up the back of the barrel with roughly the center of your handle, then hot glue it in place.

, This time, don't worry about there being a space. Roll up some paper (it is nice if you can use a different color) into round tubes just a bit thinner than your first set. These new ones need to be able to slide in and out of the older tubes. To get them thinner, roll them without the guide. You should also cut off the last 4-5"" triangular inches of paper as you're rolling the tubes to decrease the thickening paper in the center of the tube.

, Trim away the excess so that there is only 1/4"" of tube poking out of the back of the trigger chamber and nothing poking out of the back of the handle. The bend in the U is on the barrel side. This will be your trigger -- when you pull the trigger back, this little extra bit should pop out the back of the trigger chamber.


Make sure that the tube can slide freely back and forth. This is your trigger, after all.

, Bend the tube into an S-shape, flattening the curvy parts as needed. Slide one end of the paper into the second highest tube of the handle (right below your trigger), letting the curve in the ""S"" become a little trigger guard. Hot glue the leftover tube to the bottom of the barrel and cut off any excess.

, This tube should be flattened into a long, thin rectangular strip. You then hot glue it to the back of the handle, curving it around the front and under your trigger guard, if you have one. The goal is to close off all of the unnecessary openings in the tubes on the handle of the gun, but the essential one to close is the one right behind the trigger.



DO NOT close up the trigger chamber. This needs to be open to load and fire the gun.
In the end, you'll create an ""outline"" of sorts of the bottom of the gun. This is why using another color looks so good.

, Remove the trigger, and put in the spring so that it presses against the outline tube. This will allow your trigger to spring back automatically after you shoot the gun.

, Fold a piece of origami paper in half twice, forming a long, thin line of paper. Roll this line into a squat tube. Secure the tube with a single piece of scotch tape and trim down the sides to smooth them out. This should look like a tiny toilet paper roll. Then...


Take your scissors and cut the tube open. Then, take your rubber band and place it inside the tube.Tape the tube back together. You should now have a small, squat paper roll with a rubber band running through it. This is the trigger of your gun., Cut the ends so that, with the rubber banded end as close to the back of the barrel as you can get it, not part of the tube pokes out of the front of barrel.

, Make sure the back of the trigger rests right at the opening of trigger chamber. When you pull the trigger back, the bit of tube that pokes out unhooks the trigger, which releases the rubber band and shoots your bullets.

, Now, your gun should shoot. Roll bits of origami paper into small balls. Place a ball into the end of the gun opposite the handle and trigger, and hook the rubber band up. Pull the trigger to release the rubber band, shooting the trigger tube forward and firing your bullets. The ball should shoot out of the gun."

Gather at least 10 pieces of construction paper.,
Cut at least 3 strips of 2.5 inch by 10 inch (6.3 cm by 25.4 cm) paper from each piece of paper.,
Form one strip of paper into a loop.,
Connect another loop with the first loop.,
Repeat this step until you've connected all of the loops.,
Hang up your garland.",How to Make a Paper Garland1," For variety, choose two different colors of paper, or even pick several different colors. Pick colors that are appropriate to the season or occasion -- red, green, and yellow for Christmas, or pastel colors for a baby shower or bridal shower.;
, Use a sturdy pair of scissors to cut equally-sized strips of paper from each piece of paper. You can adjust the size a bit according to your preference -- adjusting the width of the strips will make the garland loops wider and adjusting the length will make the loops longer.








, Simply create a loop by making the flat strip round, and touching the edges of the paper so that they are overlapping by at least 1 inch (2.5 cm). The most dependable way to make the strip stay in loop form is to glue the ends of the strip together and wait for the glue to dry before you move on. But if you don't have the time or patience to individually glue each garland, you can also tape the loops together using clear masking tape.









If you're really pressed for time, you can even staple the ends of the loops together twice. Remember that if one loop falls apart, the garland will disconnect.

, Now take another strip of paper and run it through the first loop until you connect the ends of that strip to form a second loop. Connect the ends of the second loop just as you did with the first loop. If you're going for alternating colors, make sure you pick a different color for the second loop.








, Continue running each strip of paper through the previous loop and then connecting it to make a loop until you've connected all of your loops and have created a paper garland of interlocking loops. If you'd like your garland to be a bit longer, just cut more strips of paper and create more loops until you're satisfied with the length.








, Once your garland has been created, all you have to do is hang it up. You can drape the garland over a tree, a back patio, a column, or any piece of furniture. If you want to hang your garland up on the wall, hang the loops over a sturdy protruding nail.

Gather your materials.,
Decorate your umbrellas.,
Fold each cupcake liner into quarters.,
Create umbrella handles from your pipe cleaners.,
Insert the umbrella handles into the umbrellas.,
Glue the umbrella pieces together and wait for them to dry.",How to Make a Paper Umbrella1," To make cupcake umbrellas, you will need a few items that you are likely to already have around your house. If not, they can be found at most any grocery, drugstore, or hobby shop near you. You will need cupcake liners, pipe cleaners, craft glue, and scissors.


You can use either plain cupcake liners or ones that are already pre-decorated. If you choose blank liners, you may also need markers, pens, pencils, or crayons for decorating them.This is a good craft for young children who may have trouble with the more complicated methods of making paper umbrellas.;
, If you would like to decorate plain cupcake liners, draw on them first before doing anything else. You can use anything you have on hand, like crayons or markers. Draw whatever designs you'd like on them.


You can also put different letters on each wrapper to spell out a word.
If you have other materials available, like stickers or glitter, feel free to add those, too.
If you're using pens or markers that bleed through the paper, work a surface covered with newspaper to keep from staining. Spread the wrapper flat and face down. The outside of the wrapper will be the most visible part of your ""umbrella.""
If you're using utensils that don't bleed through, such as colored pencils or crayons, you can decorate both sides of your ""umbrella.""

, Take each cupcake liner and fold it in half with the side you would like to be visible (usually the bottom of the liner) on the outside. Unfold the liner. Fold it in half again, this time making a crease perpendicular to the first one. There should now be two creases creating four equally-sized sections.

, Bend each pipe cleaner into a crook, with one long straight section that ends in a small hook looping back around. If your pipe cleaners are long, cut them down so that they are about one and a half times the width of your cupcake liners.

, Poke the straight end of one pipe cleaner through the center of each cupcake liner. You will be going through the folded down, undecorated side. If you have trouble getting the pipe cleaners through, try poking a small hole in the center first using a toothpick or pen.

, Position the pipe cleaner handles so that they stick only slightly through the top of the cupcake liner. Fold the liners down in the position you'd like them to set in. Dab some craft glue inside through the bottom of the umbrella. Focus the glue at the base of the umbrella where the handle connects most to the paper. Don't use too much, or it will spill and make a mess. Wait at least one hour for the glue to set."

The more stuff you have to work with, the more fun it'll be when it comes to making the flowers themselves. While you're always encouraged to be as thrifty as possible when it comes to crafts, taking a quick trip over to the arts store can save a load of headache.Here is a list of things you'll probably need to complete the project; feel free to overlook any that you already think you have enough of at home:


Ample amounts of paper. Different coloured construction paper is arguably the most aesthetic option for paper flowers, but printer paper will suffice as well. The more the better, really-- you don't want to feel like you need to save on your paper use with a project like this.
A number of 'stems'. The type of stem you pick will really depend on the style of flowers you're going for. Realistic flower designs might actually look best if they're propped up by real twigs, found in one's backyard. For most cases, floral wire is the best. It is designed to approximate the look of a flower stem, and has the strength to remain upright with matter taped or glued onto its end.
Glue and scissors. You'll need tools to format and fix up the materials you'll be working with.
Markers and pencil crayons, for decorating the flowers and vase once they've been done up.;
, There's a lot you can do with the things you already have at home. There's a good chance you have scrap paper lying around, and stems can be made from a wide variety of things. Before or after you make your shopping run, you should see what else you can conjure up from your existing crafts scraps. Even if you're not able to save yourself much money for new materials, it will almost certainly offer you a greater variety of stuff to make use for the finished product.


Most houses have a growing stockpile of pencils, pens and pencil crayons they no longer use. If you're looking for a truly DIY venture, HB pencils can make for great, utilitarian pencil stems.
Flower stems can be made from just about anything, from strips of popsicle sticks to standup wiring to sticks of wood from the backyard.

, The best place to get started with creating your masterpiece is probably your kitchen table, although any table will suffice, provided there's enough room to organize, cut and fold things. You should arrange pieces according to their respective type before diving into the folding and gluing. Keeping everything (relatively) neat and tidy will save you having to search for pieces when you need them.

, In order to make proper flowers using paper, you'll first need to make squares of them. Keep these squares as large as you can; you'll need as much material as possible to make the various folds work. Make 3-5 squares for each flower you're planning on adding inside your bouquet. Each square will make a petal for your flower. As you might already imagine, the process for making each of these flowers can be quite time-consuming, so it's important to plan ahead and set enough time aside to make enough of them to fill your bouquet.One helpful trick is to pull a corner of a sheet of printer paper over to the other diagonal side of the paper as far as it can comfortably go. Cut whatever strip of paper that is not covered by the diagonal fold, and you'll have a square sheet of paper.
If the paper you're using has different colours or a pattern on only one side of the sheet, place the side you want to use facing down; this will be the side people see the most of in the finished product.

, Now that your square is ready, give it a clean fold down the middle diagonally, leaving a firm crease in the center. It's important to take your time at first if you're new to origami and other forms of paper crafts. By the time you get through a few petals, you'll find the following steps go by much faster.

, Next, it's time to fold up the center edges to reach the top corner. Pull them upwards and fold over. By the end of this step, your paper should look like a small square or diamond, with two triangular halves folded over a diamond base. Take care to make the folds as precise as you can. Sloppy folds will make it harder or even impossible to get a good finished product., For your next fold, take the open edges at the centre of your diamond and fold them outward to meet the outer edges of their respective triangles. If done correctly, they should make the shape of half a kite. From there, open up the kite fold over the diamond base to make a full kite shape.At this point, you should have two kite shapes, one on either side of your diamond background. The tops of the kits should be sticking out from the diamond.

, Turn your petal in around on itself to make a small cone. Add a pea-sized dab of glue in between the folds to make it stick. Let it sit for about a minute before you work with it any more. Handling a petal that hasn't had the time to let its glue set will risk coming undone when you try to attach it to the flower's stem.You can start working on your next petal while you're waiting for the current petal to dry.

, Once you have the petals folded up, it's time to peg it to a stem. Find the center of the flower's back, add some glue, and set the stem against the glued area. The petal should be pointing face upward relative to the rest of the flower's stem. It should be sufficiently glued within a minute. Make sure the petal has been placed properly before you let the glue set completely.Hot glue is preferable to regular stick glue, as it will give you more precision., Running through these steps once will result in one petal. You should have 3-5 petals for each flower you make. Depending on the size of your bouquet, you may have to make 5-20 flowers before you have enough to stock your vase to satisfaction, so it could end up being a pretty time-consuming project if you're feeling ambitious. Don't worry-- this may sound like a lot of time and hard work, but they'll go by much faster once you get the smooth hang of it., Using a proper sort of paper is important when doing any origami craft. Go to an arts store and some thick rice paper; it creases well and doesn't tear easily.While construction paper always works in a pinch, if you're doing the origami method of vase-making, rice paper is preferred for its thickness and authenticity.


Unlike the admittedly time-consuming flower petals, you'll ideally only need to make one vase before your bouquet is ready. With that in mind, it's important to try to make the vase as slick and polished as it can be. Giving yourself the extra time to make sure you're doing it right will be far less stressful than realizing you've made an error later down the road.

, A waterbomb base is the foundation from which you'll be making your vase. To start, make creases up, down, and both ways diagonally through the middle of the paper. Once you have finished this, there should be a visual impression of four distinct lines running through the center from one end of the square to the other. Take care to make these creases as defined as you can, pressing down and running your finger along them to make sure they settle in the paper. Weaker creases won't open up the way you'll want them to.

, Once you have your creases, push the paper up from opposing ends inwards. Hold the center down as you push it up. The pressure should cause the waterbomb's creases to open up into a creased triangle. Continue exerting pressure and allow the waterbomb to stand up. Smooth out any crumpled edges manually if you happen to see something wrong. At the end of all of this, you should have a working waterbomb foundation to build your vase with., With the waterbomb complete, you should have something that looks like an obtuse triangle. To start up with the vase proper, take both of the far corners of your triangular base and fold them upwards to its opposing side as far as it will comfortably go. Fold the right side over to the left side; do the same for the left side. This should create the appearance of a bottomless cup. Once you've creased firmly, unfold it.With this step completed, you should have the look of two paper kite shapes on either side of your vase framework. These will ultimately become the corners of the three-dimensional result.

, A squash fold is a common origami fold with spread, flattened edges, completed by pressing down on them once the initial fold has been made.Make squash folds on the left and right side of your vase in progress, then flip over the paper and do it for the opposing side. With these squash folds in place, you'll have a basic framework from which to open up your vase.There are lots of videos available online detailing how to go about a proper squash fold. If you're not experienced in origami, you should watch a few of these to get a better hang of them.

, With squash folds giving your origami vase a solid perimeter, you can now open it up. Push gently from the inside out, making sure not to dislodge any of the folds you've already made. When that is done, hide the overlapping creases by folding them on the inside of your vase. With that, you should have a relatively functional vase with which to decorate and fill with as many paper flowers as you wish., Now here comes the fun part. With the pieces all prepared, it's time to decorate the bouquet and give it some extra visual spunk. First, you'll want to decide what overall look you're going for. If you're trying to decide what style you want the bouquet to have, it's good form to approach the flowers and vase as one and the same. It's a common mistake to design flowers and the vase independently, but that doesn't give any promise the two designs will complement one another.Consider the circumstance you'll be presenting this bouquet as well. A Halloween decoration may veer towards spooky oranges and blacks, while a Valentine's gift might conventionally lean on conventional reds, whites and pinks., By wrapping construction paper around the vase and taping it, you'll give yourself a canvas to decorate however you choose. The colour of construction paper you choose will have a major impact on the look of the vase, and you might even consider using strips of multiple colours of paper for a bolder look.


It's another possibility to do without construction paper wrappings at all, as some people find aesthetic value in the intricate folds of origami. One way or another, the amount of decoration is entirely up to you, and there may be cases where no added decor is even necessary.

, Vases have the most space for artistic expression in a flower bouquet, and you should make use of it. Take some markers, pencil crayons or even watercolours and a paintbrush and take some creative license with the look of it. A geometric pattern (like a cross stitch or lined pattern) is simple and useful, but full-blown drawings could leave a great impression if you've got an artist's touch.It'll feel more special if you make an effort to associate the decoration with the occasion the flowers are being presented. If they're for a wedding for example, a drawing of the bride and groom, a ring, or even a multi-tiered wedding cake could be the thing the vase needs to be truly unique and leave a real impression.

, Drawing intricate designs or shaded textures on the petals is a good way to bring extra life to the bouquet flowers. In the majority of cases, adding shading with some pencil crayons is a simple way to significantly improve their look.

, The basic set up and location of each flower in the vase can be a creative statement unto itself. How you go about it will depend on the number of flowers you've decided to include. Evenly distributing them across the front and back is usually a safe bet, although you may want to spruce it up depending on what looks best for your own vase."

Using a precision art knife, cut a small 1/2"" notch right above the handle.,
Cut a small notch in the barrel of the gun.",How to Make a Paper Gun That Shoots2," To start making an origami gun, you'll need to prepare two sheets of paper. Take a large rectangular sheet of origami paper. Fold it in half and tear it into two smaller, wider rectangles. You will fold each smaller sheet using the following process:


Fold the rectangle in half from top to bottom, creating a smaller, narrower rectangle. Then, unfold the paper.Use the crease in the center of the paper as a guide. The paper is now in two halves. Fold one-half inward, so the end of the paper lines up with create. Then, fold the other half inward, so the end of the paper lines up with crease. The two ends of the paper should meet at the crease of the paper.Now, fold the paper inward along the crease. You should have a long, thin strip of folded paper., Then, unfold the paper. The crease at the center of the strip should divide it into two halves. Fold the end of the right half at a 90-degree angle. Then, fold the other half into a 90-degree angle. The paper should look something like a small paper horseshoe.The width of the center, horizontal section should be twice the width of your long pieces. Place the strip to the right of your center line. Then fold the ""arm"" of the horseshoe right where it meets the thin strip in the center.

, Keeping the fold starting in the same place, re-angle the horseshoe so it looks a bit like a squared teardrop. There should be a nice triangle in the middle.

, It will be a bit like a lower-case ""L,"" with a long strip and slight curvy bit at the end. You should also fold your long, thin strip of paper in half too.

, Things can get a bit tricky here, so go slowly. Take your second strip of paper and fold it in half from end to end. You will be inserting this strip into the handle:


Pull the handle apart slightly. The bent down portion should have two small openings. Feed either end of the second strip through these openings.Pull both ends of the second folded strip through the openings of the horseshoe. Keep pulling until the two strips are forming a wide angle of roughly 110 degrees. The two ends of the strip will form the ""barrel"" of the pistol., You should now be able to see the outline of a gun. There should be a small folded strip of paper hanging out just underneath the gun's barrel. Pull down on this strip of paper gently, until it hangs down below the gun. You should now be able to bend this handle in and out like a trigger., This is where you ""load"" the gun."" The incision should be roughly 1/4"" deep and 1/2 wide. Place it roughly in the center of the diagonal ""trigger"" of the gun.


You may need to cut twice -- once through the barrel and once through the opening underneath. If you do, try and stagger them a bit to make a ""hammer"" on your gun, or the small lever you see people pull back before shooting in movies. This little extra notch will help hold the rubber band in place.
Make sure there is a deep enough notch to hook a rubber band (bullet) onto.

, This just needs to be big enough to hold a rubber band on the other side. You can then attach the band between this notch and the first one you made. When you pull the ""trigger"" you move the notch enough to release the rubber band, causing it to fire!

Gather at least 10 pieces of cardstock paper.,
Cut the paper into strips.,
Cut circles from the paper.,
Create your garland pattern.,
Sew the circles together.,
Hang up your garland.",How to Make a Paper Garland2," cardstock is a bit thicker and more durable than regular paper and will make your garland look more elegant. To create a fun and eye-catching garland, choose paper with a variety of designs, from pink and purple polka dots to striped or checkered green paper. Just pick a few patterns that will look good together. You can throw in some solid paper for variety.

, Cut each piece of paper into 3-5 strips, depending on how big you want your circles to be. It will be easier to cut the circles if you cut the paper into strips first.








, The garland will look best if the circles are a few different sizes. Cut circles that are at least three different sizes -- anywhere from a 3 inch to a 6 inch (7.6 cm to 15.2 cm) diameter will do. You don't have to use each color of paper equally, and you don't have to cut the same amount of each size of circle.









The easiest way to cut the circles is to use a circular punch; you can also just trace a circular pattern on the back of each piece of paper and cut it with scissors.

, Lay down the circles in the order that you'd like them to appear on the garland. If you'd like to create a double-sided garland, then place the bottoms of two circles with the same size and pattern together. Lay them out in a way that creates variety and is visually appealing.


Place this pattern near your sewing machine so you'll be easily able to feed it.

, Pick a fun-colored thread for holding the garland together, such as red, and run a straight stitch down the center of each circle. Just place the first circle into the machine, place the needle down, and turn on the machine. Then continue to feed each circle into the machine, followed by the next one in the pattern you've chosen, until they are all connected by the thread. You can leave a few inches or centimeters between each circle, or spread them apart further or closer together.









They don't need to be evenly spaced or sown right down the middle. As long as the circles are connected and catch the eye, you'll have a spectacular paper garland.
Make an end stitch on the last circular shape.

, Once you've created your garland, you can just hang it up by sticking a few thumbtacks in the wall and draping the thread over them. For more sturdiness, you can use nails for the same purpose. You can also drape the garlands over trees or furniture.

Shape the leaves.,
Create a pattern with the petals and leaves.,
Thread a needle through the shapes.,
Add a small pompom (or beads) in the middle of the flower.








,
Hang up your garland.",How to Make a Paper Garland3," You'll need a few different colors to create the flower petals, and any shade of green to create the leaves. You can pick whatever colors are the most fun and visually appealing, but reds, yellows, or oranges will all look great. Text weight paper is a bit heavier than normal paper and will be easy to shape and curl. You should use 2-3 pieces of green paper -- the rest will be used for the flowers.

, Create a template of a few different flowers with connected petals, and then trace this shape onto the paper designated for the petals. Then, create a template of a few different patterns with leaves and trace them onto the green paper. These patterns can be of any size, but the flowers should ideally be about the size of your hand, and the leaves should be about the size of three of your fingers.








, Use a sharp pair of scissors to cut each of the patterns out of the paper. You should have around twenty-five flowers and ten leaves by now.








, Use a pair of scissors to curl the edges of the paper, just as you would curl ribbon. Just run the petals over the edge of the scissors until they curl. For variety, you can have some of the petals curling inward and some curling outward -- just alternate between curling the front of the paper and the back.








, Fold the leaves in half to create a line along the middle of the leaves, and then curl them inward using the scissors. This will add texture and dimension to the leaves.








, Now place the flowers and leaves in a horizontal pattern that would create an eye-catching garland. The leaves will appear to the sides of the petals and don't need to alternate between each flower. You can repeat a pattern of colors or just arrange them at random.

, Run baker's twine or very thick thread through a large needle, and use the needle to poke holes in the center of each petal and leaf. Then, run the threaded needle through the holes until you've connected all of the shapes with the thread. When you've run the thread through all of the shapes, just cut the thread and tie it in thick knots at both ends to hold the patterns together.








,, Now that you've created your stunning paper flower garland, you can hang it up by draping it over trees or other outdoor furniture, or hanging it on nails or thumb-tacks inside your home. You can wrap the garland around a banister or the trunk of a tree.

Cut petals out of construction paper.,
Create a unique center for the flower.,
Find the perfect ""stem."",
Connect the petals with the stem.,
Add leaves to the stem.,
Finished.








",How to Make a Paper Flower1," Pick a piece of construction paper that's nice and sturdy and a bright and happy color, like yellow. Use scissors to cut at least six petals that are at least four inches long. If you like, you can lightly draw the petal shape with a pencil and then cut around the inside of the shape to avoid pencil marks. You can also use one of the petals as a template to cut the rest of the petals, or create six slightly unique shapes -- after all, the petals on a real flower aren't the exact same length, either.









If you want to give a little extra texture to the petals, you can roll them around a pencil to make them curl upwards.
You can also consider using tissue paper for the petals, or using a mix of tissue paper and actual petals.
If you'd like to create less of a 3-D effect, then you can just cut one flower shape with all of the six petals connected at the center.;
, The center of the flower can be anything your heart desires -- you can use a piece of candy, some beads, or even a picture of a special someone. You can also just cut out a circle from a different color of construction paper. You can even create a three-dimensional center by wadding one piece of tissue paper into a ball and wrapping a second one around it while gathering its edges at the bottom to create a rounded top.









Once you've selected your center, arrange all of the petals together in a flower-like circle.
Use a glue gun, regular glue, or glue-stick to glue the center to the rest of the petals. This should secure all of the petals together and should create a nice flower-like shape.
If your center is relatively small, you can also consider glueing the petals together before you put the center on for extra reinforcement.

, Find a thin stick in your backyard, use a wooden chopstick, buy a ""stem"" from a craft store, or take an ordinary straw and paint it brown. The stem should be proportional to the flower, so hold them up together to make sure the stem isn't too long or too short.









Using a real stick may be the most authentic move, but keep in mind that it won't be as clean as something you can find at home, and that it may be harder to attach it to leaves or petals.

, To connect the flower with the stem, you can use tape, glue, or even a stapler. If the petals of the flower are separated, you can pinch them around the center of the stem and then wrap tape around the petals and the stem to make sure they stay. You can also use a hot glue gun to connect just a bit of construction paper with the stem and petals to hold them together.









If you don't like the taped look, you can even paint over the tape with a color that matches your flower so it blends in more.

, To create leaves, you can just cut them out of paper and even draw veins on them with brown marker, get fake leaves at a craft store, or even try using green feathers. To attach them to your stem, you can use tape, a stapler (if the stem is a straw), or even try a bit of glue.









If you like the flower, consider making an entire paper-flower bouquet. This can be a great addition to your home or office.

Gather your materials.,
Decorate the paper.,
Trace out one circle for each umbrella you plan on making.,
Fold your umbrellas.,
Scallop the edges.,
Cut down the center of one crease.,
Fold one panel under the other.,
Stick a wooden skewer through each umbrella.",How to Make a Paper Umbrella2," You will need sturdy paper, wooden skewers, clear tape, scissors, and a writing utensil.If you'd like to customize your umbrellas by decorating the paper, you will also need some type of media to decorate with. Rubber stamps and non-toxic ink are a great choice.


Paper of medium thickness, such as construction paper, works best. However, thinner paper like printer or origami paper or thicker paper like cardstock can also work. Tissue paper, however, is much too thin.
Decorative patterned paper and stationary will look great.
These little umbrellas are great for decorating drinks.

, If you'd like, decorate one side of the paper using pens, stamps, or some other media. Matching the decorations to the theme is great if you're making these for a party. If you have a printer that can print on thick paper, try printing out patterns. If you will be using these umbrellas to decorate anything edible, avoid using materials like glitter that may fall off into your food and drink.

, Using a coaster or the bottom of a glass tumbler as a guide, trace non-overlapping circles onto the undecorated side of your paper. Cut out each circle using your scissors., Fold the circle in half and then unfold it. Make sure the decorated side of your paper is facing out. Fold it in half again to create a crease that is perpendicular but folded in the same direction as the first. Create a third crease in the same manner, this time with a diagonal through the first two creases. Do this for a total of eight creases creating 16 equal slices within the circle.Repeat this folding pattern for each umbrella.

, Using your scissors, cut out a small almond shape from the edge of each of the 16 wedges. This will mimic the folded panels of a real umbrella. Do this for each of your paper circles., Select one crease and cut half of it, making a slit from the edge to the center. This step is necessary to create an umbrella that holds its shape. Repeat this for each umbrella., At the site of the slit, take the section on the left and bring it underneath so that the panel to the right overlaps it. Lay a small piece of tape flat down the underside of the umbrella to hold the two sides together together. Repeat this step for each umbrella., If you have trouble getting it through, use a toothpick or pen to make a tiny hole first. Don't make it too big or the umbrella will slide too far down its handle.


If you don't have wooden skewers, you can use plastic ones or long toothpicks instead. Either one will be easier to poke through the paper.Stick the bottom of the umbrella handle into drinks or food to create a festive atmosphere.

Place the flowers in a vase.",How to Make a Paper Flower2," If you want the flower to look more dynamic, make sure that each piece of paper is a different color. Pick colors that will look good together, like red, purple, and yellow. If you pick colors that are too similar, like dark blue and purple, then they'll blend in together. For a more sturdy flower, you can use construction paper, and for a more loose, flowing flower you can use origami paper.








, Cut a large and small-sized flower from every paper. Follow the same or a similar design for each flower. You can just cut an ordinary flower with four or five petals. If you create three stencils in advance, you can use them to trace the same two shapes onto each paper.









When you're done, just combine a large and small flower of a different color, placing the large flower below the small flower. Fan out the petals so they don't overlap too much. You should have three flowers made of two different colors.

, First, create a small hole in the center of the flowers using a very thin pair of scissors or a pin. Stick the pipe cleaner through so that a very small amount, less than 1/2 an inch (~1.3cm) is sticking out through the top of the flower. The pipe cleaner will be the stem of the flower, so you can pick a fun color that will look nice with the petals.









To keep the pipe cleaner in place in the center of the flower, you can bend the top so it's too big to go back through the hole, or attach a bead or a button so the flower doesn't come off.

, Pick a floral perfume to make the paper flowers smell like real flowers. Make sure to spray it far enough away so you don't end up soaking the flowers.








, Create a nice bouquet with the flowers and place them in a brightly-colored vase. If they look lonely, make some more flowers to keep them company.

Add your handles.",How to Make a Paper Bag," Depending on what kind of paper bag you want to make, you want to keep in mind what you want it to look like, how sturdy it is, and whether or not you'd like it to have a handle.


You'll need scissors, glue, a ruler, and a pencil to help you assemble the bag
Coloured or patterned craft paper is ideal for this project. It's thicker material helps to keep the bag sturdy and allow it to bear more weight inside. Craft paper comes in all designs and colours.
Wrapping paper or newspaper is good material to use if you have something more delicate in mind.
A thin piece of rope or ribbon works to create a handle.
Gather materials like stencils, feathers, glitter, paint, and colouring pens and crayons to decorate your bag.;
, Use a ruler to measure out the dimensions and a light pencil to stencil out the shape. Or you can cut a rectangle of any size.









Save yourself some time by using the naturally straight edges of your paper. If your piece of paper is the right size, cut your paper bag from the corner instead of in the middle of your material.

, In some cases, decorating your bag before assembling it is much easier. If you're making a pattern, or painting the bag in a different colour, it's easier to decorate with a flat piece of paper to ensure your pattern and colour remain the same throughout.


Decorate only one side of the paper. You can decorate both sides if you would like to show off a fun pattern inside the bag or to cover up unsightly materials, especially if you're using newspaper.

, Make sure to place it in “landscape” orientation or long sides up and down, short sides to the left and right.


If you have decorated your paper, make sure the decorations are dry and faced down.

, When you’re done, unfold. This end will later become the bottom of the bag.








, To do this, you can either calculate the center points with a ruler or fold your paper to find its center. There are three points you will have to mark:









Maintaining a landscape orientation, bring the short sides together as though you were folding the whole thing in half, and pinch the top and bottom of the would-be fold to mark where the center of each long side is. Lightly mark these spots with a pencil.
Mark the paper again a half inch (13 mm) to both the left and right of each center point. When you’re done, you should have six marks total: three in the center of one long edge of your paper and three on the other.

, Be sure to maintain the landscape orientation as you work to fold the sides as follows:









Bring the right edge of the paper to the left-most pencil lines and fold. Once the fold is properly creased, unfold. Repeat the inverse on the opposite side.
Flip the paper over, re-fold the left and right sides downward toward the center, and glue them where they overlap. Be sure to fold along the same lines as before (but note that the folds will be inverted). Let the glue dry completely before moving on to the next step.

, Make sure to orient it so that one of the open ends points toward you.








, You will be make the sides of the bag so that it opens up as a rectangle.









With your ruler, measure inwards about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) from the left-hand side of the bag. Lightly mark this with your pencil.
Push the left side-crease of the bag inwards toward the interior of the bag. Do this until the left-hand mark you made in the previous step sits on the outer edge of where the paper is bending.
Press-fold the paper downwards so that the pencil mark lines up with the new folded edge. Try to keep the top and bottom edges symmetrical as you press the paper down.
Repeat on the right-hand side. When you’re done, the body of the bag should fold inwards on either side just like a grocery-shopping bag.

, To determine which end is the bottom, look for the crease lines you folded previously that mark the bottom of the bag. Keep the bag flattened for now and prepare the bottom:









Fold and glue the bottom of the bag into place. Once you've determined where the bottom of your bag is, piece together the bottom:
Fold the bag 4 inches (10 cm) up from the bottom and crease it along this line.
Keeping the rest of the bag flattened, prop open up the bottom of the bag. The inward-flaring creases should pop open, forming a square edge. Inside, you should see a triangle of folded paper on either side.

, You will be folding a few sides to the center, using their triangular shape to ensure the bottom of the bag is evenly put together.









Fold the left and right sides of the open, square-shaped bottom completely down. Use the outermost edge of each interior triangle as a guide. When you’re done, the bottom area should have 8 sides like an elongated octagon instead of 4 sides like it had before.
Fold the bottom strip of the “octagon” upwards towards the center of the bottom of the bag.
Fold the top strip of the “octagon” downwards towards the center of the bottom of the bag. The bottom should now be neatly folded shut; glue the edges where they overlap and let dry.

, Make sure the bottom is completely closed off and that there are no gaps in the glued edges.








, You can ribbon, rope, or string to make the handles or you can leave your bag as is without handles, but handles are harder and take more time.









Hold the two top of your bag closed and use a hole puncher or pencil to make 2 holes at the top of your bag. Don't punch your holes too close to the edge of the bag or the weight of your bag plus anything inside it could break the handle.
Reinforce the holes by lining the hole's edges using clear tape or glue.
Slide the ends of your handle string through the holes and make a knot on your handle string on the inside of the bag. Make sure the knot is big enough so it doesn't slide through the hole. You may have to tie another knot over the existing knot to increase its size. The knot keeps the handle in place.

scissors
pencil
glue stick
a needle
thread
three beads
a wooden stick;
, The pattern provides a guide to help you create the shapes that you need for the mobile pieces. You can print out this pattern and use it to trace the design onto your card stock.


You can download the pattern at: http://anadiycrafts.com/decorative-mobile/


, Take all of your card stock pieces and fold them in half so that the shorter edges meet. Then, use your pencil to trace the pattern design onto the card stock so that the edges of the design line up with the folded edge.When choosing card stock colors, consider the color scheme that you hope to achieve. For example, if the room where you plan to place the mobile is painted blue, then you might consider using different shades of blue, such as light blue, aqua, and navy.
Or, you could also go for a complementary color (one that sits opposite the color on a color wheel). For example, a yellow room would be complemented by shades of purple., After you have traced the pattern design onto all of the shapes, cut along these lines with your scissors. When you are finished, you should end up with two pieces: a heart shape with no center and a smaller circle shape.Make sure that you do not cut along the folded edge.

, Use your glue stick to secure the edges of six of the heart shapes first. Apply glue to just one edge of one of your heart shapes and then press it against the edge of a different heart shape to secure it.Repeat this process for the other four pieces so that you connect the heart shapes into one unit.
You can alternate colors as desired to achieve the look that you want for your mobile.

, Glue together the edges of the circle pieces as well. You may need to trim these up slightly before you start gluing them to make sure that the circle units will fit inside of the heart units with a little space around the edges.The circle units will be made up of only three circle pieces instead of six, but you will follow the same process.
Make sure that you leave one edge of each of your units unglued. This is necessary so that you can connect these edges around the string later.

, Next, take your needle and thread a piece of string through it. Make sure that the string is long enough to hold the large heart unit and a circle unit with some space in between them. You can always trim the string down later if it is too long.Secure a bead to one end of the string and tie it off so that it will not fall off of the string. This bead will be at the bottom of each of the large paper mobile pieces to keep them from falling off of the string.

, Next, take one of your small circle units and your heart shaped units. Place the small circle unit inside the open center area of the heart shaped unit. Make sure that both units have their unglued side facing up.Then, place the string across the center of these units so that the bead is at the bottom of the heart shaped unit.
When everything is lined up the way that you want it to be, glue the edges of the circle unit first and then glue the edges of the heart shaped unit to secure these pieces around the string.
You will also be gluing a circular unit a few inches above your heart shaped unit. Glue it in the same way as you glued the others.

, After you have glued a heart-shaped unit and two circular units to your string, you will have completed one of the three pieces of your paper mobile. To finish your paper mobile, you will need to create two more of these pieces.Repeat the process of gluing one heart-shaped unit and two circular units to a piece of string with a bead at the end two more times. You will have three of these pieces when you are done.

, Apply a small amount of glue to the edge of one end of your stick and then start wrapping string around it. Keep coiling the string around your stick until you have covered the whole stick in string. Place a little more glue at the end of the stick to help secure the string.Tie the string around the end as well and then take the remainder of the string and tie this piece of string to other end of the stick. You can use this loop to hang your mobile.
Cut off any excess string after you secure the end.
A wooden dowel also works for this project. You could even double up your sticks or dowels, add a couple more units and crisscross the sticks to make a larger mobile., To complete your mobile, tie the ends of each of the three pieces of string to your stick. Tie one piece to the center of your stick and make sure that the mobile units dangle down a little ways. Then, tie one end of the string to each of the stick ends and make sure that these pieces are a little higher than the center piece. The two end pieces should also line up with each other.After you have secured each piece of string, you can cut off the excess.

Turn it over.",How to Make a Paper Dagger1," It shouldn't be too stiff because it needs to fold easily. Also, if you are new to folding origami, you should start with a larger piece of paper.;
, The pretty side of the paper should be facing the table. It doesn't matter if you're using a plain sheet of paper, though a two-sided sheet can make the folds easier to see. Also, begin with the paper making a square in front of you, not turned like a diamond., Match the top corners with the bottom corners, and then make a crease in the middle. Unfold the paper again., Match up the left side corners with the right side corners. Make a crease down the center. Unfold again.At this point, the paper should be the same size you started with but with creases down the middle going horizontally and vertically.

, The pretty side should now be facing up., Fold it down from the top left corner to the bottom right corner, matching up the sides. Create a diagonal crease. Unfold it., Fold the paper from the bottom left corner up to the upper right corner, creasing along the diagonal again. Unfold it.At this point, you should still have the original square but with vertical and horizontal folds on one side and diagonal folds on the other.

, Turn the paper 45 degrees so that one of the points is facing up. You should have a diamond facing you now., Fold in each side of the diamond until the outside corner is touching the center of the diamond. Crease them, and keep them folded.You now have a small square in the center with a triangle on the top and bottom.

, The backside should be facing up now., Make a vertical crease that pulls each side into to the center line. You're making the whole shape skinnier.The points of the side triangles should flip around as you fold in the sides.

, The points that flipped around with the fold should be sticking out. Fold them into the center point, creasing along the side.You should now have four diamonds surrounded by triangles pointing inward.

, Tuck the bottom under the top rather than the other way around, called a mountain fold., Pull out the bottom half, and halfway between the crease you made in the last step and the bottom of the same diamond, fold the paper the other way. You are creating what's called a valley fold. You are essentially making a small tuck in the paper., For the handle, you make a squash fold.You'll make valley folds from where you tucked the paper down to the bottom of the paper. Next, make small mountain folds that run diagonal from the side tips of the small diamonds at the tuck to the outer edges; these should only be as long as the bottom tip of the small diamond created by the tuck. You'll also be unfolding part of the tuck. Pull in the sides of the handle along the valley folds, using the mountain folds as a guide to flatten out part of the tuck. Flatten the creases. You should have a passable handle now.,, Fold up the small triangle at the bottom of the handle to create a straight edge., Above the handle, you should see a small diamond. Create a mountain fold at the top of the diamond horizontally and a valley fold horizontally at the middle. You are making another layer above the handle through folding, so the bottom of the fold should line up with the top of the handle. Crease the fold., Fold vertical valley folds along the blade that line up with the handle. Create small diagonal mountain folds at the bottom corners of the blade that fold down the corners. Folding in the valley folds to meet in the middle, flatten out the triangles at the bottom as part of the crossguard of the dagger., The dagger is done."

Have the petals taper into a skinny tab at the bottom so that you can secure them more easily.;
, If you used crepe paper, you can gently pull the petals apart at the center to widen them.If you used tissue paper, you can fold the petals over a toothpick or skewer lengthwise to create a slight crease.Make the petals more realistic by cutting a notch into the tip

, Begin by cutting a 1 to 2-inch (2.54 to 5.08-centimeter) tall rectangle from green tissue paper or crepe paper. Next, cut a jagged, grass-like fringe into one of the long edges.This will make the base of the daisy and help cover up the bottom part of the petals.


Plan on making the rectangle about 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) long. You can always trim it down later if it's too long.

, Begin by folding a piece of green tissue or crepe paper in half. Cut a half-oval out of it, then cut notches into the curved edge of the oval. Unfold the oval to reveal your leaf.You can make as many leaves as you want. 2 to 3 would be ideal, however.

, The ball needs to be proportionate to your flower; something around 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) in diameter would work for most flowers. You can also roll some aluminum foil to a teardrop shape instead.For a more realistic center, gently flatten the curbed part of the teardrop.

, If the teardrop is loose, pull it off, fill the hole with glue, then push it onto the wire again. Make sure that the wire doesn't pop out of the top part of the tear drop.


If you can't find any wire stems, you can paint a skewer green and use that instead. Don't use regular wire or pipe cleaners.

, You don't have to do this if you used a Styrofoam ball, but you might want to if you used aluminum foil. Paint the teardrop with glue first, then dip it into ground rice.Let the glue dry, then seal it with another coat of glue.


You only need to coat the top part of the teardrop.
If you can't find ground rice, try something else that has a grainy texture, such as ground/steel cut oatmeal or ground buckwheat.

, You may need to add a few coats of paint to completely cover the base material. Let each coat of paint dry before adding the next one., Apply some glue to the side of the teardrop, from the bottom point up to where it starts to curve into a dome. Press your first petal, tabbed side down, into the glue. Continue gluing the petals, one by one, until you complete your first row.Hot glue sets quickly, so work only one petal at a time.

, If you look at your teardrop, you will see some gaps between the petals. Fill those gaps with glue, then press more petals into the glue., Coat the bottom portion of the teardrop with glue. Wrap the fringe around it, with the jagged side facing up. The bottom edge should extend past the bottom of the tear drop and onto the stem.Cut off any excess fringe hanging off the side.

, Gently pinch the bottom part of the fringe, then twist it slightly around the wire. If you need to, secure the twisted part to the wire with a strip of florist's tape., Begin wrapping from the base of the fringe, where the pinched/twisted part is. Continue wrapping all the way to the bottom of the stem., Place the bottom point of the leaf against the stem and pinch it. Give it a slight twist, then secure it with green florist's tape.Repeat this step for all of the leaves you made. You can have them as close together or as far apart as you want.

, Some daisies are open all the way while others are closed. You can leave your daisy closed, if you want to, or you can gently pull down on the petals to open it up."

If the paper is too thick to cut all at once, draw a template first, trace it onto the paper, then cut the shapes out individually.
If you don't know how to draw a cactus, you can use a stencil or find a template online.
You can use any type of paper you want, such as cardstock or construction. You can even paint regular paper green beforehand or used patterned scrapbooking paper.;
, Keep the cacti stacked, and fold them in half lengthwise. Next, take one of the cacti, and fold it in half, lengthwise, the other way to create a mirror fold., Unfold the mirrored cactus. Coat the outer part of it with glue. If you think of it as a card, the outside of the ""card"" is the part that gets the glue., Unfold the remaining two cacti. Align them with the matching halves on the glue-covered cactus. Press them together, and let the glue dry. If you need to, trim off any excess, overlapping paper with a pair of scissors., An easy way to create spikes is to draw x or * shapes. You can also draw short, tapering lines instead. Let the paint dry before moving on.

No paint? Use a white paint pen, crayon, or colored pencil instead.

, Cut some pink tissue paper into small squares. Scrunch the squares over the end of a pencil or pen to create a cupped flower shape. Glue the tip of the flower to the top of your cactus.Don't like pink? Try red, white, yellow, or orange instead.

, You can use any type of flower pot you'd like. Terracotta would be a great choice, but porcelain would also work. You can even use a small bowl or tea cup!

Save space by filling the pot with crumpled foil or paper, or a block or foam.
If your flower pot has a hole in the bottom, glue a piece of paper over it from the inside. This will keep the ""soil"" from leaking out.

, Gently push it into the sand, rice, or pebbles. If you used larger rocks, you can hot glue the cactus to the largest one you have."

, Use scissors or a craft knife to cut out the dagger you created.

, Use the dagger as a template, tracing it onto other sheets of paper. You'll need at least ten sheets, though you may want more for a sturdier design.


To make this process simpler, you can simply print out the same design of a dagger over and over.
You can use whatever kind of paper you want for this project, though medium weight is probably best. You can even make a dagger out of book pages.

, Cut out each dagger with scissors or a craft knife.

, Align each dagger, and use paper glue to glue them together. Make sure to smooth out each layer so you don't get wrinkles. Add as many layers as you want until you get your desired thickness and sturdiness.

, Trim up any edges that are sticking out from the dagger.

, Place the dagger between two parchment paper sheets, and put it under something heavy. Leave it to dry overnight.

Cut it out just inside the line that you drew. Wedge the foam disk into the pot, ¾ inch (1.91 centimeter) from edge.If you'd like to paint your flower pot, do it before adding the foam disk.
If the disk is very loose, secure it with some glue around the edges.

, Press down on the eggs as you roll them. This will help you create a pill or capsule shape, and make it more cactus-like.If you can't find any Styrofoam eggs, you can buy some Styrofoam balls, and saw down the sides instead.

For a more natural-looking cactus, try to use small, medium, and large eggs.
For a small, simple cactus, use just one egg.

, Insert 1 to 2 toothpicks into the narrower end of each egg. Press the toothpick end of one egg into the side of another egg. Keep doing this until you have assembled your cactus. The toothpicks will act as anchors and help keep your cactus together.Put the smaller eggs on top, and the largest one at the bottom.
Avoid making your cactus too big, especially if you are using a small flower pot.

, Insert two toothpicks into the bottom of your cactus. Coat the disk with a layer of glue, and press the cactus into it., Mix 1 cup (100 grams) of all-purpose flour and 1 cup (240 milliliters) of cold water in a bowl. Consider adding 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 grams) of salt to prevent mold.Stir everything together with a spoon.

You can also make papier mâché glue by mixing equal parts of white school glue and water., Gather some soft paper, such as newspaper or newsprint. Tear it into different sized strips, about ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) wide and 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) long.

It might be tempting to cut the paper, but tearing it is actually much better because it allows the paper to blend together more smoothly.

, Press the paper against the cactus, and smooth it out with your fingers. Keep applying strips in a similar fashion.

As you move on to your second layer, you may not even need to use any glue.
Use smaller pieces of paper on the curves and seams.

, Cut the ends off of several toothpicks down to 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Poke the toothpicks, flat-end-first, into your cactus at random.Try to do this while the papier mâché is still wet and pliable.

If it is too hard to insert the toothpicks, poke holes into the cactus with a skewer first, then insert the toothpicks.
Add a drop of glue at the end of each spike before inserting it to help it stick.

, This may take a few hours to even overnight, depending on the conditions in your home. The cactus will dry faster if it is warm and dry. You can help speed up the drying process by setting it out in the hot sun., You can paint it using acrylic paint or tempera paint. For a smoother finish, paint the cactus with primer or gesso first.You can use one shade of green, or several different shades for a more natural look.

Consider sealing your cactus afterwards with a an acrylic spray sealer. This will make your work last longer.

, Cut squares out of pink tissue paper, then scrunch them over the end of a pen or pencil to create a cupped flower. Glue the base of each flower to your cactus.

Don't want pink flowers? Try red, orange, yellow, or white.

, To prevent the ""soil"" from getting all over the place, paint the disk around the cactus with glue, then sprinkle your desired soil on top."

If you feel confident enough with your artistic abilities, you can draw the parts freehand using a pencil before cutting them out. Keep in mind that four of the orange triangles will need to be used for ridges on the back when determining the size.;
, Apply glue to the back of each piece using a glue stick. Stick the other side of the glue onto a piece of thin cardboard or sturdy cardstock.


For thin cardboard, consider recycling materials like cereal boxes, snack boxes, or notebook covers.
You need to mount the paper onto cardboard or cardstock in order to make the dinosaur sturdier. If you skip this step, the finished product might be too thin and flimsy and may fall apart quickly.

, Once the glue has dried, use your scissors to carefully re-cut each piece from the cardboard.


Note that no cardboard should be visible from beneath your original construction paper body parts.

, You to mark four holes on the dinosaur body using a pencil, pen, or marker. One hole will need to be for the head, another one for the tail, and the last two for the legs.


If using the pre-made pattern mentioned previously, mark the holes according to the marks on the pattern.
If you are using freehand pieces, mark two holes about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) from the edge along the bottom of the oval. One should be near the front and one should be near the back. Mark another hole 1 inch (2.5 cm) in from the upper left side for the head and another hole 1 inch (2.5 cm) in from the upper right side for the tail.

, Lay the dinosaur body flat on your working surface. Slide the head, tail, and leg pieces slightly under the body piece just below the corresponding holes. Use a pen or sharp pencil to poke a hole straight through the paper and cardboard of the body piece at each marked hole.


Note that you should not permanently attach the limbs to the body at this time.
Each limb piece (head, tail, legs) should only slide under the dinosaur body by about 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm).
When you poke holes through the body, you should use enough force to make indentations on the limbs lying beneath the body.

, Pull the head, tail, and leg pieces out from beneath the dinosaur body. Use a pen or pencil to poke holes through the indentations made previously.

, Slide a metal paper fastener through the dinosaur body in the hole corresponding to the head. Fit the hole of the head piece through the back of the fastener from the behind the body. Flatten the fastener edges to secure the two pieces of paper together.


Repeat this procedure with the tail and two legs.
The limbs should always go behind the body, not on top of it.
When you flatten the fasteners, leave enough of a gap so that the limbs can still move around when minimal force is applied.

, Position four of your five orange spikes along the back of the dinosaur. Glue in place using white craft glue or a glue stick.


As with the limbs, these spikes should be attached from the back of the body, not the front.

, Cut the remaining orange triangle into six small rectangles. Glue three of these rectangles on one leg and the other three on the other leg.

, Use white craft glue to glue the back of a medium craft eye to the dinosaur head. Let dry.


At the conclusion of this step, your Movable dinosaur is now complete.

Draw and cut out the body of a dinosaur.,
Cut out spikes.,
Cut out two sets of legs.,
Mount the paper to cardboard.,
Cut slits into the body, legs, and spikes.,
Attach the pieces along the slits.",How to Make a Paper Dinosaur2," Sketch out the shape of a dinosaur body, including the torso, tail, neck, and head. Use scissors to cut out the body.


Simpler body designs often work better than more complex outlines for this project. Do not include any spikes or details.
The legs should not be included in this outline, either.
Draw the body freehand. If you need help, look at a reference picture or print a free dinosaur pattern and trace everything but the spikes and legs. Free patterns can be found at:

http://www.firstpalette.com/tool_box/printables/dinosaur-jurassic.html
http://printables.scholastic.com/shop/prcontent/Dinosaur-Patterns/9780439503785-026
http://www.freeapplique.com/dinosaurpatterns.html



, The number of spikes will vary based on your design. Usually, though, 10 to 12 spikes is a sufficient amount.


Each spike should be shaped like a diamond.
The spikes should all be somewhat similar in size but should not be precisely even. Ideally, the spikes you plan on positioning toward the head and tail should be slightly smaller than those you plan on using in the middle. Make the largest spike no bigger than the head of the dinosaur.

, Draw two upside-down ""U"" shapes. Make each one roughly as wide as the neck of your dinosaur, if not a little wider. Cut the pieces out with scissors.


Note that the curved end will be positioned at the top. The bottom ends of each piece should be as flat and straight as possible.

, Apply white craft glue or a glue stick to the back of each piece of construction paper. Press a piece of cardboard or heavy cardstock onto the exposed side of the glue. Let everything dry, then cut out your pieces again with the cardboard attached.


The cardboard you use should be about the same thickness you would expect to find with a standard cardboard box.
If you do not back the paper, your dinosaur may not be sturdy enough to actually stand on its own.
Note that your dinosaur will only be decorated from one side if you follow this method precisely. If you want the dinosaur to be decorated from all sides, you will need to cut duplicates of each body, leg, and spike piece and glue those duplicates onto the exposed back of the cardboard.

, You need to cut slits into the bottom of each spike and in the top curved portion of each leg set. You should also cut slits into the dinosaur body at the spots where the legs and spikes will connect.


Cut a slit halfway into the curved portion of each leg set.
Cut a slit into the bottom half of each spike.
Lay the dinosaur body flat. Mark the placement of the legs on the body using a pencil. Arrange the spikes above the body to get an idea of where each one should go, then mark each place with pencil. Cut a slit along each mark, but make sure that no slit in the body is longer than the slit in the corresponding leg or spike piece.

, Turn the leg portions so that they are now perpendicular with the dinosaur body. Slide the slit of the front leg portion into the front leg slit on the dinosaur body; repeat with the other leg portion. Follow the same procedure with each spike as you place them along the back of the dinosaur.


You should not need to glue or tape the pieces in place. They should remain snug enough on their own.
Check your dinosaur. At this point, the dinosaur should be able to stand on its own. If not, try bending the tips of each leg forward into a flat foot, since doing so will provide a larger and more secure surface to support the rest of the dinosaur.
At the conclusion of this step, your standing dinosaur should now be complete.

Done.",How to Make a Miniature Paper Cake from Scrap Paper," You can use newspapers, tissue paper, pages of notebook or any other paper. Tear it into small pieces. Keep the torn pieces inside a small bowl or a plastic glass.;
,, Mix the ingredients well. This is very similar to making a real cake, where the paper acts as flour, water as the eggs and talcum powder as baking powder!


The amount of talcum powder depends on how much paper mixture there is. Add gradually, until a good paste like consistency has been formed.

, This will help the observer to guess at the flavor of the cake. For example, orange color for orange cake, brown for chocolate cake and white for vanilla cake. This will act as food colouring.

, For example, you could use a heart shape mould, a circle mould or a square mold, depending on the person you're giving the paper cake to.

,, For best results Let it dry for four complete days. Do not take out the mixture from the mould before three days have passed.

, Take a health drink packet and cut the bottom edge in the shape of one fourth of a circle. Wrap a rubber band or a thread around to close the bag. Make a small hole at the tip of the bag.

, Then mix it all together well. Choose the poster color according to the color of the cake, or according to your preference.

, Close the bag with either a rubber band or thread.

, Create beautiful patterns on the cake. Let the cream dry for 1-2 days.

, Once the cream has dried on the cake, you can add additional decorative elements if wished, or leave it as it is. Once everything has dried completely, the cake is ready to give as a gift or use as a decoration. It's delicate, so be sure to place it on something firm, such as a plate for display or inside a little box for gifting.

Printer paper works fine and is cheap and available.
Cardstock will hold its shape better and last longer, but it is also more expensive.
Paper plates are a good alternative material with more strength than printer paper., Locate an image of a skeleton to use as a model. You can find printable skeletons on-line.


A cartoon skeleton will be easier to work with than a very detailed scientific picture.

, Separate out the parts of the skeleton that will make up your paper skeleton. Each part will be made out of one piece of paper, Cardstock, or paper plate.


Skull (head)
Rib cage
Pelvis
2 Upper-arm bones
2 Lower-arm bones with hands
2 Upper-leg bones
2 Lower-leg bones with feet

, The arms have two parts, an upper and a lower arm. Use one piece of paper or Cardstock for each part of the arm. Trace the printed skeleton picture, or use the picture as a guide to draw the bones on paper.


For a basic skeleton, draw out two cartoon bone shapes. Use one for the upper arm and one, with a hand on it, for the lower arm.
For a more anatomically correct skeleton, note that the arm has more than two bones in it. Follow a more detailed model and outline more detailed shapes or draw details on the parts of the arm. The upper arm has one bone, the humerus. The lower arm has the radius and the ulna. The hand has many bones in it.For a detailed skeleton, draw these

, Use scissors to cut around the outlines of the arms.

, The legs are similar to the arms. They have two main sections, an upper leg and a lower leg. Once you have created the leg bones, cut them out.


For a basic skeleton, draw out two cartoon bone shapes. Use one for the upper leg and one, with a foot on it, for the lower leg.
For a more detailed skeleton, note that the leg has more than two bones in it. Follow a more detailed model and outline more detailed shapes or draw details on the parts of the arm.The upper leg is called the femur; the lower leg bones are the tibia and fibula. The foot is made of many bones called the tarsals, metatarsals and phalanges.For a more anatomically correct skeleton, make the legs one and a half times the length of the arms.

, Use scissors to cut around the outlines of the legs.

, Follow the drawing to create the ribs and pelvis. Then cut them out.


To be anatomically correct, make 12 pairs of ribs.
For more detail draw shoulder blades, sockets, and collar bones near the top of the ribs.
For a detailed pelvis, include the sacrum and coccyx, two bones at the end of the spine.

, Draw a skull on paper and cut it out. Make sure to include eye sockets and a nose socket.


For a more detailed skull, draw a bottom jaw and teeth.

, Use a hole puncher to add holes to connect the parts of your skeleton.


If you don't have a hole puncher, use a scissor or a knife.
Punch one hole at the bottom of the skull.
Punch a hole at the top of the ribs to connect the skull and at the bottom of the ribs to connect the pelvis.
Punch one hole in the top of the pelvis.
Punch holes in the top and bottom of the upper arms and upper legs.
Punch holes at the top of the lower arms and lower legs.

, The skeleton parts can be attached to each other with loops of string or brass fasteners.


Brass fasteners can be found at office supply or craft stores.
String gives the skeleton a looser, dangly look. Brass fasteners can be fastened tightly to hold bones in particular positions.

, Fasten the skeleton pieces together using the brass fasteners or string.


The bottom of the skull connects to the top of the ribs.
The upper legs fasten to either side of the hip/pelvis bones.
The shoulder blades connect to the upper arms.
The lower arms connect to the upper arms and the lower legs connect to the upper legs.

,How to Make a Funnel or Cone from Paper1,
"
Make a paper disk.,
Draw a triangle wedge.,
Cut the triangle wedge out of the circle.,
Bring the cut sides of your disc together.,
Tape the inside of the cone closed.",How to Make a Funnel or Cone from Paper2," The height of your cone will be determined by the radius of your circle. The larger the radius, the taller the cone. You can print the template in the document above, and trace the shape onto the paper you want to use. If you choose to make your own disc, do your best to make the shape as round as possible.


Improper measurements will have a big effect on your cone's result. It's a good idea to put extra effort into making the circle as round as possible.
For your disk shape, you can also use a compass, or trace a round object, such as a lid or container.

, Use the template to cut out two sides from the circle to make your wedge. To draw your own wedge, make a mark in the center of the disc. Draw out two straight lines from the center point to make a wedge with your ruler. If the lines are closer together it will make a smaller wedge which will result in a cone with a broad bottom.


Use a compass protractor to pinpoint the centre of your disc if you're unsure where to place your dot. If you're using a protractor tool to outline the disc to begin with, it can save you time to make the centre dot before you trace the disc around it.
You can also draw your own triangle wedge using a ruler and pencil.

, To make a cone with a small bottom, cut out a larger triangle wedge. Use scissors or a precision knife to cut out your wedge as straight as possible. If you run into any cutting mishaps, you will probably need to start over again., For your cone shape, bring one cut end of your disc over to the other in a cone shape. Hold it together and make sure the lower ridge of both sides overlap evenly. With this, your disc should have the desired cone shape you're looking for.


Unfurl the paper and try again if the sides don't meet properly at first.
Don't make firm creases in your paper. Your cone should be rounded.

, Once you tape the two sides side by side so that the paper makes a cone. Tape the inside of the cone by bridging the two sides so that they slightly overlap and bridging the overlap with tape. With that done, your cone should be ready to go.

One straight piece of tape will give your cone the best stability. Multiple pieces of tape inside will make a mess. It is helpful to have one hand applying the tape while the other holds the shape of the cone.

Cut out a wide triangle.If the common disc method isn't to your liking, you can make a cone shape starting out with a paper triangle.,
Roll the far corners of your paper into the centre.Take one of the far corners and roll it into the centre so that the paper's edge is touching the middle of your triangle.,
Make adjustments to your cone.Unless the rolls were perfect, chances are you'll have to shift the paper around a bit in order to make the cone even.,
Fold the loose edges into the cone's opening.,
Tape the cone.",How to Make a Funnel or Cone from Paper3," In order for it to be rolled properly into a cone, there must be one long side, and two shorter sides of equal length. The bigger the triangle, the bigger your cone will be. Take care to make your measurements and cuts as accurate as possible.


Slight errors can make your cone lopsided, or, worse still, too short to tape around.
Similarly, you can make the same process work with a half-circle. A half-circle will result in a smoother top.If you don't want to make measurements yourself, triangle templates are available. Make sure you're using a template with one long side and two shorter sides of equal length., With your other hand, bring the other corner and roll it overtop so that it wraps around the other corner. When this is complete, you should have a general shape of a cone in place.


If you're having difficulty rolling the corners together, it may be that you didn't cut your triangle out wide enough.
The far corners are the opposite ends of the wide triangle.
Hold the first corner roll in place while you roll the other corner.One hand should be used for each corner.

, Tighten the rolled folds as necessary. If you think you rolled the two corner folds unevenly, feel free to try again.


If there are excess lengths of paper jutting out from the cone shape, it may be that your original sheet wasn't an even shape. If this is the case, you can keep moving forward by cutting off any excess with a precision knife. So long as you have an even base for your cone, people won't be able to notice mishaps you had in the process of making it.
It's a fairly quick process, so it pays to do it a few times until you get it right.

, Excess flaps of paper should be folded into the cone. This makes the cone look smother, and also helps the folds hold their form. If the rolls have been done correctly, there should at least be a triangular end that should be folded inward.If for whatever reason you don't have enough paper to fold over, you can get over this issue by running a strip of tape across the base, from the outside to the inside of your cone.
Try squeezing or loosening your grip on the cone if the folding slot isn't apparent enough.

, Although folding your loose edges should stabilize the cone's shape, taping the seam inside the cone will help ensure it holds. Take a strip of tape and line it up along the seam. If you think there's still a risk of it falling apart, take additional strips and line them across the top and middle of the seam. With taping done, you should have a functional cone.


The loose edge can be taped down as well.

Choose the right paper.,
Cut off the tip for a funnel.,
Draw a pattern on your cone.,
Look up ideas for added inspiration.There are countless ways you could go about decorating a paper cone.",How to Make a Funnel or Cone from Paper4," If you have a solid idea what you're making a cone for beforehand, it helps to consider the material you'll be using. Certain types of paper suit certain projects better than others.


Printer paper is fine for purely decorative cones. It offers a lot of potential to be coloured or drawn on.
A thick construction paper is best if you're making party hats.Parchment paper is a good choice if you're making a funnel to bake with.

, If you're making a cone for the sake of baking, a funnel is needed. Take a pair of scissors and cut the tip off. From that opening, you'll be able to control the pour of icing or syrup by squeezing the funnel.


If your funnel hole isn't big enough, you can try to cut it again. Keep in mind, however, that the higher you cut up the cone will result in an exponentially bigger funnel hole. It's best to keep your funnel cutting careful and restrained.

, If you're making a decorative cone or a party hat, it's fun to add a pattern. Take your favourite pencil crayons or markers and draw something. Patterns (like jagged edges or swirls) are best for a cone, but you can also draw words on it. For the sake of a party hat or dunce cap, writing a word (like ""Happy Birthday"") can help to specify the cone to the given occasion.


Draw a pattern in with pencil first if you're worried about making mistakes.
It may be easier to draw your pattern on the paper before you make it into a cone.

, Although you should try coming up with ideas yourself, it can be inspiring to look up creative projects other people have done. Experiment with different cone-making techniques. Decorate your cone with a fresh type of material. The possibilities with home crafts are endless.

Each ribbon should run diagonally from right-to-left or from left-to-right. Use a ruler to make sure the ribbons are spaced evenly.


Don't forget to pull the ribbons tight., To prevent the ribbons from moving, sew a button at each point where the ribbons cross. Flip the canvas over. You will see a knot of thread where you attached a button. To prevent these knots for slipping, place a dab of hot glue onto each knot. This will prevent the knots from unraveling. Once the hot glue is dry, you can start adding memories to your board."

, Glue guns work better when they are warmed up all the way. Make sure that you allow about 15 minutes for your glue gun to heat up. Otherwise the pieces may not stay in place when you glue them., You will need to cut piece from your foam board before you can make the jewelry box. You will need the following pieces:two 11cm by 2.7 cm pieces
two 17.7cm by 2.7cm pieces
one 16.7cm by 11 centimeter (4.3 in) piece
two 18cm by 12cm pieces
two 12cm by 7cm pieces
one 6cm by 3cm piece
one 19cm by 7cm piece
two 18cm by 3cm pieces
one 20cm by 13cm piece

, Take one of your 12cm by 7cm pieces and use your ruler to measure 3cm from the long edge. Then make a mark to show this point. Do the same on the other side of the piece and then connect the two dots so that you have a line on the piece that is 3cm from the long edge.Repeat this process with the other 12cm by 7cm piece and with your 19cm by 7cm. This line will serve as a guide for where to attach one of your 18cm by 12cm pieces.

, Take one of your 18cm by 12cm pieces and lay it down in front of you. Then, take one of your 12cm by 7cm pieces and glue it to the short edge of the 18cm by 12cm piece. Hold the glue gun close to the edge as you apply the glue or it may dry before it reaches the surface.Make sure that you keep the line that you drew on the piece facing inwards.Next, take your 19cm by 7cm piece and glue it to the long edge of your 18cm by 12cm piece. Make sure that the line you drew on the 19cm by 7cm piece is facing inwards.
Then, take your other 18cm by 12cm piece and glue it along the lines that you drew on the 12cm by 7cm and 19cm by 7cm pieces.
Next, take your other 12cm by 7cm piece and glue it to the short edges of your 18cm by 12cm pieces.
Last, take one of your 18cm by 3cm pieces and glue it to the other long edge of your upper 18cm by 12cm piece.

, After you have assembled the base of your jewelry box, you will need to line it with your baize or felt fabric. Cut the fabric to fit the upper shelf of your jewelry box that you have created. Use your glue stick to apply the fabric to this area and smooth it out so that there are no bumps or bubbles., After you have lined your upper shelf, you can add the dividers. Take your other 18cm by 3cm piece and your 6cm by 3cm piece and position them in the box so that they make a “T” shape. Use the hot glue gun to glue the 6cm by 3cm piece into place first and then attach the 18cm by 3cm piece., Before you build your drawer, you will need to line it with your baize or felt fabric. Cut a piece of fabric to fit into the 16.7cm by 11 centimeter (4.3 in) piece. Then, use your glue stick to attach the fabric to this piece.Make sure that you smooth out the fabric to avoid bumps or bubbles.

, Use the hot glue gun to attach your 11cm by 2.7cm pieces to the 11cm long sides of your 16.7 centimeter (6.6 in) by 11cm piece. Then, use the glue gun to attach your 17.7 centimeter (7 in) by 2.7cm pieces to the 16.7 centimeter (6.6 in) sides of your 16.7 centimeter (6.6 in) by 11cm piece.Make sure that you press on each of the sides to ensure that they are firmly in place.

, You will use a piece of your baize or felt fabric to attach the cover to the jewelry box. Cut a piece of your baize or felt so that it is 20 centimeter (7.9 in) long and about 5 cm wide. Then, use your hot glue gun to attach the fabric to the long edge of your cover (the 20cm by 13cm piece).Make sure that a couple of inches hang off the edge.

, Take a piece of your decorative paper and make sure that it is large enough to cover an entire side of your cover piece. Use your glue stick to apply the decorative paper to the cover. Then, fold the excess paper over the edges of the cover and then secure them with glue.Apply decorative paper to the the inside of the cover as well. This piece should stay a little inside of the cover edge, but the whole surface should be covered in decorative paper when you are done.

, Use the fabric that you glued to the edge of the cover to attach the cover to the jewelry box. Glue the edge to the outside of the back of your jewelry box. You will be covering this area with decorative paper, so do not worry about the fabric showing., The next thing that you will need to do is apply decorative paper to the front, back, and sides of your jewelry box as well as to the front of your jewelry box drawer. Cut the pieces to fit each of the areas that you need to cover and then secure them with your glue stick.Make sure that you smooth out the pieces so that there are no bubbles or bumps in the paper.

, Find the center of the front of your drawer by measuring from the edges with your ruler. Make a small pencil mark to indicate the center of your drawer. Then take one of your beads and use the hot glue gun to glue it to this spot. This will serve as your drawer handle.The drawer is all done now, so you can insert the drawer into the slot on the front of the jewelry box.

, Then, turn your jewelry box over and apply a dot of hot glue to one of the bottom corners. Then, secure a bead to this spot. Repeat this process for the other three corners. These will be the feet of your jewelry box., You can leave the box as is or you can decorate your jewelry box. Decorate the top of the jewelry box and the inside cover of the jewelry box with pictures, glitter glue, beads, buttons, etc.After you have finished decorating your box, it is ready to use!

Glue the cork board to the back of your canvas.,
Iron and cut your burlap.,
Staple the burlap to the back of the frame.,
Hammer in the upholstery tacks to the front of the board.,
Attach D-Ring hangers to the back of the canvas.,
Add your memories.",How to Make a Memory Board2," Flip over your canvas to expose the back. The cork board squares will sit inside the canvas’ wooden frame. Coat the back of the canvas with a thin layer of glue and place the cork board squares. After placing each piece, run your hand over the cork board to remove air bubbles. Cut the cork board as needed. When you’re done, the entire area inside the wooden frame of the canvas will be covered in cork board., Before you make any cuts, run over the fabric with a warm iron. This will remove any wrinkles or creases that may alter the dimensions of your fabric. Measure and mark the burlap so each edge is 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 cm) more than the dimensions of the canvas. You will wrap this extra fabric around the frame. Cut your fabric.


You may use any fabric you want., Lay your fabric on a flat work surface. Place the canvas facedown in the center of the fabric. Fold one edge of fabric over the frame and insert staples along the entire length of the wooden frame. Repeat on the rest of the edges., The upholstery tacks will form a decorative edge around your memory board. You must position them over the wooden frame. Use a measuring tape and pencil to mark the location of each upholstery tack—the distance between the tacks is up to you. Hammer each tack into place., Flip your canvas over. Position and attach one or more D-Ring hangers on the wooden frame. You will use the hardware to hang the memory board.


This step is optional., You can attach your mementos with pushpins or thumbtacks. Choose pins and tacks that match the aesthetic of the board.

Take out everything from the frame except the glass., If your frame comes with a backing that fills the entire frame, you may skip this step. If not, you can create your own insert out of cardboard. Measure, mark, and cut a piece of cardboard that will fill the entire picture frame. You will cover this insert (or the original backing) with fabric or wrapping paper., If you are using fabric, run a warm iron over the material. This will remove any wrinkles and creases. Cut a piece of fabric or wrapping paper so that each side is 2 inches (5.08 cm) longer than the corresponding dimensions of the backing., Place the fabric or wrapping paper wrong side up on a flat surface. Position the cardboard insert or original backing in the center. Fold the extra material over the insert/backing and attach it to the back with tape., Place the backing/insert in the frame and close the frame. Hang your memo board on a wall or place it on the table. Write your first memo with a dry erase marker."

Determine the side length of your octagon.,
Use a ruler to draw a line of the length you decided upon.,
Using a protractor, mark an angle 135o relative to your line.,
Continue creating lines at 135o angles to the last line.",How to Make an Octagon1," Since the size of the angles in a regular polygon is set, the only thing you'll need to decide on is the size of the octagon's sides. The larger the length of the octagon's sides, the larger the octagon itself. Make a decision based on the amount of room you have to draw in.;
, This will be the first of the eight sides of the octagon. Draw your line in a spot that leaves plenty of space for the rest of the sides.

, At either end of your line, find and mark the 135o angle. Draw a line of the same length as the first line angled 135 degrees to the original line. This we be the second side of the octagon.


Note that the lines should meet at their end points. Don't start the new line in the center of the old line, for instance.

, Follow this pattern, drawing lines of the same length that meet at 135o angles. Repeat these steps until you have created a complete regular octagon.


Because of minor, accumulating human errors in the preciseness of your drawing, the very last side you draw may not lie exactly 135o to the original line. Usually, if you've drawn carefully, it's acceptable to use a ruler to simply connect the end of the seventh side to the beginning of the first.

Add optional trim.,
Done.",How to Make a Handmade Notebook with a Greeting Card Cover," Select one that you treasure but don't mind repurposing into a notebook. It needs to be the right size for a notebook, although it can be cut down to size if needed. You'll also need printer paper seconds or similar repurposed paper for the inner pages of the notebook. Choose as many pieces as you'd like amount of pages within the book.
, If you're using printer paper seconds cut them a little smaller than your greeting card., Space them evenly so when you tie it all together with the ribbon it will look neat and even., Save both pieces of the card., Using the paper as a pattern, punch holes corresponding to the ones you punched in the paper along the spine of the greeting card front. Do the same with the back part of the greeting card., Line up the holes as you do so., Feed the other end of the ribbon through the hole that's at the top or bottom of the stack, pulling it tight until the knot is flush with the surface of the greeting card. Continue feeding the ribbon through the holes, pulling it tight, until you have fed it through all the holes., Cut away any excess ribbon., If you have enough ribbon left over, you can use it as trim for the outer edges of the greeting card. Apply glue to the underside of the ribbon, lay it long sides together along the outer surface of the front of the greeting card. Press it with your fingers along the inner surface. Press together with your fingers, making sure the ribbon is smooth and flat as you go along.

You may have to fold it when you come to the corners of the greeting card in order to deal with the turn. If you have to fold it, apply a little of your glue to anything that sticks out, then press flat with your fingers.  Continue as long as you have ribbon and/or edges you'd like to trim.
Do the same with the back of the greeting card if you have enough ribbon to finish it.

, Now you have your book! Lay it aside and let the glue dry thoroughly before using it."

Draw a circle and two perpendicular diameter lines.,
Make a slightly larger circle centered on the same point as the original.,
Make an arc across the center of the circle.,
Repeat for the opposite side.,
Draw two lines that pass through the corners of the eye.,
Draw two arcs from the remaining points of intersection between the inner circle and its diameter lines.,
Using a straightedge draw lines through the corners of the new eye.,
Connect the corners of the ""square"" just completed to the intersection of the central cross and the inner circle.,
Erase the circle, lines, and arcs, leaving the octagon alone.",How to Make an Octagon2," Compasses are simple tools used to draw perfect circles. The diameter of the circle of the circle you draw will be the longest diagonal of the octagon - in other words, the distance from one point on the octagon to the point directly across from it. So, a larger circle will produce a larger octagon, and vice versa. Use a compass to draw your circle, and, after doing so, draw two lines that stretch across the diameter of the circle and meet in the center at perpendicular angles.

, Keeping the point of the compass on the same point, draw a circle with a slightly larger radius setting. For instance, if you originally set the radius to 2 inches (5.08 cm), you might add half an inch (1.27 cm) and draw another circle.


For the rest of this process, keep your compass set to this new, slightly larger setting.

, Place the point of the compass on one of the intersections between the inner circle and its diameter. Use the compass to draw an arc near the center of the circle. You don't need to draw an entire circle - just an arc that stretches from one side of the circle to the other.

, Place the point of the compass on the intersection between the inner circle and its diameter line opposite the point you just used and draw another arc across the center of the circle. You should be left with an ""eye"" shape in the middle of the circle.

, Use a ruler or a straightedge to make these lines. The lines must be long enough to intersect the circle in two points and should be perpendicular to the diameter line they pass through.

, Next, repeat the previous steps for the other diameter line that forms the central cross. In other words, place the point of the compass at the intersection points between this line and the circle and draw arcs stretching across the center of the circle as before.


When this is done, you should have two intersecting ""eye"" shapes.

, As before, you'll now want to draw two straight lines through the corners of your new eye shape. The lines should be long enough to intersect the circle and should be perpendicular to the diameter line they cross.


When drawn, these lines, together with the lines through the corners of the other ""eye"", should form a square.

, These points just mentioned form the corners of a regular octagon. Connect them to complete an octagon.

, Congratulations! You've just drawn a regular octagon!

Start with a square piece of paper.,
Fold the corners of the square inward.,
Cut with scissors along the folded edges.",How to Make an Octagon3," Folding a perfect octagon from a sheet of paper means starting with a square sheet. Note that most types of paper used for daily tasks related to work and/or school are rectangular, rather than square. For instance, ordinary printer paper is usually 8 1/2 x 11 inches (21.59 x 27.94 cm). This means you'll need to find a square sheet of paper (construction paper often comes in this shape) or trim one edge of your paper to make it square.


If you're trimming your paper, use a ruler to ensure accuracy. For instance, if you want to trim an 8 1/2 x 11 piece of paper into a square, you would use a ruler to measure 8 1/2 inches on the 11 inch side of the paper, then cut.

, Notice that, as you do this, you create an 8-sided shape. These folds will serve as four of the eight sides of your octagon, so, for your octagon to appear regular, it's important to ensure they're the correct size. Use a ruler to measure the folded edges - you'll want any two edges to be as close to the size of the space between them as possible.


Note that you shouldn't fold the corners all the way in. If you do, you'll be left with a smaller square. Instead, fold the corners in about halfway to the center.

, When you're happy with the dimensions of your octagon, partially unfold the corners of the piece of paper and cut along the folded edges. You should be left with an eight-sided shape with sides that are all roughly the same length - a regular octagon.

"
"
Use eight sides of varying length.,
Use angles of varying size.,
Use sides that intersect themselves.",How to Make an Octagon4," It bears mentioning that, though people commonly use the word ""octagon"" to refer to a regular octagon (one with sides and angles that are the same size), this is not, strictly speaking, the only kind of octagon that exists. Any shape with eight sides is an octagon by definition, just not a regular octagon. Thus, making a shape with eight sides of different lengths, rather than of the same length, produces an irregular octagon.

, As with their side lengths, octagons don't necessarily have to contain angles that are all 135o. As long as your shape has eight sides, angles of smaller or greater size than 135o can be used, resulting in an irregular octagon.


The exception to this rule is for angles of exactly 180o. Generally, the two line segments that make up such an angle can be considered a single edge in a polygon.

, It's also worth nothing that special types of polygons called star polygons can have lines that cross over one another. For instance, an ordinary five-pointed star is drawn in this way from five lines that intersect each other in multiple locations. Similarly, it's possible to make an eight-pointed star from eight lines of equal length. It's also possible to make eight-sided shapes with sides that intersect without making a tidy, symmetrical star shape. These shapes can be generally be considered ""special case"" octagons.

Select a warping thread.,
Begin the warp.,
Continue looping the thread or yarn.,
Complete the warp.",How to Weave on a Loom1," The warp consists of strands of yarn or thread strung lengthwise, under tension, across the loom. The ideal warping thread has a slight spring to it. Choose wool yarn, strong cotton thread, or a non-traditional warping material, like grape vine., When warping a standard frame loom, start in the bottom left corner of your loom. Double-knot the end of your thread or yarn to the bottom cross-bar of your loom frame. Pull the piece of thread or yarn under and over the top cross-bar. Bring it down to the bottom cross-bar and loop it under and over.While the thread or yarn should be pulled tight, you must be able to lift the warp with one finger. When warping a cardboard loom, begin in the top left corner. Secure the warp thread to the back of your cardboard loom with a piece of masking tape—the tail should reach the middle of the board. Insert the thread into the first slit in the top left corner. Pull the warp thread to the bottom left corner and insert it into the first slit. Wrap the thread around the back of the cardboard loom and insert it into the next available top slit., Loop the thread or yarn around the top cross-bar followed by the bottom cross-bar in a figure-eight pattern.As you move from left to right, evenly space the loops across the cross-bars.Continue to wrap the warp thread around the cardboard loom. Insert the warp thread into the next available top slit, pull it down to the bottom, slide it into the next available bottom slit. Repeat., Create approximately 20 loops. When the thread or yarn reaches the top right corner of the loom frame, loop it around the top cross-bar and double-knot it. Cut the thread or yarn from the spool or ball if you have not done so already.After you have inserted the warp thread into each slit, pull the warp thread to the back of the cardboard. Cut the warp thread so that the tail hits the middle of the cardboard loom. Secure the tail to the board with masking tape. To maintain the warp’s tension, secure each piece of warp thread to the back of the cardboard with masking tape."

Collect your materials.,
Cut the weft yarn.,
Create a natural shed.,
Insert the weft thread.,
Insert the shed stick.,
Weave the second row.,
Continue to weave.,
Insert new weft thread.,
Complete the process.",How to Weave on a Loom2," After warping your loom, gather your weaving materials. When weaving on a simple frame loom, you will need a small wooden dowel or a chopstick, a fork or another item with strong tines, such as an Afro pick, a shed stick, an assortment of springy wool, scissors, and a rulerWhen weaving on a cardboard loom, you will need an assortment of springy wool, a tapestry needle, masking tape, and scissors., The weft consists of the threads that go through the warp from side to side. Select a ball of wool. Measure out a 4’ piece of yarn and cut it.The weft yarn must be long enough to make several passes through the warp.

, Insert the dowel into the warp threads—it should be parallel to the top cross-bar. Position the dowel just above the point where the warp threads cross in the middle of the loom. Pull the dowel to the bottom of the loom, creating tension in the warp threads. The gap created between the front and back warp threads is called a natural shed.When weaving on a cardboard loom, you do not need to insert a dowel or create a shed.

, Pull your weft thread through shed from right to left. Leave a 4” tail of yarn on the right. Allow the weft thread to fall down towards the dowel.When weaving on a cardboard loom, insert the warp thread with a needle. Thread the needle with the precut warp thread. Begin at the top right corner. Leave a 3” tail at the start of the first row. Weave under the first warp thread, over the second, under the third, over the fourth. Continue weaving the thread under and over the warp until you reach the end of the line. Each line will begin with an under and end with an over.

, Retrieve the shed stick. Weave the shed thick through the warp threads. Go under the bottom warp threads and over the top warp threads. Grab each end of the shed stick and turn it 90° to create a new shed. When the shed stick is inserted into the the warp, the gap between the top and bottom warp threads is called a shed.
When weaving on a cardboard loom, you do not have to insert a shed stick.

, Loosely pull the weft thread through the shed from left to right. Allow it to lay across the warp threads in an arc. Do not pull the weft thread too tight—it will cause the sides to cinch towards each other! Lay the shed stick flat and remove it from the loom. Use the fork or pick to move the second row of weft thread down towards the dowel.When weaving the next line on a cardboard loom, turn the needle and go under the first warp thread and over the second. Be careful not to pull too tight! Continue to the end of the line—end the line with an over. Push the second row snug against the first row with your fingertips.The second row should be snug against the first row.

, Insert the weft thread through the natural shed from right to left. Don’t pull it too tight! Insert the shed stick and rotate it as before. Pass the weft thread from left to right through the shed. Remove the shed stick and use the fork to push the weft threads together. Repeat this process until your 4’ piece of weft thread runs out.When weaving on a cardboard loom, continue to create new lines. Turn the needle, go under the first warp, and over the last warp. Keep the lines snug., When you run out of weft thread, cut another 4’ piece. Pull a short tail of the previous weft thread out the back. Insert the new piece of weft thread and pull the end through the back, creating a second tail. Continue weaving as before.When you run out of thread while weaving on a cardboard loom, complete the current line and leave a 3” tail that will be woven back into the weave at the end. Thread the tapestry needle with a new piece of weft thread. Leave a 3” tail at the start of the next row. Pull the tapestry needle under the first warp, over the second, under the third. Continue to the end of the row.You do not need to tie the two tails together.
Use this method when changing colors or materials too!

, On a loom this size, you will be able to create a 4” piece of fabric. Continue weaving the weft thread until your piece of fabric is at most 4” long. If you build a larger loom frame, you will be able to create a larger piece of fabric.When weaving on a cardboard loom, continue creating new rows until you have reached the bottom of the cardboard loom."

Secure the top two wefts together.,
Push the wefts together.,
Secure the bottom two wefts together.,
Cut the warp yarn and secure or snip any loose threads.",How to Weave on a Loom3," Select a needle with a large eye. Thread a piece of your weft yarn through the needle’s eye. Attach the top two rows together by sewing a zig-zag pattern across the weaving. This will prevent the top two rows from slipping.

, Remove the dowel from the bottom. Retrieve your fork. Use the fork to push the bottom wefts towards the wefts above.

, Retrieve your needle. Thread the large-eyed needle with a piece of your weft yarn. Attach the bottom two wefts together by creating a zig-zag pattern across the bottom of the weaving.

, Snip the warp threads that are connecting the weaving to the loom. With a needle pull the tails of the first and last weft rows into the weaving. Trim all other side tails to between ¼” to ½” long. Flip the weaving over and cut any loose threads you see.

Remove the tape and cut the warp threads.,
Remove the material and trim the fringe.,
Thread in the loose ends.",How to Weave on a Loom4," Flip the cardboard loom over to the back. Carefully peel off the masking tape. Retrieve your scissors and cut the warp threads down the center of the cardboard loom., Carefully remove each warp thread from the slits running across the top of the cardboard loom. Starting in the right corner, tie warp threads together in pairs close to the weaving. Repeat until all the warp threads are tied in pairs. Remove each warp thread from the bottom slits. Tie the warp threads together in pairs close to the weaving. Retrieve your scissors and trim the fringe in an even line. If you would like to create thicker fringe, use the tapestry needle to thread a length of wool between each section of warp thread. Tie thread’s tool tails together close to the weave. Continue to insert wool until you are happy with the thickness of the fringe., Beginning at the end of the weaving, thread one loose end onto a tapestry needle at a time. Take the strand around the side and weave it into the piece—go over and under several like color rows at a time. Snip the piece of wool close to the weaving. Repeat until all the loose ends are tucked into the material."

Gather the tools.,
Sand the wooden pieces.,
Assemble the frame.,
Secure the wooden frame in place.,
Sand the dowels.,
Form the shed stick.",How to Weave on a Loom5," Building a simple frame loom requires a variety of wooden materials. You will need:


2 pieces of wood ¾” x 1 ½” x 11”
2 pieces of wood ¾” x 1 ½” x 16""
8 pieces of dowel 5/16"" x 1 ½”
1 piece of wood ¼” x 2"" x 12"" (This piece of wood can not bend.), To construct the simple frame loom, you will need to locate a few tools:


Sandpaper
Wood glue
Electric drill with 5/16” bit
Clamp
Small mallet or hammer

, Before constructing the loom, sand off all of the rough edges of the wooden pieces. Run the sandpaper briskly over the edges. Periodically run your hand over the edge to assess the progress. When properly sanded, the edge should feel smooth., Clamp one of the 16” pieces of wood to your workbench. Place the other 16” piece of wood parallel to the clamped piece of wood. Retrieve the two 11” pieces of wood. Lie one 11” piece of wood across the top corners of the the two 16” pieces of wood to form right angles. Lie the other 11” piece of wood across bottom corners of the 16” pieces of wood to form right angles. The edges should be flush., Beginning in the top right corner, drill two holes through both pieces of wood. The holes should be placed diagonally at a 45° angle. Apply glue to the sides of two pieces of dowel. Insert the dowel pieces into the drilled holes with the small mallet or hammer until the dowel is flush with the wooden surface. Wipe away any excess glue. Repeat on the other three corners., When the glue has dried, run a piece of sandpaper over the dowels. Sand down the dowels until they are flush with the wooden surface. Remove any excess dried glue from the wooden frame too., Since the shed stick runs through the weave, it is essential that it does not have any rough edges. A rough edge could cause the thread to snap! Grab the 12” piece of wood and a piece of sandpaper. Round of the ends of the wood as well a the side edges."

, Do this for the rest of your craft sticks. Make sure all the holes are drilled at the same spot on all the sticks.


Use caution when cutting with a power drill. Wear eye protection and do the cutting on a flat surface.

, This will be the top of your fan and will spread out more than the base.

, Allow them to dry thoroughly.


You may find that some colors, particularly reds, will need 2 or even 3 coats.

, Make sure the sticks are touching, without any gaps in between them.

, Enlarge a photograph or cut a magazine photo to the size of the sticks you measured. Make sure your image is the exact same size of the sticks when touching.

, The image should completely fit over the sticks. If sticks are still visible at the sides, you should enlarge or cut a bigger image. If your photo hangs over the side of the sticks, you need to trim the image down.

, Use a craft knife to score the picture lightly along the sides of each stick.

, This will help keep them in order after cutting. Make sure you're numbering the back of the photo and not the picture itself.

, Use a craft knife to ensure a neat, straight cut. Hold a ruler tightly against the cutting line and slide the knife along the edge of the ruler, pressing hard enough to cut through the picture.


Be extremely careful when using the craft knife.

, In a small container, mix equal parts of craft glue and water.

, You'll need to brush the glue mix on the back of one picture strip. Center the strip on a stick, and brush a thin coat of the mixture on all sides of the stick and picture. Repeat this for the remaining strips and sticks. Let them dry completely.

, You can check to make sure your image is correct, by spreading the sticks back out to see if they're in order.

, Tie a knot in embroidery floss or 1/8-inch (.32 cm) ribbon. Thread the other end through the holes that are 1/4 inch (.64 cm) from the bottom of the sticks. Tie a knot to secure the bottom of the fan.

The process of shading may take a long time, depending on the object, so take a few breaks when you feel it's necessary.,
When you have finished the shading take a step back and look at your picture, compared to the still object.,
Keep practicing and you will become a better artist!

",How to Draw Still Life," If you are a beginner, then any object without too much detail or has an interesting shape will do. It's very important not to rush yourself into trying something that may be too difficult.;
, Make sure the location you've chosen doesn't have a complicated background to it.

, It defines the shadows more.

, Try to realize the position/shading/texture/patterns and other things that may help you draw it.

, Try using the pencil softly so if you mess up it's easier to erase.

, But do not work on any one part of the object until you have the entire object drawn lightly.

,, Shading is very important and it must be done properly. Use your pencil lightly when shading and continue overlapping that one part. Don't get impatient and start pressing harder, because after that a dent will appear in the paper and it will be harder to erase.

, You may get some swelling in your arms and hands if you did this process correctly.

, You may notice some differences so you can go back and fix it. Not everything will be perfect so don't work up a sweat trying to figure it out.

Draw a semicircle on the paper.,
Cut out the semicircle.,
Roll the paper into a cone shape.,
Glue or tape it together.",How to Make a Cone1," Lay flat a sheet of paper, or poster board for sturdier projects. Put the sharp point of a drawing compass on the edge of the paper, then use the pencil to draw a semicircle. The cone width will be twice as long as the distance between the two compass points.


If you don't have a compass, use another method, like tracing a cup.
Set the compass distance to 9 or 10 inches (23–25 centimeters) for a medium sized hat.To end up with a cone opening with width w, make a semicircle with diameter w x 3.14 (or w x π).;
, Use a pair of scissors or a utility knife to cut out the half-circle shape from the paper.








, Lift the two corners of the semicircle and bring them together. Pull them past each other slightly so the paper overlaps, making an enclosed cone shape.








, Run a glue stick or line of white glue along the edge where the paper overlaps, then press it together. You might need to hold it for a minute or two while the glue takes hold. You can use tape instead, covering the overlap on the inside and outside of the cone.

Cut out a square or rectangular piece of paper or poster board.,
Cut the paper in half diagonally.,
Tape one side of the cone.,
Finish the cone.",How to Make a Cone2," You can start with a rectangle instead, but a square will make a cone with predictable shape, not too squat or too thin.Use a ruler to measure a square in a piece of paper, then cut off the rest of the paper. If you don't have a ruler, you can instead fold one corner of the paper across to the opposite side to make a square, then draw a line to show where the extra paper needs to be cut off.


Don't crease the paper when you fold it.
If you want a cone opening with width w, make a square with length w÷0.45, or slightly longer. (This is calculated from Pythagoras' Theorem and the circumference of a circle, then rounded from w÷(√2/π).)

, Cut across the paper diagonally with a pair of scissors or a utility knife. This long, diagonal edge of the triangle will end up being the base of the cone.

, Lift one corner of the triangle, next to the longer side, and bring it over to the corner of the two short sides to form a cone shape. Glue, tape, or staple the paper together to keep it in place.


You can adjust the sharpness of the cone by moving the corner to a different spot on the triangle, instead of lining it up with a corner.

, Roll the cone over the remaining side of the paper to complete the cone. Tape or glue the edges where they meet.

Cut out your template and roll it out.",How to Make a Cone3," If you need a template for a cone-shaped funnel, with an opening at both ends, an online calculator will save you time and reduce the chance of an expensive math mistake. Plug in the desired proportions at craig-russel.co.uk to find out what shape and size you need. If you are making a full cone (with one opening and one tip), the steps below will let you calculate it yourself.


If you don't care about the explanation, here are the formulas for a full cone:L = √(h2 + r2), where h is the height of the cone (with tip) and r is the radius of the cone opening

a = 360 - 360(r / L)
You can make your cone out of a circle with radius L, after cutting out and discarding a segment with angle a.

, To make a cone with precise proportions, you'll use a circle with a specific radius, with a ""pie slice"" of a specific angle cut out.If you're making an open funnel, a second circle will be cut out of the larger one, to make the smaller opening.


This guide describes the cone as though it were standing on the larger base, with the tip at the top.
Very narrow cones can have ""pie slices"" cut out that remove more than half the circle.

, Picture the finished cone (ignoring any opening in the top for now). The slant length will run from the tip to the base. This length is the hypotenuse of a right triangle. The other two sides of the triangle are the height of the cone (h) and the radius of the bottom opening (r). We can use Pythagoras' Theorem to calculate the slant length (L) based on our desired cone size:



L2 = h2 + r2 (Remember to use the radius, not the diameter!)

L = √(h2 + r2).
For example, a cone with height 12 and radius 3 has a slant length of √(122 + 32) = √(144+9) = √(153) = about 12.37.

, Picture cutting open the finished cone and laying it flat again. You'll end up with a circle with a radius equal to the slant length L that you just calculated. Label the radius and move on to the next steps to calculate how wide a ""pie slice"" to cut out.

, The base circumference is the length of the edge around the cone base (the larger opening). You can calculate this based on the desired radius of the opening (r), using the formula for the circumference (C) of a circle:


C(cone base) = 2 π r

Our example cone with radius 3 has a cone base circumference equal to 2 π (3) = 6 π = about 18.85

, We now know the circumference of the cone, but the circle itself has a larger circumference once it's laid out (before any pieces have been cut from it). We can use the same formula to find this number, but this time the radius will be the slant length of the cone (L).


C(full circle) = 2 π L

Our example cone with slant length 12.37 has a full circle circumference equal to 2 π (12.37) = about 77.72

, The full circle without any cuts has circumference C(full circle). The material we need for the cone has circumference C(cone base). Subtract one from the other, and we know the circumference of the missing ""pie slice"":


C(full circle) - C(cone base) = C(pie slice)
In our example, 77.72 - 18.85 = C(pie slice) = 58.87

, It's possible to cut out a circle, then measure the circumference of the pie slice with a tape measure. Most people find it easier to calculate the angle of the pie slice instead, and use a protractor to measure it from the circle's center.Just a couple more calculations:


Calculate the ratio of the missing segment to the full circumference: C(pie slice)/C(full circle) = Ratio. In our example: 58.87 / 77.72 = 0.75. It turns out that our ""pie slice"" actually removes 75% of the circle in this case.
Use this ratio to find the angle. The same ratio will apply to the angles. A circle has 360º, so you can find the angle of the pie slice (a) with the formula Ratio = a / 360º, or a = (Ratio) x (360º). That's 0.75 x 360º = 270º in our example.

, If you have machining equipment, you can have a machine cut out the template to the measurements you've specified. Otherwise, draw a circle using a compass, or a pencil tied to a thumbtack using a string as long as the circle's radius. Use a protractor to draw the angle of the ""pie slice"" (or larger piece) that won't be part of the cone, and use a straightedge to extend it from the center to the circumference. Cut out the rest of the circle and roll it into the cone.


It's a good idea to cut out a little more of the circle than you need, to use as an overlap when attaching the two sides of the material together.

Leave your fan open.",How to Make a Chinese Fan," You will want to go to your nearest craft store and buy a piece of card stock, or thick paper, that is at least 3ft. X 9in. You can choose either a basic color (red, black, blue, etc.) or a more intricate design (animals, flowers, architecture, etc.). You can also create your own design on a piece of cardstock. Traditional Asian designs might be harder to find, so you may have to search online. You can use this website as a good reference point: http://silkfans.com/.Thick paper, like card stock, will allow your fan to last a lot longer than traditional paper will.
You can also choose plain white card stock, and draw your own design on it.
Do not worry if your piece of paper is too big, you can just cut it down to the proper size later on.;
, This step is strictly optional if you wish to draw your own design. The best things to use for this fan project are crayons, colored pencils, or pen. Magic markers are okay as long as you have bought thick enough paper (the colors might bleed through). You may also consider mixed media coloration, such as drawing an outline in pen, and then filling in the design with watercolors.http://www.activityvillage.co.uk/chinese-fan-craft

If you decide to use watercolor paint, make sure to paint the lighter colors first, then dark colors, and finally add your details. Between each layer of paint, give your painting time enough to dry. For more information on watercolor painting, visit this link: How to Paint With Watercolors

Make sure before you begin drawing or painting that you measure, with a ruler, the dimensions of your fan. In general, your fan design should be around 3ft. X 9in. If your design goes over these limits slightly, you can adjust for it later on.
Do not add ""extras"" yet, such as glitter, buttons, or beads. These will be added on at the end of your project.

, If you decide to make a silk fan, it works the same way a paper fan does. You will need to go to your local arts and crafts store to find a piece of silk you want. If it is not prepackaged, you will have to ask an employee to cut it directly off the bolt for you. You have many options here, whether it be plain colors, or designed silks. For a reference to more traditional Asian designed silks, visit this link: http://silkfans.com/.Remember that you will need a piece of fabric that is at least 3ft. X 9in. If you have a piece of silk at home you want to use, but is not the correct size, you can easily cut it down later on.
Buying plain colored silks, like white or light blue, allow you the option of applying your own design. Because silk is delicate, it is best to use pen or marker rather than paint. You also risk damaging your design if you paint it on, as you will be folding the piece of silk.
Try to buy a thicker silk, as this will make your fan last longer.

, Grab your piece of paper, or fabric, and lay it down face flat on a smooth table. Use a ruler, and measure out a rectangle that is 3ft. X 9in. You can use the corner of the ruler to make right angles. Draw the rectangle with a light pencil mark, so that it does not show through.Take a pair of scissors, or a rotary cutter, and cut out your rectangle. If this is your first time making a Chinese fan, you may want to cut a bit outside of the rectangle to give yourself a little more leeway.
Make sure if you use a rotary cutter that you are cutting on a safe surface like a plastic or metal cutting board. Rotary cutters easily slice through surfaces made of wood.

, Place your rectangle vertically, face down. Take a ruler, and on one of the long sides, draw a small pencil mark every half-inch. Do this until you get to the bottom of the rectangle. Do the same thing on the other long side, making a pencil mark every half-inch., Find a ballpoint pen and take the cap off. Place your ruler on your rectangle, connecting two marks (one on each long side) that are directly apart from one another. Run the pointy end of the cap between the two pencil marks, connecting them. Apply enough pressure so that you can see an indentation in the paper or fabric.

Do this between every two pencil marks that are directly across from one another.
When you are done, you should have a piece of paper or fabric that has an indentation going across it every half-inch. These indentations are where you will fold your fan.

, Lay your rectangle vertically, face down. Start at the bottom, by taking the bottom edge in your hands. Fold up along the indentation you made. Flip your rectangle over, so that it is still vertical, but face up. Take the bottom edge (the indentation you just folded) in your hands. Fold it up along the next indentation mark.Continue to repeat this step until you have folded the entire rectangle. Flip, fold up, flip fold up, etc. Always keep your previously folded section near you when you flip your rectangle.
If you want to, you can run a ruler down each fold you make so that the creases are sharper. However, if you have painted on a design, it could be damaged by adding pressure to the fold. Keep this in mind, and proceed with caution.

, First, press your accordion together, and place a semi-heavy object, like a paperweight, on top of it. Next, you will want to get out some masking tape. Use a pair of scissors to cut a strip of masking tape that is 1/2 inch wide, and 7-8 inches long. Take your tightly folded accordion and position it vertically. Wrap this strip of tape around the bottom of your accordion while it is still scrunched together.If you have a design that has to be displayed a certain orientation, make sure that you place the tape on the bottom end of that design.
Do not leave any gaps at the bottom. Place the edge of the tape right on the edge of the bottom of the accordion.
Keep the accordion pressed tightly together as you wrap the tape. When you finish taping, the wrap should feel secure. If you think it is still loose, wrap another piece of tape (same size) on top of the one you already laid down. By the time you are done, the bottom 1/2 inch of your fan should be completely wrapped.

, Find two popsicle sticks that are at least 9-10 inches long, and only 1/2 inch wide. Your folded accordion has two flat sides, and two scrunches sides. Use some normal Elmer's glue, or super glue, and glue down one popsicle stick on each of the flat sides. Spread some glue on one flat side at a time, in the space that is not covered by tape.The popsicle stick should be placed right against the tape, not over top it. This should leave you with at least an inch of overhang, depending on the length of your popsicle stick.
After you get done gluing the first popsicle stick, place the paperweight back on top of it. Let it sit for twenty minutes before you flip it over and glue the second popsicle stick on.
Do the same with the second popsicle stick. Place the paperweight overtop of it for 20 minutes before you move on to further steps.

, This is a strictly optional step, but which will add another dimension to your fan. Buy some standard wood stain or acrylic paint in any color or shade you like. Chinese fans usually use a reddish stain on the wood handles, but you should choose something which compliments your design.Take a small paintbrush, and apply small brushstrokes to one of the popsicle sticks. Make sure to get both the top, sides, and the back of the exposed end.
Let one popsicle stick dry before you turn it over. It is best to wait a day in between each, but you should at least give it an hour or so.
If you go the acrylic paint route, you can add painted designs after you apply an initial base coat. You might want to continue the design from your fan onto the popsicle sticks, or add in something complimentary. Make sure to buy a smaller paintbrush for the finer details.

, This could mean any number of things. You might want to glue on buttons or beads to the popsicle sticks. You can use glitter glue to highlight the edges of your popsicle sticks, or use it to highlight the edges of the actual fan.The important thing is to be creative without adding too much. Remember, this is a fan which will by necessity take on a lot of wear and tear. Too many beads, or add-ons may make the fan too heavy, or make it damage relatively quicker than it normally would.

, Your fan needs ""exercise"" so that the creases continuously open and close the same way. Every day, try to open and close your fan 3-4 times. Do this for a week straight so you get used to how it opens and closes. The creases of your fan will become more permanent., If you are just using your fan at church to keep you cool, you can wave and hold your fan any way you wish. However, if you are going out to the opera, there is a more sophisticated way to hold your fan. Open your fan half-way (half a circle) and place it in front of your face, so that other people would only be able to see your eyes and nose.Your hand will hold the fan at the bottom center of the half circle. Place your thumb on the outside of the fan (decoration side). Your other four fingers will be placed on the inside (non-decoration side).
Gently wave the fan towards your face. If the fan comes into contact, move the fan away slightly. The goal is to cool yourself off, show off your fan, and too demonstrate your level of sophistication.

, Certainly the goal of this project is to create a contractible fan. However, if your fan stays closed for too long, the design you have on it can become worn and damaged. After you are done using it for the night, and you are home, open the fan up. Lay it down on a flat surface, or hang it up on the wall as a home decoration."

, Keeping the sheet oriented as a diamond, fold the left point over until it meets the right point. Crease the paper well before unfolding it back into its original shape.After doing this, your sheet should have two perpendicular crease marks. One should go from the top corner to the bottom, and the other should go between the side corners. The two crease marks should intersect in the center of the paper.

, If you are making a bag to fit a specific item, you need to ensure the bag will be large enough. Fold your paper in half (if you’re using wrapping paper on a roll, don’t cut it until you have measured).Lay the item in the center of the folder paper and check that the item is smaller than the paper by at least two to three inches on all sides.


Cut wrapping paper to the size you need.
Trim paper slightly if it is excessively large for your item and you want a more snug fit.
For newspaper bags, you can use an entire sheet of newspaper (four pages worth) to make a large bag, or you can use a half sheet (two pages) for a smaller bag.#* If you are using thin paper, such as newspaper, and want to make a more durable bag, consider gluing two sheets together to create a single, thicker sheet. Use a glue stick or spray adhesive to do this.

, Lay it on a flat, hard surface. Fold it in half lengthwise and make a gentle crease at the top of the paper to mark the halfway point. Open the paper back up.

, If you're making an open-topped bag with handles, create a reinforcing borderby folding down a 2 to 3 inch (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) wide lip lengthwise across the top of the paper. Make a crease to mark the fold and open it up again. Cut out a strip of cardstock that’s as long as your paper and as wide as your border. Glue this to the top of your paper. Fold the reinforced border back down and glue it in place.


If your paper is the same color on both sides (or has the patterns only on one side) leave the border as it is, and move on.
If your paper has a design on both sides, (like scrapbook paper), flip the paper over so that the border will be on the outside.

, Working with the paper lengthwise, fold both sides in to the center crease that you created. Overlap them by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Hold the seam together with one hand, and crease the two side folds with your other hand. These are the sides of your bag, and the open ends are the top and bottom. Glue, tape, or staple the half-inch seam in the center together.If you are using glue, try to use a thin, lightweight glue, such as a glue stick or rubber cement. If you use white glue, apply it in a thin layer. Be sure to give the glue a few minutes to dry before moving on to the next step.
If you are using tape, consider using thin, clear, double-sided tape. You can also try using glue-dots as well, provided that they are thin enough. Don't use the thick, white foam mounting tape, or your bag will look lumpy.
Staplers can only reach so far. They might be better for smaller bags, or for ones with a rustic look.

, Grab your gift item and measure the width to determine how wide the bag needs to be. Write this number down as your bag width. Add ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) to that, fold up the bottom of the bag by that measurement, and crease the fold., To start, reopen the fold you just made. Separate the two pieces of the paper that form the bottom. Start with one side, and at the side crease, push one side inward so that you can line up the side crease with the bottom crease. This side should now resemble a large triangle. Hold it in place with one hand, and use your other hand to crease the two new edges of the triangle.


Repeat on the other side.
The bottom of the bag should now look like a hexagon.

, Fold them just enough so they overlap by a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Glue or tape the two flaps down. Allow them to dry. This has created the bottom of your bag.


If you are using glue, try using a sturdier glue, such as white glue. Be sure to let the glue dry completely before moving on.
You can use thin, clear double-sided tape, but it may not create the most durable bottom. If you do use double-sided tape, plan on using the bag for lightweight gifts.

, Fold the sides of the bag over based on your bag width. Open the side and bottom folds you made so you can open the bag from the top. Gently push out the sides and bottom, and work out the four corners with your fingers. Square the bottom, gently pinching the bottom sides to create a fold. Adjust side creases so they form nice, square corners.


For a quick gift bag, insert your gift and pinch the top together. Either fold it down and tape it as is, or fold the sides in to create a triangle before folding it over and taping it shut.Your quick bag is now ready to be gifted!

, You can personalize and customize your bag using any decorations you like, such as glitter, stickers, flowers or bows, or any other ornaments. Here are a few more ideas to get you started:


If your bag is made out of solid-colored paper, you can make it look more interesting by painting on designs. You can go free-hand or use stencils.
Decorate a solid-colored bag with stickers or stamps to mimic a new pattern.
If your bag has an existing pattern, consider outlining parts of that pattern using matching glitter glue.
Embellish your bag with rhinestones, buttons, or small paper flowers.
Glue some ribbon or lace along the top edge of the bag.

, Collapse the top of the bag so the sides sit flat together. Use a pen or pencil to mark the two spots where you want the handles to go (somewhere in the top reinforced border you created). Use a hole puncher to punch out holes at each marked spot, going through both sides of the bag. Cut two long pieces of string, thin rope, or ribbon, and thread them through the holes. How you tie the string off will depend on the thickness of the string:


For thin, sheer ribbon: thread both ends of the ribbon through both holes on the front of your bag. Tie both ends together into a tight knot inside the bag. Repeat this for the back of the bag with the other ribbon.
For thicker ribbon/rope: thread both ends of a thin rope the holes on the front of your bag. Tie each end of the rope into a knot, separately. Repeat this for the back of the bag with the other piece of rope.
You can make the handles as long or as short as you want. Ideally, you should be able to slip the handles over your forearm.
To make the holes stronger, consider putting a metal grommet through each hole using a grommet setter.

, Another way to finish your bag is to seal it with a ribbon. First, close the top half of your bag and flatten it. Fold a one inch (2.54 centimeters) lip toward the back of the bag, and then fold it on itself again. Punch two holes in the center of the lip that are three to four inches (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters) apart. Next:Reopen the bag and place your gift inside.
Cut a length of ribbon or twine long enough to make a bow, plus an extra few inches.
Flatten out the top of the bag again and refold the lip both times. Starting from the back, run each end of a piece of ribbon through each hole so the ends come out at the front of the bag.
Tie the ribbon in a bow.

, For a bag that’s more ornamental, you can create an accordion top and seal it with a bow. First, place your gift in the bag. Collapse the top of the bag so the sides fold inward and the front and back come together. Then:


Fold the top of the bag down ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). On the opposite side, fold the top down another ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Continue folding the bag down on alternating sides until you've done this five to seven times.
Fan open the folds so they look like an accordion. Pinch down the center, wrap a ribbon around the bag, and tie a bow in the center of the accordion folds to keep them in place., Instead of making a new bag out of paper, you can also jazz up old paper shopping bags to use for gifts. Refold the bag and lay it flat.

, Close the bag so that it lays flat. Turn an iron on to the lowest heat setting. Run the iron over the bag. Keep the iron moving and don’t linger on any spots to avoid burning the bag. Iron out any wrinkles.

, How you decorate your bag is entirely up to you. You can make it as fancy or as plain as you like. If your bag has an existing pattern or color scheme, however, try to match that pattern or color scheme as best you can. For example, if you have a delicate white and silver bag, some silver ribbon or delicate lace might look better than clunky red and yellow buttons. Here are some ideas to get you started:


If your bag is solid-colored paper, consider drawing or painting on it.
Decorate a plain bag with stickers or stamps. If you keep the shapes consistent, it could look like a pattern.
If your bag already has a design on it, consider outlining some of the designs with matching glitter glue. You can even glue on rhinestones for added flair.
Consider gluing a ribbon or lace along the top edge of the bag.
Embellish a bag with small buttons or rhinestones. Buttons are great for adding that homemade touch to bags made out of solid-colored paper.

, Once you have finished decorating the body of the bag, take a look at the handles. Do they need replacing? Does the original ribbon or rope still match the bag? If not, then consider doing any of the following:


Take out the old handles and replace them with new ones. The new ones don't have to be same as the old ones, but you might want to make the new ribbon or rope match the bag.
To add handles to a bag that doesn't have any: fold the top 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of the bag down inside and glue it in place. Punch two holes on each side and add handles as before.
Seal the bag with a sticker or adhesive gift bow. Cut out the handles (if any) and put the gift inside the bag. Fold the top over twice, by 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters). Hold the folded top down with a stick or gift bow that matches the bag's design.
Seal the bag with a ribbon. Cut out the handles (if any) and put the gift inside the bag. Fold the top over twice, by 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters). Punch two holes in the folded top, several inches apart. Starting from the back of the bag, thread both ends of a ribbon through both holes. Tie both ends of the ribbon into a bow at the front of the bag.

Choose a laminating machine that suits your needs.,
Turn on the machine and allow it to warm up.,
Place your document inside the laminating pouch.,
Place the laminating pouch containing the document inside the carrier.,
Feed the carrier through the machine.,
Allow the pouch to cool before removing it from the carrier.

,
Trim the edges if needed using a paper cutter or scissors.",How to Laminate Paper1," Most home users buy machines that can accept documents as large as the standard 8-1/2"" x 11"" letter size (216 by 279 mm).;
, Most laminating machines have an indicator light that will tell you when the machine is ready.

, These are 2 sheets of laminate plastic attached at one end.


If the pouch is only slightly larger than your document (for instance, if you are laminating a business card with business-card size pouch) you will need to carefully center the document so there will be an even border all around.
If the document is significantly smaller than the pouch, it's not necessary to center the document because you can trim the edges.

, The sealed end of the pouch should be snug against the sealed end of the carrier. The carrier is 2 sheets of treated cardstock that protects the laminating machine from adhesive buildup.

, Insert the sealed end first until the machine grabs it. Don't force the carrier through the machine; it must go slowly enough for the machine to fuse the sheets.

,, Leave at least a 1/16"" (2mm) border.

Use a thin strip of paper.,
Fold the bottom corner up to the top edge.,
Repeat this fold 5 to 7 additional times.,
Trim the extra length of paper.,
Fold up the bottom right corner.,
Tuck the extra section into folded triangles.,
Trim the top corners.,
Push a dent into the top.",How to Fold a Paper Heart2," The ideal size for this strip of paper is 1 inch (2.5 cm) by 11 inches (28 cm).The dimensions needed for this strip of paper do not need to be exact but you should try and keep the same ratio between height and width for optimal results.

, Create a 45 degree valley fold, bringing the lower left corner up until it touches the upper edge of the strip. Crease this fold.

, Always bring the corner towards the opposite edge. You’ll need to alternate with each fold; your second fold will be bringing the top corner to the bottom edge while the third fold will bring the bottom corner to the top edge.The length of the strip should becomes notably shorter as you fold.

, Using scissors, cut off the excess length. Leave a portion of the excess length that measures roughly half the width of the triangular folds., The lower right corner should be brought up so that it meets the right edge of the folded triangle. Crease this fold.

, Start by bringing the upper right corner down, sliding it into one of the existing layers of the folded triangle. As you push, the rest of this section should be completely tucked in, leaving you with a triangle., Turn the triangle so that the longest edge is on the top. Use scissors to snip off the corners, rounding them off.


Note that the paper will be very thick at this point and it may be hard to cut through.
The longest edge should not be the newly-tucked in portion of the triangle.

, Pinch the heart lightly, putting your index finger on one of the rounded corners, and your thumb on the other. Use your thumbnail to indent the middle of the top edge. This will give the edge a slight curve, completing your lucky heart."

Expose the adhesive on a second laminating sheet by removing the backing.,
Add the second sheet on top of the first.,
Trim the edges with a paper cutter or scissors.",How to Laminate Paper2," The best come with a grid on the backing and allow you to reposition the paper if you make an error placing it on the sheets.

, Handle it by the edges so you don't leave fingerprints in the adhesive. If the backing has a grid, then save it to use as a guide when placing your document.

, Lay the sheet on your work surface adhesive side up with a grid under it. You can use the grid on the backing you just removed, a sheet of graph paper or a grid you drew on a plain sheet of paper. Tape the grid down so it doesn't slide around.

, With small documents on large laminating sheets, alignment isn't important. You may need to adjust the laminating sheet on the grid.

, Press the corner down with your finger.

, Smooth the paper your hand so that it lies flat with no wrinkles or air bubbles.

, Discard the backing.

, Start at 1 corner and smooth the sheet down a bit at a time to remove wrinkles and air bubbles. You can also use a tool called a brayer to smooth the sheet, or you can burnish it with the edge of a credit card.

, Leave a 1/16"" (2 mm) border so that the laminate doesn't loosen.

Find a paper model alphabet online.,
Use an image editor to decorate.,
Print your letters.,
Cut out your letters.,
Make the creases.,
Fold the paper.,
Glue the tabs.",How to Make 3D Letters1," There are a variety of websites for making printable paper models. These range from plain block letters to intricate sculptures. Pick the type that both fits your project and matches your skill level., After downloading your template, you may choose to customize it with image editing software of your choice. This can be adding pictures, patterns, or colors to each letter. Be careful not to erase any solid or dotted lines from the original template, as you will need these for proper assembly.


As an alternative, you may always print out plain white letters and decorate them by hand before folding. However, using an image editor will guarantee uniformity between your letters and make them look more professional.

, Use your home printer to transfer your templates onto paper. You may use normal printer paper. However, sculptures made from cardstock are much sturdier. Check to see if your printer can accept cardstock into its feed.

, You can use scissors or hobby knife. For most papercraft templates, the lines you must cut will be solid and black. The unfolded printout will likely not resemble your letter, yet.


When using a hobby knife, be sure to work on a protective mat to keep from ruining your table.

, For most papercraft templates, dotted lines represent those that need to be scored. Use a bone folder to carefully score along these lines without ripping the paper.If you don't have a bone folder handy, you can also use the bottom edge of a ballpoint pen instead.

, Decide which side of the paper will be visible and place your paper with that side facing down. Fold the lines you scored inward. Once you've made these folds, your letter should be easily recognizable.

, Your template will likely indicate where glue should be placed to hold together the final sculpture. If not, simple papercraft tends to be intuitive. Your template's glue tabs will likely be plain white strips around the perimeter of the cutout. Apply a light dab of paste or go over each tab with a glue stick before placing it under the visible portion of your model.

Start with your paper flat on your work area.,
Roll the paper into a loose cylinder.,
Align the edges, then gently flatten the middle.,
Flatten the cylinder completely when you have a near-fit.",How to Fold a Paper Into Thirds1," Believe it or not, there are many ways to fold a paper into thirds, but some give more precise results than others. Try this method if you don't need to be exact — it's quick and it works well, but rarely will your results be perfect.


On the plus side, you won't need any tools for this method.
Note that a standard 8 1/2 × 11 inch sheet of paper doesn't have to be folded perfectly into thirds to fit in an envelope, making this a good choice for correspondence.;
, Your goal is to make a fat, loose roll from your paper — about the dimensions of a rolled-up newspaper. Don't make any folds yet.








, Look at your cylinder from the side — you want one edge of the rolled-up paper to be on the left and the other to be directly across from it on the right. Start to compress the cylinder, adjusting as you go to keep the edges lined up.









You want the three layers of paper created this way to be approximately the same size. For this, you'll want one edge of the paper snug against the inside of the fold of the cylinder and the other edge lying over the top, lined up with the other fold. This is more intuitive than it sounds.

, When you see that your paper is as near to perfect thirds as you can realistically get it, press down on the edges of the paper to get smooth, clean creases. Congratulations! Your paper should be in (nearly) perfect thirds.









At this point, you can make last-minute adjustments, but avoid making more than one crease unless your thirds are very uneven — this can look unprofessional.

Gather your materials.,
Fold the paper into long quarters.,
Write your chosen letters or word on the second quarter from the bottom.,
Draw straight lines upward from the top edges of each letter.,
Cut out your pop ups.,
Fold and secure your sheet to show off your pop up letters.",How to Make 3D Letters2," You will need a ruler, a hobby knife, markers or pens, and a sheet of paper or cardstock. You may also use other types of paper. Just make sure that the paper is thick enough to hold a shape (unlike tissue paper) and easily folded (unlike thick cardboard).

, Start by folding the paper in half widthwise. Then, make two additional creases by folding each half the same way but towards the opposite direction of the original crease. For example, if you folded the first crease down, you would fold both of the new creases up.The folded paper should look similar to two steps on a staircase.

, The letters can be any style you choose, as long as they are thick. Additionally, make sure that each letter's top and bottom edge lines up with the creases. If they are letters that don't typically have straight top and bottom edges, like C or O, cut them off slightly. Decorate the letters with markers or pens., Use a ruler to make the lines go completely across the quarter page above them.Try to make these lines thin using a pencil or a pen instead of a marker. You don't need them to be visible on the final letters.

, Use the hobby knife to make the cuts. Cut the entire outline for each letter, starting with the straight lines above and work your way around the sides of the letter.Make sure not to cut the bottom or top edges of the letters. You may cut out the center white space of certain letters (like R) or leave them in.

, Fold the sheet into a box with the letters as the front side, the strips above them as the top, the quarter you originally drew them on as the bottom, and the quarter the strips were cut from as the back. The top and bottom quarters can be folded under the box and secured with either tape or glue."

Trace your letter cutout onto either cardboard or chipboard.,
Glue paper cups to the cardboard letters.,
Glue the second letter onto the opposite ends of the cups.,
Cover the letter with paper tape.,
Decorate your letter as desired before display.",How to Make 3D Letters3," You will need drawing paper, disposable paper cups, chipboard or cardboard, glue, a hobby knife, and adhesive paper tape cut into long strips. You will also need a method of dampening the paper tape without soaking it, such as a new clean kitchen sponge. Decorative materials, such as acrylic paint, are optional.Keep in mind that the size of the cups that you choose will partially determine the size of your letters. How tall your cups are will roughly correspond with how thick your letters will be. Likewise, you will need to make each portion of your letter at least as wide as the mouth of your cups.

, Use the drawing paper to sketch out your ideas. Draw a letter that is at least the width of your cups' mouth in all areas. Don't worry about erasing mistakes or making it neat; this paper will not be incorporated into your finished letter. Once you're happy with your letter's design and size, cut it out using either your hobby knife or a pair of scissors.

, Cut your letter out using a hobby knife. Do this twice so that you have two identical copies of the cardboard letter. Make sure that the two letters line up perfectly., Stagger the cups right side up and upside-down to pack them in as tight as possible. The more cups you use, the more structurally sound your final letter will be. Do not allow any part of the cups to go over the edge of the letter., Wait for the glue on the first letter to dry. Make sure to line up your second letter perfectly when gluing. Allow the glue to dry completely before moving on., Take a paper strip and moisten its adhesive. Wrap it tightly around your letter so that it sticks to both the top and bottom cardboard faces. Repeat with more paper strips, one by one. Continue until your letter has been completely wrapped in at least two layers of adhesive tape., You may choose to apply acrylic gesso to give you a white surface to work on and to seal the tape edges completely. You can paint or draw over this layer using most types of media. If you are making multiple letters, try to decorate them similarly to create a theme."

Fold a ""scratch"" piece of paper into rough thirds.,
Refold until the thirds are as precise as possible.,
Use your scratch paper as a folding guide for the ""good"" paper.,
If desired, use a straight edge to assist.",How to Fold a Paper Into Thirds2," This method sacrifices one piece of paper to help you get another piece just right. You'll need two pieces of paper for this method — one that you want to fold well and one that you don't mind ruining. Your two pieces of paper should be the same size.









Get your ""scratch"" paper into rough thirds any way you wish — you may want to use the ""intuitive"" method above or one of the others in this article. You can even use trial-and-error to get your folds right.

, Now, make adjustments to your scratch paper until you have it folded into near-perfect thirds.









Do not worry about how many times this takes or how many unsightly creases you make — this paper doesn't ""count.""

, Once you are satisfied with the folds in your scratch paper, take the now-folded blank sheet and line it up with the edge of the paper you want to fold well. Use the scratch paper as a blueprint for the folds you make in your ""good"" sheet of paper.









You can do this by marking the positions of the folds on the ""good"" paper or using your eyes to visually compare the two sheets.

, If you want, you can take a straight edge (even something as simple as your envelope) and lay it over the two sheets to help you mark the folds from your scratch paper on your ""good"" paper. If you're using a sturdy straight edge, you can even fold your ""good"" paper over it for precision.









When you're done, save your ""scratch"" paper for note-taking or recycle it. Don't send perfectly good paper to a landfill.

Fold one edge of the paper over the top of the sheet.,
Line the edge up so that it covers half of the space.,
Tuck the remaining edge into the crease and fold in half.",How to Fold a Paper Into Thirds3," This method of folding perfect thirds uses nothing more than the measuring power of the human eye to find the spots where your paper folds into thirds. Despite this, it's surprisingly effective. In fact, once you've practiced it a few times, you can probably get away with using it for important correspondence.









To begin, you want to take one edge of the paper and double it up, bringing it across the top of the rest of the page. Don't make any creases yet — the edge you are about to fold should be gently rounded.

, Try to line up the edge of the paper that you're holding so that it covers half of the paper that remains. The human eye is much better at judging halves than thirds, so it will be much easier to line up the paper correctly here than it would have been if you had attempted fold the paper into thirds from the beginning.









When you have the edge of the page lined up just right, crease the paper, making sure not to let the free edge move as you're making your crease.

, The hard part of this method is already done. Now, all that you need to do is make the final one-third fold. Do this by taking the other edge of the paper and tucking it under the top edge so that it is snug against the inside of the crease. Make a second crease.









If you've made accurate folds, all of the edges of your paper should line up at this point. If they don't, feel free to make minor adjustments as needed.

"

Fold the paper in half.,
Draw a line from the bottom left to the right side of the half-fold.,
Draw a line from the top left to the bottom right.,
Make one fold at the intersection of your two lines.,
Make the second fold by tucking the other side of the paper in.",How to Fold a Paper Into Thirds4," This method uses techniques derived from origami, the Japanese art of paper-folding, to get perfect third folds.Though origami is usually done with square sheets of paper, this method should also work with standard 8 1/2 × 11 inch paper like you'd find in an office. Start by folding your paper in half in the same direction you'd like to fold it into thirds.










Note: If you don't want to make extra folds in your paper, you can find the midpoint of the paper and carefully mark a line across to divide the paper in half. If you do this, however, your line will need to be extremely straight to match the accuracy of a simple half-fold.

, Position your paper so that the half fold you just made goes from left to right. Use a straight edge to carefully draw a line from the bottom left to the point where the fold in the middle meets the right edge of the paper.









You can also do this method with a line that extends from the bottom right corner if you reverse all of the directions after this, but for convenience's sake we've decided to just give a single set of directions.

, Use your straight edge to carefully draw a line from the very top left corner of the paper to the bottom right. This line should intersect your middle fold at its center and your first line somewhere on the right side of the page.








, The spot where your two lines intersect marks one of the third folds you need to make. Use a straight edge to draw a line that passes through this point and also intersects both edges of the paper at 90 degree angles.










Carefully fold and crease along this edge. The folded edge should divide the rest of the paper into halves — if it doesn't, you may need to make minor adjustments at this point so that it does.

, Finally, take the non-folded edge of the paper and tuck it underneath the folded edge. Make a second crease when it is snug against the inside of your first crease. Your paper should now be divided into thirds.

Measure the length of one side.,
Divide this length by three.,
Mark this distance, measuring from the edge of the paper.,
Make a crease at this point, then fold the remaining flap of paper over.",How to Fold a Paper Into Thirds5," Have the methods above left you unsatisfied by the preciseness of your folds? Try following the steps in this section, which should give you folds that are as close to exact as you can reasonably hope to be. You'll need a measuring tool (like a ruler) and a calculator or some scratch paper for this method. Start by measuring the length of the side you want to make folds in.








, Doing this will give you the width of each of your thirds.









For instance, if you're using a standard 8 1/2 × 11 inch piece of paper and you want to divide it into thirds along the 11 inch side, simply divide 11 by 3. 11/3 = 3 2/3 or 3.667. This means the folds should be 3 2/3 inches apart.

, Using your measuring tool, mark the spot that is the distance you determined above from the edge of the paper. Again, you should be measuring along the side of the paper that you plan to fold.









In our example above with the 8 1/2 × 11 inch paper, we would measure 3 2/3 inches along the 11 inch (27.9 cm) side and mark this distance.

, Make a fold through your marking that is perpendicular to both edges of the paper. This is one of your third folds. The second is easy — just tuck the other edge of paper under so that it is snug against the inside of the first crease (exactly as in the sections above.)

If you're using a piece of rectangular paper, you can cut it into a square. Fold one corner over to the adjacent side. Use a scissors to cut off the small rectangle. What remains is a square-shaped piece of paper.
It's fun to make tiny fortune tellers that you can put in your pocket or hide in a friend's backpack. Use a small piece of paper to make a mini fortune teller.;
, Fold the top right corner to touch the bottom left corner. Crease the fold with your finger.








, Turn the paper and fold the opposite side. Fold the top left corner to touch the bottom right corner. Crease the fold with your finger.








, Bring the top edge to the bottom edge. Crease the fold.








, Turn the paper and fold the other edge to its opposite edge. Crease the fold. Now your paper should have four creases criss-crossing through the middle.








, Crease the folds. You'll be left with a smaller square shape.








, The smooth side should be facing up.








, All the corners should meet neatly in the center. Crease the edges. You're finished folding!








, One side of the fortune teller looks like four squares; the other looks like four triangles. Start with the squares facing up.








, Write one color in each square. It can be any colors you like.









For example, you could write pink, green, purple and orange. You could also simply color the flaps each a different color.Or if you want to do something a little different, write the names of four animals, four planets, four movie stars, or any other four items you want. Just limit it to one per square.

, Now the triangles should be facing up.








, Each triangle is divided into two parts, for a total of eight triangles. Number the triangles 1 through 8. Number the first two triangles 1 and 2, the second ones 3 and 4, and so on until you've gone up to 8.








, Open up triangles 1 and 2 and write a fortune under each number. Do the same for 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, so you have a total of 8 fortunes in your fortune teller. The fortunes you write can be anything at all. You might have to write in very small print to fit everything in! Here are some examples of fortunes you could write: 








Something amazing is coming your way tomorrow.
You're destined to marry Justin B. when you're 23.
You will fail the math test tomorrow, but you'll still get an A in the class.
You will live a very long and happy life, but you'll never be a millionaire.
Your future will be bleak unless you make a big personal change.
You'll never know if he likes you back unless you ask today.

, That means the side with the colors should be facing you.








, Lift up the squares slightly so that you can fit your thumbs are under the bottom two flaps and your forefingers are under the top two. With your fingers inside, each square forms a little cone. Hold the fortune teller so the tips of the cones are all touching in the middle.








, Pinch your fingers and thumbs together, then pull them apart. The four sections of the fortune teller will move in and out with your fingers. When you move the sections back and forth, the fortune teller will look like a mouth opening and closing.








, Now it's time to have some fun with your fortune teller. Get the fortune teller ready by putting your fingers and thumbs inside the four cone-shaped compartments. Hold the tips together in the center, so that all you can see are the four different colors on the tops of the flaps. Then play the game like this:









Have someone pick one of the colors.
Spell out the color and move the fortune teller in or out for each letter. For example, if the person says ""red,"" move the fortune teller out for ""r,"" in for ""e,"" and out again for ""d."" Pause it in place where it lands.
Have the person look into the ""mouth"" of the fortune teller and pick one of the four numbers that's visible. Let's say she picks 5. Move the fortune teller in, then out, then in, then out, then in, for a total of five moves. Pause the fortune teller in place where it lands.
Have the person look into the fortune teller and pick a new number. This time, open the flap and read the fortune that goes with that number.

Learn about the founding artists.,
Start with the right supplies.,
Draw a border.,
Draw a string.,
Start creating a tangle.,
Don't erase mistakes.,
Keep going until you're finished.,
(Optional) Once your tile is finished, you can add color to your art.",How to Make a Zentangle," A Zentangle drawing is an abstract, patterned drawing created according to the tenets of the Zentangle Method. Using the standard format of a 3.5-inch square tile (means piece of square paper), the artist creates a structured pattern according to his or her whim following a basic set of guidelines. No technology, special materials, or educational background are necessary to become a Zentangle artist. Here are a few characteristics of a Zentangle:


The tile should not have an ""up"" or a ""down"" - it is without orientation.
It should not be representative of any certain recognizable object; rather, it should be abstract.
The drawing should be completed in 'black ink on white paper with gray pencil shading.
A Zentangle is meant to be portable, so that it can be created at any time the mood strikes.;
, The Zentangle Method is very different from regular drawing, painting and other art forms. It is meant to be a form of artistic meditation that anyone can do. The act of creating the Zentangle is just as important as the final outcome, which is appreciated for its unique beauty. Zentangle creations adhere to the following philosophical tenets:


Its creation is unplanned. When you begin creating a Zentangle, you're encouraged not to have an end goal in mind. Rather, allow the pattern to reveal itself as you draw.
Its creation of a Zentangle drawing is deliberate, yet unexpected. Each stroke should be made deliberately, rather than hesitantly. Instead of erasing stray marks, the artist should use them as the foundation for an unexpected pattern.
Its creation is celebratory. Like meditation, the Zentangle Method is meant to feel freeing and healing. It's a way to celebrate the beauty of life.A Zentangle is timeless. No technology or special tools are used. Zentangles should connect those who make them to the timeless human endeavor of putting pen to paper.

, Many people create doodles - sometimes beautiful ones - in the margins of notebooks and on scrap paper. Doodles are usually created during times when the person making them is having trouble paying attention to something else that's going on, like a lecture or a phone call. Though the best doodles can look similar to Zentangles, they're actually very different. Here's how:


The Zentangle Method helps you create a feeling of """"relaxed focus"""". Unlike doodling, the person creating a Zentangle is giving it his or her full, undivided attention. A Zentangle cannot be created while on the phone or to let yourself be distracted during a lecture, because attention is an inherent part of this art form.
The Zentangle Method is a ceremony. Since a Zentangle deserves the artist's utmost attention. It should be created in a quiet place where focus and reverence can be achieved. The paper and pens used should be of highest quality, since a Zentangle is a work of art that can be enjoyed for a long time to come.

, The Zentangle Method was invented by Rick Roberts and Maria Thomas, when they discovered that the act of drawing abstract patterns with the constraint of a few basic rules was extremely meditative.


In order to teach the Zentangle Method, one must be certified as a Zentangle Teacher.There are over one hundred tangles (these are patterns) (re-)created by Zentangle. If you want to recreate one of the originals, there are tutorials online and books and kits available for purchase. Works that are reminiscent of the drawing method Zentangle but don't adhere to the official guidelines are referred to as Zentangle-inspired art.

, The Zentangle Method encourages using fine printmaking paper to use as a foundation for Zentangles. It should be plain white, unlined paper. Cut your paper into a 3.5"" square piece.


Handmade or textured paper is fine, as long as it doesn't have patterns.
You can use colored paper if you want, but wouldn't be considered a true Zentangle according to the Zentangle Method.

, Use a pencil to draw a light square border around the edges of your paper. The pattern you make will be drawn inside the perimeters of the border. Do not use a ruler or any sort of straight edge to draw your border. Just sketch it lightly near the edges of the paper.


It's completely fine if your hand wavers while you draw the border. The border will be a unique, original constraint inside which your pattern will emerge. If it has wavy lines or looks uneven, your finished Zentangle will be that much more original.
Do not press down too hard with the pencil as you freehand the border. It is not meant to be visible once you finish creating your Zentangle in pen.

, Take your pencil and draw a ""string"" inside the border. According to the Zentangle Method, a string is a curved line or squiggle that will lend structure to your design. The pattern you create will emerge according to the contours of your string. It should a lightly-sketched, simple, abstract form that elegantly divides the border into sections.


Again, don't press down too hard with your pencil as you draw the string. It will not be visible once your Zentangle is finished. It is meant to serve as a guide for your pattern.
Some people find it hard to determine how to draw the string. Remember that the philosophy behind a Zentangle is that it should feel pleasurable, celebratory and natural. Draw whatever comes out when you touch your pencil to the paper - there's no wrong way to do it.
If you want ideas for creating different strings, there are string patterns available online., A ""tangle"" is a pattern drawn in pen along the contours of a string. One Zentangle may have just one tangle, or a combination of different tangles. Use your pen to begin drawing whatever pattern comes to you - again, there's no right or wrong move inside a Zentangle. As you work, keep the following in mind:


Tangles should be composed of very simple shapes. A line, a dot, a circle, a squiggle, or an oval are all acceptable.
Penciled shading can be added to the tangles to create more depth and visual interest. This is not mandatory, but you're free to do so if you'd like.

, You can't erase mistakes you make in pen. That's part of the reason tangles are created in pen, not pencil, aside from any shading you might want to add. There's no going back.


Every tangle is built stroke by stroke. Pay attention to each stroke you make, and build your pattern in a deliberate fashion.
Focus intently on your work. Just as you would while meditating, free your mind of worries and problems. Remember that the act of creating a Zentangle should feel ceremonial.

, You'll know when it's time to put down your pen. Keep your Zentangle in a safe place, or frame it and display it for long-term enjoyment.

, However, please note that this is not part of the official Zentangle instructions.

Position your stencil on your light box.,
Place the cardstock on top of the stencil.,
Turn the lightbox on and emboss your card by hand.Use your stylus or embossing tool, and apply pressure around the interior edges of the stencil.",How to Emboss Paper1," If you do not have a light box, you can use any transparent surface with a bright light behind it. You can try a window, glass table or clear plate with a flashlight or bright light behind it. The objective is to be able to see the outline of your stencil through the paper.






;
, The light from the lightbox will shine through the stencil so that you are able to trace around it with ease. To keep the cardstock stationary as you work, tape the stencil to the front of the cardstock or tape it to the lightbox.







, You do not need to press over all the open area, as pressing along the edges will create the embossing.









With the embossing stylus pen, trace the edges of the shape that are lit by the lightbox. The fine point of the stylus is ideal for small areas, while the larger side is great for large areas.Using the embossing tool to trace around the stencil’s edges will cause the paper to stretch and subsequently achieve the raised, embossed effect.

Know the two different types of paper curling tools.,
Make or buy your quilling strips.,
Try coiling the paper.,
Gently pull the coil off.,
Glue your paper together.,
Pinch the coil into a shape if desired.,
Glue all your pieces together.,
Finished.

,
Try out some patterns.",How to Do Quilling," These two tools are the slotted tool and the needle tool. The slotted tool is best for beginners, while the needle tools lends itself to a more perfect creation. You can also use a toothpick or corsage needle if you do not want to buy either of these tools.Slotted tool: This is thin pencil-like instrument with a slit or slot at the top. The one downside of the slotted tool is that it creates a tiny crimp in the center of the paper where you slide the paper into the head of the tool. If this doesn’t bother you then you should definitely try this tool when you are first starting out.
Needle tool: This tool is harder to use but will result in an uncrimped (meaning it looks more professional) and perfect spiral.;
, The art of quilling is based, not surprisingly, on the paper used to make your pieces of art. Quillers use thin strips of colorful paper, curling them with their tools to form incredible designs. You can make your own strips by cutting pieces of paper into equal-sized strips, or you can buy pre-cut paper. The length of your strips will depend on the pattern that you are following., Before you make any cool decor, make a bunch of plain coils. To get started, insert one end of a quilling strip into the tiny slot in your quilling tool. Make sure it's nice and snug, then start twirling the tool away from you. The paper should wrap around the end of the quilling tool, making a coil. Keep twirling the paper until the whole quilling strip is twisted on the quilling tool.To try coiling with a needle tool or toothpick, get your fingers a little damp and then curve one end of paper strip around the needle (or other tool). Use your thumb and index finger to apply pressure and roll the paper around the needle.

, When you have rolled the piece of paper all the way around your tool, take it off. If you want a loose coil, put it down and let it loosen.

, Once the coil is as big or small as you want it, glue the tail. You should only apply a tiny amount of glue. Use a toothpick, paper piercing device, or T-pin to dab a small amount of glue on the inside side of the end of the paper (the tail). Hold for twenty seconds.Basic glue, such as Elmers, will work just fine for quilling. You could also try tacky glue, as it dries more quickly than basic glue. You could also try water-based super glue, which dries incredibly quickly and holds the paper well.

, If you do this or not will depend on the pattern you are following. You may want to pinch it into an eye shape for a leaf. You could also do a triangle for an ear. The possibilities are endless!

, Again, be very sparing with the glue--glue can make the paper soggy or warp your masterpiece. It is almost impossible to have too little glue. Remember to hold the pieces together for twenty seconds!,, You can go to a craft store and buy a book of quilling patterns, search the internet for quilling patterns, or try out some of wikiHow’s patterns! These wikiHow patterns include:

Choose whichever picture you would like to turn into a template.,
Identify what part of the picture is the main outline (too many details can overcrowd the embroidery) and what colors of thread you would like to use for it.,
Take a piece of corrugated cardboard and set the paper you want to work the embroidery onto on top of that.,
Punch out the outline with a needle or pin.,
Take the paper out from between the cardboard and template.

,
Thread the needle with one of the outline colors chosen and begin on one end of a line.,
Tie the thread neatly once the line is done.,
Continue on until the piece is done.

,
If the picture was done just for display, take the finished product and find a neat sheet protector sleeve, frame, or other holder to display it.",How to Do Paper Embroidery," It has to be a picture you wouldn't mind throwing away once you are done with it and it has to be a physical picture, like a printed or photocopied piece.;
, The colors would have to match the color of the item it is outlining.

, Then take the template to put over that. Hold them in place with either staples - if the embroidery is smaller than the space being used and you don't mind the holes left behind - or paperclips. Paperclips can hold the paper in place, but be careful that you don't slide the paper on accident.

, Make sure that there is an ample amount of room between the holes and that you punch out outlines in even numbers. The former would prevent tearing, and the latter makes sure that each hole has a pair so that the thread always ends up clean on the top.

,, Start by going through the back side of the paper and reach over to the hole's pair. Continue on until the line is finished.

, This can be done multiple ways. The thread can be cut off the needle and tied like shoelaces. Or, the thread can be taken into a loop and tied before the thread is cut off the needle.

,, If the picture was done on a card or other craft project, do with it accordingly.

Prepare the cardstock for embossing.,
Press the rubber stamp you chose lightly onto the embossing pad.,
Stamp the paper with your coated stamp.,
Sprinkle embossing powder over the stamped location.Make sure all the embossing solution is completely covered.,
Emboss the design onto the paper with your heat gun.",How to Emboss Paper2," Set your large piece of scrap paper, like a place mat, in front of you. Place your cardstock in the middle of the scrap paper. Lay out your cardstock so the surface you want to emboss on is faced upward.

, Look at the stamp to make sure the surface of the stamp is completely covered with the embossing solution from the pad. Firmly press the stamp onto the desired spot on the cardstock.Find a happy medium with the amount of ink you use to cover the surface of the stamp. Too much ink can make the design appear blurred once stamped onto the paper.To ensure a crisp image, carefully lift the stamp straight up. Clean the stamp by wiping any leftover embossing solution off with a damp rag.

, When pressing the stamp against the paper, make sure that level pressure is applied firmly to the stamp’s back to ensure an even application. Follow the stamping up with embossing powder., Lift the card so any embossing powder that did not adhere to the stamped area can fall to the paper below.


You may need to lightly tap the card. Return this unused powder to its container to be used again. Sit your card back down.
Use your paint brush to dust off any embossing granules that remain on the card outside the stamped design.

, Plug in your heat gun and hold it a couple inches away from the card. Move it around above the powdered area. The heat will begin to transform the powder into a raised, shiny coating.Pay attention not to get the heat too close to the card or hold it in one place too long as it can scorch the card and ruin the embossing.
Be careful not to burn yourself with the heat gun or with the finished embossed design. Allow it to cool for at least 30 seconds before touching it."
"
Set up your work station.,
Emboss your card with the embossing machine.,
Remove the embossed paper or cardstock.",How to Emboss Paper3," You will need an embossing machine, an embossing folder, and a piece of cardstock or watercolor paper with measurements of 4 ¼” x 5 ½” so that it fits the embossing folder., Place the embossing folder at the entrance of the embossing machine and crank it through the machine. The roller applies pressure to the paper or cardstock, which creates raised areas onto the paper from the embossing folder.Get your cardstock situated. Place your card face side down over the stencil. Check to make sure you have both the stencil and the card aligned as you desire.
For a deep impression of the stencil, pass the embossing folder through the machine two to three times., Take the embossing folder from the machine and lift it open to reveal the completed embossed paper. If you are using cardstock, consider adding more character by sanding the cardstock with sandpaper to reveal the cardstock’s lighter core. This can add a new design element to its appearance."

",How to Sketch," Just like with any art form, it is difficult to sketch when using poor quality (or the wrong) materials. You can easily find all the proper sketching materials at a local arts and crafts store. Spend a few dollars and gather up all the right materials, including:









H pencils. H pencils are the hardest pencils, and are used for sketching thin, straight, non-blend-able lines. These are mostly used for architecture and business sketches. Get an assortment including 8H, 6H, 4H, and 2H pencils (8H is the hardest, 2H is the softest).
B pencils. B pencils are the softest pencils, and are used for making smudged and blurry lines and for shading your sketch. These are the favorites of many artists. Get an assortment including 8B, 6B, 4B, and 2B (8B is the softest, 2B is the hardest).
Fine art paper. Sketching on regular printer paper may be easy, but the paper is thin and doesn't hold the pencil as well. Use fine art paper with a bit of texture for the easiest time sketching, and for the best overall appearance.;
, For beginners, it is easiest to sketch from a live model or an image, rather than by using your imagination to create an image to draw. Find an image of something you like, or look for an object or person around you to draw. Take several minutes to study the subject prior to beginning to sketch. Pay attention to these things:









Find the source of light. Locating the primary light source will determine where you sketch the lightest and where you sketch the darkest.
Look for any movement. Whether actual movement from a real-life subject or perceived movement in an image, determining movement in your subject will determine the shape/direction you make your sketch strokes.
Pay attention to primary shapes. All objects are made up of a combination of the basic shapes (square, circle, triangle, etc.). Look for the shapes that underlay your subject, and sketch these first.

, A sketch is intended to the the base or draft of an image. Therefore, when you start your sketch you should use a light hand and lots of short, quick strokes. This will make it easier to test out different ways of drawing a particular object, and will allow you to erase mistakes much easier as well.








, Gesture drawing is a form of sketching where you use continuous movements and connected lines to draw your subject, without ever looking at your paper. Although it sounds difficult, it can help you to get a good idea of the basic forms in your drawing, and help to set a base for your final drawing. To do a gesture drawing, look only at your subject and move your hand accordingly on the paper. When possible, avoid lifting your pencil and use overlapping lines. Later, you can go back and erase the extra lines and perfect your sketch.









This is good practice for a sketch - kind of like a pre-sketch.

, Make sure you have enough light. You can sketch at a table, in the park, in the middle of the city in a sketchbook, on regular paper, or even on a napkin.









You might want to try different versions of the same object to brainstorm and later decide which you like best.

, For example, you can draw circles or horizontal lines for five-ten minutes to warm up your hand.








, Move your hand very quickly, using minimal pressure, almost glossing over the page without stopping. Get comfortable with the paper you are working with. At this initial stage, you should barely be able to see the strokes. Consider this to be the foundation of your sketch.








, When you achieve the perfect shape in Step 3, you can then define your strokes more precisely with this darker pencil. Keep adding details. Start adding inner shapes. Make sure they are to scale. For example, when drawing a parking ramp, you want to make sure that the entrances and parking spots are the appropriate size.









When you are finished using this pencil, you will notice smudges on the pages since the lead on this pencil is softer than the previous one. Remove all smudges with the eraser.
Make sure you use a soft eraser like the putty eraser so that your erasing does not rip off the top layer of the page. The putty eraser will lighten your lines, not completely eradicate them.

Repeat the previous steps, but instead of measuring in the reference object every time, draw in everything around the original object measured.,
Remember to relax and always look back at your subject!",How to Use a Pencil to Measure in Drawing," Make sure you find a relatively stationary subject in good lighting, and that it/they won't move midway through your sketch.
, Find the height/length of an object in your subject that can be used for reference, like an eye in a portrait or a single apple in a still life. Holding the pencil, place the tip of your thumb at the point on the pencil to mark the length of the object measured., Use your other hand to copy the length from the pencil to the paper, then draw in the line. Divide this reference line in half and if necessary or long enough, into quarters., This part can be a bit tricky, but remember to always relate the dimensions and proportions of everything back to the original line. Use the half and quarter marks on your reference line to draw in your objects accurately. Reference your reference line. Use it.

For example, if you are drawing a portrait and originally measured the horizontal width of an eye as your reference line, to draw in the nose you would hold up your pencil again and find the width of the base of your nose.
Then you would compare it to the width of the eye (the measurements of the widths should be roughly equal). This step helps you keep everything in the same dimensions.
Use your pencil to measure the distance from the inner corner of the eye to the width of the nose across the nostrils and draw it in.

, If anything seems off, double check the proportions in relation to the original object."

Collect art supplies.,
Find an empty closet, a spare bedroom, or any other private space with a door.,
Put furniture in the room.,
Find empty containers from around the house and put them into your studio.,
Store these boxes under your table, if there is room.,
Decorate your studio.,
Get ready to be an artist.,
Create!",How to Make an Art Studio," The basics are colored pencils, acrylic paints, sketching pencils, erasers, and sketching paper. If you would like, purchase oil paints, watercolor paper, watercolors, pastels, and more. You will also need scissors and glue. Salvage supplies from your basement from when you were a kid, or ask friends and family for extra supplies. You can buy your own if you have the money. If you are a painter, buy an adjustable easel. You can also scope out an arts and crafts store like Michael's. They sell sketching and painting kits, beading kits, and other supplies.;
, This room can be an attic in your house. Make sure that this ""room"" is big. Generally, the bigger the better; it gives you space to put up inspirations and organize art supplies. You will always need an adequate light source. Sunlight is the best source of light. At night, use full spectrum light bulbs, which lets you see colors accurately and eliminate glare and eyestrain. If the floors are carpeted, spread a tarp on the floor where you'll paint. If not, purchase some wood cleaners in case paint gets on the floor.

, You will need a flat table, at least three feet long. This can be a desk, just a table, or other. You might want to purchase a bright light for your table. From your stockpile of supplies, take out two or three sketching pencils, an eraser, a pair of scissors, and a big batch of sketching paper to put on your desk. Put everything but the paper into a pencil holder for easy access. A chair or stool will be necessary as well. Wood or plastic is preferred, as chairs/stools with cloth or cushions may get stained. If you do choose to add a chair with cushions or cloth, make sure the cushion/cloth is removable and washable. You can add other furniture for breaks, like sofas and small coffee tables.

, Or, purchase them from a store. They can be plastic, colorful, with lids, without lids, whatever. You will need open boxes for paper, watercolor paper, canvases, etc. Gather all of your crayons, markers, paints, paintbrushes, pencils, and any other art supplies. Put them all into separate containers, while rooting out supplies you think are broken, dried, or unusable. Label the containers with index cards or labels.

, If not, stack them on the side, or put them on your desk. Make sure the labels on the boxes are facing out. Put open boxes on the floor. If you have any shelves, you can put the boxes into the shelves and pull them out like drawers.

, Paint the walls a funky color. Take photographs of things that inspire you. Find photos of your friends, family, pets, and home. Clip photos from magazines and buy books of interesting and beautiful things to base your art on. Tape all of these photos and images on the wall above your desk to inspire you. Hang things from the ceiling, like little Christmas ornaments, lights, or even just random things you find with yarn, binder clips, and tape.

, Bring paper towels and cleaning sprays into your art studio to make cleaning up messes easier. Find old t-shirts and smocks to protect your clothes. Begin thinking of projects. Be prepared for the worst of messes.

, Use your new space to create beautiful art. Take time after every session in your studio to clean up your mess to keep your beautiful art studio beautiful. Impress your friends with your cool and funky art studio.

Add colors to your drawing with your oil pastels.,
Add more layers of colors to blend them together.,
Have fun.,
Finished.

",How to Draw With Oil Pastels," You should start with an easy subject like a dog, a house, or a lake, if you're a beginner. If you're up for a challenge, you might want to choose something harder, like a person or landscape.;
, Depending on the size you want your drawing to be, choose a paper size that will fit your subject without leaving too much or too little space.


After you finished that, try thinking what hue or texture you want the paper to be. This is optional, but good artists can use different paper hues and textures to create different effects for their drawings.






Also, note the thickness of the paper. A fairly thick kind of paper is recommended, because you would need to press down a lot when drawing with oil pastels so thinner papers may rip under the force. There are many kinds of paper, so try choosing a kind that works best for your goals.

, On the testing sheet, draw something smallish. Don't draw too many details, this is only for testing. It will help you get used to the feel of the paper and the pastels before you start your actual artwork.

, Don't worry about the details yet. The details aren't so important at the moment, however, later they will make the drawing more beautiful! So try adding little details later!

, Plan out your color schemes and which areas you would want to blend colors. Start out by coloring the drawing roughly, and adding more details as you go along.

, Also, try blending them with your finger or an artist's tool to move the oil pastels around the drawing. Using your finger is the recommended method.

, Drawing with oil pastels may be hard, but you can have fun too! Don't think that if you failed you will never be able to make art. Remember that this was still your first attempt and that everyone needs practice to do something well.

Target specific drawing skills.,
Devote some time to drawing.",How to Practice Drawing1," Are you doing pencil drawing? Just scribbling? Generally you'll want a piece of paper or notebook. For a pencil drawing, just use a No. 2 since you are practicing. Also if you are using a pencil, get an eraser. If you would like to color, use markers, colored pencils, paints, pastels, or anything else you would like. Try to get thick drawing paper at an art supply or craft store. Canvas paper or a drawing pad is recommended, but if you're just learning you might want to start with regular sheet paper.;
, Are you already good at drawing animals? Maybe you should focus on humans. If you're struggling with proportions you should try working on that during your practice. Figure out what it is that you want to improve so that you're not just drawing at random. Just drawing isn't necessarily going to make you better - you need targeted practice.


Free drawing is fine too if you want to work on your ability to create in the moment. Graffiti artists often free draw for this reason.

, Imagine going to the gym and doing five sit ups and then leaving. You’re not going to get in better shape doing that, and drawing for five minutes once a week probably won’t help you out either. Try to commit some serious time to drawing if you want to get better. Twenty minutes four days a week isn’t a huge time commitment but will be really beneficial. "

Stay consistent.,
Choose a time every day when you draw.,
Draw for 20 or 30 minutes each session.",How to Practice Drawing2," The most important thing is that you keep drawing. Try to avoid falling into the trap of getting really into the activity for a few weeks and then tailing off. Make it a part of your daily routine.

, Maybe it’s in the morning right after you get up. You can try to draw scenes from your dreams, and it’s a really relaxing way to start the morning. Maybe you prefer drawing in the evening before you go to bed. Whatever works, but choosing a time will help make establishing a routine easier.

, It’s important to spend a decent amount of time drawing. Keep looking for new exercises and things to draw so you avoid getting bored. The more time you commit the better you’ll be in the end.

Take a class at an art school.,
Hire a private drawing tutor.,
Look for free classes at local museums and galleries.",How to Practice Drawing3," Many local colleges allow people to enroll in single classes, but if you don’t want to go that route there are plenty of private art schools around. Look for one in your area. This will help you regiment your time.

, Try reaching out to local art teachers at colleges and high schools. They might have some free time and be willing to tutor you if you offer them a decent salary. Even if you only meet with them once a week for an hour they can help you focus your practice for the rest of the week. They’ll be able to track your progress better than you can alone too.

, Many galleries and museums have free art classes. You won’t have as personalized an experience but it won’t cost you any money either. You often get to hang out in a museum at night and try to draw their exhibits too, which is pretty cool.

Draw monsters and doodle.,
Draw from direct observation.,
Use short lines.,
Practice proportions.,
Draw snakes.",How to Practice Drawing4," Just scribble! Get your creative juices flowing this way. You’ll actually start to observe how things come together, and you’ll start to develop a steady hand. This will also help you hone your creativity because you’ll be drawing all your own ideas.

, This is a great way to learn how things fit together and how to draw common objects. Try to draw the couch in your living room, or the tree in your back yard, or anything else. It’s probably best to start with objects rather than landscapes. Landscapes can be tough because you're dealing with perspective. However, it is completely up to you!

, Short lines make it much easier to draw straight lines, squares, and circles. It’s much more natural for us to draw using short lines. Just try drawing using tiny dashes and you’ll find that you have much more control over your pen or pencil.

, Try to see proportions everywhere. Compare the size of your fingers to the size of your hand, the size of your backpack to that fence off in the distance, etc. Start by drawing the simplest things you can think of, like a square house and a person standing next to it. Once you start to feel comfortable with basic proportions you can move on. , You don’t like snakes? Well, too bad! Drawing snakes is a great way to help you practice drawing parallel and concurrent lines more effectively. It’s a good way to free your hand. If you’re finding it really difficult, start by drawing circles next to each other in the shape of a snake. Make the first circle the largest, and then each one smaller after that. Now draw parallel lines on the top and bottoms of all these circles. That's the idea behind drawing a snake. "

Try to put this line on the upper half of the paper.Also, sketch two quarter circles that get cut off by each bottom corner. Imagine they would wrap around 360 degrees if the paper didn't stop. These two are reference shapes and will be erased later.;
, Draw garden shrubs inside each shape in the bottom corners. You can now erase the two quarter circles themselves, leaving just the plants inside.

, Draw a road that leads off into the distance. Start at the bottom of the page, and make the road get skinnier as you go. Keep the road winding until it dead ends into the bumpy horizontal line you drew earlier, which is now acting as a mountain range in the distance.

, For those who are more comfortable with their artistic skills, draw a tree on the right side of the page. Have the base of the trunk start at the top of the bush on the right side, and start extending branches once the trunk is over the hillside.

, All now that's left to do is draw your sun. Have it peering over the mountainside as kind of a half circle.

The Y-shapes show where the talons will be when you draw the legs. Make sure they are at each end of the line across the tail., The beginning of the leg is a circular shape that sends halfway down the line that leads to the Y-shapes. Use the remaining space between the circles and the y-shapes for the lower legs. then you can draw the talons using the Y-shapes to guide where they will be and how long the ""toes"" are.,  These are Yveltal's ""Fingers."",  Add three spikes to the underside of the wings near the body.  These spikes are more akin to feathers.,,  Draw a short curve from the body towards the right wing.  Then add another curve under it to make it Yveltal's neck. These lines will be connected later when making Yveltal's head. Attempt to follow the sample above to avoid proportion problems.,  Add triangles to the rectangles to make Yveltal's horns.(The horns are the rectangles+the triangles.)  You can finish its face by drawing the beak with a downwards zigzag and connect it to the lower line that makes Yveltal's neck., Draw a curve from the tip of the triangle on Yveltal's chest to the top of the page.  Bring the same curve back down to the other side.  Reconnect this curve to the chest using these lines. This is should vaguely resemble a triangular shape. Be as free handed as you like when drawing Yveltal's mane, as the actual curves in the plumes are variable. Be sure to add feather spikes here and there to give a ruffled, unruly look.,, These are branch-like structures, so make them as harsh and jagged as you like.

Find a suitably sized beauty product bottle that you've finished with.,
Give the bottle a rinse out to remove most of the beauty product left inside.,
Mark the cutting lines on the bottle.,
Cut out the holder shape.,
Cut out the hanger.,
Cover the bottle.,
Use your new charging station.",How to Turn a Plastic Bottle Into a Phone Charging Station," It needs to be large enough to contain your cellphone. Simply hold your mobile phone against it to test the size––the edges should extend around the outside of the phone.


Suitable bottles include lotion, shampoo and conditioner bottles, provided they are large enough and flatter across rather than too rounded.;
, Use hot water for best effect, with a dash of dish detergent. Swish it around strongly a few times, then pour down the drain. Allow it to dry upside down on a dish drying rack before proceeding.


You can wipe out any residual beauty product after cutting it open.

, The back of the bottle will need to be turned into the handle that hangs from the wall alongside the power point, while the front of the bottle needs to be cut high enough to prevent the phone from falling out when placed into the container. Basically, draw a straight line across the front of the bottle and a big ""mound"" at the back, to just under the neck of the beauty product bottle.


Use a marker, pen or other suitable drawing device to make the markings.

, This can be done using scissors or a craft knife. Be careful to try to keep the edges as rounded as possible when cutting the curved parts. Sand any rough edges away.

, This is the bit that will hang from a hook. Cut the hole out, leaving plenty of space between the top of the handle and the hole, to provide the hanging strength. (This part should be at least 2 inches/5cm in width, if not more.) If you have a large craft hole puncher, this might be used instead, to make a pretty shape (just make sure it allows for good hanging though).

, The bottle isn't anything to look at it with its commercial logo and writing on it. You can improve this in one of several ways:

Paint over it using acrylic paint. You could use one color, or vary the colors, or even make a design.






Add adhesive contact paper. Find plain colored contact paper, cut to shape and carefully adhere.






Add fabric. Sand the surface of the bottle first to make it easier for the craft glue to adhere (Mod Podge is a good choice but strong white glue would also work). Then cut the fabric into a rectangle (leaving extra seam at both the top and bottom, as well as wide sides), and glue onto the surface of the container. It works best if you add the glue to the container first. You'll need to keep it tight and smooth out any wrinkles as you're adding the fabric. Cut away the excess fabric neatly when it is all glued into place, then Mod Podge over the top of the fabric layer. Allow to dry.






Be careful to get all edges cut neatly if using adhesive contact paper or fabric.



, You can either hang the charger from a hook attached alongside the power point if preferred.

Sew along the edges of the pillow, BE SURE TO SEW ONLY 3 SIDES LEAVING ONE SIDE OPEN. Be sure you stitches are strong so you won't run into tearing or ripping issues later on.

, that are roughly 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) bigger than your MP3 or iPod. This will serve as its pouch.

, Sew along the edges of the smaller sheets and then be sure to LEAVE ONE SIDE OPEN so sew 3 sides and not all 4.

, Be sure that your MP3 or iPod fits in the smaller pouch comfortably.

, Sew a button on the inside of your smaller pouch (look at other buttons to see examples of how to sew it on) cut a small hole that will fit the button on the other side and make sure your MP3 or iPod can fit in the pouch with the button on there.

, Before attaching the smaller pouch to the big pouch flip the big pouch inside out (so the nice side is facing out)

, Stuff the big pouch of your pillow and make sure you don't over stuff it and provide problems later on but don't under stuff it so its uncomfortable.

, Attach the smaller pouch to the large pouch by opening the small pouch in the big pouch like a mouth and then sewing it around in a circle so you don't sew our pouch shut. (make sure the button side is exposed to the outside.)

, Lastly sew all of the access fabric closed on the 4th side BUT BE SURE NOT TO SEW THE SMALLER POUCH SHUT.

, To use this pillow simply place the iPod or MP3 inside the pouch and close the button to prevent it from falling out and getting lost in the night, or during a pillow fight!

A standard mouse pad is around 8” x 10”, but feel free to customize the size to your personal preference.Use corrugated cardboard, rather than flat cardboard, because it provides a layer of cushioning.
If you have any cardboard boxes on hand, you can simply cut the base of your pad from the side of a box.
If the cardboard you have isn’t thick enough for the mousepad you want, you can glue a few pieces of cardboard together to create your pad’s base.
Instead of cardboard, you can also use a piece of foam core.;
, You don’t want your mousepad to slide around on your desk while you are trying to use it.

You can use shelf and drawer non-slip liner for the bottom of your mousepad. Just cut it to the size of the base of your mousepad. You can find this type of liner in stores like Target, Walmart, Lowes, or Home Depot.
If you don’t buy the adhesive kind of liner, use glue to attach it.
Alternatively, you can use a piece of a rug liner in the same way.
If you want a simple, household nonstick alternative, you can use a piece of double-sided tape on each corner of your pad. Add your tape when you are completely finished constructing your pad. Simply use it to stick the pad to your desk.
You can also use adhesive pads or putty meant for hanging posters.








, This should be the same size as your cardboard and will give your mouse a good surface to move on.

You want to place your foam directly on top of your cardboard surface so that all the sides line up.
After you cut the foam, remove the paper protecting the adhesive and apply it to the top of your cardboard. If the foam you find doesn’t have adhesive, you’ll want to glue the foam in place.
You should be able to find this type of foam at any hobby or craft store.
If you don’t want to use foam, you can just leave the cardboard plain, as it will still function as a mousepad.
Alternatively, you can use something like a piece of cork as this layer of your mousepad. If you have an old bulletin board, simply cut out a piece the size of your pad.








, The beauty in creating your own mousepad is that you can customize it to match your workspace.


Decide if you want it to include a pattern, a solid color, or a photograph.

, Once you know what you want your design to be, decide on a material for the decorative top layer of your mousepad.

Remember that you want your mousepad to stay smooth and flat, so your mouse can move across it easily.
For photographs, you can use simply a printed sheet of paper with your chosen image.
When you’re using a photo, you want to make sure you use a photo that is the size of your mouse pad, rather than gluing a smaller photo in the center.
If you’d rather have a pattern, you can use wallpaper or wrapping paper. Thrift stores are a great place to find cheap remnants of wallpaper perfect for crafting.
Fabric is also a good material for solid or patterned mousepads. You can find fabric at any local hobby store or repurpose an old cotton shirt.








, Whatever material you choose, you’ll need to cut it to the size of your mousepad base.

You want it to be the exact size of the top of your base with clean-cut edges.








, After you cut it to size, you will want to attach your fabric or paper top to the base.

White glue or mod podge works well for paper tops. Just use a paintbrush to spread a thin, even layer of glue onto the surface of your base, and then smooth on your top layer of paper.
If you are using fabric, use fabric glue or a spray adhesive for the best results.
Avoid hot glue, as this will leave lumps in your mouse pad.








, The clear contact paper will protect your design and allow your mouse to move smoothly.

First, cut your contact paper to size. Then, peel off its backing, and apply it to your mousepad. Be sure to smooth out any air bubbles.
You can use the side of a ruler as a tool for smoothing.
If you’d rather skip the decorative paper or fabric, you can simply use an opaque contact paper with a preprinted design.








, To make a very simple pad, you will need a small book or similarly shaped flat object, a plastic envelope, and some tape.


The book inside the envelope creates a nice flat surface for your mouse to glide on.
If you don’t have an envelope, you can also use a zip lock bag.
If you’re in a real hurry, you can use a thick magazine or a book alone as a mousepad. Make sure the book you use has a smooth cover and enough surface area. Simply place the book or magazine beside your computer., If you have a plastic envelope, this works best. It has a smooth surface and a small amount of cushioning.









, This will make your mousepad into a more manageable size for use on your desk. You can leave the envelope whole if you want a very large mousepad or want to reuse the envelope later.









, You’ll want something to put inside of your mousepad to give it weight and give your mouse something to slide around on.

The weight should be slightly smaller than your envelope half.
A slim book works well.
You could also use a scrap of wood or a few small pieces of cardboard.








, You want it to sit comfortably inside the envelope with a bit of room on the end so you can enclose it.









, Use a few pieces of masking tape or clear tape to seal the edges of your envelope. This insures that your weight won’t fall out while you’re using it.









, If you really need a mousepad right away, you can skip this step. However, it can be nice to ensure your pad stays in place on your desk while you use it.

The simplest way to create a nonslip surface is to use a few pieces of double-side adhesive to attach the pad to your desk.
You can also use tape, poster putter, or command hook adhesive.

To avoid damage to your counter/table, you may want to place a piece of cloth between the ball winder and the counter., This can be tricky. Have patience., (Refer to your item's directions to see how to do this. Every ball winder is a little bit different!), You will want to do this slowly at first to get used to how the yarn winds. Different fibers react different ways., If you go too fast, the yarn may get caught in the gears below (on some models.),,,,,,,"

Try to be practical about your yarn purchasing.",How to Organize Your Yarn," Before you can get start getting organized, you need to know what you have. Go through all of it and check the lengths. Only save yarn longer than one yard long. , Although it can be difficult, throw away any yarn you won’t be using for an upcoming project. If you don’t love it or think you will use it in the future, get rid of it. Having less yarn makes it easier to organize and keep it neat.


Make a list of upcoming projects. This can help you have a better idea of how your yarn will be used. It also may help you avoid buying new yarn since you will know what you’ll be working on next.

, There are a number of websites for knitters and crocheters. Some, like Ravelry, have a feature that allows you to photograph your yarn stash and keep a record online. This may be helpful if you’re at the craft store and considering buying new yarn. , Make a separate space to keep any projects you have in progress. A tote bag works great for this purpose and makes your projects more mobile. This also prevents yarn you’re currently using from getting mixed in with your other supplies.


Limit the number of projects you’re working on. Try to keep your current projects to a reasonable number, such as four or five at one time. Spreading yourself too thin with knitting or crochet projects makes it easy for your yarn to end up in disarray.

, To get started organizing, take all your yarn out and separate each skein or ball. Untangle any messy bunches of yarn and roll any loose strands.

, If you have multiple balls or skeins from the same dye lot, store them together to make it easier to put them to use in a project. This is also a good organizational method if you don’t have a lot of yarns of different weights. Combine color coordination with other organizational methods.

, Organizing yarn by different weights can be effective. For example, you can divide your yarn by worsted, chunky, or sport yarn. It makes it easier to start new projects when you know exactly what weights of yarn you already have.

, Sort by different materials, such as wool, acrylic, or cotton. That way, when you start a new project you'll know exactly where to find the fabric you need.

, If you have projects you plan to work on soon, make sure the yarn for them is easily accessible.


Combine color coordination with other organizational methods. There's no need to stick to one method. You can organize similar weights by color as well.

, After deciding how you will sort the yarn, it’s time to select a storage space. If you have skeins of yarn in many different colors, you may want to use these as decoration and display the yarn somewhere it can be seen.

, You may also choose to keep your yarn stored away until you’re ready to use it. Some of the storage containers can either be used in the open or stashed away in a closet or craft room.

, There are a number of different storage containers to keep your yarn organized, depending on whether you want your yarn in the open or out of sight. Storage drawers or bins are some of the most popular choices because storage drawers and bins are cost-effective. They can be purchased at nearly any big box or home store. Buying clear storage containers allows you to display the yarn.


Buy drawer dividers. To keep yarn from getting jumbled up, purchase drawer dividers to further split your skeins and balls up.

, If you have a great deal of yarn and want to put it on display, a bookshelf is a great choice. The yarn is easily accessible. This may be a good solution if you have a dedicated craft room.

, For smaller amounts of yarn that you want to keep out of sight, a hanging shoe organizer is a perfect way to keep your skeins neat. Hang it on the back of a door. This method takes up very little space and prevents you from having to put yarn in plastic bags.

, This method helps you keep yarn out of the way as well as allowing it to be decorative. A peg board and hooks can be purchased at nearly any hardware store. You can hang it behind a door to keep it out of the way. You can arrange yarn balls by color to make the space decorative as well as functional. , After the organizational process, you’ll want to be sure your yarn stays neat in the future. Plastic bags ensure different yarn won't get jumbled up. Label your storage containers with the yarn type.

, Winding yarn transforms messy or loose skeins into tighter, easy-to-store balls. Yarn winders are available at craft stores or online and winding yarn takes relatively little time.

, Unless you have new projects in mind or a specific use for new yarn, don’t buy it. Yarn stashes can quickly grow out of control, and you may end up with more yarn than will be useful to you.

Cut a rectangular piece of cardstock.,
Cut a length of scrap tulle.,
Wrap the working tulle around the cardstock.,
Slide the tube off the cardstock.,
Tie the center.,
Cut the folded edges.,
Fluff the ball.,
Use as desired.",How to Make Tulle Pom Poms1," The dimensions will vary depending on how small or large you want to make the pom pom. The width of the rectangle should match your desired pom pom diameter, and the length should be 1-1/2 to 2 times as long as the width.For a small pom pom, try making a 4-inch (10-cm) by 6-inch (15-cm) rectangle. For a larger pom pom, consider making an 8-inch (20-cm) by 12-inch (30-cm) rectangle.
Alternatively, you could use a hardback book instead of creating a cardstock rectangle. The width of the book should match the desired diameter for your pom pom.;
, This piece of tulle should be about 7 to 10 inches (17.5 to 25 cm) long. Set it aside for later.


You'll eventually use this piece of tulle to hold the center of the pom pom together. If you don't want to use tulle, you could try cutting and using an equal length of ribbon, twine, or coated wire.

, Hold one end of the tulle at the lengthwise edge of the cardstock rectangle. Wrap the tulle completely around the width of the rectangle a total of 30 times, then cut the tulle from its spool after the final pass.


For most sizes, 30 passes should create an adequately fluffy ball of tulle. Extremely small pom poms may require fewer passes, and extremely large pom poms may require more.
You can use one to four colors of tulle. If using multiple colors, hold the different tulle strips together and wrap them simultaneously. Shorten the number of passes according to the number of colors.

One color gets 30 passes.
Two colors get 15 passes.
Three colors get 10 passes.
Four colors get 7 or 8 passes.



, Carefully slide the tube of wrapped tulle off the cardstock rectangle. Pinch the tube together at its center.


When pinched, the tulle tube should have a bow-like shape. The wrapped, rounded edges should fall to both sides of your hand.
Work carefully. If the tulle unravels during this step, you'll need to wrap it around the rectangle again to return it to its tube shape.

, Carefully tie the piece of scrap tulle around the center of your tulle tube, preserving the bow-like shape first created when you pinched the tube with your fingers.


Keep the tie centered around the tube. If it appears off-center, carefully slide it along the width of the tube as needed to position it closer to the center.

, Insert your scissors through the rounded loop ends and cut them apart. Do this on both sides of the tulle tube.

, Gently pull the cut tulle ends toward the center of the pom pom, fluffing and shaping them as needed to hide the tied center and give the pom pom a rounded shape.


Some pieces will likely appear longer than others. If this happens, carefully trim them down using your scissors to give the pom pom a more rounded shape.
During this time, you can also trim away any excess tulle, ribbon, or coated wire peeking out from the center of the pom pom.

, Once the tulle pom pom is adequately round and fluffy, it's done and ready to use.

Cut out a cardboard circle.,
Cut out the center of the circle.,
Create a second cardboard ring.,
Place a length of ribbon between the pieces.,
Trim a length of tulle.,
Wrap the tulle around the cardboard sandwich.,
Cut around the edges.,
Tie the ribbon around the tulle.,
Pull off the cardboard.,
Fluff the tulle.,
Use as desired.",How to Make Tulle Pom Poms2," Draw and cut out a circle from plain cardboard. The diameter of this circle will match the diameter of the pom pom.For a small pom pom, you could trace around the mouth of a standard drinking glass, creating a circle with a diameter of about 6 inches (15 cm).
For a medium pom pom, consider using a diameter of about 12 inches (30 cm).
For a large pom pom, create a circle with a diameter between 24 and 30 inches (61 and 76 cm).

, Using a straight razor, cut a second circle out from the center of the larger circle. The diameter of this circle should be no more than one-third the diameter of the larger circle.


You can discard the small circle. The only piece you need for your pom pom is the large cardboard ring.

, Follow the previous steps to create a second cardboard ring identical to the first.


You can make the process easier by tracing the outer and inner edges of the first ring onto the cardboard you'll use for the second ring.

, Cut a piece of skinny ribbon long enough to wrap around the outer circumference of the cardboard rings. Sandwich this piece of ribbon in between the two rings.


If you don't have ribbon, you could use string, twine, or yarn. To create a more durable pom pom, consider using a more durable material like coated wire.
Form a U-shaped loop with the ribbon and lay it flat on top of one cardboard ring. It should lie between the two edges of the ring. Place the second ring directly on top, aligning the edges of this ring to the edges of the bottom ring and securing the ribbon in between both., Cut 1 to 3 yards (1 to 3 m) of tulle, depending on the size of the ring.


Small rings need 1 yard (1 m), medium rings need 2 yards (2 m), and large rings need 3 yards (3 m).
You can use one or two colors of tulle. If using one color, cut the tulle to the full length. If using two colors, halve the lengths; for instance, use 1/2 yard (1/2 m) of one color and 1/2 yard (1/2 m) of the second color to wrap a small ring instead of using a full 1 yard (1 m) of both colors.

, Position one end of the tulle along the outer edge of the cardboard, then wrap the tulle over the surface, through the empty center, and back around the other side of the ring.


Continue wrapping the tulle around the cardboard sandwich in this manner, working until you run out of tulle. Use your fingers to adjust the placement of the tulle as needed so that the entire ring is evenly covered.
If you use two colors of tulle instead of one, treat the two pieces as one piece. Do not wrap them separately.

, Slide a pair of scissors over the tulle folds. Cut these folds around the entire outer circumference of the ring.


Work carefully to avoid accidentally cutting the ends of your center ribbon.
After cutting the tulle, you should see two distinct sides connected only at the center.

, Carefully separate the two cardboard rings, opening them just wide enough to reveal the center ribbon. Tie this center ribbon into a tight knot around the center of the tulle.


It's crucial that you tie the ribbon into a tight knot. If you tie it too loosely, the pom pom will fall apart once you remove the cardboard.

, Carefully pull the cardboard rings off either side of the tulle structure.


After removing the cardboard, you should be able to see the basic pom pom shape.

, Gently pull the edges of the tulle pom pom toward the center, fluffing and positioning the pieces as needed to create a rounded ball.


During this step, you should use the tulle to cover the center string. If the string is too long to hide, trim off a portion of the ends.
If the edges of the tulle appear uneven once you fluff the pom pom, use scissors to carefully trim away any excessively long pieces, giving the pom pom a more rounded shape.

, Once you're satisfied with the shape and fluffiness of the pom pom, it's done and ready to use.

Decide on how many pieces of yarn to use.,
See if you like how it looks.,
Put the selected yarns into a plastic bag.,
Use a circular knitting needle.,
Turn your knitting and head back until you get to the end of the row.,
Notice that you have a tail hanging from the threads.,
Continue on to the end of the row.,
Continue doing this until you have got all the stitches where you want them to be; you can knit, purl, do any stitch you want.

",How to Make Tweed Yarn," You can use as many threads as wished, 2,3,4,5,6–however many pieces of yarn you need. This article demonstrates the technique using 4 pieces. The pieces don't have to be the same size, weight etc.;
, Put the yarns together and twist them. If you like the way that it looks, then you are ready to go.

, Close the bag but leave a small opening that allows the yarn to come through. Use paper clips or bulldog clips to close the bag.

, Knot the yarn around the needle and start casting on. Keep knitting as many stitches as you need. The best way to use this technique is to make a scarf because it doesn't really matter how big or how little it is. Otherwise, just make a swatch to see how many stitches you get to an inch, and then you can make a sweater or any other garment wished.

, Once done, you are ready to purl back or knit back, depending on what stitch you want. A couple of rows of garter stitch are always good when starting a scarf, for instance.

, Use these; slip the first stitch, knit the second with the tail, the third with the tail, and the fourth with the tail. Drop it. You can cut if off later; for now it is not going to go anywhere because it is now woven in.

, Turn the work around and knit back. When you get to the end stitches that you have knitted in double, don't separate them, so knit them together. Knit the last stitch.

, Take the rest of your yarn, and place it horizontally across your fingers. If you want a standard sized pompom, drape it across your forefinger and middle finger. If you'd like a bigger pompom, extend the yarn over your ring finger too.








, Do not wrap the yarn too tightly, or you will risk cutting off your circulation. If your fingers start to turn blue or purple, you are wrapping too tightly. Wrapping the yarn too tightly will also make it harder to slide it off in the end. How many times you wrap the yarn around your fingers will depend on how big you want the pompom to be:








If you are using two fingers, wrap the yarn 100 to 125 times.
If you are using three fingers, wrap the yarn 125 to 150 times.

, Hold your yarn bundle together as you pull it off so that it doesn't come apart. Make sure that you place it in the center of your short piece of yarn.








, Pull both ends of the yarn towards yourself, then tie them together into a tight knot over the center of your yarn bundle. This is very important. If the knot is not tight, the pompom won't hold together.







, Bring the two yarn ends towards yourself again, and tie them into another tight knot. Tie them together once more to make a secure double knot.








, Be sure to cut through all of the loops, or your pompom won't look right in the end.








, You can do this with your fingers, or by gently rolling it between your palms. Don't panic if a few strands come out; this is normal.








, Your pompom is mostly done, but it may look a little scruffy. Neaten it up by trimming off any long bits of yarn that stick out. Do this by carefully rotating the pompom between your fingers, and cutting away any pieces of yarn that are longer than the rest.

If you're working with a single-ply or ""single"" yarn, use the point of the knitting needle or your fingernails to fray the end of the strand, separating the fibers.
Do this with both pieces of yarn you intend to splice together, then lay the separated strands end-to-end.;
,, Leave the other plies aside for now.








,


If you're working with a single-ply yarn made of natural fibers that will felt, twist both frayed lengths together. If you're working with a single-ply yarn made of man-made fibers, you have the choice of twisting both frayed ends together or twisting just some of the fibers from each end together.

,









Natural fibers such as wool and angora will felt; most man-made yarns will not. But you should still work man-made fibers and forth to make sure they're tightly twisted together.

,,









If you're working with natural fibers, moisten your hands again to help felt the remaining loose fibers into the spliced strand.
You also have the option of leaving the loose strands hanging. You can work them into the fabric as you knit past the splice, or use a yarn needle or crochet hook to thread the loose ends later--although having to thread loose ends into your work defeats the original purpose of splicing yarn together.

, The circle should be ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) wide. The bigger your outer circle is, the bigger your inner circle should be. Avoid making the inner circle too big, however, or you'll have a hard time tying your pompom together.








, Cut your larger circle out first, then the smaller one. You will end up with something that looks like a doughnut. If you are a child doing this craft, ask an adult to help you with this step.








, The slit needs to go from the outer edge straight down to the inner edge. This will make wrapping the yarn around your doughnut easier.







, Stack the doughnuts one on top of the other, and make sure that the slits are aligned. You will be treating these as one doughnut until the very end.







, The easiest way to do this would be to start at one edge of the slit, going all the way around your doughnut, and finishing at the other edge of the slit.








, Try to wrap as evenly as you can, and not so tightly that the cardboard starts to twist and warp.If you'd like, you can switch yarn colors to create a more interesting-looking pompom.







, Snip off the excess yarn first, then slid your scissors between the yarn and the cardboard. Pull your scissors towards the edge of your doughnut, and start cutting through the yarn. Hold your yarn together, and don't let it come apart.








, Separate your two cardboard doughnuts enough so that you can slide your yarn in between them. Tie the ends of your yarn into a tight knot. Wrap them back in the opposite direction, then tie them into a tight, double knot.








You can choose to snip off the excess pieces of yarn, or you can tie the ends into a loop so that you can hang it.

, If you need to, you can tear them to make things easier, but keep in mind that if you do that, you won't be able to reuse them.








, You can do this by gently going through it with your fingers. You can also roll it between your palms instead. Don't worry if a few pieces of yarn come out.








, Your pompom might still have some scraggly bits coming off of it, especially after all that fluffing. Rotate the pompom between your fingers, and snip off any long pieces of yarn that stick out.

Slide the wrapped yarn off of the fork, then snip through the loops on either side.,
Even out the pompom.",How to Make a Yarn Pompom3," You can use a plastic fork, but a metal fork will be less likely to bend or snap. Because you are working with such a small tool, consider working with a thinner type of yarn, rather than a bulky type.








, Not only will you ruin the fork, but the pompom may not come out even. It will also make the pompom more difficult to tie at the end.








, You will be using this to tie your pompom together. If you want, you can thread this through a yarn needle. This will make tying your pompom together easier.








, Thread the yarn through the middle of the fork, right under the wrapped yarn first. Next, wrap it over the top of the wrapped yarn, and back under it, as tightly as you can.








, Snip off any excess yarn, or tie it into a loop if you'd like to hang your pompom.








, Gently fluffy the pompom out. You can do this with your fingers, or by rolling it between our palms. Don't worry if you lose a few threads.








, At this point, you are done. Your pompom may look a little bit scraggly, however. If this bothers you, use a pair of scissors to trim off any uneven bits of yarn so that you get a ball-shape. This will also help make your pompom look more dense."

,
Find things to make with your dog yarn.",How to Make Dog Yarn," Your dog's fur must be at least two inches (5cm) long, clean and unmatted. If it's a little shorter than that, it may need to be mixed with other types of fiber (e.g. wool) so that it holds together. Any fur under 1 inch (2.5cm( should be discarded as it will shed far too much when spun and made into fabric.;
, Some areas of the dog may have little undercoat and mainly guard hair. Don't save fur from these areas. Focus on the ruff, shoulders, back, sides and belly.Separate the thicker and tougher guard hairs from the soft cotton-like undercoat. Clippings, if used, should be sorted similarly. Only save the soft undercoat. Remove any foreign material that you encounter.

, You can use the same procedure as for Angora fiber: How to Card Angora Fiber.

, There are several ways to do this:


Finger spin. Take some fur in one hand and take a small piece of it with another hand and twist. Keep a firm grip and don't let it untwist. Keep twisting and it will soon turn to yarn. Spin about one and a half yards and keep it for the next step.







Use a hand spindle.

, Leave about 1⁄2 to 3⁄4 inch (1.3 to 1.9 cm) left of the larger circle, making it a thick ring. You now have your templates. You can make them any size you want, but small ones work best.








,, Using any color yarn you like, start wrapping yarn around BOTH of the rings. Continue until you can't see the rings at all, then do a second layer. The more layers you add, the denser your pom pom will be.








, Using an exact blade or a pair of scissors, cut around the outside edge of your rings. When you are finished cutting and it starts to look more like a pom pom, take your set-aside length of yarn and slip it in between your templates. Tie a tight and secure knot.








, Roll the pom pom in your hands to make it even, and trim off any hanging strings, If you are making a Christmas ornament, leave the two ends of string hanging out of the pom pom and tie their ends together. Your finished pom pom is ready to roll!

, The best clay for this project is air-dry clay, as it dries quickly and without having to fuss with heating. The remaining requirements for building this stand are listed under Things You'll Need below., Mold it into a spherical shape. It does not have to be perfect.,, Do this by cutting off the edges with the ruler.

The size of the square is dependent on the size of your phone. Use the measurements made earlier to assist with this.

, Check that it is as long (horizontal) as your phone. Fold up one long side and the two short sides, leaving one long side unfolded (this side will be where the cradle is attached)., Once again mold it into a sphere. Make sure that this sphere is larger than the one made before., This time, mold it into a rectangular shape, again using a ruler. Make sure it is the same length as the base.

The size of the rectangle is dependent on the size of your phone. Use the measurements made earlier to assist with this.

, Use your finger to smooth one side of the rectangle into this side of the base.

As you attach the cradle, ensure that it tilted at a slight angle, for holding the phone.

, This will prevent the phone from sliding off and keeps it in place., Check for the need to make further adjustments, such as any widening, changes of angles or improving the edges, etc. When all adjustments have been made, you're ready to complete the project., It should appear even and neat all over the project., Using leftover clay, make fun things such as animals, objects like candy or shapes. Add anything you fancy to make your phone stand really pretty.,,

To test for dryness, you can stick your fingernail in the clay. If a nail print shows, the clay is not yet dry.

, You can try using one color for a simple look, it's up to you. If using more than one color, consider how to arrange or merge the colors so that they complement each other., Use clean, neat strokes, being careful not to paint over any decorations.,, Be careful to avoid painting over any decorations.,, You can glue gems, add stickers, ribbons, etc., to personalize the phone stand., Test before putting your phone into the cradle and base of the stand., Put the stand where it is most convenient and admire your handiwork."

You can find physical stores in your area but there are also a number of online retailers. Of course, if you find another option that you like better, you can take that option!;
, When looking at places to buy leather, you should look at how they are selling it. Good leather is usually bought by the square foot or by the piece. You can also buy scrap leather by the bag. If someone's selling you leather that doesn't seem right, be wary.

, Not only will scars, brands, and bites make your final product difficult to tool and look bad, they're also a sign that a leather vendor is supplying their leather from places that treat their cows terribly. You don't want to have any part in animals being abused, so buy your leather from good sources.

, It is said that writers need to write a few hundred thousand words before any of the words are good. For leather working, you're going to have to do some bad work before you're ready to start doing good work, so you should not start by buying fancy leather. Buy scrap leather by the bag or any other cheap beginner's leather. You'll know when you're ready for something a little nicer!

, For tooling, cow leather that has been vegetable tanned is the best option. Other leathers can be used for other details, but cow veg tan is your friend when it comes to tooling.


You will want to avoid leather that is intended for furniture and leather that is textured. These are not suitable for tooling.

, Different projects will need leathers of different thicknesses. Make sure you're getting the right thickness for what you want to do. Leather thickness is measured by the ounce. For tooling, 2-3 ounces is too thin. Start instead with 3-4 ounces and use thicker leather depending on your purposes.


Weights translate to a standard range of millimeters. You may want to test the thickness of your leather pieces when you buy a new batch to make sure that you got what you paid for.

, There's no reason to go straight into professional, expensive tools. In fact: it's best to start off with a beginners set because everyone tools differently and what works for someone else may not work for you. You want to be able to experiment. Good starter sets can be bought at very reasonable prices from stores like Tandy, both online and locally.

, Modeling tools, while technically designed for clay, can be extremely useful for leather crafting as well. Tools like a stylus are commonly used, as are tools like a modeling spoon.

, You should never cut your leather on scrap wood or any surface with a texture (and of course you don't want to cut on a surface you want to preserve), because the texture can be transferred to the leather and even make the leather more difficult to cut. You want to use a marble or granite cutting board. These can be purchased or you can ask a local contractor or granite supply company for scrap.


A rubber mat underneath can dim some of the sound and keep your cutting board in place.

, A mallet is a universal tool that you will need for doing almost any style of tooling. You want to to use a poly mallet when you start learning to work with leather. Never use a metal mallet and avoid wood mallets (as they are delicate). Rawhide mallets are good but expensive, so if you want to experiment with these, wait until later.

, If you have to buy tools individually, focus on buying the most basic, most useful tools. A stylus, a swivel knife, a modeling spoon, a beveler, a mallet, and a few basic stamps (often also called single-action tools) will get you through learning the craft.

, Tools come in a number of sizes and the standard sizes are usually for large, male hands. If you are younger or generally have smaller hands, getting smaller sized tools will make the tool significantly easier to use.

, Stamps and the traditional shapes of leather working tools almost have a unique language unto themselves. Most of the tools will have names that do not seem to make sense, but almost all of them refer to the traditional cowboy leather designs and the specific purpose those tools were meant to serve. Learning the names for the tools can be extremely useful, especially for understanding instructions that you find online and for finding the tools you need.

, Tooling leather is just like traditional sculpting: there are lots of tools and everyone uses them in slightly different ways. You should not feel like just because you use a stamp to get one look when it's really for getting another, that you're somehow wrong. Whatever works for you and looks good is fine.

, The easiest and cheapest way to make your pattern is to simply print it out at home on normal printer paper. You can also trace the design onto wax or tracing paper. However, you should never use carbon paper or draw a design directly onto the leather.


This is an optional step, as you can do your leather tooling freehand or by creating your own pattern.

, Cut the leather into the size and shape of the final piece (a belt if you're making a belt, the side of a saddle, the long rectangle of a wallet, etc). Do not ever use scissors to cut this type of leather however. Scissors are only suitable for very thin, fabric-like leather. You should instead use a box cutter or x-acto knife.

, Casing leather is just a fancy word for getting it wet, but that doesn't mean you should go straight for some water. Water is perfectly usable but a casing solution (which you can buy from leather stores and online) will help protect your leather from water stains. Just apply your liquid of choice over the surface area that you'll be working with, using a spray bottle or sponge.


You don't want to soak or over-wet the leather, however. Apply the liquid in moderation.
Generally you don't want to case a single area more than once. If you need to stop working for awhile, wrap the leather in plastic wrap and put it in the fridge.

, Wait until the leather starts to turn back to its original color and then start tracing your design. Simply align your pattern and then use a dull pencil or modeling stylus to ""draw"" over the design on the paper. You should not press hard. Lift up the paper and you will see that the casing allows the light pressure of your drawing to transfer the design temporarily onto the leather.

, With this temporary outline, you will want to cut the main lines of the design onto the leather. Hold the swivel knife like a pen you're clicking down the end of, with your pointer finger in the saddle and your thumb and middle finger on the barrel. Hold it so that the blade is straight up and down and place the back corner into the leather. Then, pull the blade towards you. Keep your wrist straight and turn the blade as necessary by moving your fingers on the barrel.


The blade should always be pulled towards you, so you will have to adjust your leather accordingly.
It is a good idea to spend a lot of time practicing with the swivel knife on scrap leather before starting a serious project. This will help you learn how to move the blade to get the look you want.
You can change the speed, pressure, and length of the stroke to get different looks. For example, a quick, short pull can create a whisker look.

, With your main lines cut into the leather, you'll want to decide which areas should be lower and which should be raised. You'll also want to think about which areas will need shading or texture. Planning this out ahead of time and mapping it on your sketch can be useful in creating a professional final look.

, You can use tools like the modeling spoon to press down the edges on one side of the design or the other, in order to make it look raised or make it look embedded. Just make sure to stay consistent which which areas get raised or lowered!

, Now you can pull out your stamps! Place a stamping tool against your leather, so it is standing up vertically but resting evenly on the leather. Tap or double-tap the mallet down vertically against the top of the leather tool to imprint the design. Begin by using a scrap piece of leather until you realize how much pressure you must exert.


The mallet should not be slammed down on the tool. When you use a stamp, the impression should not break the surface of the leather and create ""walls"" allowing you to see the sides. The tool should also be held loosely, so that it can bounce back up after being tapped.
In your practice, aim to stamp the leather only once per placement on the leather. Some larger stamps may require two or more strikes of the mallet. In this case, line the stamp up again with the imprints you have already made and strike it again.

, Tooling, especially tooling large areas on leather, will make the leather warp. An easy way to combat warping is to weigh the piece down when you are done so that it dries in the appropriate shape. You don't need to use anything too heavy and be careful of placing anything with a texture onto the wet leather.

, Use a bevel tool to cut the square off of the edge of your leather. This will keep the edges from rolling up over time. It is only necessary to bevel one side of the leather: the back side can remain flat. Pay special attention to any sharp corners on your leather piece. These will need to be beveled separately, creating a diagonal or cut corner.

, With your edges beveled, you can move on to adding whatever finish is appropriate for your leather. You can use a resist to keep it a particular area clear of the finish or to reduce the coloring. Just be sure to always use gloves when using dyes or finishes....unless you like your hands a different color!


Tandy sells excellent finishes in a variety of colors. To apply these, use a paper towel, wool dauber, or a natural or very old sponge (regular sponges contain a chemical that does not react well with the leather).
You can also use dyes. There are dyes intended for leather, but some leathers can also be dyed with shoe polish! These should be applied in the same way as the finishes.
Acrylic paint thinned with water works on leather, if you'd prefer a painted look. Just use a normal paint brush to apply it. This works better for smaller, detailed sections than larger ones.

, You'll want to smooth the beveled edges of your piece after dying it. You can use a special tool for this purpose but the cheaper option is to simply rub it with a paper towel or canvas cloth! This will make the edges look shiny and professional.

, If you plan on doing any stitching, you'll want to add a stitching groove to keep your stitches from being worn down over time. There is a tool for this purpose called a stitch groover. Once you've cut a channel into your leather where the stitching will go, use a pricking iron or overstitch wheel to lightly mark where your individual stitches will go. This will help create an even, professional look. Finally, punch the individual holes you marked using a piercing awl.


When buying an overstitch wheel or pricking iron, get a shorter one to start off with, as it will be more versatile and make it easier to turn corners.
When starting a new stitching line or having to otherwise pick up the overstitch wheel to start again, place the first spoke down in the hole of the last section of the line. This will keep the stitches even.

, Before sewing, you'll want to add any other finishing touches that you know you'll need, like adding snaps. Be aware, however, that adding things like snaps is difficult and requires its own separate set of tools. Once that's done, add your stitching and you're basically done. Rub the whole surface with a cloth to get a nice, smooth final look.

, As a final measure, you can add a clear final finish on after doing your stitching, if you want to. This is not necessary, however. Enjoy your new creation and don't forget to keep practicing!

Yarn (pink or purple traditionally, but you can make your pygmy puff any color you want)
Scissors
Googly eyes or paper and markers
Medium or large glue dots
Red or pink embroidery thread and plastic needle (optional);
, The looser you wrap the yarn, the fluffier and less dense it becomes. A medium density is best because the pygmy puff is firm enough to stand on its own but is still plush and soft. You will wad up some yarn to start, then continue to wrap the yarn around to build it up. Make sure that the pygmy puff looks circular; wrap the yarn repeatedly over an area that bulges to make it look more normal.

, Choose the flattest side of your pygmy puff and make sure the pygmy puff can sit without falling over. Choose googly eyes that aren't too large or small. Attach to the face with glue dots roughly the size of the googly eyes. If you don't have googly eyes, draw eyes on a piece of paper, then cut out and attach. Draw the iris first (the colored part), then the pupil (black), and add a dot with a silver sharpie to imitate light reflecting off the eye. Attach to the pygmy puff with glue dots.

, Pygmy puffs have long, skinny tongues that they use to scavenge for food. You can make your tongue as short as 3 inches or as long as 8 inches. Cut your desired length from either red or pink embroidery thread and make a large knot on one end. Thread the other end through a plastic needle. Push the needle through the center of the pygmy puff, making sure it comes out in a spot you like. Remove the needle from the thread and pull all of the embroidery thread through.


If the tongue is too long, shorten it. To retract the tongue, pull the knot in the back. To lengthen the tongue, pull the thread in the front.

Seal the weathered surface with shoe wax.",How to Weather Leather1," Stuffing only needs to be done when you’re weathering an object that may lose shape, such as a shoe or bag. Fill the item completely with old newspaper. Lay other leather objects flat on a table., Get some rubbing alcohol from the self-care section at a drugstore or general store. Load the alcohol into a spray bottle and lightly coat the leather. The leather should be damp, not soaked.If you don’t have a spray bottle, use an old toothbrush to spread the rubbing alcohol.
Acetone also works. It may help remove dye, but acetone can be dangerous and you may need a lot of it., Use the brush on the areas you wish to weather. To get the most authentic look, give extra attention to exposed areas like seams, edges, elbows on jackets, straps on bags, and heels on shoes. Do this while the leather is damp with rubbing alcohol to speed up aging.Any abrasive object, such as pumice stones or sandpaper, can be used. Sandpaper is very abrasive, so use it as a last resort.

, Once the rubbing alcohol is dry, apply shoe wax to give the leather protection You can use your finger, a cloth, or an old toothbrush to spread the wax over the leather. Work in as much wax as possible and wipe off the excess. Finish by buffing the leather with a brush."

Fasten the final stitch.",How to Knook," Insert the nylon cord into the eye of the knook hook, pulling roughly 6 inches (15 cm) of cord through to the other side.


A knook hook looks like a standard crochet hook, but there should be an eye on the side opposite the hooked end. This is the eye or hole you'll be threading the cord through.
If you start with a knook kit, the nylon cord should be included. Otherwise, choose nylon cord that is roughly the same thickness as your yarn, if not a little thinner.;
, Using your yarn, tie a standard slip knot onto the hooked end of the knook hook.


This is the same type of slip knot you would use with a standard crochet hook.
To make the slip knot:

Grab approximately 5 inches (12 cm) of yarn.
Wind the attached end of the yarn over the section you just grabbed, creating a loop.
Push yarn from the attached side under and through the loop, creating a second loop. Pull to tighten the first loop around the second.
Place the second loop over the top end of the knook hook. Pull to tighten this second loop onto the hook.



, Crochet a series of chain stitches to serve as the foundation row of your knook work.


Maintain even tension on the yarn as you work so that your chain stitches will be even.
The length of the chain will vary depending on the project, but if you only want to practice, consider making a chain that is at least longer than the length of the knook hook.
The chain stitches you need to create here are the same chain stitches you would create for a standard crochet project.
To make a chain stitch:

Wrap the yarn around the top of the hook from back to front.
Pull this yarn-over through the loop already on your hook. This completes the stitch.



, Insert the hook into the first chain lying adjacent to the hook. With the hooked portion facing down, catch the yarn on the hook, then pull the yarn back through to the other side of the chain.This action should put a second loop on your hook. You will need to keep this loop on your hook while picking up the remainder of your foundation chain stitches.
Continue picking up each stitch by following the same procedure (insert the hook into the chain, catch the yarn, pull the yarn back through to the front). Repeat across the entire chain until you have picked up each chain stitch.

, Turn the knook hook around, then carefully slide all of the picked up stitches off your hook and onto the nylon cord attached to the end.Depending on how long your foundation row is, some of the stitches may fall off the hook and onto the cord before this step. That is not a problem. During this step, you merely need to push any stitches still on your hook onto the cord.
Note that the nylon thread will still be attached to you hook, but the hook will be free from yarn after this step. The short end of the cord should hang free, as well.
Once all of your foundational stitches are on the cord, you can begin to knook the main body of the work using a purl stitch or a knit stitch.

, Insert the tip of the hook into the first stitch on your nylon cord, pushing it through from the front of the stitch to the back.


The hooked tip should face down as you insert it.
Remember that the cord should still be attached to the hook, but the yarn will not be attached to the hook at the start of this process.

, Catch the yarn with the hooked tip, then pull it back through to the front of the row.


Keep the working yarn to the front (inside) of the row as you stitch.
When you catch the yarn and pull it through the loop, you will need to turn the hook to draw the yarn toward the front (inside) of the stitch. The process should create a small bump (called a “purl bump”) at the base of the stitch.
This action completes the purl stitch you started in the previous step. Keep the loop you just created on your hook after you finish the purl stitch.

, Repeat the purl stitch across the entire row of loops. Follow the same procedure when creating each purl stitch and keep all of the loops on the hook after each individual stitch.You may need to guide the loops down the length of the hook as you complete each one.
Note that some of these loops may fall off the end of the hook and onto the other side of the cord. If it happens, that is okay, and you do not need to worry about correcting it.

, Once you have an entire row of purl stitches on your hook, turn the hook around and pull the nylon cord out of the foundation row.


Locate the point at which the nylon cord exits the foundation row and enters the first formal row. Tug at the bend, pulling out only the side of cord strung through the foundation row.
Make sure that the cord remains strung through the loops of the row you just created.
After pulling away the cord, push all of the loops still on your knook hook onto the cord. There should be no more loops on your hook after this step.

, Work one purl stitch into each of the stitches created for your previous row. Continue to create purl stitches until you reach the end of the row.


The purl stitches you create for this row should be identical to those you created for the previous row.
Keep each loop on your hook after creating each purl stitch.
In essence, the rows should be identical.

, Repeat the entire process as needed until the work reaches your desired length.


After working purl stitches across an entire row, turn the knook hook and pull the cord out of the previous row. The cord must still run through any loops that fell off your hook while completing your previous set of purl stitches.
After pulling the cord out of the old row, push any remaining loops off your knook hook and onto the cord.
Once the loops are on the cord, you are ready to purl stitch another row.

, When working on the final row of purl stitches, you will need to bind off each purl stitch as you create it.


Insert the hook into the first stitch. Catch the yarn and pull it back through to the front of the work, creating a normal purl stitch. Keep the loop on your hook.
Purl stitch into the second stitch. Instead of keeping this loop on your hook, however, you need to catch the look of this stitch with the hook and pull it through the first loop. This binds off one stitch and leaves one loop on your hook.
Repeat the process down the rest of the row. Purl stitch into the next stitch, then pull the resulting loop through the first loop on your hook, binding off the stitch you just created.

, Once you reach the end of the row, cut the yarn, leaving a tail of 4 inches (10 cm). Pull this tail through the last loop on your hook and weave any excess into the stitches to hide it.


There should be no yarn left on the hook after this step.
After the entire work has been fastened off, pull out any remaining nylon cord.

, Slip the tip of the hook into the first stitch on the cord. The hook should go in from the back of the stitch to the front.


Keep the hooked tip face down.
At the start of the process, the cord should be attached to the hook. The yarn will not be attached to the hook, though.

, Grab the yarn with the hooked tip. Use the hook to pull this yarn through to the back side of the stitch.


Keep the working (attached) yarn to the back (outside) of the row as you knit.
You may need to twist the hook slightly as you pull the yarn through the stitch.
Completing this stitch completes the knit stitch you started in the previous step. The loop this knit stitch creates should remain on your hook.

, Knit stitch once into each of the remaining stitches of the row.


Each knit stitch should be made by following the same procedure used to create the first one.
You may need to guide the loops down the hook as you complete them. Some may fall off the end of the hook and onto the cord as you work.

, After completing a full row of knit stitches, turn the hook around. Pull the cord out of the foundation row while keeping it strung through the loops of the row you just created.


After pulling the cord out of the foundation row, push any of the loops still remaining on your hook onto the cord. This should free the yarn from the hook, but the cord should still be attached to the hook.

, Knit once into each of the stitches created in your previous row. Work across the entire row in this manner.


These knit stitches will be identical to those made in your previous row.
Each knit stitch will create a loop. Leave all of these loops on your hook until you reach the end of the row.

, Work identical rows of knit stitches until the work reaches your desired length.


Upon reaching the end of a row, turn the knook hook and pull the cord out of the previous row. Then, push the loops of your current row off the hook and onto the cord.
When the loops of your most recent row are gathered on the cord, you can begin knitting your next row.

, For the final row of your work, you need to bind off each knit stitch as you create it.


Knit stitch as usual into the first and second stitch of the row, drawing up loops for both stitches. Instead of leaving both loops on the hook, pull the second loop you created through the first.
Knit stitch into each stitch after this. For each knit stitch, pull the loop you create through the loop on your hook. Repeat this action across the entire row.

, Upon reaching the end of the final row, cut the yarn, leaving roughly 4 inches (10 cm) of excess hanging loose. Use the hook to pull this tail of yarn through the last loop on your hook, fastening off the entire work.


Weave any excess yarn into the back of your stitches to hide it.
Pull any remaining cord out of the work. Both the hook and the cord should be completely detached from the work.

Soak the leather in cool water.,
Heat a second pot of water.,
Dunk the leather in the hot water.,
Shape as desired.,
Allow the leather to dry at room temperature.",How to Stiffen Leather1," Fill a large bucket or sink with cool to room temperature water. Immerse the leather in the water for about 10 minutes, or until it becomes thoroughly soaked.


Note that this process works best when used with vegetable tanned leather.
You can technically stiffen the leather by soaking it in nothing but room temperature water, but it will only become mildly harder and you will not be able to shape it. The addition of a hot water step will allow you to make structural changes while hardening the leather further.;
, As your leather soaks, fill a large stockpot with water and set it on the stove over high heat. Continue heating the water until it reaches a temperature of 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius).Use an accurate thermometer to keep track of the temperature. If the water is too hot or too cold, your results can vary dramatically from those described here.
If you do not have a thermometer, you can gauge the temperature of the water by slowly heating it on the stove and testing it every minute or so with your bare hand. If you can keep your hand immersed in the water, it is safe to use that temperature for your leather. Once you can no longer bear to keep your hand in the water for more than an instant, remove the water from the heat source and do not allow it to get any hotter.
Some people prefer to soak the leather in boiling water. Doing so stiffens the leather at a faster pace, but it also gives you less control. The resulting leather can become very brittle and may be unevenly stiff across its surface.

, Pull the leather out of the cool water and immerse it in the hot water. Let it remain there for a few minutes.


After the first minute, you should already see the leather darken and curl.
The longer you soak the leather, the stiffer it will become. If you soak the leather too long, however, it will be more brittle when dry.
When using this method, soaking the leather in hot water for 30 seconds after it already darkens will result in a piece of leather that is hard but not inflexible. This means that the total hot water soak time would be about 90 seconds. Leave the leather in the water for a longer period of time if you want to make it stiffer.

, When you pull the leather out of the water, it should be fairly flexible. If you need the form the leather into a specific shape, now is the time to do so.


When wet, the leather will be stretchy and easy to form. This stretchiness will vanish within the first minute or two, though, so you need to work fast if you plan to stretch it out. The leather will still remain flexible for up to an hour after the stretchiness fades away, though.

, Let the leather sit out at room temperature for several hours. After it dries, the leather should be notably thicker and stiffer.


Stiffened leather will also shrink, so the piece you started out with may not look as large when you finish the process.

Glue the head to the body.,
Fluff your pygmy puff.",How to Make a Pygmy Puff2," You can find them in a variety of sizes at any craft store or even in the crafting section of a big-box store.You can choose any size styrofoam ball you want, but approximately three inches in diameter will make a good-sized pygmy puff to prop on your shoulder like Ginny’s.

, You have a couple different options for the fur. Whichever material you choose, you’ll be able to find much more variety in texture and color at a fabric store.


For a super fluffy, shaggy pygmy puff, choose a bulky fur-type yarn, which is often branded as Fun Fur. For a super soft, fuzzy but less shaggy version, pick a fluffy type of wool strips.
If you’re trying to make a pygmy puff just like from the books, then you should pick a shade of purple or pink, but realistically, you can make it whatever color you want.

, This is especially necessary if you’re using the long strip of wool to make your pygmy puff.Once the hot glue has dried and one end of the material is firmly attached, you can start winding the material around the foam ball.If you’re using yarn, you can simply wind tightly. If you’re using wool, you’ll need to add dabs of hot glue to the underside and press them to the ball to get it to stick.Turn the ball as you wind, moving it with every loop around.Keep building up the material until you can no longer see the styrofoam peeking through the fur anywhere.

, Once you have covered the foam ball completely, you can cut the yarn or wool and hot glue the end to the rest. Don’t worry if you can see the very end tip of the yarn or wool because you can cover this spot when you make the face for your pygmy puff.

, Pick a piece of felt in a lighter shade than you made the body—baby pink for a pink puff or lavender for a purple puff. Cut a 1.5” square out of it for the head. You’ll use this to form the shape of the head for your pygmy puff.Shape the felt for the head. You’ll need to use a bit of filling to give the head shape and make it retain the shape. Place something small and pliable, like a cotton ball, inside the piece of felt and wrap the felt around it.#* If you wish, you can also take something small—such as cutting off the tip of a Q-tip—and you can hot glue one end to the cotton ball and the opposite end to the inside surface of the felt. This will help hold the head shape in place, and it will also form a small little muzzle for the nose and mouth.
Glue the head together. Once you’re happy with the shape of the head, hot glue the felt together at the back of the head.You’ll probably be able to trim some excess felt away before you finish gluing.

, In the movies, Ginny’s pygmy puff has very beady black eyes, so you can simply use two small black dots of felt and hot glue them above the little nose muzzle you shaped in the face.


If you want the eyes to have a shinier look than that, you can easily find two small black beads at the craft store while picking up the rest of the supplies.If you want to make it sillier looking, you can simply use googly eyes from the craft store., Use a decent amount of hot glue on the back of the head, and hold it in place against the body until it dries. If you were able to see the seam or any matting where you glued the end up the yarn or felt in place on the body, then make sure you attach the head over the seam.


You may also want to brush the fur out of the way before you attach the head; otherwise you can accidentally end up with sticky hot glue clumping the fur together.

, When everything has dried, roll the little guy around in your hands and scruff up the fur to give it plenty of texture and body.

Dampen the leather in water.,
Pour on powdered cleanser.,
Scrub the leather with a wire brush.,
Leave the cleanser on for an hour.",How to Weather Leather2," Soften the leather by giving it a light coating of water. Use a spray bottle, rag, or toothbrush to spread an even amount of water over it. The leather should be damp but not soaked., Get a cleanser such as Comet or Ajax used on tough household stains. The powdered variety with bleach works best. This substance is mild enough to not ruin the leather. Don’t be afraid to add a lot of the cleanser to the leather. Cover the area you wish to weather.Never use pure bleach on leather.

, Use a wire brush to work the cleanser into the leather. The wire will begin the weathering process and help the cleanser to continue it. Other abrasive objects can be used instead. Remember that more abrasive surfaces, such as sandpaper, can weather the leather too much., The cleanser will have turned into a paste after scrubbing. Allow a layer of this paste to rest on the leather for at least an hour. Afterwards, wipe off the cleanser with a damp cloth."
"
Rub the leather on the ground.,
Strike the leather with rocks or a hammer.,
Include the leather in a gentle wash cycle.,
Roll the leather in a sandbox.,
Drag the leather behind a car.",How to Weather Leather3," The ground or another rough surface helps wear down leather. This is a good solution for wearing out shoe soles. Twisting the leather a little also contributes to weathering. You may also place the leather in a bag and step on it., Both rocks and hammers leave age marks. Lay the leather flat. Be gentle when using a hammer and take care not to collapse any breakable parts like the soles of shoes. Strike with a different part of the rock each time to get a more natural look.Colored rocks can impart different colors you can spread into the leather with a wire brush or sandpaper., First, set the leather in a pillowcase or between towels. Add fabric softener to the washing machine, then choose the gentle cycle. Move the items to the dryer and use a no heat tumble setting.You may also skip washing if you don’t want to expose the leather to water. Bag it and place it in the dryer. Don’t use heat or else the leather will shrink.

, Any child’s sandbox at a nearby playground can be a free way to weather leather. Roll up the leather item then kick it around. Pick it up, dust it off, then repeat the process once or twice. The abrasive sand will distress the leather without wearing it down as much as sandpaper., Use a rope and tape to connect the leather to the back of a car. If you have an empty stretch of road, drag the leather over it a few times. You can also run over the leather with the car a few times. Make sure you don’t crush any breakable areas like the soles of shoes."

Soak the leather in room temperature water.,
Preheat an oven.,
Mold the leather as desired.,
Bake the leather.,
Let cool.",How to Stiffen Leather2," Fill a sink, bucket, or similar container with cool to room temperature water. Immerse the leather in the water and let it soak until it becomes completely water logged.


This process is generally recommended for use with vegetable tanned leather.
The amount of time you leave the leather in the water will vary based on the thickness and quality of the leather. Usually, leaving it in the water for 10 to 30 minutes will suffice. The leather should be notably flexible when you remove it.

, As the leather soaks, preheat the oven to 120 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius).Move the racks of the oven around as needed to clear enough room for the leather piece.
If your oven does not reach a temperature this low, simply use the lowest temperature available. Note that higher temperatures could cause a little steam scalding, however, which may alter the color and cause more greater shrinkage.

, Take the leather out of the water. If you plan on forming it in any way, do so now, while it is still flexible and easy to handle.


Since the leather is still fairly cool at this point, it may not keep its form when left alone. After shaping it, you should hold the new forms in place using string, stitching, or nails.

, Place the wet, shaped leather in the oven and bake it until it feels dry. Depending on how long you soaked the leather and the temperature of your oven, this can take anywhere from 20 to 90 minutes.


You can let the leather remain in the oven even after it dries out, but know that dry baking it will cause the temperature of the leather to rise and the structure of the leather to become both harder and more brittle.

, Remove the hot, dry leather from the oven and let it cool at room temperature until it is safe to handle with your bare hands. During this time, the leather will continue to stiffen.


Once cool, you should remove any string, thread, or nails holding the shape in place. If the leather has become sufficiently stiff, it should be able to hold its new form on its own now.

"
"
Preheat an oven.,
Dry bake the leather.,
Melt a little wax.,
Paint the wax onto the leather.,
Reheat and repaint the leather as needed.,
Cool completely.",How to Stiffen Leather3," Set the oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit (90 degrees Celsius) and let it completely warm up.


Make sure that the racks inside the oven are rearranged as needed so that the leather piece can fit inside without brushing against the racks or the sides of the oven.
This method should work well with most types of leather, but vegetable tanned leather is still the easiest to work with. Also note that it tends to be a good method to use if you are trying to stiffen leather than has already been formed and does not need any additional shaping.

, When the oven is hot enough, place the leather inside and bake it for about 30 minutes. The leather needs to be notably hot to the touch when you take it out of the oven.


The heat itself plays an important part in the stiffening process. Essentially, it liquifies some of the molecules in the leather, causing them to break down and become more flexible. When those molecules solidify again, they do so in a structure that is even harder than the leather's original chemical structure.
If you allow the leather to get too hot, however, it can become too brittle by the end of the process.

, Place a block of beeswax into a double boiler and heat it until it completely liquifies. Do this step as the leather bakes so that the leather and the wax will be hot enough to proceed at the same time.


Beeswax is the wax of choice, but you can use melted candles or nearly any other type of wax, as well.
To melt the wax:

Heat 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water in the bottom part of a double boiler placed on the stove over medium-high heat.
Place the wax inside the top part of the double boiler.
As the wax begins to melt, stir it with a disposable spoon or chopstick. Continue until the melts completely.



, Take the leather out of the oven and place it on a few sheets of newspaper. Load a large paintbrush with melted wax and brush the wax onto the hot leather using even strokes.


The leather should soak up the hot wax. If it does not do so, the leather is not yet hot enough and should be returned to the oven.
Continue brushing the wax onto the leather until the leather cools and no longer absorbs the wax.

, After your initial coat of wax, place the leather back into the oven and heat it for another 20 minutes or so. Remove it from the oven and brush the surface with an additional coating of melted wax.


You should repeat this process until the leather no longer absorbs any more wax, even when hot.
One way to tell that the leather can no longer absorb wax is to look at the coloring. The wax will alter the color of the leather slightly. If the entire surface of the leather is an even color, it has likely absorbed as much wax as possible throughout the entire piece.

, Let the leather cool and dry completely. When done, it should be extremely hard and nearly impossible to bend.

Clean the area with rubbing alcohol and a soft rag.,
Apply glue to the underside of the flap.,
Reattach the flap.,
Sand super glued areas gently.,
Dye the leather.,
 Apply leather finish.,
Allow the glue to set.",How to Patch a Leather Couch1," Gently rub 70% isopropyl alcohol over any small flaps or gouges in the surface. This clears away any grease or dirt to prepare the surface for leather glue.Do not let excess alcohol sit on the surface, as it can damage glossy, fully-finished surface coats.Use white vinegar instead on suede and nubuck.
You can use leather cleaner instead, but many of these products condition the leather (leaving a residue), or fail to remove greasy stains.;
, Nubuck, suede, and synthetics such as vinyl and bonded leather require a leather glue labeled for use on your material. On other types of genuine leather, you may get better results with super glue. Apply a small amount of glue to the underside of the flap using a large needle or toothpick, scraping it into a thin layer.







, While the glue is still wet, gently press the flap back into place on the leather surface. Align the flap so that none of the material beneath the flap is visible. Quickly wipe away excess glue with a paper towel before it dries.







, If you are using super glue on genuine leather, sand it by hand with 320 grit, wet-or-dry sandpaper before it dries. This makes a fine dust that combines with the wet super glue to create a filler. Sand in the direction of the crack until the surface feels smooth.








Use 500 grit sandpaper instead on aniline or other thin, delicate leathers.
Skip this step if you used leather glue.

, If the repaired area is a different color than the rest of the couch, apply leather dye with a damp sponge. Wait for it to dry.








Check the dye label to confirm it is suitable for your type of leather. Test on an inconspicuous area first if you are not sure.
If you feel your repairs need more work, gently sand the surface and repeat the process, starting with a new dab of glue.

, If the dye appears too dull or matte, dab some clear finish over the top, and wait for it to dry. The clear finish will add luster and protect the dye.







, Wait at least one hour before causing any flex in the surface of the material.This will give the leather glue the proper amount of time to set and bond to the material.


For best results, let the glue set on its own. Heat can damage leather, so using a hairdryer to speed up the drying is risky.

Blow up a 12-inch (30.48-centimeter) balloon half-full.,

Let the balloon dry.,
Use your fingers to press the balloon away from the yarn.,
Pierce the balloon near the tail and let it deflate slowly.,
Make a stem out of a brown pipe cleaner.,
Attach the pipe cleaner to the top of the pumpkin.",How to Make a Yarn Pumpkin1," You can blow it up more, if you really want to, but the bigger your balloon is, the more yarn you will need. Don't blow your balloon up too small, or it will look more like an egg (although this will work great for a balloon gourd!)., If you blew up your balloon half-way, you will need 21 pieces. If you blew your balloon up more than that, you will need more pieces of yarn.For a traditional pumpkin, use orange yarn. You can also use ivory yarn for a white pumpkin, or even purple or black!


Use plain, medium or worsted-weight yarn. Don't use anything too thin or chunky.
Cotton yarn will also work well for this project.

, The easiest way to do this would be to tie the other end of the yarn to a cabinet handle. You can also tie it to a clothes hanger, then hook the clothes hanger onto something. This will keep your balloon suspended in mid-air and make it easier to work on., You will need 2 ounces (60 milliliters) of white school glue for each yarn pumpkin that you are making. Do not water the glue down, or your pumpkin will be too flimsy after it dries.For a stronger pumpkin, try a decoupage glue (ie: Mod Podge) mixed with a little bit of water.Be sure to use a matte finish if you'd like to preserve the matte texture of your yarn.

, Use a fork to swirl it around, making sure that it gets evenly soaked.

, This will get just the right amount of glue off. If you don't do this, the yarn will drip everywhere and make a mess. If you use your fingers, you will take off too much glue, and your pumpkin won't be strong anymore.

, Hold the balloon steady with one hand, then press the end of the yarn close to the tail with the other. Wrap the yarn around the balloon until you reach the other end. Press down on the end of the yarn to seal it in place.Be sure to change directions every so often.

, You don't always have to start at the tail end of the balloon. You can even wrap the yarn around its equator for a different effect. Remember to press down on each end of the yarn to seal it.


The yarn won't completely cover the balloon. You will get something that looks like a basket or filigree.

, Even though you squeezed the excess glue out of it, it may still drip. It would be a good idea to place some old rags, a cheap tablecloth, or some old newspapers of magazines under it to protect your floor or counter.


It will take about 24 hours for the yarn to dry. The yarn likely won't be rock-solid once it dries; it may still have some flex to it.

, This is very important. If you don't do this, the balloon will pull the yarn inward as it deflates. Carefully stick your finger through the holes in the wrapped yarn, and run it between the yarn and the balloon, prying the two apart., If you notice any yarn still sticking to the balloon, gently pry it away. Don't let the balloon pull the yarn inward, or your pumpkin will appear dented. Pull the balloon out when you are done and discard it.At this point, you can cut off the tail that you used to hang your pumpkin. You can also leave it on so that you can hang your pumpkin up someplace more visible.

, Wrap a brown pipe cleaner around your finger or a marker to create a tube. Carefully pull it off.You can make vines in a similar fashion. Wrap a green pipe cleaner around a pen or pencil, pull it off, then gently pull it apart to create a coil.
You can make leaves out of green paper or fabric.

, In most cases, you can simply slip the end of the pipe cleaner under the yarn.If this is not possible, however, attach it using a hot glue gun.


Hot glue the leaves to the vines, then attach the vines to the base of the stem.

Prepare the cleaning materials.,
Lather the surface.,
Rinse thoroughly.,
Leave the leather to dry.",How to Restore Leather1," In a bucket or small basin, mix a cleaning solution of dishwashing soap and warm water (one part soap to 8 parts water).Alternatively, purchase saddle soap from a shoe store, department store, or online. Saddle soap contains ingredients like beeswax that add suppleness to leather while cleaning it, but wax or oil may inhibit a filler or compound from properly adhering to the leather. Use a small amount of the soap (i.e. a small dab on a wet cloth) to prevent buildup on the leather., Dip a soft, lint-free cloth into the solution, or dip it into warm water before adding a dab of saddle soap. Wring the cloth out lightly, then wipe down the entire damaged surface of the leather with firm, circular motions. Rinse and repeat., Rinse the cloth and dip it into cool, clean water. Wring out the cloth lightly and run it over the leather surface again. Make sure to remove all soap from the leather. , Once the leather is thoroughly rinsed, let it air dry. Avoid using a heater, blow dryer, or other heat source to speed up drying time. Heat can change the chemical structure of leather, leaving it stiff and misshapen."

",How to Make Leather Vambraces," For the simplest vambrace pattern, just measure the circumference of the thickest part of your forearm, then your wrist and finally the length you want the vambrace to be. This is the basic pattern for most vambraces.
, Draw the prototype in 3D first, then figure out the components you'll need. If this is your first time working with leather, chose a simple design., To be more precise, you can use computer editor to draw it and then print. Don't forget to mark some places for eyelets. Do this on both sides, you will use them for laces.

,, You should make sure that everything goes as planned and that the pattern matches your measurements., If your vambrace consists of multiple pieces, try to decrease the space between different parts. This way you'll spend less leather.,, This will make it easier to work with., Lay it on your arm and press down gently., When leather dries, it keeps its shape., You'll use them for laces. Only do this when the leather is completely dry., You can color it with oil leather dyes, clean the edge if it's too rough. Experiment and be creative!,"

Let leather dry completely after stamping.",How to Stamp Leather," Before stamping your leather, cut it into the shape you want. For example, if you're making leather name tags, cut your leather into the shape of a name tag before stamping it. You can use a straight-edge rotary cutter or an x-acto knife to cut leather while it's lying on a flat surface.You should always cut leather on the ""flesh side."" This is the wrong side of the leather, meaning the side that you will not be stamping as it will not be the exterior of your leather project.;
, Leather is a tough material, so it needs to be moist for stamps to stick. Get a sponge moist with water. Then, press the sponge onto both sides of the leather. Wet the flesh side first and then the front of the leather.The leather should be damp, but not soaking wet.

, If your project requires you make any other alterations to the leather, do so before stamping it. For example, if you need to punch a hole in leather for a name tag, do so before stamping your leather., You should always stamp leather on a firm surface, as you'll need to use a considerable amount of force to get the stamps to stick. It's a good idea to place a piece of hardwood down on a flat surface. Stamp the leather on the hardboard.You can purchase blocks of hardwood at most department stores.

, Take your leather stamp. Place the stamp down where you want the image or letter to appear on your leather. Hold it in place with one hand.You will need to buy leather stamps. You can buy them online or at some craft shops.

, Use your other hand to hammer down on the stamp. This will secure the image or letter into the leather. Give the stamp a few firm strikes with the hammer until the image or letter transfers., Once your image or letter has transferred, repeat the process again with the second image or letter. Press the stamp down where you want it on the leather and then give the stamp a few firm strikes with a hammer to transfer the image., It's always a good idea to test your stamps ahead of time. Cut out a small test scrap of leather, moisten it, and apply some stamps to it. See roughly how many times you need to strike the stamp with the hammer to get the image or letter to transfer., If you notice your leather is drying out, re-wet it as needed. If you're only stamping on one or two images or letters, you probably will not need to re-wet the leather. However, larger projects will require you to occasionally stop and rewet your leather., Once you've transferred your images onto the leather, set it aside. Allow the leather to dry completely before doing anything else with the leather, such as sewing it. Drying times vary depending on the types of leather and how wet your leather got during the stamping process."

Lay down drop cloths.,
Dissasemble your leather item.,
Wipe the leather down with isopropyl alcohol.,
Sand shiny areas of the leather with a fine grit sandpaper.,
Wipe the surface of the leather with a damp cloth.,
Apply a leather preparer and deglazer to the surface of the leather.",How to Paint Leather1," Prepare your painting area by putting tarps or drop cloths under the leather so that paint doesn't get everywhere. Make sure to paint the leather in a well-ventilated room so that you don't inhale paint fumes., If if you plan on painting leather furniture, it's a good idea to disassemble the furniture before you start painting, so that paint doesn't drip onto other parts of the furniture.If you are painting leather shoes, remember to take the shoelaces out before you start painting it.

If you can't disassemble the item, you can tape off the portions that you don't want to paint.

, Dampen a rag with isopropyl alcohol and wipe down the surface of the leather. The alcohol will remove any preliminary coatings, waxes, or oils that are on the surface of the leather, which will help the paint adhere to the leather.Isopropyl alcohol may not be strong enough to remove all leather finishes.

, If your leather is still shiny, sanding off the shiny areas with a 100 - 200 grit sandpaper will remove portions of the glossy finish that might be left over after wiping it down with the alcohol.Put the sandpaper in the palm of your hand and work back and forth on shiny areas in the leather., Before you start painting the leather, make sure that the surface is clean. Take a damp rag or a microfiber cloth and wipe over the surface of the leather. Continue wiping down the leather until all dirt and debris are lifted off.Any dirt or dust left on the surface of the leather will be embedded in the paint.

, You can purchase a bottle of leather preparer and deglazer at craft stores or online. Saturate a rag with the preparer and deglazer and work it generously onto the surface of the leather.The preparer and deglazer will dry fast because it's alcohol based.
Leather preparer and deglazer formulas are made specifically to help paint adhere to leather.
The preparer and deglazer may fade the old color of your leather.

Trim away any loose fibers around the edge of the tear.,
Apply leather filler.,
Wait for the filler to dry.,
Dye the repaired area.,
Apply leather finish.",How to Patch a Leather Couch2," Deep tears that expose the substrate under the leather require a ""sub patch"" to form a strong backing for your repair. A leather repair kit is a convenient way to purchase sub patch material, since it will also include the other tools needed for this repair. If you don't have a repair kit, you can use any strong, flexible mending fabric, or another piece of leather or vinyl. Cut the sub patch so it is slightly larger than the hole or tear. Round the corners for easy insertion.







, Use a pair of tweezers to insert the sub patch into the hole, then to flatten out any wrinkles or folds. Make sure that the sub patch completely covers the hole and sits smoothly between the substrate and the leather.







, Using a large needle or toothpick, apply a flexible fabric or leather glue to the underside of the leather. Spread the glue in a thin layer wherever the leather will contact the sub patch. Press the leather onto the sub patch, gently pulling the tear back to its original shape. Wipe away excess glue with a paper towel.







, Place a block of wood or heavy book over the entire area to apply even, firm pressure. Wait for the glue to dry for at least twenty minutes, or according to label instructions.









Check your glue label to see if it suggests using a hairdryer to speed up drying. Even if it does, keep the heat low and avoid holding the blow dryer directly against the leather. Excess heat can dry out or damage leather.

, Before you apply leather filler to repair the hole, you'll need a clean surface for it to bond with. Lightly dampen a clean rag with leather cleaner or 70% isopropyl alcohol, then gently clean the damaged area.









Alcohol is usually more effective than leather cleaner at removing excess glue or grease-based stains., This helps the leather filler create a flush surface with the edges of the tear.Carefully trim away any loose or stringy fibers around the edge of the hole.








, If there is still a small gap between the two edges, use a palette knife to spread a small amount of leather filler into the gap. Use the flat side of the palette knife to smooth out the filler and to scrape away any excess.You want to leave the filled area flat and flush with the rest of the leather surface. Use a paper towel to remove any excess filler and feather the edges where it touches the undamaged surface of the leather.









Leather filler is included in leather repair kits.

, Refer to your product instructions for an estimate of drying time. Once dried, you should be able to press the repaired area gently without it shifting or feeling squishy.You may have to apply a second coat of filler if the surface still feels uneven after drying.

, You can mix your own color by hand following the instructions in your repair kit, or send a sample of the leather to a custom leather dye company to make an exact match. Once you have the right color, dab a small amount of dye over the repair with a damp sponge. Once the area is mostly concealed, wait for it to dry. Repeat as necessary, gradually blending outward for a natural appearance.








Test the mix on an inconspicuous corner of the leather first if you're not confident it's the right shade. If the color seems wrong, wipe it away quickly.

, Some leathers have a more lustrous finish than others. If the dye looks too flat and dull, dab a coat of clear finish over the top, and wait until it dries. The clear finish will help protect the color and match the luster.

If you'd like, you can curl the end of the stem over your finger, pen, or pencil.


To great vines: wrap a green pipe cleaner around a skewer or pencil, pull it off, then gently pull it apart to create a spring. Wrap it around the base of the stem., Once again, do not cut the loops of yarn apart. Instead, manipulate them with your fingers so that they are evenly spread around the stem, creating a squashed, pumpkin-like shape.

Use a separate piece of yarn for each wrap.
Wrap the pumpkin horizontally in a spiral from bottom to top, using one, long piece of yarn.
Wrap the yarn in triangular-shape spirals around the pumpkin.

, Although not necessary, this can give your pumpkin a nice, consistent look. Use a drop of hot glue at the base and tip of the stem to secure the yarn.For a rustic look, try jute cord instead.
If you made your pumpkin out of a Styrofoam ball, consider leaving the cork or stick stem bare for a more rustic look.

, Trim off any loose bits of yarn, and glue down any bits that stick up. Set your pumpkin down some place visible so that you can take pride in your work!

Buy a leather repair kit.,
Avoid a mess.,
Apply a leather repair compound.,
Apply a thin coat of colorant.,
Spray on more colorant.,
Apply a leather conditioner.",How to Restore Leather2," Leather repair kits are available for purchase at hardware stores, department stores, and online. In theory, these kits should contain all of the tools and substances required to repair leather surfaces. To find a good quality kit, read user testimonials before buying; a reputable company will have many., To avoid stains from any of the ingredients being used to treat your leather, lay down newspaper, plastic sheeting, or towels under the leather object. Wear protective gloves and old clothing while you work. To minimize fumes from repair products, open the windows or bring the object outside to restore it.

, Using a sponge, gently spread a thin layer of leather binder (a liquid that seeps into the leather fibres and binds them together) over the entire surface of the worn leather. Let it air dry. Repeat the process 3-5 times, or until you are satisfied with the results. Remove excess binder that might accumulate around the seams., Add a small amount of water-based leather colorant to a sponge or foam applicator. Apply a thin coat onto the leather, concentrating on hard to reach areas like creases, cracks, and seams. Wait 30 minutes for the colorant to dry.Shake the colorant well to ensure that it is mixed well before using it.

, Fill a spray gun or airbrush with colorant. To avoid runs or oversaturation, spray very fines coats of colorant onto the leather. Allow the surface to dry (water-based colorants dry within a few minutes) and repeat the process until the surface looks adequately covered. , Once the leather is dry, use a soft, lint-free cloth to apply a leather conditioner to the surface. Be sure to apply the conditioner evenly and cover the entire surface. Gently buff and polish the leather to make it supple and shiny."

Treat the scratch with vinegar.,
Rub the scratch with oil.,
Use a blowdryer.,
Take care of your leather.",How to Restore Leather3," Apply a small amount of distilled white vinegar to the scratch with a Q-tip or small cloth. The vinegar will swell the scratched area in a collagen-like manner. Let it dry, then gently buff the area with a colorless shoe polish., Treat a scratch in leather with either orange oil or olive oil. Using a damp cloth, rub the oil into the scratch and surrounding area using buffing motions. This treatment will have the added bonus of conditioning the leather.Use oil sparingly, as it might deteriorate the leather over time if used in excess., Heat can be bad for leather, but in small doses it may be beneficial. Turn the blowdryer to a medium setting and use it on the section of scratched leather, gently rubbing the scratch with your free hand. The heat should bring dyes applied to the leather at the tannery back to the surface, thereby reducing the appearance of the scratch., Treat your leather goods with a weather-resistant protection spray and reapply every three months. Keep leather away from water as much as possible, and be sure to be delicate about drying it if it does get wet (i.e. avoid direct heat, and air dry). Use a leather conditioner to moisturize leather every few months, or whenever it starts to feel too dry."
"
Insert a subpatch.,
Glue the tear.,
Apply filler.,
Apply a thin coat of leather dye.",How to Restore Leather4," Cut a subpatch out of thin but solid material (e.g. a piece of an old t-shirt). Cut a patch slightly larger and wider than the tear you are repairing. Round the corners for easier insertion. Use tweezers to insert the subpatch under the tear. Smooth out the subpatch behind the leather; be careful not to do further damage to the leather., Apply a flexible craft glue to a large needle, palette knife, or plastic knife. Apply craft glue to the underside of the leather and the subpatch underneath. Do this all around until the tear is glued shut. Flatten the surface of the repair and wipe off excess glue with a wet cloth. Stronger adhesives may have to be cleaned up with rubbing alcohol. , Apply leather filler to the tear in a small thin layer. Some fillers can be force dried with a heat gun or blow dryer. Others must be allowed to cure on their own. Repeat the process until the surface is level. Do a final thin coat and emboss or texturize the compound with a gloved hand or saran wrap. Allow to cure. If necessary, gently polish any rough spots with 500 grit wet or dry sandpaper. , Begin with the repaired area. Dab or stipple a thin layer of dye with a sponge, brush or foam applicator. Allow to dry. Work surrounding areas as needed. "

Purchase an acrylic leather paint.,
Mix paint and water together in a 1:1 ratio.,
Apply the paint to the leather in thin layers.,
Let the paint dry.,
Flex the leather in between each coat.,
Apply additional coats and repeat.,
Let the leather dry for 24 hours.",How to Paint Leather2," Go to a craft store or look online for acrylic paint made specifically for leather. Acrylic paint will absorb into the leather without affecting the flexibility of it., Adding water to the paint will make it thinner. This helps the leather absorb the paint. Squirt the acrylic paint into a bowl and add an equal amount of water to it before mixing it together with your paintbrush., Dip a flat paintbrush into the paint and work in long even strokes over the surface of the leather. The paint will look faint at first and the old color will come through the new paint, which is normal. Try to get even coverage until the entire leather piece is painted., Let each of the thin layers of paint dry for two to three hours before touching it. Touch the surface of the leather with your hand to see if it's dry. If it feels wet or the color transfers to your hand, the leather isn't dry enough to apply another coat., If you are painting a leather handbag or leather clothing, flex the leather back and forth in between each coat to prevent your paint from cracking later., Continue painting the leather and letting it dry before applying more coats. Depending on how deeply colored you want your leather, it may take up to seven coats for it's a dark, solid color., Once the leather is the hue that you want, let it dry over a 24 hour period. Come back to the painted leather and touch the surface to make sure that it's not sticky or wet. If it is, let it dry out for a longer period."
"
Purchase an acrylic leather finisher.,
Apply the finisher to the surface of the leather.,
Let the finish dry.",How to Paint Leather3," Applying a finish to the leather will help seal in the paint and will give the leather a nicer looking finish. High gloss will be reflective and will look shiny, while a matte finish will give the paint a softer, less shiny, look. Once you decide on which finish you want, purchase the leather finisher online.Matte and satin finishes will look shiny when they are first applied but then dry to their respective finishes.

, Saturate a sponge brush with the leather finisher and apply it in thin coats over the painted leather. Continue going over the surface of the leather, making sure to fill in any seams., Put the leather in a dust-free area until it dries. The finisher will dry after a full 24-hours. Your leather should now look professionally painted."

Start by setting up a work area for yourself, preferably outdoors or in a well-ventilated, easily cleaned indoor area.,
Soak the hide in a bucket of water overnight to make it more pliable.,
Carefully scrape the flesh off the skin using a very sharp convex blade or drawknife.,
Once clean, the hide must be de-haired.,
By now the hide looks clean, but is still covered in protective layers, a membrane on the flesh side and the epidermis on the fur side.,
Finally, the hide is ready to be tanned.,
The final part of the process, currying, is turning the preserved but rough and poorly-colored skin into a polished final product.,
At this stage, the leather can be smoked suspended over a fire of greenwood.,
Either way, the leather is finished by rubbing oil into the surface and giving it a final round of sleaking.

,
Congratulations!",How to Make Leather Naturally," Tanning can be a very messy project. Set up a long narrow workbench to lay the hide on. An 8x8 timber on cinder blocks, or any kind of narrow, sturdy table should work fine.;
, Remember that a soaked skin will be extremely heavy, so try to have a strong helper on hand.

, This may take several hours; don't rush or you may end up cutting the skin by accident.

, Lime is usually used to break down the keratin in the hair, making it easier to remove.


Mix up a solution of 2 cups lime to 1 gallon (3.8 L) water. Be sure to make enough to completely cover the skin.
Soak the hide in the lime solution for one to two weeks. Hair, especially deer fur, is notoriously difficult to remove, so don't try to hurry this process. On the other hand, leaving it in the solution too long might damage the skin itself.
When it's finished soaking, lay it over your work-bench and scrape the loosened hair off the skin using a canoe paddle, drawknife, seashell or similar implement.

, These layers, especially the tough epidermis, must be removed to allow the tanning solution to penetrate and fully preserve the hide.


First allow the surface of both sides to dry out.
Carefully scrape the hide using sharp blades held perpendicular to the skin.
Sand the surface with medium-grade sandpaper for a more polished job and to help remove any tough spots.

,


Collect a large amount of oak or hemlock bark. Try not to strip bark from living trees as this can kill or severely injure the tree. With a little exploration, you can usually find plenty of fallen trees to collect from. Also, make sure you have the right tree! Most bookstores stock tree identification manuals if you don't already have one.
Add the bark to a large container of water. An empty trash can or plastic box is ideal.
Soak the skin in this bark ""tea"" for up to nine months. During this time the tannic acid in the bark will seep through every pore in the skin, coating the microscopic fibers with preservative. For best results, change the water and add fresh bark once in a while, say once every three months.
Once it's done tanning, pat yourself on the back for being so patient! Remove the skin from the solution and clean it well, scrubbing and even scraping it with a blade.

,


To prepare for currying, poke a series of holes along the border of the hide using a leather awl or similar instrument.
Tie ropes to the holes and stretch the skin taut on a wooden frame by fastening the ropes to the frame. In this position, the skin will be easier to manipulate.
Leave it on the frame until semi-dry. A few hours in the sun should suffice.
Scrape both sides vigorously with a very blunt blade or alternatively, rub a rounded stick or canoe paddle across the surface. This process, called sleaking, rapidly and repeatedly stretches the leather making it permanently soft, smooth, and supple. As the skin MUST be continuously and vigorously sleaked until dry, this is a very exhausting process best done by two or more people taking turns. The longer and more energetically the leather is sleaked now, the better the final product will be.

, This isn't necessary, but it helps waterproof the leather and darken its color. A tripod would work, but be careful not to let the leather fall into the fire!

,, If you completed the above steps carefully and methodically, your finished leather should be soft, smooth and lightweight, ready to be dyed or used as-is in your favorite leather crafts. Some examples include leather-bound books, bags and pouches, clothes, moccasins, belts, and wall decorations. Have fun and be creative!

Continue adding beads.,
Finish your bracelet.",How to Make Leather Bracelets1," You can find leather supplies at most craft stores or online. To create a beaded leather bracelet, you will need leather chord or strips, as well as beads with holes large enough to fit the leather.;
, Cut 2 strands of leather cord or strips with scissors. When crafting leather bracelets, you can estimate the length by wrapping the strand around your wrist and adding a few more inches to the overall length to compensate for a tie.

, Tie the strands together at 1 end with a secure knot, leaving a bit of leather on the end for tying the bracelet around your wrist. For the easiest beading process, tape one end to a tabletop or pin it to your pant leg.

, Place a single bead onto one of the strings and slide it to the base of the knot.

, The leather chord should slide in the same bead from the opposite side. This will create a loop around the bead, securing it in place. This process will be done for every bead added.

, Continue adding beads to your bracelet by sliding a single bead up one of the strands, and then pulling the same strand through the center in the opposite direction. Do this until your bracelet is long enough to wrap around your entire wrist.

, Use a basic knot to tie off the other end of your bracelet. Remove the tape from the opposite end, and tie the tails together around your wrist to finish off your piece of jewelry."

, Wrap the leather around your wrist to determine how long to cut your pieces. Cut 3 strips of leather cord or strip with scissors.

, Tie a regular knot at one end of the strips, securing them together. Attach the strands to a table with sticky tape or use a safety pin to pin the leather to your pant leg.

, Wrap the right cord and set it over the left cord. The braiding used for this simple bracelet is the same used for hair.

, The second step is to move the piece from the far left, and place it over the center. It will now be the new center strip.

, Move the piece from the far right over the center strip. This is the same step as the first one.

, Following with the same pattern, move the left piece of leather over the center piece.

, Braid the leather strips until they've reached a length long enough to wrap around your entire wrist. Smooth out the leather wrap to flatten out the braids.

, Secure the strands with a regular knot, and then remove the sticky tape and place the wrap around your wrist.Tie the two ends together and cut off any excess you may have."

Add your clasps.",How to Make Leather Bracelets3," To create a leather cuff, you will need strips of tooled leather, leather glue, a leather needle, waxed linen thread, and a button snap or clasp for the ends of the bracelet.

, Use a ruler to measure a strip of leather 2 inches (5.08 cm) wide, by the length of your wrist plus one inch. Cut the leather to size with a pair of sharp scissors or utility knife.

, Attach your cut and sized leather to a larger, tooled piece of leather with leather glue. Use your fingers to smooth out any wrinkles, and allow it to dry overnight. Adding a second layer of leather to your bracelet will give a more finished look.

, Trim the edge off the tooled leather to make it the same size as your original strip. You should now be left with a nearly completed double-sided leather strip.

, Use a leather needle and waxed linen thread to stitch the cuff together. Any stitch is appropriate; the stitching is simply securing the edges of the leather and giving a more sophisticated look.

, Use your needle and thread or the leather glue to secure your clasps to either end. With the completion of this step, you're finished!"

, Wrap a single piece of leather around your wrist, and add 2-3 extra inches to the length. The extra leather will be used to tie the ends together when the bracelet is completed. Cut the leather to size.

, Tape down one end of the strip to a table top, about two inches from the end.

, Dab a bit of glue to the leather, and then wrap a piece of embroidery floss around it. Wrap the embroidery floss tightly around the strip for as long as you would like, before switching to your next color. When you finish, add another dab of glue and cut off the excess embroidery floss.

, Follow the same process as above by dabbing on a bit of glue to the leather, and then wrapping a new color of embroidery floss around the strip. Continue wrapping the floss as far as you would like, and then dab on some more glue and cut off the excess.

, Add as much floss as you would like to your bracelet to give it a bit of color. You may choose to wrap the entire leather strip, or only a bit of it; the choice is up to you!

, When you've added as much thread to your bracelet as you would like, thread the end of the floss through a needle, and cut off all of the string except for about 1 inch. Thread the needle under the embroidery floss that you've already wrapped around the leather. Pull the needle out the other side, leaving the tail end of the thread hidden under the wrappings.

, If you want to add clasps to your bracelet, attach them to the ends of the leather strands at this point. Otherwise, simply tie the ends together around your wrist, and you're finished!"

Try on your bracelet.",How to Make Leather Bracelets5," A studded leather bracelet requires strips of tooled leather, assorted studs, an x-acto knife, a hammer, a snap-on clasp, and scissors.

, Wrap the leather strip around your wrist, and add an additional inch to the measurement. Use the scissors to cut the strip to length, and cut off the corners to round off the ends.

, Take your studs and arrange them how you like over the leather bracelet. When you've gotten them just where you want them to be, gently poke the leather with the prongs from the stud. Doing this will not pierce the leather, but leave a small indent.

, Use the x-acto knife to cut small slits where the prongs indented the leather. These cuts need only be wide enough for the prongs to be inserted through; cutting them too wide will show up on the finished project.

, Slide each of the studs through the slits you have cut. The prongs will stick out the back end. Twist them around just how you like them before securing them in place.

, Flip the leather strip over and use your hammer to bend down the prongs. If there are two prongs on the back of each stud, hammer them down in opposite directions.

, To create the clasp, add the snap-on buttons to either end of the bracelet. These may have prongs that can be slid through the leather and hammered down like the studs, or they may need to be glued in place.

, Use the snaps to secure the bracelet on your wrist. Adjust any studs that may have gotten twisted around or moved out of place. Your bracelet is finished! Show off your new style by making several and stacking them."

Sew down the side of your glove.,
Repeat with the second glove.,
Try on your gloves.",How to Make Leather Gloves," Lay your non-dominant hand flat on top of a piece of paper, keeping your fingers closed. Your thumb should extend out at its natural angle. Draw around your entire hand, working from one side of the wrist to the other.Your hand should be in the middle of the paper with your index finger and thumb pointed toward the center.
Once you have this basic outline, you also need to draw a dot at the base of each finger. To do this, open each pair of fingers (one pair at a time) and draw a small dot in between them, centering it at the base.
Slip a ruler in between your fingers. Draw a straight line from the dot to the tops of your fingers.
Remove the ruler and make sure that all of the lines are parallel with each other.
Add an extra 2 inches (5 cm) of length to all sides of the pattern. Sketch the line so that it slopes out slightly near the wrist along the outside of your hand, or the side opposite your thumb.
You should have an accurate outline of your hand at this point. Do not cut it out yet, however.;
, Fold the paper in half along the outer edge of your index finger. Cut around the outline, cutting out two layers at once and keeping the fold intact.


Note that the thumb portion of your outline will be lost at this point.
Once you cut out the outline, cut down finger slits you sketched out earlier. The slits on the front of your pattern should be 1/4 inch (6 mm) shorter than the corresponding slits along the back of the pattern.

, Open the trank pattern and mark the locations of your thumb joint. You'll need to draw and cut out an oval for the thumb hole in the center of the trank.


Mark the thumb base, web, and thumb knuckle with dots. Make a fourth dot directly across from the knuckle dot.
Draw an oval that connects all four of these dots together.
Sketch an inverted triangle along the top of this oval. It should be no longer or shorter than the center of the oval.
Cut out the remainder of the oval, leaving the top triangular portion intact.

, Fold a piece of paper in half and put the inside of your thumb along the fold. The fold should run parallel to the side of your index finger and wrist. Draw around the outside of your thumb.


Once you have this sketch, open up the paper and draw a mirror image on the other side of the fold.
Cut out the thumb piece and hold it against the thumb hole in your trank pattern. The two should roughly join together. If not, remake your thumb pattern, adjusting the size to better match the thumb hole in the trank.

, The fourchettes are lengthwise pieces that fit in between the fingers of your gloves.


Fold a piece of paper and put it in between your index and middle finger on your non-dominant hand. The fold should rest directly on top of the webbing in between your fingers.
Trace around your index finger, adding a little extra length to the top to match the length of the middle finger.
Cut the pattern out.
Repeat this process two more times, sketching out fourchettes to go in between your middle and ring fingers and in between your ring and pinky fingers.

, The easiest leather to work with when making gloves will be thin leather with a smooth, even grain.


Grain leather is made from the external side of the hide, and it offers the greatest amount of durability and dexterity.Thin leather will create more comfortable gloves than thick leather, which could end up feeling bulky.

, Tug the leather and observe how stretchy the material is. If it bounces back after you stretch it, no further preparations are needed. If it sags a little or seems too stretchy, you will need to help stiffen and control this stretchiness.


Stretchiness is good, but if you do not take measures to control it, the gloves can easily become saggy and worn out after you wear them a few times.

, Get the leather wet, then stretch it out with the grain until it will stretch out no further. Let it dry.


Once dry, wet it again and stretch the leather out across the grain. Do not stretch it out completely this time, though. Let it dry again.

, Pin your patterns to the prepared leather and use sharp scissors to cut them out, matching the pattern line for line. This means cutting out the thumb hole and finger spaces, as well.


Make sure that the grain line runs parallel with the fingers. Leather has the greatest amount of stretch across this grain, and you will need to make use of that stretchiness to help the leather move with the the knuckles as you bend your fingers.
Leather should not fray, so you do not need to hem the edges or apply any anti-fraying adhesives.
Cut each piece out twice so that you will have enough pieces to make two identical gloves. Since the front and back of these gloves will be identical, you do not need to worry about inverting the pattern for your opposite hand.

, Stop just short of the bottom curve.


If you want to hide your stitching, make sure that the right sides of all pieces face each other as you stitch and turn the pieces right-side out once they are stitched together.
Alternatively, you can keep all of your stitching on the outside of the gloves, allowing it to remain visible. In that case, keep all of the pieces right-side out as you stitch them together.
Hidden and visible stitches are both an option with leather, so this is merely a personal style choice on your part.

, Insert the open bottom of your thumb piece into the thumb hole of your trank piece. Pin the edges of the thumb to the edges of the hole, then sew around the entire joined edge.


Make sure that the thumb points upward as you insert it into the thumb hole.
The thumb piece edge and thumb hole should match pretty evenly.
You can bend the edge of the thumb hole inward so that the right sides of the hold edge and thumb piece face each other, or you can pin/sew the right side of the thumb edge along the wrong side of the hole edge. Either option will work, so again, this is merely a matter of style preference.

, You will need to connect it to the palm and back sides of your trank pattern. Pin and sew in place.


Attach the fourchette to the palm side of your pattern first. Once the piece has been sewn onto the palm side of the trank, attach it to the back side of the trank.
Sew from the tip of the index finger and down along the palm side slit, then back up to the tip of the middle finger.
When joining the fourchette to the back trank, start from the tip of the middle finger and move down the slit, then back up to the tip of the index finger.

, Once the fourchette between your index and middle fingers has been sewn on, move onto the fourchettes between your middle and ring fingers and between your ring and pinky fingers. The sewing method for these other two fourchettes is exactly the same as the sewing method for the first.


Sew the middle/ring fourchette on next. Once it's on, sew the ring/pinky fourchette on.
Work as you did before, sewing each fourchette onto the palm side of your trank first before doubling back over the back side of the glove.

, In necessary, pin down the glove so that the outer edges of both sides meet each other. Sew down both sides of the gloves and close up any gaps that still remain around the finger area.


The only opening left by the end of this step should be the wrist opening. This, of course, remains open.
If you want to hide your side seams, make sure that the right sides of your glove pieces face each other as you finish up the sewing. Turn the glove right-side out when the sewing is finished. If you want the seams to show, keep the wrong sides facing in as you sew.
When you complete this step, you should have one finished glove.

, Follow the same exact sewing steps with your remaining pieces to make a second glove that matches the first.


Sew the thumb piece together, then sew the thumb piece into the thumb hole of the trank.
Stitch all the fourchettes in place, working with the index/middle combination first, followed by the middle/ring combination, and concluded with the ring/pinky combination. Note that the palm side of this glove will be the opposite of the palm side for your first glove.
Stitch along the sides and open finger gaps to complete the glove, leaving only the wrist open.

, At this point, your gloves are finished and ready to wear."

Dye the leather.,
Neutralize the acid.,
Finish the leather.",How to Make Black Leather Dye," In a five gallon bucket, place the entire package of steel wool and pour in the entire container of vinegar. Seal this and allow it to sit for a few days, occasionally opening and stirring it. This waiting period is to allow the acid in the vinegar to fully oxidize the steel. Eventually, the liquid will have an opaque, light brown color. This means it is ready to use.;
, The vinegar in the dye is acidic and eventually it will destroy the integrity of whatever leather you apply it to. The solution to this problem is to use a neutralizing solution. Take the other five gallon bucket, pour in the baking soda and fill it approximately half-way full of water. Stir this until all the baking soda has dissolved. Put the lid on it and set it aside.

, Test the dye by taking a small piece of leather and submerging it in the dye for approximately 2 minutes. Use the piece of wire for this, not your hands. Remove the leather. It should have a very dark matte color to it. If not, there is either a problem with your dye or your leather. If you have used veg tanned un-dyed leather, try adding more steel wool and letting it set for several more days. If it does come out black, good, that means your dye is working and is ready to use on any larger pieces of leather you may want to dye.

, Now, take the piece of leather you have just dyed and submerge it in the bucket filled with the baking soda solution. Leave it in there for several minutes, so that the solution can seep into the leather and then remove it.

, Remove any white residue by washing it with water. Your leather is now ready to be made into whatever you would like.

Triangle
Square
Heart;
, Some of your local crafting stores will have felting supplies, but you'll find more gear online. To begin your starter kit you'll need:


One or two felting needles
Wool fiber
Foam cushion or pillow, Tear a sheet of wool at least half an inch thicker than your planned shape. Make sure the wool is half an inch larger on each side of the template you've created.

, You can use either a foam cushion or an old pillow. You will definitely get holes in the pillow if you go for this option, so be aware.

, To begin make sure the wool is positioned firmly onto the surface of your choice. Poke the wool in an up and down motion at random. You don't need to be forceful. Be sure to watch your fingers in this action., Using straight pins, outline the shape that you've chosen. Then, use your felting needle and go along in an up and down motion along the outline. This motion will compress the fibers into the outline., Use your felting needle to go through and flatten the center of the shape. Take time going through the up and down motion until your shape comes into picture.

, Fold the excess wool into the center. Now repeat the previous step of compressing the center of shape, this time compressing the excess into the center using your felting needle. This will create a clean and rounded edge., Now that you have a clean looking shape, flip the wool over. Now repeat compressing all the fuzzies left behind with your felting needle.


Use straight pins to secure your shape down for an easier time. This will also relieve your fingers of getting stabbed.

, You will need enough felt to cover each chair leg. Purchase pre-cut felt sheets or you can simply pull remnants from your felt bag for use.

, If you are working with an 81/2x11 pre-cut sheet, measure the felt into thirds (using your ruler and pencil). Follow the ruler with your pencil to create three distinct pieces.

, The cuts don’t have to be perfect, but make sure you end up with three strip pieces.

, Center the felt piece so you have even overhang surrounding the bottom of the leg.

, Twist and tie band as many times as needed for the best fit.

, The felt bottoms should protect your floors until you can purchase a more attractive protection system.

Pick out a 3D shape.,
Form a ball.,
Compress and add more fiber.,
Continue till you have the desired size.,
Use different colors of wool.,
Create animal sculptures.,
Practice and practice more.",How to Needle Felt2," The process for creating 3D shapes is very similar to creating flat shapes. Creating a ball is a great start to understanding the basics of 3D felting. Creating a ball can also be a very useful tool for storing your needles.

, Pinch a wad of fiber and coil it up into a ball using your fingers. You can start with a small wad at first.








, Use your felting needle to compress the wad of fibers into a smaller ball shape. Then add more fiber to the ball and repeat compressing it using your felting needle.







, Be sure that the needle pokes go in and out of the ball at the same angle. You don't need to be hard with each poke, but instead focus on making straight lines.







, Adding a variety of color will strengthen the aesthetic of your designs. Most 3D creations use different colors of wool. Different colors can be especially useful for adding detail into your design. You could for instance, add red wool into a white ball to create a baseball.








, Once you get a grasp of basic needle felting you'll be ready for the challenge of creating sculptures of your own. One of the easier designs for animals might be a penguin. All you need to do is to combine the 2D and 3D techniques.









Start with the body of a penguin. Form an oval shape.
Create the head. Create a much smaller circle than the oval shape. Add in details using black wool such as eyes and maybe a mouth.
Create the arms. To help you visualize penguin arms just think of them as little leaves. Construct two leaves that are smaller than the body, but bigger than the head.
Attach the components in the same way you compressed these shapes together, by poking straight lines with your felting needle., You'll need to allow yourself time to get comfortable in order to improve. Try set up a routine for yourself. Set aside at least one day a week to work on your creations for about an hour. If you have more free time then schedule more time for needle felting.

"
"
Improve your needle.,
Vary your fiber.,
Incorporate stitching.,
Use wires and other supplies.,
Use cookie cutters.",How to Needle Felt3," Depending on how advanced you're willing to take your needle felting, there are many types of needles that will strengthen your practice. You can create your own needle apparatus so that it is more similar to a writing utensil. You can also create various types of devices that have multiple needles. Some devices have as much as four needles in them for those initial compressions.


There are plenty of different options online if you do not feel like constructing your own device.

, There are plenty of different fibers that all function for different purposes. This may be where you look into online suppliers, unless your local craft store carries various types of sheep wool or alpaca. Explore some of these options:


Batting wool is ideal for creating sculptures.
Roving wool is similar to batting, but it is better suited for thin shapes like ropes rather than wide sheets.
Prefelt wool can be used as a clothing garment to your sculptures, but shouldn't be used as any type of base., For some of your ideas simple compression using your felting needle may not be enough. In some cases you'll need to use a more traditional string and needle stitching technique to secure your designs. This should only be used if you are concerned with the weight distribution of your design.

, To create malleable designs sometimes you'll need to use a wire as a support base for the structure. Get creative with different materials that you could form wool around. For instance, you could use a foam ball as a base. Doing this could save you time and wool.

, If you know you are going to make a lot of hearts, then invest in a cookie cutter shaped heart. It will save you time and effort by having a ready-made outline. Some craft stores will even have a selection of shapes used for needle felting.

Assemble the materials.,
Cut the fingers off the old gloves.,
Edge the base of the fingers to prevent unravelling.,
Decide on what you want to create.,
Wrap the body(the cut-off glove finger) with the felt.,
Create the face of the puppet and decorate the body.",How to Make Finger Puppets1," You will need fabric gloves, scissors, glue, various colors of felt, and anything you want to decorate the puppets with!


Fabric gloves can be found at many gardening stores. It is better to pick up a larger size to give you more room to decorate the puppets.
The felt will be used to help decorate the puppet. Buy fairly large squares of felt to ensure you have plenty in case of a mistake.
The decorations can be anything from googly eyes to sparkles. You might also want to pick up pipe cleaners to help make the puppet come alive.;
, Discard any fingers that have a hole in the top unless you are creating a ""bald"" puppet (your fingertip will be the bald patch).









Try to cut the fingers off so that the puppet will fit your finger. If you have a smaller hand, cut farther up on the glove finger.

, A simple hand-stitch is fine. Glue works just as well if you can't or don't want to sew. Simply glue around the edges of the finger where you can see the seam. You can also use blanket stitch if you know how.









This will help the puppet last longer through continued use

, Your cut-off glove finger will serve as the body for your creation. The various colors of felt will help you to get the right ""skin"" color for the body. For example, if you want to create a lion, use a light colored yellow felt.








, You can either glue the felt on or stitch it.








, The face can look like anything you want as it is your puppet!









You can glue on googly eyes or cut out small circles from the felt. It may be best to use an exacto-blade for this task.
Glue on a nose made from felt, sequins, tiny buttons etc.
Create a mouth. Glitter sticks are great for this, or cut a felt smile and glue on.
Add the hair. Use yarn, wool, string for hair. If you are making a puppet that resembles a person, add the hair to the top of the puppet, around where the seam is. If you are making an animal puppet, glue short pieces of string around the entire body.
Add anything else you would like to the puppet. If you are making a man, use pipe cleaners or cut out pieces of paper to add a hat! You can decorate the puppet with anything you would like.

Finished.

",How to Make Wool Felt Ball Coasters," The most efficient way to create these puppies is to make sure all your supplies are laid out directly in front of you and ready for use.


Open felt ball packages and place balls in one pile.






Plug in hot glue gun and make sure you have enough glue refills to get through the entire craft.






Open and stack cork coasters nearby





;
, Add a dab of glue to either the top of the coaster or back of the ball and place in the middle of the coaster.

, Encircle the center felt ball with other felt balls, keeping the circle extremely tight without crowding the balls.


Add enough glue to hold balls in place but avoid over-gluing (which will cause sloppiness).







, Work closely and use your wooden skewer if balls shift or move.

,, This could mean up to 24 hours depending on where you are working (more time for warm, humid climates).

Decide on what you want to create.,
Gather your materials.,
Take two layers of felt in your desired color.,
Cut on the line with shears/fabric scissors or an exacto blade.,
Sew or glue the two pieces of fabric together.,
Decorate your puppet.",How to Make Finger Puppets2," This will help you determine what you need to buy. If you are making an animal, decide what color will best resemble the animal's fur. If you are making a person, decide what color skin you want your puppet to have.

, You will need various colors of felt, something to draw on the felt, scissors or an exacto blade, and a thread & needle. You should also purchase any decorations you would like to have, such as googly eyes or sparkles. If you cannot or do not want to sew, be sure to also have a hot glue gun.


The color of the felt should match the color of the fur or skin of your creation.
Be sure to purchase plenty of felt. It is easy to make mistakes so give yourself some room.

, Put your finger or your child's finger on top of the felt. Trace about a quarter of a centimeter around the perimeter of the finger with tailor's chalk or any marker that will show up on the felt. If you want the puppet to have arms, draw some while tracing the finger.









If you traced your finger on the edge of the felt, you will not need to cut a straight line because the edge serves as a straight line.

, Be sure to trace the line exactly so that it later fits your finger well. Cut a straight line across the bottom of the trace to finish it off. This will be where your finger goes later on.








, Since you need a place to put your finger, do not join the two pieces of fabric at the bottom, flat-end of the puppet. Sew around the perimeter of the finger puppet close to the edge using an overcast stitch or a blanket stitch. Again, sew fairly close to the edge so there is lots of room for the finger, and use small, neat, and even stitches for a professional appearance.You may need a pin or two to hold the felt in place while you sew. Refer here if you need to learn to sew.









If you are unable to sew, or do not have a lot of time, use a hot glue gun. Remove the top layer of felt and carefully apply the glue in a thin line around the puppet. Make sure the glue is close to the edge of the felt, and that none gets in the middle of the finger puppet. Press the top layer of felt back onto the bottom layer. The felt should be aligned and not crooked; the finger puppet could easily get messed up if this step is done incorrectly. Let the puppet sit for a while after this step.

, At this point, you should be able to open up the two pieces of felt at the bottom, flat end. Now you can let your imagination run free to really make the puppet your own!









If you have decided to create a person, create clothing out of the felt and hot glue it on to the puppet. The correct size for the clothing can be determined by tracing the body of the puppet and cutting the felt.
If you have decided to create an animal, glue fur from string or light wool onto the animal.
Use any other materials you think would help with the puppet such as sparkles or pipe cleaners.

Cut a top leaf bunch shape from the darker green felt.,
Draw a small circle from the light green felt.,
Place the dark felt on top of the strawberry.,
Done.",How to Make Felt Strawberries4," It's easiest to imagine a five petaled flower shape for this; the ""petals"" will actually serve as the leaves that you find atop a real strawberry.

, This will sit on top of the dark green felt, in the center.

, Then place the green felt in the center of the dark felt. Sew the leaves in place using a single large green cross stitch in the circle felt. This allows the green leaves to flap up, as they do on a real strawberry.


If desired, you can trim the edges of the strawberry leaves to make them appear a little more raggedy, as in nature. This is optional.

, The felt strawberry can now be displayed, used on another craft project or placed in a basket or box for a gift.

Make a basic template for the head piece.,
Place the template on the felt.,
Stitch the two pieces together, stitching only around the curve.,
Make ears.,
Add eyes, nose and mouth.,
Choose a design for the head finger puppet.,
Mix and match different styles of ears, eyes, etc., to give the puppet its own personality.",How to Make Felt Puppets1," This is very simple; just draw a semi-circle shape that is wide enough to fit over the child's fingertips and long enough to reach just before the knuckle. This will be your basic template for any head you choose to make, be it animal or human.;
, Pin in place. Cut around it twice.

, Leave the straight edges unstitched; this is where the child inserts a finger.

, Ears can be triangles, half circles, bunny ears, floppy ears, elephant ears, etc. Simply cut the required shape from felt in the same color as the head. Glue in place.


Also cut inner ear pieces from a different color of felt. Glue inside the ear shape.

, These can be made from felt or from items such as buttons, googly eyes, sequins, thread, etc. Again, after cutting the shape (if needed), simply glue the item in place.

, Here the possibilities are endless but some ideas include:


Pig - pink felt, triangle ears, round snout from felt with a button glued on top, googly eyes
Mouse - grey felt, triangle ears with pink felt inner ears, googly eyes, triangle nose, felt or embroidery thread whiskers
Elephant - grey felt, ears shaped like a filled-in figure 8, pink inner ears, trunk made from grey felt with fabric pen marked lines (or sew with thread), googly eyes
Dog - Brown felt, floppy triangle ears that fold over onto the face, googly eyes, oval snout in same color as felt, with a black spot for a nose
Cat - Black felt, green cat's eyes cut from felt, triangle ears with pink felt inserts, felt or embroidery thread whiskers, triangle nose in pink felt
Girl or boy (basic person) - Skin color of choice, eyes cut from felt in eye color of choice, red or pink smiling mouth cut from felt, cheek dimples (round felt pieces), etc. Add hair in the form of yarn glued around the face from top, down; braids, etc. can extend down the face area if wished, just be sure to tie firmly so that they do not unravel

, Consider adding other features, such as a hat, a tiara, a Santa cap, earrings, eyelashes, etc.

Cut out two pieces of felt fabric following the cardboard template.,
Match and stitch the two pieces of felt fabric together.,
Decorate the finger puppet.",How to Make Felt Puppets2," Draw a rectangle onto cardboard to use as a template. Make the rectangle wider than the finger and about 2.5cm/1 inch longer than the finger. At one end of the rectangle, round it off––this becomes the top or head section of the finger puppet.

, Take care to round it off neatly. This is now the basic template for placing on the felt fabric.

, Each two pieces of felt forms one finger puppet, both head and body in one.

, Leave the straight end of the rectangle unsewn; this is the entry for the finger.

, This is the fun part but you do need to know what you want to turn the finger puppet into, such as a person or animal, and then decide what sorts of features, clothing, fur, hair, etc. the finger puppet will have.


Use yarn for hair and fur.
Use googly eyes or felt shapes for eyes.
Use felt shapes or fabric markers to make facial features such as a smile, nose, teeth, etc.
Make clothing using different colors of felt, fabric scraps, lace, ribbon, fabric paint (three-dimensional paint is a good choice), etc.

Secure the rose.",How to Make Felt Flowers1," To create felt roses, you will need to cut large circles out of your felt. Choose any color you would like, and consider choosing additional shades of green felt to create matching leaves.;
, To start your rose, you will need to use a felt circle. It doesn’t need to be a perfect circle, so you can either trace a round object or freehand it. Make the circle anywhere from 4–10 inches (10.2–25.4 cm) in diameter depending on how large you would like your rose to be.

, Use a pair of scissors to cut a spiral into your felt circle. Start at one edge, and cut a spiral inwards using a wavy-cut until you reach the center of the circle. Take your scissors and cut a wavy pattern around the edge of the circle as well, so that you are left with a flat, snake-like spiral.

, Start at the outside edge of the spiral and begin rolling it inwards. Pinch the base of the spiral as you roll to create the base of the flower. When the spiral is completely rolled up, it will create a pretty rose shape.

, Turn your felted rose over and use a needle and thread to stitch the spiral together. Tie a knot at one end of your thread and add several stitches to the back to keep the layers of the rose in place. Tie off your thread with a second knot, and you’re finished!"

Finish your bunch.",How to Make Felt Flowers2," For this pattern you will be making multiple small felt flowers and attaching them in a bunch to a felt base, similar to the appearance of lilacs in real life. For a traditional lilac look, use cream fuschia, or lavender colored felt with matching thread.

, To start your flowers out, you will need to cut many small circles. Cut between 5-15 circles measuring 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. You will also need to cut one larger circle to act as the backing. This will change in size depending on the number of blossoms you decide to create, but should be large enough that you can place all your small circles on it without seeing any edges.

, With your circles cut out, you can create your lilac blossoms. In each circle, cut out a rounded “+” shape to look like a lilac bud. Try to use as much of the circle as you can by cutting away a minimal amount of fabric.

, Arrange your small lilac blossoms over the larger felt circle you have created. Use a needle and corresponding thread to sew each blossom to the base using an “x” shape in the center of the flowers. Overlap the flowers to create texture and add a realistic appearance.

, As you finish sewing on all your small blossoms, tie a knot in the back of the bunch with your thread and cut the excess string. Add felt flowers if you want, but if not, enjoy your pretty new lilac blooms!"

Select your felt.,
Cut your felt to size.,
Glue your strips.,
Create your petals.,
Roll up your flower.,
Finish your peony.",How to Make Felt Flowers3," This method of making peonies requires long, skinny strips of felt, so use fabric that you have long pieces of. You can use any color you would like.

, Your felt strips will need to be 1½ inch wide and whatever length you would like. The longer the piece of felt you use, the larger your flower will be.

, To create the illusion of petals, you will need to create a loop out of each strip of felt. Fold the felt in half and dab glue along the edge of the fabric all the way across the strip. Hold the edges together until it is dry, forming a long, narrow, oblong tube.

, Use a pair of scissors to cut small notches in the loop. Cut notches that go ⅔ of the way down the loop (from the top, not the glued end) and are ¼ inch apart. You will end up with several dozen small loops attached along a single band of felt at the bottom.


You can cut the felt straight down or at a slight angle to get different variations of petals. Try both to see which you prefer.
Experiment with the distance between the slits you cut, as these will create petals of different sizes. For a very intricate flower, make cuts very close together. For a chunky flower, space your notches farther apart.

, Start at one end and begin rolling the felt strip inwards along the glued bottom edge. As you roll, dab glue on the inside of the felt so that the flower sticks together. When you reach the end, add a bit more glue to secure it.

, When the flower has been rolled up completely, it is done! For extra security, add a few stitches of thread in addition to the glue you used to keep the flower together. You can optionally add a few felt leaves to complete the blossom."

Add your second layer of petals.,
Glue on your final petals.,
Finish your dahlia.",How to Make Felt Flowers4," Dahlias require many small parts, and thusly need a lot of felt. Make sure that you have several full-sized strips of fabric to do this project. Use any color you would like for the flowers, and use shades of green to create matching leaves.

, The dahlias will have three layers of petals, so you will need to cut three sections of felt in differing sizes. Cut 16 rectangles measuring ½ inch x 2 inches (5.1 cm), cut 10 rectangles measuring ½ inch by 1½ inches, and 7 rectangle measuring ½ inch x 1 inch (2.5 cm). You will also need a circular base measuring 3 inches (7.6 cm) across.

, To form the shape of a dahlia petal, draw an oblong diamond shape onto each rectangle. Have two points in the center across the length, and add two more points ⅓ of the way from the top across the width. Cut these shapes out.

, Use your scissors to sculpt each petal into the correct form. Round the edges of the two points nearest to the top of the diamond, and cut ¼ of the way up the petal straight across to create a horizontal base. You will now be left with a shape reminiscent of the Pope’s hat.

, At the base of each petal, add a dab of hot glue and fold the sides in till they meet at the center. This will leave the top part of the petal open, while creating a rolled edge and pleat down the center of the bottom of the petal. Do this for all of the petal forms.

, Add the largest petals to your circular base by adding a dab of glue to the back (near the bottom) and sticking it to the base about ¼ of an inch from the edge. Work your way around until all your petals are glued.

, Use the medium sized petals to create the second layer for your dahlia. Put a small dab of glue to the back of the petal, and stick them ¼ of an inch below the base of the first layer.

, Use the smallest petals last, and glue them in a final row ¼ of an inch below the base of the second level of petals. You will be left with an open center on the felt circle.

, Add a pretty button, bead, brooch, or bit of colored felt with glue to the center of the dahlias to finish them off. Additionally, you can choose to glue or stitch on some green felt leaves to the bottom of the flower. You’re done!"

",How to Make Felt Flowers5," Hydrangeas are made from multiple small sections glued together, so make sure you have a fairly sizeable piece of felt to start this project. You can use multiple colors for a single flower if you want.

, To begin, you will need to cut 6 flower shapes from your felt. You can cut them to be any size, with larger pieces equalling a larger flower. Cut each piece to be a five petal flower with rounded edges (think of the flowers you drew as a kid). Also, cut out a small circle at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter; increase the size of the circle for a larger bunch of hydrangeas.

, Take each petal and fold it in half, adding a small dab of hot glue to the center of the flower. Because there are 5 sides to each bud, the edges won’t line up perfectly and that’s ok. Don’t glue the petals all the way across, because you want them to stay open along the edges.

, With all of your petals folded and stuck together in half, fold them in half a second time. This will leave you with a small pyramid-esq petal shape. Use another small dab of glue in the center of each petal to hold the form, but don’t add glue anywhere else.

, Glue the tip of each petal bunch to the small circle you cut. The flat sides of the folded petals should fit together nicely, and give you a lovely hydrangea clump. Add additional felt leaves for a finishing touch.,"

Done!",How to Make Felt Coasters1," Draw a grid on your 18x18 inch (457.2x457.2 mm) sheet of white felt to create smaller 4x4 inch (101.6x101.6 mm) squares. If you measure properly and don't waste the felt, you can create 20 4x4 inch (101.6x101.6 mm) squares out of a single piece of 18x18 inch (457.2x457.2 mm) felt. After you've marked the lines with a pen or marker, proceed to cut the felt into squares., Take your seven sheets of multicolored felt and create two 2x8 inch (50.8x203.2 mm) strips per color. You'll continue to cut these strips of felt to add as decorations over your 4x4 inch (101.6x101.6 mm) white square.


You can buy multicolored felt in bundles at most craft stores or on online boutiques like Etsy., From each strip of felt, you should be able to cut out four 2x2 inch (50.8x50.8 mm) squares of different colored felts. These squares should be 1/4 the size of your 4x4 inch (101.6x101.6 mm) piece of white felt. These will act as your modular pieces or the pieces of felt that will lay over your 4x4 inch (101.6x101.6 mm) white squares.

, This will create six triangles and will make your coasters look different and break up the shapes on their surface. Cut the triangles so that you end up with right triangles.

, Get creative and lay your multicolored pieces over your white felt. Arrange the felt so that the surfaces of your felt coasters look unique and colorful. Use the smaller pieces in each corner of your coaster to create different designs.


For example, you can have a pink triangle in the upper left, a blue square in the lower left, a red square in the upper right, and an orange triangle in the lower right.

, Once you're happy with the arrangement of your pieces, you can start to sew along the inner edges. Cut 18 inches (457.2 mm) of your cotton thread and thread it through the eye of your embroidery needle. Pierce the modular pieces and the white 4x4 inch (101.6x101.6 mm) square in order to hold them in place. For this step, you'll only need to sew the inner edges., Instead of having to sew each modular piece all the way around, you can take a shortcut by turning the coaster over and sewing along the edge of the coaster. This will finish holding your modular pieces in place and will complete your project. After sewing, simply turn your coaster over and use it.


Cut a 24 inch (609.6 mm) thread for this portion of the project.

Measure and cut 3.5x3.5 in (88.9x88.9 mm) squares of felt and patterned fabric.,
Cut 2.5x2.5 inch (63.5x63.5 mm) square frames out of six pieces of white felt.,
Layer your pieces of felt and fabric over each other.,
Sew the pieces together leaving a 3/8 inch (9.53 mm) seam allowance.,
Done!",How to Make Felt Coasters2," Use a ruler or measuring tape to mark twelve squares of white felt, six squares of gray felt, and six squares of patterned fabric. Use fabric scissors or a rotary cutter to cut crisp, straight edges. All of your fabric pieces should be cut to 3.5x3.5 inch (88.9x88.9 mm) dimensions.Find a fabric that has a pattern that you like and want to use for your felt coasters.
Washing your wool felt before use will make subsequent washes much easier.

, These pieces of felt should look like frames and will be sewn over the surface of your felt coasters. Once you're done cutting the white squares of felt, you should have six pieces of plain white felt, six pieces of cut white felt, six pieces of your patterned fabric, and six pieces of a different colored felt.

, Stack up your cut squares of fabric, starting with your solid white piece on the bottom, followed by your different colored felt squares, then your patterned fabric, and finally your white felt frames. This is what your felt coasters will look like once they are sewn together.


You can pin your pieces of fabric together to make sewing them much easier.Make any adjustments to your coasters before you start to sew.

, Use a zig-zag or straight stitch when sewing your pieces of felt together using a sewing machine. Use a needle and thread if you don't have access to a sewing machine. Try to sew as much in the center of your white felt frames as possible to balance your felt coasters. You should have six coasters by the end of this project.

, You can now use your felt coaster with patterned fabric.

Cut a circle out of your 3mm (0.12 inch) thick felt.,
Cut smaller circles out of two different colors of felt.,
Stack the circles on top of one another.,
Sew the circles together.,
Done!",How to Make Felt Coasters3," The largest circle should be made with your 3mm (0.12 inch) thick felt. This will be the base of the coaster and will dictate how large or small the coasters are. Typically, the largest mugs are 4 inches (101.6 mm) wide, so you're going to want to make your coaster at least 4 inches (101.6 mm) in diameter.If you are having trouble cutting circles, you can purchase stencils that can help you., Take your thinner, 1.5 mm (.06 in) thick felt and cut a smaller circle from one color of felt. Once you're done, take a different colored piece of felt and cut an even smaller circle. These felt pieces will layer on top of one another to create the design for your coaster.

, Stack the circles on top of one another, with the largest circle being on the bottom. Arrange them however you want, whether that be centered or asymmetric. Once you're happy with how you've arranged them, you can get ready to sew them together.

, The goal is to make the stitches look random, so your only goal is to make sure that the circles are tightly fastened to one another. Sew in a circle, starting from the second largest circle and go around multiple times. Continue to work your way closer into the center of your coaster until all three pieces are sewn together.When you're done sewing the circles together cut off the excess string.
Precision is not required for this step.
If you don't have a sewing machine you could stitch the circles together by hand, but it will take much longer.

, You can now use your colorful stacked felt coasters.

Buy some felt and stuffing.,
Download your pattern piece.,
Gather your scissors, stitching, and sewing supplies.",How to Make Felt Animals1," Obviously if you want to build a felt animal you’re going to need some felt. Poly-fill stuffing is most common, but you can also buy cotton or even bead if you would prefer to work with that material.Stuffing is important to give your animal some structure. You can buy both these materials at an arts and crafts store.;
, There are many pattern pieces that you can find out on the Internet. Pattern pieces are traced onto the felt and then cut out so that you have all the component pieces of your felt animal.


You can also try creating your own pattern piece. If you want to make a simple animal like a snake your can use four very elongated football shaped pieces. Make sure all your football shaped pattern pieces are the same size. Measure the width of each piece at its midline to figure out how wide your snake is going to be. Take that number and multiple it by four to get the circumference of your snake. Use this information accordingly as you make the body. You'll want the length of the snake to be four times larger than the circumference of the snake. Make sure you have enough felt! That's the idea behind making pattern pieces. You can add eyes and a tongue with extra fabric.
Remember to leave 1/4 of an inch extra room in the pattern piece for sewing purposes.

, If you don’t already have these supplies you can buy them at an arts and crafts store too. You can use a sewing machine if you have one available, but felt is easy to work with. You can just use a needle and thread.

Cut a 1 by 2-inch (2.54 by 5.08-centimeter) strip of felt, then roll it up tightly to make the stem.,
Cut the rest of the felt into strips.,
Cut your strips down into leaves.,
Hot glue one of your small leaves to the top of your stem.,
Attach the next two small leaves.,
Continue wrapping and gluing leaves around the stem.",How to Make Felt Succulents1," Start rolling from one of the narrow ends, and secure it with a strip of hot glue along the opposite end. Set the stem aside.If you don't have hot glue, you can use fabric glue instead, but you may have to tape or clip the felt roll shut until the glue dries.
Don't have any glue at home? Lightly stitch the roll shut using a needle and matching thread.
Succulents are usually either a dark green or a light, green-grey, but you can make yours any color you want.;
, You want some 1½-inch (3.81-centimeter) wide strips, and some ¾-inch (1.91-centimeter) wide strips. These will eventually become your big leaves and your small leaves., Start by cutting the strips down into squares or rectangles first. Next, cut them into leaf shapes. You can make the leaves rounded or pointed, depending on what you want your succulent to look like.Make the bottom of each leaf straight and flat instead of pointed. This will make them easier to attach.

Plan on having about 12 big leaves and 6 small leaves for each stem that you make.Alternatively, you can have 6 large leaves, 6 medium leaves, and 6 small leaves.

, Make a small line of glue along the bottom of one of your small leaves, then wrap the leaf around the top of your stem. Try to get as close to the top edge of the stem as you can, and don't worry if the leaf can't wrap all the way around the stem., Draw a line of hot glue along the base of both leaves, then wrap them around the stem, just below the bottom edge of the first leaf. Position the new leaves right across from each other. If they are too wide for the stem, overlap the bottom edges slightly., Start with your small leaves first, then move on to the bigger ones. Try to overlap the leaves slightly, and go in a spiral."

Set up your workspace.,
Take a charcoal crayon and fill an entire paper up with black.,
Find a good black-and-white photo.,
Take a piece of eraser and erase out the outline of the head.,
Start with the eyes, since they are the whitest spots on your face.,
Look at the photo and start finding the areas that are lightest.,
Start working on the details.,
Try to shape the hair.,
Erase the black background.,
Turn the portrait over and admire.,
Draw a still life.,
Move on to even harder stuff.,
When finished with a drawing, spray it with a fixative to prevent smudging.",How to Draw With Charcoal," Charcoal can draw on almost any type of paper meant for drawing. Remember, though, that coal is also very messy. It comes off your skin very easily, but to avoid your table becoming all black, put some newspapers or other papers under your workspace.;
, You don't need to draw anything yet. Just turn the white paper black. Don't leave any blank, white spots.

, Try a portrait, even if you are a beginner. Put it in front of you and turn it upside down. If you do that, you do not have exact imagination of what you are drawing and your image will be unique. Aim for some basic highlights of the human face; you do not need to copy the image exactly.

, That's right, you will be drawing with an eraser.

, Do not place them all the way on top of the image, since that's where you will draw hair. Also, consider eyeballs and the shines: Once you have the basic eye outline, take eraser and slightly make a rounded line inside of the eyeball. Now, your eyes really look realistic.

, Now, take your eraser and erase those areas out. Apply less and less pressure as you go out of the lighted area. Now, take your finger and rub those areas. That blends the gradient and makes it more realistic.

, You might want to take the charcoal again and make some outlines. Also, you can take eraser and erase other, additional areas out.

, Take eraser and make lines along the black area that is supposed to be hair. Now, take the coal and make the lines thinner. Be sure to follow patterns shown on the photo.

, Take eraser and erase everything besides the portrait. Then take the charcoal and fill in the outline that used to be white. Make the outline thin.

, But realize that that was just a start up exercise. Your image is probably not the best and looks nothing like the photo (but it looks like human!). If you want to, you can start all over again to get more practice. Once you think you've mastered making gray gradients, you can move on.

, Take some fruit, vase (maybe with flowers) and place them on a chair or table. Pay close attention to lighting and shading and use same techniques as you used in portrait to bring the image to your paper.

, Look out your window and draw what you see: Trees, streets, houses. Again, notice all the shading and lighting. Try to learn new techniques.

, You may also try hairspray, but in some cases this may ruin the piece.

Cut out the pattern pieces from the felt.,
Start stitching the corresponding pieces together.,
Sew the two body pieces together.,
Add your connecting and additional pieces.,
Connect your belly piece.,
Don’t forget to leave an opening.",How to Make Felt Animals2," You’ll want to enlarge your pattern piece to the size you want your animal to be. Make sure that you allow for a 3-millimeter seam allowance. That means you need that much extra space for the animal to fit together once you stitch it.


For example, if you were sewing a mini dog together you would have ten pattern pieces in all. Two body pieces, two head pieces, one belly piece, one back piece, one crown piece, and one tail piece. A snake would only have the long four football shaped pieces.

, For example, if you were making the mini dog you would start by sewing the body and head pieces together. In the pattern piece layout there will be letters that correspond with where each part connects. For this little dog, you’ll be sewing the two head pieces on top of the two body pieces. , Now you’ll connect the two pieces. You won’t be sewing all the way around obviously. Only sew the top half of the body together as the letters indicate. For example, if you were making this little felt dog you would start to see the outline of your animal. If you made your own pattern pieces for the snake you'll just want to connect each of them to form a cylinder.

, For example, if you were making the little felt dog you would need to add the crown piece to the top of his head. Once the body pieces are together you can start to figure out how to fill in the gaps. The little felt dog also requires a brown speckle on his back to fill in the hole on is back.

, The belly piece is generally one of the last pieces to add. Using the little dog as an example, you would turn the body pieces upside down and add the belly piece to the bottom around the edge.

, You absolutely need this opening so that you can stuff your animal. If you forget to leave the opening you’ll have to undo your stitching or start all the way from the beginning. The little dog example has a hole already built in for stuff, but you might need to leave your own hole. "
"
Turn your animal inside out.,
Stuff your animal.,
Add your embroidery.,
Stich up your final body pieces.",How to Make Felt Animals3," The little dog pattern piece leaves a hole in the stomach for you to turn your animal inside out, but you might need to leave your own hole if you are making a different felt animal.

, Using the whole you left stuff your animal thoroughly with polyester fiberfill. Make sure the animal is well stuffed but not over stuffed. You want the animal to feel firm without looking like it is going to explode. Use your judgment. , You can add whatever pieces you want. The little dog calls for small beads for eyes and some black string for the mouth and nose. You can add designs all over the felt if you desire though.


The snake embroidery would consist of little sewing on black circles of fabric or string for eyes, and a little piece of red felt for the tongue. Draw a tongue that appeals to you. Most snakes have forked tongues.

, This would be the time to add ears, tails, or whatever else your animal might have connected to their body. The little dog will have a tail stitched to the back of his body and two ears connected on top. Remember to turn your body pieces inside out after you sew them to hide the stitching. Follow the letters on your design piece. If you aren’t sure what pieces are added where, look at which letters correspond to what pieces. For example if you are adding ears to the top of a dog there will be the same letter on the ears as on the top of the body piece. Anywhere with matching letters is supposed to be connected with stitching. "

Open up the leaves.,
Glue down your next set of leaves about 1 inch (254 centimeters) above the first set, but have them face the opposite direction.,
Continue gluing the other leaves in a similar fashion.,
Cut two mini leaves.,
Glue the mini leaves to the top of the stem, between the two larger leaves.",How to Make Felt Succulents2," Start rolling from one of the long edges, and use a line of hot glue along the other long edge to secure the stem. Set the stem aside when you are done.Succulents are typically dark green or pale, green-grey, but you can make your succulents any color you want.

, Keep the bottom of the each leaf straight. You can make the edges curved or straight, however., Place the stem on top of it; make sure that it is centered and perpendicular to the leaf base (not parallel). The leaf should be about ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) up the side of the stem., Take your second leaf, and draw a line of hot glue along the base. Place the leaf over the stem, making sure that the two leaves align. Run your finger along the base of the leaf to seal the glue., Once the glue has set, gently grip the two leaves by their points, and pull them down so that they are perpendicular to the stem., Rotate your stem so that you see just the sides of your first set of leaves. They should be making a slight V-shape. Glue down your next set of leaves in a similar fashion, sandwiching the stem between them, then pull the points down., Keep about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) between each set of leaves. Remember to alternate the direction that the leaves are facing in. Your last set of leaves should be flush with the top of the stem. Pull them down so that they are perpendicular to the stem., These leaves should be shaped just like the others, but only ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) tall and wide., Make sure that the mini leaves are pointing in the opposite direction as the ones just below it. Do not pull the mini leaves apart."

Consider dyeing your felt first.,
Using pinking shears to create jagged edges.This works great for star-shaped succulents.,
Add some color or texture with acrylic paint.,
Put the succulents into a small flower pot.,
Turn it into a wreath.,
Turn a bunch of felt succulents into a fall-themed centerpiece.",How to Make Felt Succulents3," Most succulents aren't a bright green color craft felt typically comes in, but rather a soft, pale green. You can get a similar shade to this by dye white felt using green fabric dye. Each brand of fabric dye will be a little different, so be sure to follow the directions on the package.Be sue to let the felt dry before you cut it and use it.

Do a few test swatches first. Felt doesn't always pick up dye very well.
The more water/less dye you use, the softer the color will become.
Don't worry if the color turns out uneven. It will make the succulent look more realistic.
Succulents don't have to be green. Consider making a few that aren't to make them stand out. Shades of blue and purple are great options!

, Simply cut your shapes out using pinking shears instead of plain scissors. You might want to use regular scissors to cut the base of each leaf straight, however; this will make them easier to glue together., Although not necessary, this can make your succulents look more realistic and interesting. For example, you could use a thin, pointed brush and white paint to draw lines or specks on long, spiky leaves. You could also use a foam brush and a darker shade or green, pink, or red, and lightly shade the edges. This works great for star-shaped succulents.

Water the acrylic paint down first. This will ""dye"" the felt instead, and allow the texture to show through.

, Make a big succulent, then hot glue it to a smooth stone. Fill a small flower pot with pebbles, then bury the stone in the pebbles with the succulent sticking out.If you made a lot of succulents, you can use a shallow planter box instead.
If your succulent has a long enough stem, you could just fill a small flower pot with a bunch of big pebbles, and wedge the stem in between the pebbles., Wrap yarn around a Styrofoam wreath, so that no foam is showing. Use a light, neutral color, so as not to detract from your succulents, and glue to secure the yarn. Next, arrange the succulents in groups of two or three, starting with the largest. You can cover the entire wreath with succulents, or just a small portion. Once you are happy with the design, use hot glue to secure the succulents.Don't like the look of yarn? Try a willow or grapevine wreath instead!

, Cut a white foam pumpkin in half along the equator. Fill the bottom half of the pumpkin with a foam block, or a foam dome. Make sure that nothing sticks out past the cut edge. Next, hot glue moss to the foam to hide it. Arrange your succulents on top, and secure them with more hot glue.Paint part of the pumpkin with some gold or silver leaf to give it a touch of elegance.
Discard the top half of the pumpkin, or save it for another project.

Set up a clean working space.,
Trace a pattern on white paper.,
Find a pattern online.",How to Make Felt Ornaments1," In order to make felt ornaments, you will need a large clean workspace. A large table works nicely. Wipe down the surface to ensure that there is nothing that could get onto the material. Make sure that all of your supplies are handy before you begin.;
, When it comes to creating felt ornaments the possibilities are endless. For example, you could make felt ornaments in the shape of trees, stars, bells, birds, angels, snowmen, baubles, snowflakes, mittens, hearts, etc. You could stick to one pattern, or make a variety of different patterns. To make a pattern, simply draw a shape, in the size you want the ornament, onto a piece of white paper and then cut it out.You may need to draw multiple patterns until you find the shape and size you like best.

, If drawing is not your strength, you can find patterns online and then print them out on a white piece of paper to trace. For instance, complete a Google image search for ""felt ornament templates."" There is a large variety of different designs and patterns. You can also find some helpful decorating techniques as well.

"
"
Trace the pattern onto the felt.,
Cut out the pattern.,
Stitch on any details.,
Sew the ornament.,
Add a ribbon for hanging the ornament.,
Stuff and seal the ornament.",How to Make Felt Ornaments2," Once you have selected and created a pattern, trace the pattern onto the felt that you will be using to make the ornament. In order to trace the pattern onto the felt, you will need to use an iron-on transfer pen. To use this pen, print out the pattern and then trace over the design directly on the paper. Once complete, flip over the paper and place the ink directly on the felt. Iron the paper on the felt. This will transfer the ink onto the felt., In order to cut out the pattern, make sure that you are cutting two pieces of felt that are the exact same size. Try folding the felt in half with the pattern side facing up. This way you can cut both pieces at the same time. This will ensure they are the exact same shape and size. Carefully and slowly cut along the pattern.


To navigate sharp corners, stop cutting, take the scissors off the material, and change directions. Then begin cutting again, facing in a new direction.

, Depending on the ornament you are making, you may want to stitch on some added details. For example, if you are making a snowman you may want to stitch on eyes or a mouth. Stitch these details only onto one of the pieces that you have cut out.


This will vary depending on the ornament and is not always necessary. If you are not comfortable with more complex stitching, you can glue on details afterwards.

, In order to sew the ornament together, you need to layer the two pieces of felt, with the good sides facing inwards. The good sides are the sides of the felt that you want to be visible once the ornament is complete. Measure and sew a ⅛ inch seam around the ornament, leaving a 1 ½ inch opening. Typically you should leave the opening at the bottom of the ornament, but depending on the shape you may need to leave an opening along the side. Once you are finished sewing, turn it inside out, so that the good sides are facing outwards.Alternatively, you can sew the ornament together with the sides you want to be visible facing out using a blanket stitch. You will still need to leave an opening at the bottom in order to fill the ornament with stuffing.

, When you sew the ornament closed, you should add a looped ribbon for hanging. Loop a small ribbon and position it between the two pieces of fabric at the top of the ornament. When you sew the ornament closed sew through both pieces of felt, as well as the ribbon. This will secure the ribbon and allow the ornament to hang.

, Stuff the ornament with polyester fiberfill. Insert the filling through the opening that you left at the bottom of the ornament. This will give the ornament depth. Once filled, stitch the opening closed."
"
Add sequins and ribbon.,
Glue on felt details.,
Decorate with stitching.",How to Make Felt Ornaments3," Once you have sewn together the body of the ornament, you can decorate the ornament and add any details you wish. You may want to add some sequins or ribbon. For example, if you are making a star-shaped ornament, you could glue on some sequins so that the star sparkles when it catches the light. Alternatively, if you made a gingerbread man ornament, you could glue ribbon and sequins to create eyes, and a mouth. You could also use different colours and sizes of ribbon and sequins to act as decorations on the cookie.


Be creative and have fun playing around with different designs and patterns.

, You can also cut out smaller pieces of felt and glue them on as additional decoration and detailing. For example, if you are making a bird, you could cut out a felt wing and glue it onto the front to add some depth to the ornament. Alternatively, if you made an angel ornament you could glue on felt wings to the back of the ornament.


Again be creative and play around with different types of felt add ons.

, You could also decorate a felt ornament with stitching. For instance, you could sew on lines to act as extra details. You could also use a cross stitch to add a picture or design to the front of the ornament. For example, if you made a ornament that looks like tree bauble, you could decorate it with stitched stripes and swirls.

"

Make a stacked felt tree ornament.,
Make a felt ornament without sewing.,
Search online for additional creative ideas.",How to Make Felt Ornaments4," Not all felt ornaments need to be stuffed. You can also be creative and make a variety of different types of ornaments out of felt. For instance a stacked felt tree ornament is quite simple to make:Select a colour and cut felt into squares of different sizes. Begin with 6 ½ inch squares, followed by 6 ¾ inch squares, followed by 6 1 inch squares, etc. Continue cutting bigger squares, increasing the size by ¼ inch each time, until you reach 1 ¾ inch squares.
Stack the squares in piles based on size. For example, stack all 6 squares that are 1 ¾ inch in one pile, and then all squares that are 1 ½ inch in another pile etc.
Then run a looped thread and needle through the centre of each stack, starting with the largest squares and moving to the smallest.
At the top glue two ½ inch squares together to look like a star on top of the tree. Leave an extra loop of string for hanging the ornament.
Once complete rotate the squares so that they stagger looking like a tree.

, You can also make a felt ornament that requires no sewing. Simply cut out a desired shape, such as a circle to look like a bauble ornament. Then decorate the bauble by gluing on sequins and other smaller pieces of felt. Alternatively, you could cut out a red piece of felt in the shape of a candy cane and then glue smaller stripes of green and white felt to the front to make it look like a colourful candy cane.Once complete, attach a ribbon to the top of the ornament so that it can hang. Cut a hole at the top of the ornament and loop a ribbon through the hole.

, This is another simple shape, but this time you'll be adding craters and shadows to provide texture to your picture.

, Although this step departs from the more realistic boundaries you've been working with so far, you should know how to employ a little suspension of disbelief when drawing, in order to make your art as fantastical as possible.

, The shapes themselves shouldn't be too difficult, but making them proportional and positioning them so they work together will take some effort.
, A snowflake like this is made up of many straight lines and exact angles, which should be a slightly bigger challenge for you.

, While the previous shapes were all symmetrical, these crystals are not—you'll have to figure out how to work with that.

When using a completely new pencil, start 1–2 centimeters (0.4–0.8 in.) from the top and start peeling away from your body. Do this around the whole pencil until you get a nice, sharp tip.;
, Writing the title acts like a constant reminder of what you are doing and are trying to achieve.

, The best thing to do when you don’t have any ideas for the drawing is to draw a line. Drawing a line gives you a start to build from, ready to fill the paper with your ideas. And every cartoon robot starts with a line.

, This can go in many different ways, so use your imagination. Stick to the guidelines of a robot: edges, squares, rectangles, and a metallic appearance. Shade the edges lightly, as a reminder for later, in-depth shading.

, The head should connect to the body in a creative way, not just sit on top of it. For example, you can draw a fork connecting the body and head, or connect them with springs and hydraulics for movement. Feel free to add more technological parts at this point.


It is crucial for there to be depth in the drawing. This can be achieved by drawing 3D figures, using shading and perspective to give it a sense of depth. In the example drawing, the shading is done on the right side of the picture, which gives an effect as though light were shining on the robot from the left side.

, Once again, use your imagination to connect the pats together. In our example drawing, we have used hydraulics and motors to show the nature of the robot. Perspective and angle are important, as are outlining the edges.

, Add something else besides the robot to act as a complement for the robot.

, Add details like darkening the shadings and outlining the edges. Add a logo or name for personalization. Erase any errors made, and you're done!

Select paper.,
Draw a basic paper person.,
Cut around the outline.,
Add details to the paper person.,
Use the paper person.",How to Create a Paper Person1," A paper person can be made from many types of paper, it just depends on what you plan on doing with the paper person and how much ""handling"" the paper person will get.


Thin, strong card is best if the paper person is to be played with.
If using on a collage or other craft, the paper can be of any kind, matched to the craft's requirements.
Old wrapping paper can be turned into paper people; the patterns can make the person look very interesting.;
, Draw a very simple outline of a person, male or female. You don't need details on this drawing, just the shape, as you'll be cutting around this.


If you're having trouble getting the shape right, print off a basic picture of a human being and trace around it. Or, use a gingerbread man/woman cutter and trace around that, for a quirky person.
The size of the paper person is up to your needs. It might be a miniature person for playing with toy cars, or it might be a lifelike size, for pinning on the wall for a party decoration or a poster for science class.

, You now have a paper person.

, This step is optional and dependent on your end use of the paper person. However, some standard details to add include:


Facial features
Hair
Clothing
Shoes
Adornments, such as a watch, jewelry, headband, etc.

, If strong enough, the paper person can be used for play. If he or she busts, you can just make a new one.

Draw a rectangle on another piece of construction paper.,
Cut out the rectangle with the square attached.,
Tape the head to the body.,
Add any extra decorations as wished.",How to Create a Paper Person2,", Divide the T shape into five same-sized squares 8"" x 8"". Add one more square on the center top of the T shape. This forms the head shape.

,


If adding hair, draw hair on this box and on the two T-bar end boxes (the hair should run in a line from the face box, each side). Draw a line to complete the hair on the top box of the T. Color the hair in, keeping the hair color inside the drawn lines in each box.
Color the face in, if wished. If you do so, also color the non-hair areas of the two side boxes of the T-bar.

, Fold on each line drawn for the square, then tape the three-dimensional box together. The box with no drawing on it forms the base of the head. This is the head completed.

, Make it 10 inches (25.4 cm) x 5 inches (12.7 cm). Divide the rectangle into five equally sized rectangles. For one end, add a 2"" x 2"" square to the top.

, Fold at the fold lines, going left to right, then tape it all together. Fold the square over and tape in place.

, Tape onto the folded over square portion of the body.

, Once done, the three-dimensional paper person is ready for play.

Design the people.,
Assemble the paper people.,
Play on.",How to Create a Paper Person3," In this method, you only need to make basic shapes, then you can draw any designs for the people as you like, onto the shapes.

, Vary the sizes according to the ages and shapes of the persons you'll be drawing (shorter for babies and kids, taller for adults). The base of the archway should be slightly wider than the paper roll you're using for the bases.


Draw as many of these archway shapes as you want to make paper persons.

, Put to one side for now.

, Cut a small round from the paper roll. Cut two slits on opposite sides of the base. These slits will hold the paper person in place for play.


Make as many of these as you've made archway shapes.

, Draw one person per archway shape, with the flat end being the base (where their feet should end) and the rounded end the top (where their head goes to). Be creative with the styles, looks, etc.


You can make use of as much or as little of the space on the archway shape.
If you like, cut out scrap fabric and glue pieces on for the person's clothing. You could add beads for buttons and jewelry, bows as hair accessories, etc.
Have kids color in the people if they like.

, Simply slide the archway shapes into the roll bases.

, The paper people are now ready for playing with.

Cut a long strip of paper.,
Fold the paper accordion style.,
Draw the outline of a person at one end of the strip.,
Trim off any leftover paper that isn't long enough to fold.,
Unfold the paper.",How to Create a Paper Person4," A regular piece of paper will do just fine, or construction paper, printer paper, wrapping paper, etc. The flimsier the paper, the more likely the paper people chain will rip.


The number of people in the paper chain depends on the length of the paper: the longer the paper, the more people.

, Make sure that the width of the folds are the size of the outline of the person you are going to draw.

,


Take care that the head touches the top edge and the feet touch the bottom edge of the strip. Also, the hands must touch either side.
Tracing the outline of the person will be a lot easier than doing it freehand. (Do an online search for ""gingerbread man"", go to images, and there should be a plain outline that you can print off and trace over.)

, Cut out the shape of the person, leaving the folds intact at the hands (and possibly the feet also) so that the chain does not break.

, You now have a chain of people. Pull it apart and it's ready to be hung.

On top of that, you will draw the scroll.,
Now you will need to draw rather thick, curved lines on each side of the horizontal lines.,
Draw two small vertical and horizontal lines connecting the thick curves.,
After that, we will draw the pegs.,
To the right of the parallel lines, draw two horizontal lines that are even with the first set of horizontal lines inside the parallel lines.,
Repeat on the left with the next peg, on the right with the one after that, and then the left again.

Finally, color in your violin and you are finished!

",How to Draw a Violin," Using a pencil, lightly draw two ""semi-arches"", one facing the right and the other facing the left.;
,, Be sure to leave space for the fingerboard.

, Trace the sides of the ruler until right above the two s'. Draw a horizontal line to make a sort of a rectangle.

,, This may be very tricky for some people, so you will need to pay close attention. First draw a small line in the space above the parallel lines. Then draw slightly arched lines on the two sides of the center line. After that, draw a smaller horizontal line alongside each of the slightly arched lines that you just drew.

, The thick curves should be facing outward.

It is a good idea to choose a neutral PH adhesive. This non-acidic glue will not deteriorate the paper that you plan to glue to your wood.;
,, If you are using a very thin paper, you may find that the glue needs to be thinned in order to avoid bubbling.


You can thin the glue by adding water to it in another container. Add slowly and stir until you reach the desired consistency.

",How to Make Star Wars Snowflakes," Since you will be either taping them to a window or hanging them you want to design the snowflake on very strong paper that can withstand the rigors of the holidays and possibly be used again in the future.


Find a very sharp pair of scissors to cut out the snowflakes. The right pair of scissors is the key to creating a professional looking snowflake. Make sure you select only the sharpest pair; sharpen any dull blades before embarking upon this project.
Consider using a variety of scissors in order to cut out the intricate shapes. Find a pair of scissors with a smaller blade so you can make small cuts and round the edges for a more intricate project.

, While you will most likely cut through the pencil marks you will need to erase any pencil that remains.

, A number of websites offer a variety of Star Wars snowflake templates that you can use. Many have multiple designs featuring a bevy of characters.

, A heavier bond paper will allow you to create a hearty template that you can easily trace and re-use. Be sure your printer can handle the paper bond and won’t jam or damage the printer. (You may want to consult the manual to determine how heavy you can go.)

, Why stick with boring white when you can jazz up your snowflake? If you like Jedi white, you could use white or silver glitter to make your snowflake shine.

, Be very deliberate when cutting out the shape; going slowly with the scissors and being sure you round out every corner in order to create a clean template.

, Lightly trace the template over the cardstock. Avoid pressing your pencil down hard on the cardstock in case you make an error and need to erase.


Consider taping the template down over the cardstock to keep it firmly in place. If the template keeps slipping while you are trying to trace, use small pieces of clear tape on the far edges of the template to hold it in place.

, Once you have the snowflake fully traced, carefully cut it out.


Use different sized scissors for some of the intricate edges. Stop cutting when you get to areas that require a more intricate touch and grab the smaller pair of scissors.
Erase any remaining pencil marks on the snowflake. Once it's cut out, examine the snowflake for remaining pencil marks. Use a clean eraser to remove the marks.

, Let your creativity and imagination run wild by customizing and designing your snowflake with your own unique touch.


Cover the snowflake surface with glue from the glue stick before affixing decorative items. Use broad strokes over the snowflake, covering every inch of it with a thin sheet of glue.
Add glitter by liberally sprinkling it directly from the container onto the snowflake over a paper plate. As the residual glitter falls from the snowflake it will hit the paper plate and can be reused for the next snowflake or project.

Vellum can give photos a blurred look, which may help establish the theme you're going for on a scrapbook page.A darker colored, hazy vellum can provide a dreamy look to a page. A wedding photo can be made more romantic with hazy vellum covering it. If you include photos from wintertime or Christmas, try placing a white or ivory piece of vellum over the photos. This will give them a wintery feel.
You can also cover up a portion of a photo with vellum. This can emphasize certain features of the photo, while blurring others. Maybe you have a picture of your toddler laughing, and want to emphasize her smile. You can create a border with vellum going around your toddler's face. This will make viewers focus on her smile.;
, As vellum is see through, you can make a pocket with vellum that will not conceal items in your scrapbook. If there's an item you want to showcase in your scrapbook, but do not want to tape or glue down this item, try displaying it with a vellum pocket.Cut out a square or rectangle of vellum big enough to pocket your chosen supplies.
Place the vellum onto your chosen page. Use a sewing machine to stitch around the edges of your vellum pocket. Do not stitch the top edge of the vellum. This is the opening of your pocket.
Slide your materials through the top edge of the vellum. You can now display materials that are meant to be removed and examined more closely when someone pages through your scrapbook.

, Vellum with quotes can be used as a background piece for a series of photos. You can also print quotes on vellum and lay the pieces over a photo. This way, you can have inspiration quotes superimposed over images in your scrapbook.You can go to a local print shop to print on vellum. Choose quotes relevant to what you're trying to convey on your scrapbook page.
For example, say you're scrapbooking your wedding photos. It may be a fun idea to write out the lyrics to the song you danced to for your first dance.

, When you attach vellum to the pages of your scrapbook, use an adhesive that will keep vellum on longterm. Glue sticks and glue sprays are generally the most effective to use on vellum. You can get these products at a local craft store.When gluing down vellum, place the glue on the page rather than the vellum.
Adhesive can show up beneath vellum, as vellum is transparent. Therefore, it's a good idea to place adhesives in portions of vellum that will be covered by extra layers or decorations.

Draw and illustrate on vellum.,
Trace your favorite designs.,
Paint on vellum.",How to Use Vellum2," Vellum is an excellent surface for drawing and illustration. If you draw and illustrate as a hobby, try doing some drawings on vellum. This can give your pictures a unique look, and vellum can provide a sturdy surface for drawings.Typically, ink drawings are done on vellum. Preliminary drawings can also be done on vellum. That is, if you want to draw or paint something on a canvas, you can practice on vellum paper first.
If you want to add color, vellum's surface works well with colored pencils. Colored pencils will blend more easily, creating a smooth texture.

, As vellum is translucent, it is perfect for tracing existing designs or replicating a drawing that you are particularly proud of. Lay the vellum over the design and use ink or pencil to recreate the image.When tracing on vellum, you will be drawing on what is known as the ""hair side."" This is the side of vellum that is hard and smooth. The ""skin side"" is softer and fuzzier, and should not be drawn on.
Test different types of pencils on a vellum surface. You want to find a pencil that works with your chosen vellum. You want the trace marks to be thin and smooth, and you do not want lead piling up on the vellum and clogging the pores.
Use tissue paper to cover areas you are not drawing on. Lead may smear during the tracing process, so tissue can help keep the lead contained.

, Vellum may be used with certain painting mediums. Vellum can make a painting's colors appear shinier, and many people enjoy painting on vellum. Apply a neutral base color to the vellum before you begin painting. When dipping your brush in paint, you want to have enough to coat the vellum evenly, but not so much that you're leaving blobs of paint on the vellum.It may take a few brush strokes before you find the right amount of paint to add to your brush.
Once your base coat is dry, you can begin painting you images on vellum. With vellum, you paint in layers. You add one layer of color, wait for it to dry, and then add another. Move from light colors to dark colors, and move your brush slowly over the vellum to prevent smearing and paint blobs.
Use the type of brush your painting requires. To create thin lines, for example, you would need to use a thinner brush. You may have to switch between various brush types as you create your painting.

Print on vellum.,
Make an envelope with vellum.,
Print a greeting card.,
Print out photos on vellum.",How to Use Vellum3," Printing on vellum can be used for a variety of small crafts. You can, for example, print a nice quote on attractive vellum paper, and then put in a picture frame as a gift. You can also print out a birthday greeting on vellum, and glue the vellum inside a card. Printing on vellum can be somewhat tricky, so have patience during the printing process.Read your printer's manual and see if there are any specific instructions for printing on unconventional types of paper. Ink can smear easily on vellum, so see if your printer has a ""draft"" or ""quick"" printing mode. These modes tend to use less ink.
See if your printer lets you choose a paper type when printing. Most printers default to ""plain paper."" Instead, select something like ""photo paper"" or ""fine art paper.""
After printing your vellum, set it aside to dry. Ink will take awhile to dry on a vellum surface, so it's important to set the paper aside to dry. Do not attempt to use vellum in crafts until the ink is dry to the touch.

, Take apart a regular envelope and use it as a template to create the vellum envelope. When assembling the envelope, try using glue specifically made for vellum, as vellum possesses different adhering properties than typical paper.


Make sure to use a glue that dries clear. Standard or colored glues will be visible through the translucent nature of vellum.As vellum can be hard to write on, and can smear easily, you may want to mail out vellum envelopes inside conventional envelopes.

, Print your wedding invitations or other greeting cards on vellum for an airy design. These can be further modified with a drawing or personalized message once the printing has completed.


If you're having trouble feeding thick cardstock into the printer, consider printing onto the vellum and overlaying it onto the cardstock instead. Attach the vellum with vellum glue along the top, or punch holes through the vellum and cardstock and use a ribbon to tie them together., Mat a photo onto a larger sheet of plain, colored or printed vellum. You can then lay the printed photo on colored cardstock. Create a border by choosing a sheet of cardstock larger than the vellum or with an overmat. Add a mounting board, glass and a frame if you wish.


The photos can also be printed on vellum paper directly and combined with standard cardstock for various effects."

Glue a thread on the back of the plate and hang it on the wall using a command hook or thumb tack.",How to Make a Paper Dahlia1," The list is located at the bottom of the article.;
, You will need around 50 to 60 squares to make one dahlia. Use a paper trimmer to make this job easier. If you don't have one, a simple ruler and scissors will do the job.

, Dab the sponge around two corners of each squares as shown.


This is done to create a two color dahlia. Dabbing gives a natural look compared to just painting the corners. If you don't have a sponge, use dry brush to create that effect.

, Wait for it to dry overnight, then come back to it in the morning. Lightly dab your finger in a small area of the paint. If no paint comes off on your finger, it is sufficiently dry.

,,, Make around 50 cones to start making the dahlia. You can always make extra if you want.

, The plate used in the images above was 9 inches (22.86 cm) in diameter. If you don't have a plate, you can also cut a piece of cardboard to use as a base. Apply a line of glue on the back side of the cone.


A plate is preferred to use than cardboard. The reason is that while hanging the flowers on the wall, the plate gives a three dimensional effect as if the flower is popping out from the wall instead just pasted on the wall. But it is your choice to decide which one to use.

,,,,, For this, take the left over pieces (3"" X 8"") of the cardstock paper and make fringes for the center by cutting only 3/4 of the paper (lengthwise) in 3 to 4 mm width and leaving the remaining part to fold.

,,,, Your dahlia is now ready to hang on the wall.


Refer to this image for a closer look of what the dahlia should ideally look like.







,


If the plate has holes, just insert a rubber band into the holes and hang it on to a command hook.

Find an A4 size piece of paper.,
Cut out a small square or parallelogram.,
Convert this base tessellation into a more interesting shape.,
Trace it on the 3"" x 6"" (7.5cm x 15cm) paper until it is full.,
Go over the lines with a black permanent marker.,
Color it in anyway you like.,
Ink it all over.,
Let dry.",How to Make a Translation Tessellation," The piece of paper should correspond to the volume of your tessellation. If you want a larger tessellation, choose larger paper. If you want a smaller tessellation, choose smaller paper.






;
, This will form the basic shape from which your tessellation will be generated. Any translation tessellation can be constructed starting from a parallelogram-based tessellation. While not strictly necessary, using graph paper or making ruler marks along the edges will help with the next step.








, By following these steps, you ensure that your shape will always be able to tile the plane.









If you find it easier to work from a rectangular base, but want your tessellation to have slide symmetry, cut off one of the triangular flaps and append it to the opposite side. In the computer-generated image shown, the angle of the parallelogram was needed to determine the extent of the glide; if doing this by hand, you could start from this tessellation directly.
Cut one side of the square and tape it to the opposite side. Do not flip it over or make any other movements other than sliding the paper to the opposite side. Use the ruler markings to ensure the cut portion is attached to the corresponding part of the opposite edge. In the image, a triangular region was moved to the opposite side.
Repeat this cutting and pasting as desired. Moving one more triangular region creates the tessellation shown in the next step.

, Fill in the blank spaces with a color of your choosing.








, Then make a design in the black permanent marker.








, Use contrast to create three dimensional effects or use free coloring the small or large paper with any favorite color.








, Scrape off any extra ink.








, Do not let the extra ink dry or it won't come off.

,,,, This is similar to typical regular paper snowflakes. It can be as simple or as complex as you want. Cutting triangles tend to be easiest, but rounded shapes are possible too.

, It should have a repeating pattern around it.

, These have to be the washable kind, which are water based.


Your coloring does not have to be neat; the design will spread and blur into colored blobs.

, The longer it is submerged, the more blurred the colors will get. It only needs to be submerged for a second or two.


Alternatively, you could use a spray bottle and spray water on the snowflake. This will result in a less blurred, more colorful snowflake. It also may be a little less messy when working with children, as they tend to slop water everywhere.

,, Be gentle, as wet filters tear easily.

, Alternatively, you can simply stick it wet on a window and it will hang there until it dries and falls off. Enjoy!

, A good project with young children is worth repeating. With a few variations, this project can be done again to easily fit another theme. For example:


Do not cut the paper filter - just ""tie-dye"" it. Just by itself it is pretty. It also creates a nice ""stained glass"" effect which is nice for a unit on the Middle Ages.
You could also create a flower. Again, skip the cutting steps. When dry, add a green chenille stick and paper leaf. Give the paper a small twist to create a flower!

Staple the strips together.,
Bend the strips one by one down to the base of the stack of papers.,
Staple the base of the heart together.,
Punch a hole through the center strip.,
Insert twine through the hole.,
Hang your ornament.",How to Make a Heart Out of Paper1," These heart ornaments are beautiful and only take a few minutes to create, making them ideal for garlands. They consist of strips of paper bent into a heart shape., Use sturdy paper, like construction paper or patterned scrapbook paper. You will need nine strips in four different lengths, and each strip should be 2 inches (5 cm) wide.


Three strips should be 10 inches (25 cm) long.
Two strips should be 12.5 inches (32 cm) long.
Two strips should be 15.75 inches (40 cm) long.
Two strips should be 19.75 inches (50 cm) long.

, The strips need to be piled together in a specific order so that the proper pattern forms in your heart.


Pile four of the strips on top of each other from smallest to largest until you have used one of each size. The largest should be on the bottom with the smallest on top.






Flip the pile over so that the largest is on top. Place another of the smallest strips on top of the first 19.75 inch (50 cm) strip. This newest strip will stay at the center and will help you to hang your heart.






Pile the remaining strips on top of the others from largest to smallest, until all the strips have been used. This means the largest will go on top of the smallest that you have just placed down with the rest on top. You will end up with the smallest on top once more.







, Make sure the bottoms of all the strips are evenly lined up with one another. Put a single staple through the bottom to hold the strips together.

, Hold the stack together at the bottom, near your lowest staple, and bend the pieces of paper toward your fingers. Starting with the smallest strip on each side, bend each of the strips down to the staple at the base of the stack of papers.


Bend each of the four strips on the right side starting with the smallest and ending with the longest. Bring them down to the right side of the staple at the base of the stack.
Bend the corresponding four strips on the opposite side down and to the left.
Leave the center strip straight and hold the stack together with thumb and forefinger at the base of the heart.






Be careful not to crease the paper as you bend it.

, This will keep all the strips in their bent position. Use as many staples as necessary to hold the bent strips of paper in place.


You may also need to add staples further along the stem to help form and maintain the heart shape. These staples might be visible so it is your choice whether to add them to your heart or not.







, Use a paper hole puncher to punch a small hole at the top of the straight center strip.


Center the hole and place it roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the top edge.







, Place a long string, ribbon, piece of yarn, or piece of twine through the hole and tie it into a loop. You can use this loop to hang your heart ornament.

, Now that your heart is complete you can hang it in a location of your choice. You can also make additional ornaments and connect them into a garland if you wish.

Use the paper heart chain to create a line of hearts from a single piece of paper.,
Choose a piece of paper.,
Fold the strip accordion-style.,
Draw half a heart on the top fold.,
Cut around the outline.,
Unfold the chain.,
Trim off excess paper.,
Decorate as desired.",How to Make a Heart Out of Paper2," The paper heart chain will create a line of identical hearts that are all connected together. This chain is quite easy and is a good project for kids., You can use any size paper, but the most convenient size to use is a standard letter size or A4 sheet of paper, from which you can make two chains of hearts. Choose a color that appeals to you and your preferences.


Fold and unfold the sheet of paper in half lengthwise. Cut along the crease to divide it into two even halves.






Be very careful to give young kids only blunt, child safe scissors to use.
You only need one half to complete the chain, but you can save the other half and use it to create a second chain, if desired.

, Starting from one short end of the paper, fold the strip back-and-forth, making each fold roughly 1.25 inches (3.175 cm) wide.


Vary this width according to your preferences. For a standard letter size sheet of paper, this width will create a chain of about four hearts. Wider folds will create fewer hearts.
Fold the paper over once.






On the next fold, fold the two-layer thick edge of paper under the rest of the paper.






Repeat this over-and-under folding pattern until the entire strip has been folded up.







, The middle of the heart should face the folded side of the top segment. The curved outer edge should go over the side of the paper.


In other words, the other edge will not be completely outlined. If you do complete the outline, the chain will fall apart once you cut it out. Do not cut this edge completely.

, Use sharp scissors to cut around the outline of the half-heart. Leave the paper tightly folded as you cut.


Make sure that there are some folded edges on both sides of the half heart shape. If you trim away or try to round out the outer edge of the heart, you will end up disconnecting the heart chain.
You can also cut out small section from the inside of the heart. These will create cutouts inside your hearts, similar to making a paper snowflake. Make sure that these cutouts do not alter the outside shape of the heart.
Always be careful when using scissors. Do not injure yourself and give children only child-safe scissors to use.

, Carefully unfold the segments to reveal a chain of connected hearts.

, There will usually be extra paper after the last heart. This will look like a partial or incomplete heart so it is best to simply remove this section.

, You can decorate the heart chain with paint, glitter, stickers, stamps, or just about anything else.


If you have made cutouts in your heart you can glue tissue paper or cellophane onto the back to create a stained glass effect.
For a longer chain, you can start out with a longer strip of paper or connect several smaller chains together with string or tape.

Use this method to create a stuffed heart out of paper.,
Fold two pieces piece of paper in half.,
Trace the shape of half of a heart on one side of one paper with the center of the heart along the creased side of the paper.,
Cut out your heart.,
Use the heart you have just cut to create another heart in the other paper.,
Decorate the heart.,
Poke evenly spaced holes along the edge.,
Stitch the holes together for ¾ of the way around the heart.,
Stuff the heart.,
Stitch the heart closed.",How to Make a Heart Out of Paper3," The stuffed heart will be larger and heavier than the other paper hearts and is thus excellent for larger decorations or gifts. The edges are stitched together and the heart can be decorated as much as you like., Fold the papers in half width-wise or ""hamburger style,"" bringing the two short ends together. Choose a color that suits your preferences for the heart.


Crease the paper well in order to hold the halves in place.







, If you feel confident in your ability to free-hand draw the heart, you can do so without a pattern or template. Otherwise, find some sort of template that you can trace.


You can use a heart-shaped cookie cutter or paper weight as a template, or you can print a heart template onto standard printer paper and cut it out to use as a template.

, Cut along the outline you traced and unfold the paper to reveal a symmetrical heart.

, Fold the heart in half once more and use this shape to trace the same half of a heart outline on the other paper. Cut out the second heart as well. You should now have two hearts that look the same., If you plan to decorate the paper heart at all, you should do so before sewing and stuffing. You can decorate you heart with stamps, stickers, markers, colored pencils, crayons, paint, glitter, craft sequins or anything you can think of.

, Use a thick sewing needle to poke small holes in even intervals along the perimeter of the heart. If young children are completing this project then they should use a slightly blunted needle for safety.


You could also use a paper piercer or the sharp pointed end of a compass instead of a sewing needle.
Make sure that the two pieces of paper are stacked and pierced in the same places.






Pierce near the edge but not so close that the edge of the paper may rip. About ½ inch or 1.25 cm would work well.







, Thread a sewing needle and start stitching the two paper hearts together, weaving the thread in and out of the holes you pierced. Only sew up 3/4 of the holes so that you can still stuff the heart.


Use thick thread or two to three pieces of thread wrapped together.
Begin your stitches from the back, toward the bottom tip of the heart.
Do not pull the thread taut through the first hole. Instead, leave about 3 inches (7.6 cm) of thread free and loose at the start of the heart.
You can also stitch using the blanket stitch. Which will provide a nice edging for your heart as shown in the picture. The blanket stitch involves tying the thread to the first hole and then pushing the needle through both layers of the heart. Before tightening the thread, bring it up through the loop created around the edge. Tighten the thread and that is a blanket stitch.







, Use plastic grocery bags, batting, or bundled tissue paper to stuff the heart through the open section of the heart. Stuff the heart gently to prevent it from tearing.


Use a pair of scissors or a pen to help push the stuffing into the heart.







, Stitch the remaining holes closed. Tie the two ends together in the back of the paper heart. You should now have a lovely decorated stuffed heart to admire!

Place one folded piece on top of the other at a 90-degree angle.,
Place the rectangles directly on top of each other so that the creases are on top of one another.,
Draw thin lines in pencil from the bottom of the folded piece of paper up to the dotted line.,
Cut a curved end around the top of the folded papers.,
Turn one piece of paper to the side at a 90-degree angle once again.,
Weave the strips together.,
Open your basket.,
Add a handle or strap.",How to Make a Heart Out of Paper4," These are beautiful little hearts that double as small baskets. You can hang these from the tree and add small treats inside as gifts., These should be two different colors to weave a nice pattern for your heart. Traditional colors are white and red although you can use any combination you prefer. Choose paper that is a medium weight.

Too thick of paper will make it difficult to complete the weaving.
Too thin of paper will not hold up as a basket., If you are using standard letter size or A4 paper then you can fold them in half “hamburger style” or width-wise. Then cut a straight line from the center of the folded edge to the center of the non-folded edge on both sheets. You will use one rectangle of each color.

The size of the papers can be varied according to your preferences, because it will change the size of your finished heart.
Keep the two pieces folded in half.

, The top piece will be vertical while the bottom is horizontal. Their left edges should meet evenly so that the sideways piece is sticking out to the right. Draw a thin line in pencil on the sideways piece along the edge of the vertical piece., Make sure the two pieces are facing the same way. You will want the piece with the pencil line on top so that you can see it., Draw multiple straight lines along the paper up to the original line. This will divide the paper into strips partway along its length. Cut along these lines through both of the folded pieces of paper.

Make sure your strips are at least ½ inch (1.25 cm) wide or else they may break easily. The size and number of your strips does not matter, it is all personal preference. Keep in mind, however, that the size and number of strips will change the difficulty of weaving. For kids, try to create only three strips to begin with.

, While both folded papers are still on top of one another, cut the end without the strips in a curve. These curves will create the two upper curved parts of the heart. These edges should now look like half an oval., Turn one piece of paper so that it is horizontal while the other paper remains vertical. The rounded edge on the vertical piece should be towards the top while the rounded edge on the horizontal piece should be facing right.

The two creased edges should form a 90-degree angle in the bottom left-hand corner.

, Weaving this heart is different than normal weaving because you will be weaving the strips “through” and “around” rather than “under” and “over.”

Take the top strip on the horizontal paper and weave it through the first strip on the vertical paper. “Through” here means in between the two layers of that strip.
Now take that same top strip and put it around the second strip on the vertical piece of paper. “Around” here means that the two layers will go above and below the second strip on the vertical piece of paper. Alternatively, you can rather think of it that the second strip on the vertical paper is going in between the two layers of the top strip on the horizontal paper.
Continue taking the top strip of the horizontal piece of paper through and around the strips on the vertical folded paper. This top strip should now be woven through all the other strips.
Take the first strip (on the right side) from the vertical piece of paper and continue weaving it through and around the remaining horizontal strips. Since the first vertical strip is already around the first horizontal strip, you will next take it through the second horizontal strip and continue until the end.
Continue with all the strips weaving them through and around the others until all the rows and columns are woven., Now that all the rows of strips are woven through the others, you should have a completed woven heart. Open up the basket by inserting a finger between the two layers of paper. You can fill this basket with whatever treats or other small items you choose., Cut a long piece of matching paper to the length that you wish your handle to be. Use tape or staples to attach the handle to either side of the inside of the heart.Alternatively, you can poke a hole in the top center of the heart and string a ribbon or twine through it. Tie a knot in the two ends of the ribbon and you will have a nice handle or string from which to hang the heart.
If you poke holes you can also add small grommets to make the heart look more polished, although this is not necessary.

, This will be your initial arc.

, Legal paper works the best, but you can get by with an 8.5 x 11 (21.5 x 28cm) sheet of paper if you are careful.

,, Angle it away from the longer section toward the shorter, 1/3rd edge of the paper, forming an obtuse angle., Extend it to the opposite edge of the paper.

, This will be the ""flap"" or ""lip"" used for taping or gluing the edges of your shade together.

,, Open the compass to the height measurement and draw a second arc, using the same center point. The distance between the two arcs will be the height of your shade.

, Cut the two arcs, and then cut outside of the ""flap"".

, Overlap them slightly before fastening with tape or glue.

, At this point, you can decorate the shade as you wish:

Use hole punches to allow direct light through.
Draw designs on it.
Scallop the edges.
Put stickers on it.
Your imagination is the only limiting factor!

Scrunch up the bottom of the lantern, so the cut slits point outwards, and tape the bottom edge.,
Tape or staple a handle to the top of the lantern.,
Optional -- hide the tape lines by gluing two strips of paper around the top and bottom edges of the lantern.",How to Make a Chinese Paper Lantern1," All you really need to make a Chinese paper lantern is colorful paper and some tools. Red is a traditional color, but any color will do:


Construction paper (8.5"" x 11"" or bigger)
Scissors
Pencil
Ruler
Stapler, tape, or glue;
, This will be the accent color of your lantern, with the full-size piece used as your main color. Cut use a ruler and scissors to make the sheet an inch shorter on the length and the width.









Save these strips for later -- they can make good handles.

, Fold the big, uncut construction paper in half horizontally, so that the two long edges meet. Use the hard edge of your ruler or your fingernail to make a nice even crease at the fold.








, If the construction paper was a hotdog bun, you'd be cutting from the bottom up. For perfect Chinese paper lanterns, use the ruler to ensure every cut goes equally high. While there is no perfect height to get to, usually longer cuts (3-5"") look best.








, You don't want too much overlap. This smaller sheet becomes the form and shape of your lantern, so you want it to be large and well rounded. Staple or tape it together once you have your shape.









If in doubt, overlap the papers about a finger's width.

, You're doing the same thing you did with the smaller sheet, but, this time, you use the pre-made cylinder as a guide. Take the long edge of the lantern sheet and tape it around the entire top edge of the smaller sheet.









Because it is longer, the bottom edge should overhang.
Work slowly, getting the edges of the two papers lined up perfectly for the best lantern.

, You should already see your lantern forming before you've even taped it. Again, go slowly for the best, most precise results.








, Simply curl one of the strips from earlier in half and tape it to two places along the top of the lantern.








, You'll be able to see where the paper overlaps and glues or staples together. But you can create a nice accent and avoid the issue by using two strips of paper and some glue. Matching the interior color of the lantern with these trim pieces (like in the video) is extra slick looking.

Carefully fold the paper the other way.,
Use a small piece of clear tape to connect the two paper ends together.,
Staple or tape on the handle.,
Hang up your paper lantern somewhere in the house.",How to Make a Chinese Paper Lantern2," Cut off the top and set it on the side for later. This will be the lantern's handle.








, Make sure you take the time for a perfect, even fold. This will lead to a much better lantern,








, This will be the ""stop cut"" line. The top of the fold means the two open edges of the paper, not the crease at the bottom.

, You want to start from the fold at the bottom and work up to the top Stop at the top line.








, Making this fold will help you hide any pencil marks.

, Repeat on the other side.








, You could also cut out another color and use that instead to give your lantern a little more flavor.








, Make several lanterns to decorate the house fully.

Tape the end of the strap to the back of your phone case.,
Cut and stick a piece of self-adhesive Velcro to the front of the strap.,
Peel off the backing from the other Velcro half, then stick it to the front of the case.",How to Make a Duct Tape iPhone Case," Use a ruler to measure the length and width of your phone. Add 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) to each measurement., Cut two strips of duct tape based on your length measurement. Stick them down on a cutting mat, overlapping the sides until you get your width measurement. Flip the sheet over, and cover it with two more strips of duct tape.

Repeat this step for the other sheet.
Use an craft blade to cut off any excess duct tape.

, You will need two strips that match the length of your sheet, and two strips that match the width. Slice each strip in half lengthwise. You will have a total of eight strips when you are done.

You can use the same color as your case, or a coordinating one.

, Place one of the shorter strips over one of the narrow ends of your first duct tape sheet. Make sure that half of it is sticking out over the edge of the sheet. Flip the sheet over, and stick the other half of the strip down. Do this for the remaining edges on both sheets.This will hide the raw edges of the sheet as well as reinforce it., The rectangle needs to be the same size as one of your duct tape sheets. If you don't have a heavy-duty Ziploc bag, you can use a freezer one instead.Make sure that you cut the rectangle out of a blank side, without any words, patterns or designs.

Alternatively, you can make a large ""duct tape sheet"" using clear packaging tape.Don't use the small sandwich bags made from thin plastic. They are not very durable.

, Set down one of your duct tape sheets. Place your phone on top of it, making sure that it's centered. Place the plastic sheet on top of your phone., Cut a strip of duct tape to match the length of your duct tape sheet, then slice it in half lengthwise. Place one of the strips over the edge of the plastic sheet, then carefully fold the excess onto the back of the duct tape sheet.Repeat this step with the other strip for the other side edge. Make sure that you pull the plastic sheet tightly across the front of the phone.
You can use a contrasting color to make your case look more interesting.

, The slits should be right next to the duct tape border, and about ½ inch (1 centimeter) long. You will have three tabs at the bottom of your plastic sheet: two solid duct tape tabs on each side, and a clear, plastic tab in the middle., Fold down the left tab on your plastic sheet; it will make a sort of triangular shape. Secure it with a thin piece of tape. Repeat this step for the right tab., Cut a strip of duct tape that is the same width as your duct tape sheet. Slice the strip in half lengthwise. Use one of the strips to tape down the center tab on the plastic sheet. Fold the excess tape over the bottom edge of the duct tape sheep and onto the back., Take the other strip from the previous step. Stick it to the top of the plastic sheet, so that half of it is touching the plastic, and the other half is sticking out. Fold it over the top edge of the plastic sheet. Make sure that you are only taping the plastic sheet and not the duct tape sheet.Ensure that the strip doesn't cover the camera on your phone. Trim the strip down narrower, if you have to.

, You can use the same color as the sheet, or a contrasting color. You will be using this to bind the two duct tape sheets together., Set your duct tape sheets down on your cutting mat, leaving a small gap between them. Place your duct tape strip over the right and left side edges of the sheets, covering the gap.The gap needs to be about the same width as your phone.

, This time, cut the strip 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) longer than your assembled case. Use the same color as the first strip. This time, Flip your assembled case over first so that you can see the outside. Place the second strip of duct tape right over the center seam, covering the sticky part.You will have ½ inch (1 centimeter) of excess tape sticking out over the top and bottom of the case., Flip the case over so that you can see the inside. Fold the excess tape at the top and bottom edges down. Your case is now fully assembled!, Each strip needs to be 4 inches (10 centimeters) long. You can match the color to your case or to the trim. You can also use a third color, but make sure that it goes well with the other two., Place your first strip down, sticky-side up. Place your second strip right on top of it, sticky-side-down. Make sure that they overlap by 1½ inches (4 centimeters). You will have about ½ inch (2 centimeter) of excess tape along the top and bottom long edges., Fold the top edge down first. Flip the strap over, then fold the other edge down as well. You should now have a strap that has smooth, finished edges on both sides., Flip your phone case over so that the back is visible. Cut a strip of duct tape that is 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) wider than your strap. Center the end of the strap on the back of the tape, then secure the tape to the back of your case.Make sure that the strap is centered; it should be halfway down the length of your case.

, Cut a piece of self-adhesive Velcro that is a little narrower than your strap. Peel off the plastic backing from one side, then press it against the inside of the strap. Do not pull apart the two Velcro halves yet., Once you have the Velcro secure to the back of the strap, peel away the second plastic backing. Pull the strap across the front of your case to where you want it to be, then press down on it.Use your fingernail to gently pry the two Velcro hales apart. Press down on them

Make sure you have what you need.,
Have a template.,
Once you have downloaded the template.,
Once you are happy with the position of you logo / logos you are ready to print your artwork.,
Now that you have printed your page it should look something like this.,
Next step is to cut out your designs with your scissors or art knife and ruler.,
Now we are ready to position our print onto our sublimation mug.,
Now adjust your pressure setting on your mug press so that when you clap your mug in the press it have medium to heavy pressure on it.,
Now plug in your mug press and set the temperature for 400F / 204C and the timer for 180 seconds and let it preheat to the required temperature.,
Once the time is up release the pressure off the press and remove the mug by the handle followed by picking the edge of one the the bits of heat tape on one end of the paper with your fingernail then peeling the paper off the mug in one smooth movement.,
Now place you mug on a heat proof surface until it has cooled down enough to handle.",How to Dye Sublimate Custom Printed Mugs," The items needed are, the following: inkjet printer with sublimation inks installed, graphic art software like Adobe Illustrator or Coral Draw, sublimation paper, mug heat press, pair of scissors or art knife and a ruler, heat tape and a few blank sublimation mugs.   ;
, You can download one from our website here. This template is for an 11oz, 325ml mug. Diameter of the mug is 260mm. Print area is 70mm Wide x 90mm High on two sides of the mug. Our AI template is setup so you can print the graphics for two mugs on the one page. We have left guidelines in place to show you where to position the logos so that they are positioned at approximately 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock if you are looking down on top of the mug with the handle in the 12 o'clock position. Please keep important text and graphics 2.5mm away from the edge of the magenta cut line or the guide-lines. This is so when you cut out your finished printed sheet that you don't accidentally cut into your logo. Background graphics should extent 2.5mm past the cut-line.

, Open it in Illustrator and layout your logos or artwork in the position stated. If you only want 1 logo on each mug then position your logo to the right hand side. This means a right handed person will see your logo when they pick up your mug. It is actually on the wrong side at the moment by once we print in mirror image it will be on the correct side, which is on the left side of the page.

, Generally for most good quality sublimation paper you don't require a lot of ink to be laid down on the sublimation paper. If you are using an EPSON printer good setting to start with are Quality Option: Photo, Paper Type: PLAIN PAPERS, under the Page Layout Tab make sure the Mirror Image check-box is ticked. Click OK then the Print Button and then the Print button again in the Illustrator Print window. 

, Don't worry about the washed out look. All sublimation prints look like this. The magic happens once the image is heat pressed / printed onto the mug. This is when the ink turns to a gas state and is absorbed into the polyester coating on the surface of the sublimation mug.

, Cut about 1mm inside of the magenta cut-line. don't leave any of the magenta line on the paper of it will print on your mug.

, All mugs are slightly tapered so before we wrap our artwork around the mug we are going to make two cuts right in the middle of the paper so we end up cutting through about 3/4 of the paper. What this will allow us to do is once we have taped the paper to the mug with the image facing the mug the cuts allow us to adjust the center of the paper up or down just a little to allow for the taper. otherwise your text may not run parallel to the bottom of your mug. You will also notice that most of the time you can see through the paper so this will help you to align your images so they are horizontal. So now cut off about 3 pieces of heat tape about 1/2"" 12mm long stick them on the edge of your bench. Carefully wrap the paper around a mug, image facing inward. Now rotate the paper back and forth until you have roughly the same distance between each end and the handle and the same amount of white ceramic showing at the top and bottom of the paper. Once this is done apply 1 piece of tape to the center of each end of the paper. Now check to see if your text is aligned with the base of the mug. If not you can slip the paper up a down a bit where the cuts are until it is. Once you have this right apply the last piece of heat tape half over the bottom cuts and half on the mug to hold the paper in place.

, You can tell if you have enough pressure as the Teflon and silicone rubber backing of the mug press will bow around the top and bottom of the mug a bit.

, (please note this is the setting for TexPrint XP sublimation paper) other sublimation papers may require lower temperatures or longer or shorter heating times.Once the press reaches the set temperature slide you mug into position and clap the mug press shut. If you have one with a count down timer it should start automatically or you may have to press the enter button to start the timer.

, (watch out its HOT!) This part is important as while the mug is still hot the image will still be releasing ink gas and if you do not remove it in a smooth motion you may end up with ghosting (double image), over spray or a slightly blurry image. This can also happen if you cook the mug for too long. you may have to experiment with heat and times to get the right setting for your press.

, If you have done everything correctly then you should end up with something like this.

You can free-hand the pattern, or you can trace it. If you want to trace it, do the following:Trace your phone onto a sheet of paper.
Draw your pattern using a black marker. Make sure the design touches the sides.
Cut out the template along the outline.
Tape the template to the back of your phone.;
, Cut a sheet of parchment paper that's about twice the size of your phone. Place your phone on top, with the screen facing up. Wrap the paper over the side edges of your phone, then secure them with a piece of tape. Wrap the top and bottom edges, and secure them with tape as well.Wrap your phone as tightly as you can.
Make sure that you are taping everything on the front of the phone.

, These will be your guidelines so that you don't accidentally cover them with hot glue.Make sure that the color you use shows up against your phone.

, This also includes the speaker and mic holes as well. If you cover them up, you don't be able to use your phone properly., Make sure that you make them nice and thick. Also, make sure that you avoid the buttons and sockets., Again, hot glue is not the best medium to create a perfectly smooth case, so your best bet is to make a texture of pattern. Whichever you choose, make sure that all the lines connect to the sides of the phone as well as to each other., You can simply draw a thin line around the front of the phone, right next to the side edge. You can also make a series of tiny dots instead. This will give your case a lip and help it stay on your phone., Once the glue has hardened, peel it off of your phone. Remove the parchment paper from the phone next. At this point, it would be a good idea to test the case on the phone. If there is any glue covering a button, socket, etc., then you can cut it away with a craft blade., Once you are happy with the case, take it off of the phone. Paint the outside with nail polish, then let the polish dry.If you want the case to be a solid color, you can use spray paint instead."

Paint the stamped areas with nail polish, if desired.",How to Make a Cell Phone Case2," Cover your counter with plastic wrap, parchment paper, or wax paper. You can also work on top of a marble counter or a glass sheet instead.

Try to work in a well-ventilated area. Silicone can have a strong odor.
The silicone used in this method is not the same as hot glue.

, Pour some cornstarch onto a smooth counter or into a glass bowl, then squeeze some clear silicone onto it. The measurements don't have to be precise; you just want to have more cornstarch than silicone. Plan on using about 5 tablespoons (50 grams) of cornstarch and 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 40 grams) of silicone.Make sure that you are using clear silicone. You can find it in home improvement stores. It comes in a syringe.If you can't find cornstarch, look for cornflour. You can also use potato starch instead.

, You don't have to do this, but it a good way to make your phone case look more interesting. If you don't do this, your phone case will look white. You use a few drops of liquid dye, liquid watercolor, food coloring, or acrylic paint., You will need to knead it about 20 times or so. You won't pick up all of the cornstarch, which is normal. The dough may look crumbly at first--just keep kneading!, You can do this with a rolling pin, a glass, a wine bottle, or even a spray paint can. Keep rolling until you have a sheet a little larger than your phone. It should be about ⅛ inch (0.32 centimeter) thick., Make sure that your screen is facing upwards, and you have equal amounts (or close to it) of dough sticking out over each side., Slide a paint spatula under the dough, then lift it up and fold the dough over the sides of the phone. Smooth out any creases or wrinkles; try to be as neat as possible., Flip your phone over and dust it with cornstarch. Use a stamp to indent designs into it. You can also use cardboard cutouts instead to create your own, unique designs. Lift the stamp away when you are done.If you want to make a quilted design, let the silicone harden for about 10 to 20 minutes, then dust it with cornstarch. Use a knife to make cross-crossing diagonal lines in a diamond/quilted pattern., How long this takes depends on the type of silicone you used and the weather condition. It may take just two hours, or it may take 24 hours. Once it is dry and solid to the touch (you can't dent it), pull it off of your phone.

If the case is dusty inside, wipe it down with a damp cloth.

, Cut it about 7 millimeters away from the side edges, and 1 centimeter away from the top and bottom edges.Alternatively, you can cut along the indentations caused by the seam between the phone's screen and case., If you were to look inside your cell phone case, you'd see little indents caused by the camera, flash, buttons, and sockets. Cut all of these out using a sharp craft blade.You can also carve a rectangle or trapezoid into the top and/or bottom edge for the speaker instead of cutting out a slot., You can apply more raw silicone on top if you want to, then smooth it out with a paint spatula or popsicle stick., Choose a color that goes well with your case. Metallic colors, such as silver, work especially well!You can make more shapes out of silicone separately, let them dry, paint them with nail polish, then glue them to the case with a drop of clear silicone."

If you are making a lined case, with two different colors of felt, choose one color to be on the inside, and the other color to be on the outside., You only need to pin the bottom and two side edges; leave the top edge open. Try to pin the felt as tightly around your phone as you can. The fit will be snug at first, but it will eventually loosen up., Use the pins as a guide as you sew. Your seam allowance will vary, depending on the thickness of your phone. You can do this on a sewing machine or by hand.If you are doing this by hand, consider using embroidery floss in a contrasting color.

Hang the yarn so that it can dry.,
Use the yarn.",How to Dye Speckled Yarn," Acrylic and other synthetic yarns do not take dye very well, if at all. Your yarn need to be 100% wool, such as alpaca or sheep.Other natural fibers, such as cotton, may also work.


White yarn will give you the brightest colors. If you want a softer effect, try gray, cream, or beige instead.;
, You will need 1 gallon (3.7 liters) of room temperature water and 3 tablespoons (45 milliliters) of white vinegar for every 100 grams/cc ounces of yarn. You can prepare the solution in a sink, tub, bucket, or pot., Remove any wrappers from the yarn first, then dunk the yarn in the water. Gently squeeze it until it soaks up the water and sinks. Leave it in the solution for 1 hour., Once the soaking time is out, take the yarn out and gently squeeze it. Do not wring it, however, or it may felt.You want the yarn to still be damp but not dripping-wet.

, There are lots of things you can use to dye your yarn with, including liquid food coloring, gel food coloring, and flavored juice mix (ie: Kool Aid). You can also use professional dyes as well, but you'll need to use special utensils for that to avoid contaminating your cookware. You can use just one color, but two or three will make your yarn look more interesting.

, How you prepare you dye depends on the type of dye you are using. Liquid or gel dyes need to be diluted first. Powdered dyes need to be left in powder form for this method. If you are doing multiple colors, you'll need to pour each dye into its own cup or plate.


Dilute ⅛ teaspoon of gel food coloring in 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of water.Dilute 6 drops of food coloring in ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of water., This project will get messy, so it would be a good idea to protect your surface with plastic wrap or a cheap, plastic tablecloth. You can also spread the yarn out in a casserole dish, baking dish, plastic tub, or tray.Don't unroll or unwind the yarn. You simply want to separate and spread out the fibers so that they are easier to get to.

, The prongs will pick up just the right amount of dye to create speckles. If you are using powdered dye, dip the fork into a cup of water first, then dip it into the dye.Another option for liquid dye is to use a dropper or pipette to apply it. This will create bigger speckles., Keep poking the yarn in various places until the dye starts to fade. When that happens, simply reload the fork with more dye. You can switch to a new color at any time, but you will need to clean your fork first. An even better idea would be to use a separate fork for each color.If you are using powdered dye, such as powdered drink mix, you can sprinkle it directly onto the yarn in small patches., Use your hands or a clean fork to gently shift the yarn around and reveal more blank patches. Dip your fork into more dye and poke the yarn some more.If you are using a dropper, simply drop more dye onto the yarn.
If you are sprinkling powder dye on, then sprinkle more on.

, There are multiple ways to set dye into your yarn and make it permanent. It all depends on what you have access too and how much time you have. You must set the dye, or it will come out when you wash the yarn.


You only need to use one of the heat setting methods from below.

, Preheat your oven to 350F (177°C) first. Once it reaches the right temperature, place your yarn onto a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Tuck the baking sheet into the oven, and wait 45 minutes. Once the baking time is up, take the yarn out., Fill a large pot with a few inches of water. Bring the water to a boil, then set a steamer basket over it. Place your yarn into the basket and let it steam for 30 minutes. Take the yarn out at the end, and let it cool.Make sure that the yarn does not touch the water.
Add some salt to the water. This will help set the dye further.

, Place the yarn into a microwave-safe baking dish and cover it with plastic wrap. Microwave it for 2 minutes. Wait 2 minutes, then microwave it for 2 minutes more. Take the yarn out of the microwave when you are done., All of the setting methods involve heat. Once you have finished setting the dye, you will need take the yarn out, and let it cool. Set it down some place where it won't be disturbed for a while. Wait until it becomes cool enough to handle. How long this takes depends on what heat setting method you used and how much yarn you dyed.

, This will get rid of any excess dye that did not get set into your yarn. Do not scrub, twist, or wring the yarn while you rinse it, or it will felt. Instead, hold it under running water, gently moving the fibers around, until the water runs clear.An alternate method would be to soak the yarn in several changes of water until the water turns clear.
You can use a little bit of soap if you need to, but be careful., You can hang the yarn from a clothesline using clothespins, or you can drop it across a drying rack. Make sure that there is good circulation all around the yarn. It might also be a good idea to set a tray under the yarn to catch any dripping water.


Don't let the water pool under the yarn.

, Once the yarn has dried, you can use it just like any other wool yarn. Depending on the weight and type of yarn you used, you can make all sorts of things from it, including hats, scarves, fingerless gloves, and sweaters.

Decide what parts of your laptop you want to decorate.,
Turn off your laptop, then wipe it down.,
Decorate your keyboard using washi tape.,
Decorate your laptop using a skin.,
Use individual decals and stickers to customize your laptop.",How to Decorate Your Laptop1," You have a lot of options when it comes to using decals to decorate your laptop. You can decorate the top, the keyboard, or even the touch pad.


When sticking anything directly onto your laptop (not the laptop’s protective cover), make sure you are careful to choose decals, skins, and stickers that are meant for that purpose. Stickers meant for this purpose are often made from vinyl.;
, In order for decals, tape, skins, and stickers to apply smoothly, all of the surfaces on your laptop should be clean. Use water and avoid using surface cleaners.


Use a damp, not soaking, towel to wipe down the surfaces to which you will be applying any kind of decoration.
Wash your hands to help ensure the laptop stays clean after wiping it down.
Use a dry towel after the wipe down to ensure the laptop is completely dry and ready for applying decals. , Using washi tape is a popular way to customize your keyboard. Washi tape is a type of decorative masking tape that is safe to apply to your keyboard. It comes in dozens of patterns that you can mix and match. You can buy washi tape at many craft stores. It is also available online from many vendors.
Cut strips of tape the size of individual keys, and stick them to the keyboard. You may want to gently write the corresponding letter on the tape. Sometimes washi tape is quite thin. In that case, you might be able to see the lettering through the tape anyway.

, Skins cover the entire back (behind the screen) of the laptop with an elaborate image. Skins are great when you want a single, dramatic image.


Many websites sell pre-made laptop skins or even allow you to upload your own images to be made into skins.
You can also make your own laptop skin by buying sticker paper and printing the image you want onto the sticker paper using your computer’s printer.
Apply the skin by by slowly peeling one edge of the skin back and sticking it to one edge of the laptop. Then, slowly peel the back of the skin away a little at a time while smoothing the skin down with a straight edge (a credit card will do the trick). , Individual stickers can be used on your laptop to provide personalization and customization. Decals can be purchased from a variety of online stores.


Decals are often vinyl. Vinyl decals are easier to remove than ordinary stickers.
Remember that stickers that look upside down when the laptop is closed and facing you will look upright to everyone else when the laptop is open.
Ordinary stickers may be very difficult to remove, so be sure you want them before you stick them on.

Ask other knitters what they do before buying a yarn.,
Experiment.",How to Find the Perfect Yarn for a Knitting or Crochet Project," Different projects look better with certain colours. A perfect yarn could include a shade of your favorite colour.;
, Although second hand yarn is great, and cheaper it often includes tangles that are really hard to fix; to prevent this look through the yarn and look a little into the inside, just push some yarn over and look into the inner layers.

, Is it a clothing piece? Doilies? What kind of yarn does your project need? Clothing needs to be soft to wear but have strong enough yarn to last. Doilies need a very thin yarn that's lace.

, Natural Fibers are what many people use for their perfect product.

, A good to you is yarn that is made for your project (Ex: sock yarn for socks). This is something to try before you start experimenting.

, Do you want a bulky, and soft scarf? Or a thin and firm scarf for style? Different yarns are used for both scarves. For your bulky, soft scarf you'll need to find a bigger worsted weight size with a soft feel to your hand kind of yarn. A thin and firm scarf? You'll need a thinner worsted weight yarn (or smaller size needle(s)) and a yarn with a firmer feel.

, Will your yarn fail and tear after you worked on your project? To test yarn's strength, see how it reacts when you pull it one hand pulling against the other. Does the yarn almost break? Or does it get a little stronger? This is also a good way to tell if the yarn will stretch your finished project.

, Their advice can help you choose a better yarn which gives a better project!

, Perfect yarns are from a person's point of view, and the more a person handles and uses yarn will get better ideas of their perfect yarns.

Remove the cover from the laptop.,
Prepare your painting area.,
Lightly sand the part of the laptop cover you want to paint.,
Paint your laptop cover using spray paint.",How to Decorate Your Laptop2," Most laptop cases are made of hard plastic. You should remove the cover when painting to avoid painting the laptop itself.


Use painter’s or masking tape to protect any parts of the cover that you don’t want to paint.

, Lay down newspaper on a hard surface. Use this surface for all your work. Make sure that the surface is completely covered to protect it from the paint.


If you do not have any old newspaper lying around, any kind of paper or an old tablecloth will work.
Make sure the area is well ventilated and consider using a mask to prevent inhaling any fumes while spray painting. Inhaling fumes from spray paint can be dangerous.Avoid areas with any open flame or extreme heat. Spray paint is flammable!, This will give you a better surface for painting. It will also reduce the likelihood of the paint flaking off. Don’t sand too hard. Your goal is to create a slightly rough surface that will better hold paint, but not scratch the surface up completely.


Use 100-180 grit sandpaper to prepare plastic for paint. Optionally, coat the case in primer. Primer can help prepare the surface for painting, but is not always necessarily with plastics., Spray paints for plastics are available in a variety of colors at most craft stores. Use the area you have set up previously. Again, be sure that it is well ventilated and away from any open flame.


Spray evenly and avoid building up too much paint in any one area. This will help your paint job from appearing blotchy and uneven.
Apply two to three coats, letting the cover dry in between coats. Using several coats will help ensure complete coverage."

Create your design.,
Gather your materials and prepare a work space.,
Arrange anything that will be stuck on your laptop on the cover.,
Stick everything to the cover.,
Varnish your laptop cover.,
Allow the varnish to dry.",How to Decorate Your Laptop3," Be creative with your design, but keep in mind that you will be traveling with your laptop. Therefore, you do not want it to become too bulky or to include items that will easily fall off and be left behind.


You can use paint, stickers, photos, glitter, sequins, rhinestones, ribbons or fabric to get a laptop cover that is totally unique.
Decide if you want to keep the base color the same.
Use a piece of paper to sketch out your design.

, After you have decided on a design, make sure that you have everything you need.


Some specialized decals and stickers can be purchased directly either in stores or online. You can explore this option too.
Otherwise, most common materials can be purchased at any craft store.
Lay down newspaper or an old tablecloth to work on to ensure you keep your workspace clean.

, This way, you can confirm that you know where everything will go. Move everything around until you are happy with it.


Try several different options before settling on one. After you glue things down it is very difficult, if not impossible, to remove them again without damaging the cover.

, Stickers can simply be stuck onto the cover. However, much of your design will require glue to permanently attach.


Choose a glue that is appropriate for your cover. If you are using a hard plastic cover, use an epoxy. Epoxies work best when gluing to plastic., This will help stop any part of the design from falling off and give a nice finish. Once again, make sure the solvent won't damage the material your cover is made from. If you have painted your laptop cover, use a varnish designed for acrylic paint. Varnish is available in liquid and spray forms.


The most common and easier varnish is polyurethane.
Polyurethane spray can be purchased in craft stores and is much easier than trying to paint the varnish onto a decorated surface.

, After you have finished your layer of varnish, make sure to allow your laptop cover to dry thoroughly before attaching it back to your laptop.


Allowing your varnish to dry will help keep everything attached, and prevent any of the glue from getting on the laptop.

Soak the yarn in a mixture of vinegar and water.,
Brew coffee for dying the yarn.,
Pour the coffee over the yarn.,
Heat the coffee-soaked yarn.,
Rinse the coffee dye from the yarn.,
Dry the coffee-dyed yarn.",How to Dye Yarn with Coffee," To prepare your skein of yarn for dying, you'll need to soak it in what's called a ""mordant"" - a compound that helps the dye to set into the material. The most readily available substance to use as a mordant is regular distilled vinegar.


Place the entire skein of yarn into a bowl. In a separate bowl, mix about 1 part vinegar to 3 parts warm, clean water.






Pour the vinegar mixture over the skein of yarn. Ensure that it is completely submerged, and allow it to soak for about 20 minutes.





;
, Any type of coffee will work well for dying yarn, and you can brew it using your usual method. The coffee can be brewed at regular strength, although a stronger brew can be prepared to achieve a darker color dye.

, Drain the vinegar mixture from the bowl of yarn, but do not rinse the residual liquid away. Immediately pour the coffee over the yarn in the bowl, again submerging it completely.

, To allow the dye to penetrate and set into the yarn, you will need to heat the mixture. The quickest and simplest way to do this is by using a microwave oven.


Place the bowl of coffee-soaked yarn in the microwave. Heat it on the highest setting for about 3 minutes, or long enough to just bring the coffee to a simmer.






After the initial heating, use a set of tongs to flip the yarn over in the bowl to ensure that it will be exposed to the dye evenly. Microwave the yarn for another 2 or 3 minutes, and then let it rest in the coffee until it returns to room temperature.







, After the coffee has cooled to room temperature, pour it out. Place the skein of yarn under a faucet and rinse it thoroughly until the water runs completely clear.

, When the yarn is rinsed completely of its coffee dye, you should hang it to air dry before using it. A convenient way to hang your yarn is to drape it over the faucet that you used to rinse it.

Combine some vinegar and water.,
Place the yarn in the vinegar mixture and let it sit.,
Heat the slow cooker.,
Fill the slow cooker half way with water.,
Mix the coloring into the water.,
Place the yarn in the colored water.,
Add more water to cover the yarn if necessary.,
Cover the slow cooker and cook the yarn for several hours.,
Transfer the yarn to a colander and cool it.,
Run the yarn under lukewarm water.,
Dry the yarn with a towel.,
Allow the yarn to air dry.",How to Dye Yarn in a Slow Cooker," In order to dye yarn in a slow cooker, you must choose the right type. You can only use undyed yarn made from protein-based fibers, such as wool or silk. The process won’t work on plant-based fibers, such as cotton, bamboo, or flax, or synthetic yarns, such as acrylic or nylon.You can use yarn that’s a blend of protein-based and other fibers as long as it’s at least 50 % protein-based. For example, you could use yarn that’s 75% wool and 25% nylon.;
, To prepare the yarn for dyeing, you need to wrap the yarn in large loop that’s approximately 3 to 4 feet (0.91 to 1.2 m) (91 to 122 cm) long so it’s easier to work with. Wind it around the back of a chair to create the loop, and use a piece of synthetic yarn that won’t dye to loosely tie it so it’s secure.If you purchase yarn in a hank, or a big circle, you don’t need to tie it in a loop. A ball or skein of yarn must be tied in a loop, though.
You may want to secure the loop of yarn in one more than one location to ensure that it stays wrapped up while you work with it.

, Find a large bowl that’s big enough to hold the yarn. Pour 8 cups (1.89 l) of warm water into the bowl, and add ⅔ cup (158 ml) of white vinegar. Mix the solution with a wooden spoon to ensure that the water and vinegar are fully combined.The water doesn’t need to be hot. It should be between 95 and 105 degrees Fahrenheit (35 to 41 degrees Celsius).

, Once you’ve mixed the water and vinegar, take the loop of yarn and place it in the mixture. Push it down into the water and hold it under until it is saturated enough to remain under the water on its own. Allow the yarn to soak for at least 30 minutes.Soaking the yarn in the vinegar mixture helps soften the fibers so the yarn will absorb the color more easily.

, To ready the slow cooker for dyeing, plug it in. Turn the heat to high, so it can begin to heat up.For the best results, use a slow cooker that holds at least 6-quarts (5.7 l).
If you are using a non-food coloring to dye your yarn, such as a fabric dye, you shouldn’t use the same slow cooker that you use for preparing food. You may want to buy a second slow cooker just for dyeing yarn at a thrift or discount store.
You can add a liner to the interior of the slow cooker if you’re worried about the dye coloring it.

, After you’ve turned the slow cooker on, pour enough water into it to fill it halfway. Allow the water to heat for 2 to 3 minutes, so it’s slightly warm when you add the coloring.There should be enough water in the slow cooker to cover the yarn completely. Start by filling it half way. If the yarn isn’t covered once you place it in the slow cooker, you can pour in more water.

, When the water has had time to warm slightly, add food coloring in your chosen color to it. The amount of coloring you should add depends on how dark or bright you want the yarn’s color to be. Use a spoon to mix it into the water until it’s fully combined.For the best results, use synthetic food coloring. Vegetable-based food colorings typically don’t work as well.
You can also use powdered food drink mix, such as Kool Aid, to dye the yarn.
Fabric dye also works well to dye yarn, but it will leave you unable to use the slow cooker to make meals again in the future.
It’s best to start with a small amount of coloring or dye. If you aren’t happy with the color of the yarn when it’s finished cooking, you can add more coloring and allow it cook longer.
You can get an idea of how the color will turn out by sprinkling a few drops of the colored water on a piece of white paper towel.
Create a custom shade for your yarn by mixing two or more food coloring colors.

, After you’ve added the coloring to the water, lift the yarn out of the vinegar solution. Set it immediately in the slow cooker, making sure that it’s completely covered by the colored water.There’s no need to wring out the yarn after you take it out of the vinegar solution.

, If the yarn isn’t completely covered with the color solution, add extra water to the slow cooker. That may mean you need to mix in additional coloring or dye as well., When the yarn is completely covered with the colored water, place the lid on the slow cooker. Allow the yarn to cook in the colored solution for 3 to 8 hours, or until the water becomes clear because all of the color has been absorbed.Don’t stir or move the yarn while it’s cooking.
If you allow the yarn to cook in the slow cooker until the water is clear and it still isn’t as dark as you’d like, lift the yarn out of the water and add more coloring or dye. Mix it in to ensure that it’s fully combined, return the yarn to the slow cooker, and allow it to cook until the water is clear again.

, When the yarn is the color that you want, lift it out of the slow cooker. Place it in a colander in the sink, and allow it to cool for at least 15 minutes.When you place the yarn in the colander, press down on it to release the excess liquid in the fibers.

, When the yarn is cool enough to handle, turn on the water in your sink. Rinse the yarn under lukewarm water until the water runs clear., After the yarn is rinsed, place it on a dry towel. Wrap the towel around the yarn and press it to remove the extra moisture.It’s best to use an old towel because some dye may transfer from the yarn to the towel.
You can also place the yarn in your washing machine on the spin cycle or spin it in a salad spinner to remove the excess moisture.

, When the excess moisture is removed from the yarn, unwrap it from the loop and hang in a warm area of your home to dry. It may take as long as a day for the yarn to dry completely.When the yarn is dry, you can roll it back up in a ball or wrap it in another loop.

, Place 1/2 gallon (2 L) water and 1/2 cup (120 mL) soda ash (also known as washing soda or sodium carbonate) into the bucket. Mix the ingredients. Ensure that the soda ash dissolves.

, Soda ash helps the dye to cling to the yarn fibers. Buy soda ash at a yarn supply or crafts store.


Place the hank of yarn into the bucket. Allow the yarn to soak for 5 minutes.
Remove the yarn.
Twist the yarn with slight pressure to remove moisture.
Lay the yarn on a flat sheet of plastic. Ensure that the yarn is spread evenly in a long line.

,, (1 L) of hot water with 3/4 cup (180 mL) urea in a large container. Ensure that the urea dissolves in the water. Urea is a chemical that keeps the yarn wet, ensuring that the dye ""sticks"" to the yarn. Urea is available at yarn supply or crafts stores.


Place 1 tsp. (5 mL) of cold reactive dye into a cup. Cold reactive dye is a dye specially formulated for use with textiles.
Pour just enough water into the cup to make a paste. Mix the dye well.
Add 1 cup (240 mL) of the urea water to the paste.
Use the same procedure for any additional colors you wish to use. Mix each color in a separate cup.

,


Use a foam brush to apply the dye to the yarn. Apply the dye with short sweeping motions. Begin at one end of the yarn and move towards the opposite end. Use a separate foam brush for each color of dye.
Flip the yarn over onto its undyed side when you have reached the end of the line of yarn.
Repeat the application of the dye, moving from one end of the yarn to the other.
Look inside the center portion of the yarn to ensure that all of the yarn has been dyed.
Apply dye to any spots that you missed.

, Place a plastic sheet over the yarn. Allow the yarn to remain covered for 24 hours.

,


Combine 1 tsp. (5 mL) textile detergent in a bucket with enough water to submerge the hank of yarn.
Remove the plastic sheet from the yarn.
Hold the yarn over a sink.
Pour the soapy water over the yarn. Continue to rinse the yarn until the water is clear. Ensure that the yarn remains as free of tangles as possible.
Twist the yarn gently to remove moisture.
Allow the yarn to dry.

Choose your yarn based on gauge.,
Choose your yarn based on weight.,
Choose your yarn based on drape.,
Choose the yarn recommended by your pattern.",How to Choose Knitting Yarn1," Every yarn has a gauge (also known as a “tension”). This number refers to the number of stitches per inch. Every pattern will tell you what gauge of yarn to use for the project; make sure you utilize the correct gauge or your final product will come out looking completely different from your pattern.The gauge does not reflect the size of the completed garment.
To measure your yarn’s gauge yourself, count the number of stitches over 6 inches (15cm), then divide that number by 6. Your answer will determine the gauge of your yarn.
Just because two different yarns share the same gauge does not mean they will function the same within the confines of a pattern. Texture, drape, fiber and other factors also affect on the final outcome of your project.;
, Certain yarn weights perform better with certain projects. Lace or cobweb is best to make doilies. Fingering works best to knit socks. Sport is ideal for making baby clothes or blankets. Worsted is used to make blankets and sweaters, and bulky is perfect for scarves and rugs.When working with different yarn weights, make sure you also use the correct needle size and hook size for that yarn.
When looking at weights, double check that you are also using the recommended brand for your pattern of choice.

, When selecting your pattern, decide how you want your finished piece to hang. Depending on whether you prefer flowing or more structured, select your yarn accordingly.For a very dense drape, select a very thin yarn.
For a more relaxed drape, select a thicker yarn and use large needles to create large stitches.

, Most patterns recommend working with a specific yarn and it's important to take this seriously. Using the wrong yarn can completely alter your pattern, and since different yarns have different elasticities, you may find yourself running out of yarn altogether.To avoid running out of yarn, buy extra. Most yarn stores have a flexible return policy, and if not, you can always use your extra yarn in another project.
If you are going to substitute yarn, make sure you replace your yarn with a yarn of a similar elasticity. Inelastic yarns include silk, linen, hemp, alpaca, tencel, bamboo, cotton and rayon.

"
"
Choose your yarn based on plies.,
Choose based on color.,
Choose based on fiber content.",How to Choose Knitting Yarn2," Yarn is made up of strands, which are twisted together to form plies. Working with plied yarn is especially helpful when you’re working on cable and stitch patterns. If you’re looking to make your stitches stand out, use a smooth, plied yarn in a solid color.The thickness of yarn is determined not by how many plies you have, but how thick the individual plies are. For example, a 4-ply yarn can be thinner than a 1-ply yarn, provided the plies in the 1-ply yarn are finer than in the 4-ply.
If you’re working with a wide yarn, choose a simple pattern.

, Working with colored yarn can be counterintuitive: the more colorful your yarn, the simpler your stitching should be. Bright or novelty colors can distract or hide complicated work, so consider this when you’re picking a colored yarn to work with your pattern.Choose a plain, solid yarn to make the texture and shape of your project pop.
If you’re working with Fair Isle patterns, choose smooth plied yarns in contrasting colors so your patterns will show up.
Consider using hand painted yarn for a subtle watercolor technique.
If you’re a beginner, steer clear of novelty yarns. The yarn is harder to see and it makes fixing mistakes or ripping out stitches much more difficult.

, Certain yarns lack elasticity, which might not work with the pattern you’re hoping to use. Either pick a pattern that hangs straight, or ask a specialty store employee for elastic thread to help edge your pattern.Cotton and silk yarns both have very low elasticity.
Animal fibers are warm and lightweight and ideal for making cold weather accessories.Plant based fibers are strong, durable and moisture wicking, making them ideal for spring and summer clothing.
Cashmere is lightweight and durable, but more expensive. It is ideal for making scarves, shawls and sweaters.

"
"
Use samples to choose a yarn.,
Ask questions.,
Create your own sample swatch.,
Look at the price tag.",How to Choose Knitting Yarn3," If you’re looking to work on a specific project, check with your local craft or knitting store to see if they have samples made up. These samples will give you an idea of what yarn works well with the pattern and will give you an idea of how the final product will look.If your store does not have the full project completed, ask for a sample swatch instead.

, Craft or knitting store employees are extremely experienced in selecting yarns, as long as you know the right questions to ask. Some questions you should consider asking when selecting a yarn are:Will it stretch?
What size needle should I use with this yarn?
Does this yarn pill?
Is this yarn easy to work with?

, If you already have yarn on hand but are unsure if it’s the best choice for a specific project, test it out. Knit a 4”x4” (10cm x 10cm) swatch and see how it looks. To check draping, make your swatch even larger.To really test out your swatch, treat it as you would your actual clothing. Wash it, crumple it and hang it on the wall to see how the yarn reacts.
If the swatch does not perform up to your standards, switch it out and try another option.

, Yarn doesn't have to be expensive, but using higher quality yarn will yield a higher quality project. Don't compare yarns of different materials (silk yarn will always cost more than wool yarn) but compare yarns of the same material. If you're stuck between two wool yarns, choose the more expensive option for a higher quality result.If you know what type of yarn you're looking for, check online. You may be able to score a better deal than you would in your neighborhood yarn store.
Trade yarns with friends. The more yarns you try, the better you'll get at identifying quality yarns that work well for you.

Prepare your base by obtaining a flat wooden board of your choice.,
Measure the board sides to determine nail placement.,
Add nails to the board.,
Tie the string to one corner of the board.,
Stretch string to the opposing end of the board and wind around the nail twice.,
Move onto the next nail and repeat the process until all nails contain wound string.,
Tie off the final piece of string and pull strings into place.,
Finished.

",How to Design Starburst String Art," Size makes no difference but be prepared to use an increased number of nails and thread for a larger size.

Sand the top of the board to remove loose pieces of wood and then smooth over with a soft brush. You’ll want the board to be as smooth as possible, without any jagged edges.



 


Spray paint the board surface. Perform this task in a well ventilated area that has been protected with a drop cloth or newsprint. Consider adding two coats to give a professional, polished appearance.






Allow for ample dry time before continuing with the craft.





;
, You will border the entire board with nails that are evenly spaced between each other. Use a pencil to mark your spaces or simply tap a nail lightly into place to create your guide.

, Tap nails into place without going completely through the board, but enough to securely hold to the surface. You want enough of the nail and head protruding away from the board so you can tie the string and wind it around the nail.

, Make sure you double knot the string so it stays in place.

, Continue the pattern by stretching string to the opposite corner of the board and winding the string about the nail two times.

Look for the opposing corner and stretch the string to the opposing end nail and wind twice.






You will be making an “X” shape each time you wind the string.







, This may take some time, especially if you chose a large board so if you want to take a break, simply wind the string around the last nail several times to hold in place until you return.

, You want a spiral, starburst shape so you may need to adjust strings at this point.

Repeat the process until all of the wool is transferred onto the right carder.,
Repeat the hand carding process to further refine the wool.,
Continue to switch carders.,
Lift the refined carded wool from the carder.",How to Card Wool," You will want to card only clean wool, as any dirt particles could hamper your ability to use the wool carders. Freshly shorn sheep’s wool will also have dirt deep in the fibers, so you will need to be sure you wash it thoroughly.;
, Grab a bucket or clean out a sink to use as a washing basin. The basin should be large enough to comfortably contain the amount of wool you would like to clean. The temperature should be at approximately 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 Celsius). Water that is too hot will strip the wool of natural oils.

, To protect the woolen fibers, avoid soap or detergents that contain bleach or similar whitening additives. Stir the detergent into the water until the water is soapy.For best results, use a soap or detergent with a pH between 7 and 9.
Most mild dish soaps are neutral (a pH of 7) and should be safe to use for cleaning wool.Mild dish soaps can be purchased at any drug or grocery store near you.

, Let the wool soak for about ten minutes in the basin of warm water. This should loosen the dirt particles, making it easier for the dirt to separate from the wool or for you to remove it with some light scrubbing. Rub the wool with your hands to wash it thoroughly.Repeat the process as necessary. You may need to soak the wool 2-3 times before it is completely clean.

, Remove the wool and pull the stopper to allow your sink to drain or dump the water out of your bucket. Rinse out any remaining dirt in your sink or bucket.

, You will know it has been thoroughly rinsed when you notice that the bubbles from the detergent are gone. You may need to rinse the wool three or more times., This will absorb the excess water in the wool, allowing it to dry a bit faster. Wrap it in the towel and gently squeeze to pull out as much excess moisture as possible., You can do this by clearing a space on a desk or countertop and laying the wool on another clean and dry towel. You could also lay it flat on a drying rack. Allow the wool to dry overnight. Do not attempt to card the wool until it is completely dry.

, Carders are wooden paddles covered in pin board and they often closely resemble cat or dog hair brushes. Be sure to avoid purchasing carders made for cotton and purchase ones specifically made for wool.Wool carders come in small and large sizes. Larger sizes can be harder to manage if you have little upper body strength.
Some wool carders have teeth that are very close together. They are harder to drag apart but align the wool into finer wool.
Hand carders have different types of teeth as well, which are used for different purposes. Carders with coarse teeth are used for carding coarse fibers, such as wool and mohair. Hand carders with fine teeth are generally used for carding softer fibers like cotton and angora.

, The wool should be touching the side of the carder with the pin board. You will want to cover it the surface of the carder until almost all the teeth are covered but not so there is an excess of wool hanging off the side of the carder. Do not cover other carder with wool.

, Place the full carder on the on your left knee with the wool facing up. Hold the handle of this carder with your left hand. Switch hands and knee if your left hand is your dominant hand.

, The carder should be oriented so that the pin paper is facing down and toward the wool on the other carder.

, Begin at the top end of the full carder (opposite the handle). Work your way gently from the top to the bottom in full strokes moving in one direction. There is no need to press very hard. The pin paper should grab a few fibers at a time, straightening it onto the second carder., If you see any knots, continue brushing until they are removed and transferred onto the surface of the other carder. This could take up to five minutes to complete, depending on how fast or slow you prefer to go.

, Transfer the now-full carder to the left knee. Take the empty carder into your right hand. Gently brush the empty carder over top the full one, as you did previously.

, You will continue to switch your carders until no dirt appears and the wool is very uniform. Look closely at the brushed fibers. If they are falling in parallel lines, then it is ready.

, Start at the top of the carder and slowly move to the handle, lifting the wool the whole way. You can use the other carder to help lift the top of the fibers up and back. As you lift, you can gently and loosely roll the wool until it resembles a burrito. Once the fiber is rolled, it is referred to as a rolag."

",How to Take Head Measurements for Making Hats," Start with tape line at center of your forehead on hairline. Run the tape line around head, under the bulge at back of your head and back to front to meet the tape line again. This measurement is your correct head-size.








Average head size measurements range from 21"" (53cm) to 23"" (58cm) in half sizes.

, Decide where you will wear your hat, either sitting further back or forward on your head. Mark this point and start the tape line on the mark. Run the tape line over the top of your head and just over the bulge on the back of your head.








This is the back to front measurement and usually measures 9 1/2"" (24cm) to 10 1/2"" (26.5cm).

, Start the tape line where the edge of your hat will sit to the same point on the opposite side of your head near your ear.









This is the side to side measurement and usually measures 10"" (25.5cm) to 10 1/2"" (26.5cm).

",How to Put a Tassel on a Cap," Graduation caps have tassels that often come in a separate plastic bag from the gown and are not already on the mortarboard, which is the official name for the flat graduation cap.Shake the tassel in order to untangle any of its strands before you try to fasten it to the cap. This will make the process easier.
The mortarboard earned its name because it was said to resemble tools used by masons to hold mortar. These graduation caps, including tassels, were first worn by artists and students in the 14th century and being able to wear one indicated intelligence and power.;
, You can figure out the front of the cap by looking on the cap’s inside. There will be writing that says “front of cap.”


Graduation caps usually have a square, flat top. They sit on the top of a skull cap that should be form-fitting around your head. The tassel goes on top of the cap.
Make sure you wear the cap correctly also. Mortarboard graduation caps should be worn so the cap’s front tip is centered on your forehead, right between your eyes. The hat shouldn’t be tilted off your head. Put it directly on your head’s top., Most tassels have two strings that form into a loop at the end to affix them to the button on the top of the graduation cap.Place the center of the loop end of the tassel over the button at the top of the cap with the tassel toward the front of the cap. To do so, you must bend the loop in half and start passing the tassel side of the loop through the loop end.
This will create a hole which the button can be placed through and when the tassel is then pulled tight, it will be securely held on the cap's button by friction and gravity. Gently tug both sides of the loop under the button edge to lock it into place. Criss cross your loop under the button, and pull until you hear it snap.

, This is probably not necessary, but some people want a little more security around their tassel.


You could use a drop of glue on the end of the tassel before fastening it to the button. You could also use adhesive tape for the same purpose.
Basically, you are sliding the loop at the top of the tassel onto the button at the center of the top of your mortarboard. Tug gently on the tassel to make sure it's firmly seated under the button. The glue or adhesive is just extra support.

, Once, you are declared a graduate, flip it to the left side. Flipping the tassel is called “turning the tassel.”


If you want to keep the tassel as a treasure before you toss your cap, you can quickly remove it and tuck it in your pocket for safe keeping and pictures later.
Don’t flip your tassel until you actually are handed your diploma on the commencement stage. Although the mortarboard is very old, turning the tassel is a tradition that only dates back about 40 years.

, The rules are different if you’re not an undergraduate or high school student.


If you are getting a graduate degree (like a master’s degree or PHD), you will want to wear your tassel on the left side throughout the graduation ceremonies.
Fastening the tassel works the same way no matter what the degree level, though.

, You will need a button on the top of the hat so that you have something to loop the tassel around.


Fasten the tassel as you would do to a graduation hat, by looping the tassel around the hat’s button and securing it by criss crossing it around the button.
You could fasten the tassel to the button by using a slipknot. To make a slipknot, hold the yarn with two hands. Create a loop by bring the yarn in your right hand under the yarn in the left hand, so the bottom of the yarn crosses. Secure the yarn at the crossing point. Reach through the loop, and grab the yarn on the left side. Pull the right hand back through with the yarn. Grab the two hanging ends and the loop, and pull them in opposite directions.

, Sometimes people want to put a yarn tassel on a crocheted hat (or other piece of knitted work like a shawl).


Make the tassel separately, rather than crocheting it directly into the hat. You will want to attach the tassel to the hat after you finish the hat.
Cut a piece of cardboard that is the width of the tassel length you want. You may need a different size of cardboard if you are working off a pattern. In such a case, follow the directions.

, Take yarn, and wrap it around the cardboard. The more you wrap it, the fuller the ultimate tassel will become. You could also wind the yarn around something else, like a videogame or CD jacket. Wind it around loosely. Now, take a separate piece of yarn, and use it to tie the yarn bundle together at one end. You want this piece to be at least 6 inches long because you will also need it to tie the tassel to the hat.
Slide the yarn carefully off the cardboard. You want a loop at the end of the yarn. Take another piece of yarn, and tie it around the bundle of yarn below the already tied end. Knot it.

, You want to cut the loops off on the opposite end of the bundle that is tied, and trim the ends to make sure they are even.Now attach the tassel to the hat. You could use a crewel needle to stitch the tassel to the hat.
Weave the end of the yard into the hat’s stitches. Thread one end end into the needle, and stitch the tassel and hat together. ,"

Identify which type of sewing you are undertaking.,
Learn the main types of sewing thread.,
Consider the qualities of sewing thread.,
Select sewing thread according to the right color.,
Consult the sewing instructions.,
Purchase quality thread.",How to Choose Sewing Thread," Some types of sewing are more complex in the requirements for threads because they require decorative as well as practical sewing techniques. Other types are very straightforward, such as simple sewing, which is best performed with commonplace, simple cotton or rayon threads. The general types of sewing include:



Darning to repair rips, tears, and holes in garments and fabric items
Sewing up a pattern such as a dress, apron, etc.

Embroidery: this covers a very wide range of possible sewing techniques including needlepoint, cross-stitch, hardanger, blackwork, stumpwork, whitework, shadow work, crewel work, ribbon embroidery, etc. The threads for embroidery may be many and varied, even within a single project.;
, They are:


Cotton threads
Nylon/rayon threads (including invisible thread)
Silk threads (and silk ribbons)
Wool threads
Metallic threads
Bobbin threads (for machine sewing)
Designer threads (mixed threads made by combining different types of threads, e.g., cottons with rayon with silk, etc.)

, Knowing the properties of the threads will help you to decide the usefulness and desirability of using them for your specific project. The following list with explanations will help you choose a thread that is suitable for your project:



Cotton thread: The usual cotton thread found on reels in most haberdashery and craft stores is ideal for basic sewing. Most cotton threads are mercerized, a coating that lets the dye take more easily and results in a lustrous appearance. This cotton has limitations, however, as it has no ""give"" and can break if used on fluid fabrics, such as stretch knit fabric. On the plus side, cotton is ideal for delicate fabrics and projects, such as lingerie and sheer fabrics.

All-purpose cotton - a medium thickness cotton (size 50) is suitable for sewing a wide range of projects using lightweight to medium cotton, linen and rayon fabrics.
Stranded cotton - this is made of six strands that have been woven together loosely. These are usually used in embroidery and are often best unwound prior to use or the end result will be too thick, although with wider weave fabrics, using all strands can sometimes be very effective.
Coton perlé - this thread cannot be divided and is used in embroidery projects to produce a neat sheen.
Cotton à broder - an embroidery cotton in varying weights. It has a smooth quality.
Tatting thread - not a separate thread as such, but the type of cotton required for tatting is very specialized. It should be highly mercerized and tightly twisted, so that it is very firm and smooth.
Flower thread - this has a matte sheen and is soft. This thread is ideal for embroidery projects that require a rustic, old-fashioned look, particularly samplers on fine linen. It is only suitable for fabric with a small count.
Quilting thread - this is all-cotton thread that is coated for ease of movement through quilt fabric and batting. Obviously, this is ideal for quilting projects.



Polyester threads: These are strong threads that have excellent give for sewing projects. They tend to come in an all-purpose weight (size 50); they often have a wax or silicone finish that allows the thread to slip through fabric with little friction. This is suitable for most machine and hand sewing projects. This thread is suitable for fabrics with stretch in them and is especially good for woven synthetics, knits and stretch fabrics. The appearance of this thread will be waxy or shiny, not matte like plain cotton.

All-purpose thread - this is cotton-wrapped polyester thread and is widely available for sewing. This is suitable for using with most fabrics and is cheap and easily obtainable. It is not, however, a good thread to use for embroidery projects.
Invisible thread - this is similar to fishing line. It's strong and it's invisible, making it ideal for projects where you need the sewing to be strongly kept in place and hidden at the same time.



Heavy duty: Heavy duty thread is ideal for heavy duty fabrics, such as those used in soft furnishings like upholstery and window dressings, vinyl, and coat fabrics. This is usually around size 40 and can be made from polyester, cotton-wrapped polyester, or cotton.

Rayon threads: Rayon embroidery thread works well to create flat stitches where cotton embroidery thread might stand too high.

Nylon threads: This is a strong thread that is suitable for using on light to medium weight synthetic fabrics. It is a fine thread, usually in size A.

Silk threads: Silk is a fine thread that is ideal for a range of fabrics, although silk is often reserved for embroidery work, same for silk ribbon. This strong thread is ideal for sewing on silk and wool, and for for basting all fabrics. The benefit is that silk threads do not leave holes and it is very flexible. An excellent tailoring thread.

Silk floss - this thread has a high sheen. It is also known as Japanese silk. It comes untwisted and can be used as it is, or divided to make even finer stitches. This thread is suitable for embroidery projects and for using on silk fabric projects. Although strong, it is delicate to work with, so it is vital to have trimmed fingernails to avoid catching and tearing.
Twisted silk - this thread consists of several strands of silk twisted together; again it is ideal for embroidery and can be used as it is, or separated into smaller threads.
Stranded silk - these threads have a sparkling look and can be separated into strands for sewing in embroidery projects.
Silk ribbon - silk ribbon is used for silk ribbon embroidery, both as projects in their own right, and for decorative projects such as on handbags, tops, skirts, etc. and for hair accessories.



Wool threads: Wool threads tend to be used for embroidery projects and for blankets (using blanket stitch). Wool works best with heavy fabrics, such as wool, or canvas.

Persian wool - Persian wool consists of three strands. You can use the three strands together or separate the threads to use singly. Whether or not you separate the threads will depend on the project and the thickness of the fabric being sewn.
Tapestry wool - this wool is not as thick as the Persian wool. It is not dividable.
Crewel wool - this is the finest of the wool threads. It is ideal for crewel embroidery projects. While it is fine, you can weave it into a thicker thread by twisting with more threads.



Machine threads: These are the threads inserted into a sewing machine.

Bobbin threads - this is an affordable thread that goes on the bobbin; it is commonplace for use on sewing machines and is used for a wide variety of general sewing projects made on the sewing machine.
Variegated thread - these threads are dyed different shades, the variegation repeating along the length of the thread in an even manner. Suitable generally for embroidery projects or colorful sewing projects, such as crazy quilt jackets, etc.



Metallic threads: Metallic threads are used for goldwork embroidery and for embellishment on items such as handbags. The colors are gold, silver, and copper.

Purl thread - this thread is hollow. Also twist thread and pearl purl
Japan thread - this is a very fine metallic thread that usually requires two threads used at the same time.



, Once you have decided which type and strength of thread is suitable for your project, you will need to match its color. This is where it is a really good idea to purchase the entire quantity of thread in the color you are using to ensure that you keep the same batch color quality throughout the sewing project, especially in the case of embroidery. If you cannot find an exact color match, select a color of thread one to two shades darker than the fabric color to blend in. Light thread will stand out much more.

, It is important to read the instructions of any sewing pattern or embroidery project from beginning to end prior to undertaking a project. The pattern or instructions should tell you what thread it recommends. It is a good idea to try to match the recommendation exactly, or as closely as possible, to ensure the best outcome for the project. When you are more experienced, you will be able to make thread substitutes with the full understanding of the end results.

, Cheap thread is cheap thread and will not last. Quality thread costs more but is definitely worth it to ensure the quality and durability of your project in the long-run, as well as making the stitching process easier and more enjoyable, especially in the case of embroidering.

Cut a large square of fabric.,
Hem around the perimeter.,
Wrap the turban around your head.",How to Make a Turban1," Measure out a square that is 37 by 37 inches (93.98 by 93.98 cm) large. Mark these measurements out using chalk or fabric pencil and carefully cut along the marks.


Make sure that the edge is straight before you measure and cut your fabric.
Choose a double-sided fabric for best results since both sides of the fabric may end up showing after you wrap the turban.
Pick out a fabric that is soft enough to feel comfortable but crisp enough to hold itself together after being wrapped. It needs to have decent traction, as well, so that it does not slip down off your head. Cotton works well, as does velveteen and fleece. Satin, silk, and other smooth materials should be avoided.;
, Turn 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of fabric under along all four sides of the square. Pin in place, then sew each hem to prevent the material from coming up.


A hem is important since it prevents the fabric from fraying. You might be able to skip the hem, however, if you use a no-fray fabric (like fleece) or if you cut the edges using pinking shears. Alternatively, you might also be able to use no-fray spray on the edges to minimize fraying without sewing a hem.
Sew the hem using a straight stitch on a sewing machine. If sewing by hand, use a back stitch.

, Fold the square turban in half and wrap it around all sides of your head, including the top. This step completes your project.


Fold the turban along its diagonal so that it forms a double-layer triangle.
Position the triangle at the back of your head. The upper edge should line up with the top of your head and the bottom point should be centered at the nape of your neck.
Lift the top center corner over your head and down over your forehead.
Bring the two end corners around to the front. Tie them together in a tight knot.
Take the center corner at your forehead and tuck it over the front tie you just created with the end corners.
Tuck each end of the tie into the sides of the turban. Tuck in any other excess material hanging out, as well.
This completes the wrapping process

Have fun with it all.",How to Yarn Bomb," Yarn bombing is one of the newest trends in street art. A yarn bombing artist chooses a plain structure and uses it as a canvas to display a beautiful work of yarn-based art.


Most yarn bombs are created through knitting and crocheting, but technically, any form of street art that uses yarn can be considered a yarn bomb. This includes pieces made with latch hook, cross stitch, or simple wrapping techniques.
The phenomenon started in the Netherlands in 2004. Since then, it has spread across the world, but has mostly been limited to big cities.;
, If yarn bombing is big in your city, you can get inspiration from the work of local artists. If you don't see much yarn bombing where you live, though, you can still get ideas by looking for yarn bombing photographs online.Some of the most popular large objects include trees, signs, statues, fences and benches. For something on a smaller scale, you could yarn bomb stones or pine cones.

, Keep an eye out for simple, plain objects that might benefit from a bit of yarn bombing artwork. You can start in your own backyard, or you can venture out into your neighborhood.


Look close to home. Notice the objects you pass on the street during your daily routine and pick from among those. Yarn bombing close to home will make it easier to plan the project and to keep an eye on the finished work after installing it.
Choose something manageable. If you're just starting out, you probably should avoid yarn bombs on statues with intricate parts or any other major endeavor. Start with something simple. If you have success with that, you can gradually work your way up to more challenging projects.
For larger yarn bombs, frequently a knitting or other fiber arts circle will plan a larger yarn bomb as a project, with each person either creating a certain number of pre-sized squares to be assembled quilt-style on the object being bombed, or with each person being responsible for one part of the bomb, i.e. an arm for a sweater for a statue, or one sign post covering for a group of signs. In this way, the amount of work doesn’t become overwhelming for one person and can be a fun project to share with your knitting or fiber arts compadres!
Make sure that you will be able to secure the yarn around the object well enough to prevent it from falling down, though. On a tree, horizontal branches can prevent the work from slipping down the trunk of the tree. On a street sign, however, you would need to figure out a way to attach extra strings through holes in the post or around the sign to prevent the yarn bomb from slipping down the pole.

, If you plan to yarn bomb something on your own property, you won't need any permission to do so. For objects on others' private property or on public property, however, you'll need to get permission to create your piece from the appropriate sources.The element of surprise can make the experience more fun, but you should make sure that anyone who needs to know about it knows about it beforehand.

Ask your neighbor before yarn bombing his tree.
Get permission from the property owner or your boss before yarn bombing the parking signs in your company parking lot.
Ask the local art council or city council before yarn bombing a bench in a local park or a city parking meter.



, Yarn bombing is not meant to be a permanent form of artwork. When you plan the creation of your work, you'll also need to plan on taking it down.


Even the best yarn bombs have a limited life span. Rain, wind, and dirt can quickly strike the object, causing it to become grungy and frayed within a few short weeks.
To maximize the beauty of the work and avoid complaints, it is best to plan on removing the yarn bomb before this happens or before the destruction gets too bad.

, You will need precise measurements to create a snug piece.


For large objects, you need to measure the width, height, and depth of the object. If the object is round, you will need to measure the circumference instead of the depth.
Measure each part of the object that will be included in the yarn bomb. For instance, if you are yarn bombing a tree, measure the trunk and all of the branches you plan to use, as well as the spaces in between branches. You will also need to measure parts along the same trunk or branch where the circumference varies.
Make sure that you are using a fabric measuring tape as you take your measurements. This type of measuring tape gives you greater flexibility when you measure oddly shaped objects.

, Sketch out the object on a sheet of paper and mark down the appropriate dimensions in the appropriate places. You can use this diagram to help you plan out how many pieces you'll need for the final work and how those pieces will fit together.


Some people find it easiest to collect the measurements before making the diagram, while others may find it easier to make the diagram first and mark the measurements down later. Work in whichever order makes sense to you.
It might help to make several copies of your diagram. Doing so will allow you to sketch different design ideas without ruining or obscuring your measurements.

, As noted elsewhere in this article, knit and crochet pieces are the most common, but you can actually use any technique that allows you to work with yarn. Simply choose whichever technique appeals to you most.


If you are yarn bombing a three-dimensional object, like a tree, street sign, stone, or statue, it will be easiest to crochet or knit the piece.
If you are yarn bombing something with a wire grid, like a fence or park bench, cross stitch and latch hook techniques will work best.

, Once you have the technical stuff figured out, you will need to figure out the aesthetic, artistic aspect of your yarn bomb. Think about the colors and patterns you want to include.


You could technically yarn bomb something in a single color, but many of the most notable yarn bombs arrange multiple colors in a simple or complex pattern. When using multiple colors, make sure that the colors will look good together. You should also consider whether or not the colors will look good in their final surroundings.
Ask yourself why you are creating the yarn bomb. If you have a message or a theme in mind, you should build the design around that theme.
Determine whether the piece will be one large work or several patchwork pieces stitched together. If it will be the latter, plan out the color of each patchwork piece and sketch out how the pieces should fit together. Do a few calculations to determine the dimensions of all pieces before making any of them.

, After you plan out the design and dimensions of your yarn bomb, you will need to actually create the pieces. Each piece will be created separately and away from the actual object you plan to yarn bomb.


When you create a knit or crochet piece, you will actually be making two-dimensional pieces that will wrap around the three-dimensional object to create a final three-dimensional effect.
If you are yarn bombing with latch hook, cross stitch, or wrapping, you will not create the piece prior to installation. For these methods, you will create the piece as you install it.
Measure each piece after you create it to verify that it matches the dimensions you measured and calculated earlier.
If you are creating a large patchwork piece, you might be able to stitch the pieces together before installing it as long as those pieces form a single two-dimensional work of yarn.

, In some instances, it might be best to install the yarn bomb during daylight hours. Other times, you might find it more beneficial to install it at night, when few others are around to interfere.


Yarn bombing during the day will likely make it impossible to remain anonymous, but if secrecy is not important to you, the daylight will make it much easier to see.
If you want to remain anonymous, you will need to pick a time of day when very few people are likely to be around. Usually, this means installing the yarn bomb at night.

, Aside from your yarn artwork and installation tools, you may also need to bring a few helpers with you.


You will need to bring a yarn needle, matching yarn, and scissors to actually install a crocheted or knitted piece. If you are latch hooking or cross stitching, bring the tools you would usually use to create a piece of this nature.
Take your diagram, as well, so that you can check your work against it as you move through the installation.
You should also bring along a ladder if you need to reach tall places and a flashlight if you are working at night.
Even if you think you can install the yarn bomb on your own, it is a wise idea to bring at least one friend with you if you are doing the work in the evening or at night.

, Use your diagram as a guide as you wrap each piece of yarn artwork around the appropriate part of the object. Hold each piece in place with safety pins until all of the pieces are in their correct position.


If you are cross stitching, latch hooking, or wrapping, you won't have any previously created pieces to wrap around the work. Instead, you will need to use the object itself as your canvas and create the entire work on scene.

, Use additional yarn and a large yarn needle to stitch all the seams together, holding the yarn bomb in place more securely. Once everything is in place, you can remove the safety pins previously responsible for holding the pieces together.


Use a simple stitch to make the process as easy and quick as possible. For instance, a whip stitch is usually a good choice.

, It is crucial that you do not cause any damage to anyone's property while installing your yarn bomb.


Aside from man-made property, like benches and signs, you should also avoid damaging the plants and animals living in the area., Take pictures of the process and of the final result. If you install the yarn bomb while it is still light outside, you should snap a photo as soon as the installation is complete.


After you install the piece, you should take pictures as soon as possible before any damage comes to it.
If you want to remain anonymous, do not declare that you are the one responsible for the yarn bomb on any public forum, including social media accounts with strict privacy settings. If you absolutely must take credit for the work, wait until after you've taken it down before announcing your role.

, Return to your yarn bomb a few hours or days later to check on it. Viewing your yarn bomb anonymously can also help you learn about the honest reactions of people on the street who are viewing the artwork for the first time.

, While anonymous feedback is great, you should also ask for feedback on your yarn bomb from people who know that you were the one to create it.


It's best to start with people who already knew about the intended yarn bomb or those who you believe can keep the yarn bomb a secret.
After you've removed the yarn bomb or have otherwise indulged in a satisfactory amount of anonymity, you can begin asking strangers and acquaintances for their opinions. Get opinions from the artistically inclined as well as the everyday passerby.

, As noted earlier, a yarn bomb is not meant to be a permanent structure. It is best to remove your yarn bomb before it starts to deteriorate too dramatically.


Know that someone else may remove your yarn bomb before you have the opportunity to do so. People who find the yarn bomb an annoyance may cut it down prematurely. The city may also choose to remove it if they get complaints or if they believe the yarn has gotten too dirty.

, One major purpose of yarn bombing is to brighten the drab qualities of ordinary, everyday life. If you aren't brightening your own life by creating the piece, a large aspect of the process is missing.

Cut out two large rectangles of fabric.,
Pin the layers together.,
Sew along the perimeter.,
Turn right-side out and stitch the opening.,
Wrap the turban around your head.",How to Make a Turban2," The rectangles should each be 73 inches (185.42 cm) long and 37 inches (93.98 cm) wide.


For this version, you will end up creating two layers of fabric, giving yourself more versatility.
The outside layer has very few restrictions and can be made of nearly any material and with nearly any print.
The inside layer should be made from a material that has good grip or traction so that the turban will not slip or come undone as you wear it. Use something like cotton or chiffon, and avoid smooth fabrics like silk or satin.
Make sure that all four edges are straight before continuing on.

, Lay the two layers of fabric on top of one another with the ""right"" sides together and the ""wrong"" sides facing out. Pin each side in place, positioning the pins directly along all four edges.

, Stitch around all four sides of the turban, leaving a seam allowance of about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) on all sides. Skip a section roughly 12 inches (30.48 cm) long in the middle of one long side of the piece.


This step joins the two layers while also hiding the raw edges of the fabric on the inside of the work.
It is essential that you skip a 12-inch (30.48-cm) length of fabric so that you can turn the turban right-side out later on.
Once the entire perimeter has been sewn up, minus the skipped over section, clip all four corners by snipping off the tips. This prevents the corners from looking or feeling lumpy when you turn the piece right-side out.
Use a simple straight stitch on your sewing machine or a back stitch if sewing the turban by hand.

, Feed the fabric through the opening you left in the side, forcing it the ""right"" sides to the outside of the piece. Top-stitch the opening closed when done.


Before stitching, make sure that the edges of the opening are turned under to hide the raw edge of the material. If you have difficulty keeping the edges turned under, pin them or press them in place with an iron before sewing.
Note that the stitch you make here will likely be visible, so it is important that the stitch is neat and made with coordinating thread.

, This turban will wrap around all sides of your head, including the top, and the ends will be hidden by tucking them into the sides. With the conclusion of this step, your turban is now complete.


Place the center point of the turban on your forehead.
Wrap both ends around the sides of your head and across to the back. Tie it snugly at the nape of your neck.
The cloth should cover the top of your head, extending from the forehead to the back of your head. Carefully arrange the turban on the top of your head so that it covers the top completely, and tuck the ends into the portion of the fabric already tied around your head.
Wrap one side of the turban around your head. Keep it level across your ears as you wrap, or twist it as you wrap for a slightly different look. Make sure that a 12-inch (30.48-cm) section of fabric remains free at the end of this wrap-around.
Repeat the previous step with the other side of the fabric. Wrap it around your head, leaving another 12-inch (30.48-cm) section free.
Tie the two ends together and tuck the excess into the sides.
All the material should be securely wrapped and kept in place, and your turban should be ready to wear.

Cut a long strip of fabric.,
Hem the edges, if necessary.,
Wrap the turban around your head.",How to Make a Turban3," The fabric should be about 55 inches (139.7 cm) long by 9 inches (22.86 cm) wide.


A thick, double-sided fabric works better than a single-sided fabric since both sides of the fabric may end up showing after you tie the turban onto your head.
Choose a fabric with good grip, like cotton. Smooth fabrics like silk tend to slide down and may not stay on your head well.
If you are working with a fabric that could fray but do not want to hem the edges, use pinking shears to cut instead of scissors. The zig-zag edge minimizes the amount of fraying that will occur, but it may not stop the fabric from fraying completely.

, If you use a ""no fray"" fabric like fleece, you do not need to worry about the raw edges of the material. If the edges are prone to fraying, though, you should hem 1/2-inch (1.25 cm) of the edge all the way around the perimeter.


The simplest way to hem the edges is to pin the fabric along the underside of the turban and sew a straight stitch with a sewing machine down all four sides. If sewing by hand, use a back stitch.
Alternatively, you could apply a ""no fray"" spray liquid to the raw edges to prevent fraying without hemming the fabric. These liquid solutions are not as secure as an actual hem, but they will likely work well enough for light to moderate everyday use.

, Wrap the fabric around your head, starting from the back and eventually twisting it into a knot at the front.


Place the center of the fabric at the back of your head. Hold the two ends out in front of you.
Wrap the turban around the sides and front of your head.
At the center front of your head, twist the two sides together once, interlocking them.
For a more secure twist, cross the two sides over each other once more.
Tuck the ends of the fabric into the portion of the turban wrapped around your head. Note that you need to tuck the fabric into the sides and not over the top.
With this, your twisted turban headband is complete. The front, side, and back of your head will be covered, but unlike the traditional turban, the top of your head will be exposed.

Choose a flat surface.,
Get a half sheet of newspaper.,
Find some tape.,
Gather possible accessories.",How to Make a Newspaper Hat1," As you begin folding the newspaper, you will want to make your creases crisp and clean. Making a paper hat on a non-flat surface or in the air will lead to a messier hat.;
, The size will vary based on the print size of the newspaper you are using. Many are around 15x22.

, This is optional as most newspaper hat designs use folds to hold the hat together. If you are in a rush, or just want to make the hat extra sturdy, use tape when necessary.

, When you are done with your hat, you can decorate it any way you want. Paint it. Color it with markers. Put stickers on it. Use feathers to give it added flair. Be as creative as you want.If you are making these hats for a birthday party, you could easily set up a fun arts and crafts station for them. Write each child’s name on their hat in big colorful letters. Let them color their names in and personalize their hat however they want.

Wear your new top hat proudly.",How to Make a Top Hat," Traditional top hat material is no longer manufactured, but there are several modern day alternatives you can choose from. When looking for a material to use, gravitate toward fabrics that are fairly stiff and heavy. Light, floppy material will produce a floppy hat.


Craft felt is one of the most popular options you can use. It is easy to find, affordable, easy to work with, and comes in a range of colors. Polar fleeceand tightly-woven wool are other possible options.
Fosshape,buckram, and plastic canvas can be a little harder to find and a little more expensive, but they also tend to be a little stiffer and may produce a more pleasing result when all is said and done. If you cannot find these materials in the color you want, you can paint or dye them that color.;
, You will need to cut out two round circles of equal proportions. The longest diameter of these circles should be about 15 inches (38 cm).


The brim pieces will be stacked and sewn together to create a double layer. This is done so that the brim has more structure and support. If you only use one piece of material for the brim, it may lack the structure it needs to be convincing.

, The flue is the tall, chimney-like portion of the top hat that creates the signature look of the style. You will need to cut out two rectangular flue pieces of equal proportions. The length should be 6 1/2 inches (16.5 cm) and the width should be 24 inches (61 cm).


Like the brim, the “flue” will also consist of a double layer of fabric for the purpose of providing adequate support. Without this double layer, the top hat is likely to sink or fold over on itself once you place it on your head.
If you would like to create a more playful version of the top hat, you can also cut out separate bands in alternating colors to form the flue. Stitch the bands together lengthwise so that they form a single flue piece with a height of 6 1/2 inches (16.5 cm).

, You only need to cut out one piece of material for the top of the hat. Cut a circle that is 8 inches (20.3 cm) in diameter.


Unlike the brim and the flue, the top piece or “lid” does not need to have much structure, so you only need one piece of fabric for it. If you do not like the look of a single layer, however, you can double this part of the hat up, as well, by adding a second piece of equal dimensions.

, Place the two brim pieces on top of each other, right sides facing in and wrong sides facing out. Pin in place.


When you insert the straight pins, slide them into both layers around the shared edge. You need to use enough pins to prevent the two layers from moving around along the edge, since the edge is where you must sew the brim together to start with.

, Use a fabric pencil or a piece of chalk to sketch out a smaller circle in the center of the larger brim circle. This circle should be about as big around as the size of your head.


This circle will eventually become the opening for your head, which is why it needs to be the same approximate size. Use a tape measure to measure the circumference of your head to verify that the circle in the center of your brim piece matches.
Usually, the inner circle will be about 6 inches (15.24 cm) in diameter.

, Use a sewing machine or a needle and thread to sew around the outside edge of the pieces, leaving a seam allowance of about 1/8 inch (3.176 mm).


Do not sew along the edge of the inner circle yet.
When done, you should have a solid, round disk with a circle marked in the center.
Remove the pins as you sew or after you finish.

, Use sewing scissors or shears to cut alone the outline you marked at the center of the brim. Cut from the inside of the circle, not along the outside.


If you have difficulty keeping the pieces from shifting or moving around at the center, you could remedy the situation by pinning around the outside of the drawn circle before cutting that circle out. Doing so should limit the amount of movement.

, Pull the brim right-side out by turning it through the opening you created by cutting out the center of the brim.


Iron flat, if possible, so that the material is easier to work with.

, Stitch up the open center of the brim using a sewing machine or needle and thread. Leave a seam allowance of 1/4 inch (6.35 mm).


As before, if you find that the fabric around the center opening continues to move around, pin around the opening to restrict this movement.

, Place one flue piece on top of the other, with the wrong sides facing out and the right sides facing in. Pin together.


You need to pin around all four parts of the rectangle. Place the pins as close to the edge as possible to prevent the edges from coming loose as you sew.

, Sew around all four sides of the two stacked pieces to create a double-layer piece to work with.


You should have a seam allowance of about 1/8 inch (3.176 mm).

, Lightly fold the flue in half width wise and pin the edges together. Sew along the joined edge using a sewing machine or needle.


Do not iron or crease the fold. Ultimately, you will want this part of the hat to have a rounded shape, not a flat shape.
The seam allowance will vary depending on how large your head is. The portion of the fabric leading up to the seam should be about half of the diameter of your brim opening, and when unfolded, this portion of the flue should be about the same size as that brim opening.

, Release the fold of the flue and try to shape it with your fingers so that the flue shape, as a whole, forms a rounded shape.


If there is a crease along the side you folded previously and you cannot get it out simply with your fingers, you could try placing the flue over a round vase, lamp, or similar object to stretch it in that circular shape. Remove the crease by applying steam with your iron.

, Place the lid piece wrong-side up on your working surface and set the flue wrong-side out on top. Pin in place.


Pin the pieces together as close to the edge as possible to prevent them from wiggling apart.

, Sew the flue to the lid using a sewing machine or needle. Leave a seam allowance of 1/8 inch (3.175 mm).


Turn the flue and top right-side out once the two pieces have been attached.

, Pull the bottom edge of the flue slightly through the hole you cut in the brim, leaving 1/8 to 1/4 inch (3.175 to 6.35 mm) of fabric beneath the brim. Pin in place.


Pin the overhanging portion of the flue fabric to the underside of the brim, placing the pins as close to the edge as possible.

, Sew the overhanging portion of flue fabric to the underside of the brim using a sewing machine or needle.


The seam allowance should only be about 1/8 inch (3.175 mm).

, Any excess fabric on the inside of the brim or flue should be trimmed away with sewing scissors or shears.


While this is not strictly essential since the excess fabric should be hidden, it might make the hat more comfortable to wear.

, You can leave the top hat plain and wear it as is, or you can add decorative elements to it to personalize it or make it usable for a costume.

If you are using the hat for cosplay or costume purposes, study pictures of the character you are trying to dress as and decorate the hat accordingly.
If you want the top hat to look more “classic,” you could try embellishing it by attaching a black satin ribbon around the base of the flue.
To make the top hat more versatile, add embellishments that are removable.

, Your top hat should now be complete and ready to wear."

Begin by removing the sex organs.
Slice the animal from the tail to the throat.
Peel back the skin with your fingers or a knife.
Split the sternum, spread the rib cage and remove the organs.
Flip the animal over and finish removing the hide.;
, Manufacturers use a mechanical fleshing machine to remove the flesh from the inside of the skin. Running the inside of the skin over the steel roller of the machine will eliminate any excess flesh. If you don't have access to a fleshing machine, you can purchase fleshing tools from a hunting store or taxidermy supply store.


Drape the flesh over a large horizontal beam. Stand at the end of the beam and pin a small section of the hide to the end of the beam using your body weight. If you don't have a beam to use or don't want to construct one, you can simply spread the hide out on a tarp on the ground.Place a large basin or bucket below your work area to catch the excess tissue and fats as they are scraped away.
Scrap away all the subcutaneous materials with your fleshing tools. Remove the veins and membrane.
Rotate the hide and work until the surface is complete. Do not leave the hide if you need to take a break as the material can dry out. After the hide has been fleshed, the end result should be a white, smooth surface.

, Apply a generous layer of salt to the skin, or create a brine and soak the skin.This will act as a preservative to keep the hide from decomposing. Fresh skins need to be salted or frozen within the first few hours, otherwise they may be destroyed.Fold the hide in half so the flesh sides are together. Leave for 24 hours. Scrape away any remaining salt and repeat.To create a brine, add one pound (.45kg) of salt per one gallon (3.8L) of water to create a solution. Let the hide soak for 24 hours.

, Soaking will help remove any dirt or other materials from the skin. Fill a large 35 gallon (132L) or so container with fresh, cool water. Place the hide in the water for at least a day. The longer you let the hide soak, the easier it may make the hair removal process.

, This can be done chemically with a solution of calcium oxide (also known as slaked lime, whitewash, or calcium hydroxide) bath. You can also use the same tools for dehairing that were used for fleshing. Remove all the hair and the epidermis, then hang the skin to dry.

, Add one teaspoon (5mL) of calcium hydroxide per gallon (3.8L) of water to create limewater.This bath is known as bating and will remove any inter-fiber substances and unnecessary proteins. It will also help to soften the skin and loosen any remaining hairs. Remove the skin from the lime bath and rinse it thoroughly until clean.

, This can be a one to four day process, depending on which method you choose.


Perform a vegetable tannage. A vegetable tannage uses tannin extract, which occurs naturally in a variety of different tree barks like oak, chestnut, tanoak or hemlock. The tannin extract is mixed with water and placed in a rotating drum along with the animal skin. The rotation of the drum will evenly distribute the extract over the skin. This process takes about three to four days and produces a leather that is flexible and used for furniture or luggage.
Perform a mineral tannage. Mineral tannage uses a chemical called chromium sulphate. The chromium sulphate has to sufficiently soak into the animal skin to achieve proper tannage. This process takes around 24 hours to complete and produces a leather that is stretchable and used for garments and handbags.
Tan a hide with brains. Brain tanning is a popular home method for tanning hides.They say each animal has enough brains to tan it's own hide. So if you have the brain of the animal use that, or you can buy a brain from your local butcher. Combine with a pint (473mL) of water and blend it until it is smooth. Use a large pot to boil the mixture. Add the boiled brains to a large bucket or drum and add some water to cool it. Keep the water at a four-one ratio to the brain. Add the hide and massage the mixture into the skin thoroughly. Leave at room temperature for up to 24 hours.

, You will need a large container to hold all your hides and the tanning agent. Look for a container around 35-40 gallons (132-150L).

, The tannin which you select will displace the water and replace it will collagens from the chemicals or substances. You will need to let the leather soak from several hours to 6 days depending on which tanning method you select and the size and quantity of the hides.

, Dyes are what can be used to give the leather a color other than the natural look. If you are going to dye all of your leather the same color, you can add the dye during the tanning process, or you can wait until after the tanning process.

, The leather will need a thorough rinse after tanning. This will ensure any chemicals and dyes are removed. Use warm water and some mild soaps that contain natural ingredients., After the skins have gone through the tannage process, they can be considered leather. Hang the leather out to dry. Hang the leather over rods in a cool, semi-moist area. You can use a fan to help speed up the drying process, but leather should dry slowly so be patient.


If the leather is not drying evenly, use some damp rags to remoisten the areas that are drying faster.

, A machine called a staker can soften the leather by stretching it and lubricating it with natural oils. This process ensures the leather stays pliable.


You can also hang the hide up from your ceiling and stretch the hide as much as you can in all different directions. You can use ropes and hooks to keep the hide taut.

, Once a hide is about 80% dry, apply the oil to the surface on the skin side.Coat the entire surface evenly. Repeat several times through the drying process.

, The hide is soft and pliable, but depending on your purpose you may want to smoke the hide to force the tannin into the fibers. Stitch the hide to form a bag and suspend the opening above a small smoky fire for several hours.


Different kinds of wood can even add a natural color to your leather. Aspen or cottonwood can create a golden leather.Try different woods available in your area to see what different colors and looks you can create.

, The leather can be buffed or polished. You might choose to treat the leather with a coat of acrylic or polyurethane to make patent leather. You can also emboss leather to create permanent shapes or designs in the fabric if desired. Finally, cut the leather based on the end user's specifications.

Create holes for adjustment.",How to Make a Custom Guitar Strap," Belts make a good base for a guitar strap. Find an old belt that you don’t use anymore. You will be removing the buckle that makes the belt useful for clothing. You are basically going to strip the belt of any extra parts and leave the belt in its raw state.

Use scissors or a sharp blade to remove the buckle from the belt.
Place the belt around your shoulder as you might hold a guitar. Most belts will need to be cut to better fit a guitar. You can also make adjustments so that the strap can be adjusted.;
, Use a strong string material like paracord for the guitar strap. Don’t use anything too slim or else it may break. If you have extra rope, you can arrange multiple lines for the strap by twisting or gluing them together. Measure the string by draping it over your shoulder and hold your guitar.A good length is one that will allow you to make adjustments.
You might need a friend to help you measure the strap.

, Instead of a belt or string you could also use fabric as the base of your guitar strap. It will be important to layer the fabrics on top of each other to create a durable base. Arrange about three or four layers of fabric on top of each other and then cut out an outline for the strap. Measure out the width of the shoulder the strap will rest on.

A durable fabric like denim may work best.
Trace the dimension onto the layered fabrics before cutting. Attempt to make a clean cut.
Attach the fabrics together by sewing them or by using glue.
Many synthetic fibers like acrylic tend be more durable than natural fibers., Go to a linens shop and search through the raw linens. This is the best way to find a unique fabric design that you can use for your guitar strap. There are plenty of options for the guitar strap’s design. Pick out a fabric design that suits your style and music.

For instance, classic paisley is a design that was popular in the late 1960s.

, Look through your wardrobe or linens closets to see if you have anything that you don't use anymore. This is a great way to truly personalize your strap. If you have a favorite t-shirt or bed sheet that you no longer use, it could be great as a cover for your guitar strap base. This will add an element from your past that could inspire you to play a certain way.

Use something that you'll feel comfortable playing with. Don't choose something that you might be embarrassed by.
Tie die will especially look good if you like this type of look.

, The fabric you selected will act as a cover for the base of your strap. Lay out the base of your strap on a surface and wrap the fabric over the base. Make sure the fabric fits tight around the base. Once your cover is snug and covering the base, cut off any excess fabric from the cover. Sew the cover onto the base using a simple cross stitch. The base of the strap should stay in one place and not move around too much.

It may benefit you to glue your fabric to the base before sewing to ensure everything stays in place.
Don’t forget to sew the fabric at the ends of the strap closed.

, You can add plenty of extra features and designs, based on your style. Some players will choose a minimal strap design, while others like to make their strap burst with personality. You can add studs if you’re into hard rock or metal. You can also be creative and stitch patches or other linens to the strap.Add fray to your strap if you want to have an eccentric cowboy look.
You could even glue glitter onto your strap. This style works well for glam rock.

, The second most important area of the strap is the shoulder section that will be holding the brunt of the weight. This is where comfort comes into play, which is very important if you're going to be standing for an extended period of time.


The wider the strap at this area, the more space the weight will be distributed over, and the less sore your shoulder will be! Padding is a great thing to add to this area as well.
Foam or a similar material can easily be attached to the underside of the strap using glue or needle and thread. You can get fancy and glue Velcro onto the padding and the strap for removable padding.
If you construct your strap with two pieces of material, you can sandwich padding between them.

, You can setup your guitar strap to fit the strap pegs using string. The string you choose needs to be a durable material like paracord. You should also try to use a thin string. Create a hole in the guitar strap using an awl or leather punch. Create a hole just large enough to weave the string through.

Tie the string to the top end of the guitar strap and connect it to the top strap peg on the guitar.
You can alternatively use a knife or scissors but an awl or leather punch will be easier.
Consider a good length for your guitar strap before attaching the string - string can be difficult to adjust later if you change your mind.

, You can buy authentic guitar strap tips that you can attach to your homemade strap. This is a good way to ensure your guitar strap will be secure enough to hold the guitar while playing. You can either find these online or make them yourself. You need a strip of leather to make them from home.

Measure out the width of the strap and outline that width on the leather. Cut out two pieces of leather.
Look at guitar straps for an example of the end’s curvature. The end typically gets narrower towards the hole.

, One end of your custom strap should allow you to easily adjust the looseness of your guitar. The best way to do this for your strap is to create a series of holes to fit the bottom strap peg on your guitar. It is easier to make an adjustment from the bottom. A leather punch will be the easiest way to create even holes.Use a blade to create a series of holes that are about an inch apart.
Don’t make the hole too big for the strap peg. The idea is to make the strap fit onto the guitar snugly.

Glue between each layer if your are stitching more than two pieces of leather., Pull several inches of thread through the eye of the needle. About one inch from the edge of the thread, push the tip of the needle through the center of the thread, puncturing it. Pull this punctured portion of thread up the length of the needle back toward the eye. Pull the short end of the thread over the long piece and past the eye of the needle, creating a knot to lock your thread.Cut the thread at a slant to make it easier to thread it through the eye of the needle.
Once you pull the punctured thread back toward the eye, if you have a large loop between the eye and the punctured thread, pull back on the long portion of the thread to draw the loop back through the eye before pulling the short end past the eye to create the know.
Repeat this process on the other end of the thread with another needle so that you have a needle on either end of the thread to complete saddle stitches.
Attempt to supply enough thread to complete the entire project without having to cut and rethread the needles. This should be at least 3 times the length of your seam and more if your project is particularly thick.

, This will guide your stitching in a straight line. Stitches can run in a line or a groove. If you use a groove, once the stitches pull tight, they will lie beneath the surface of the leather and be more protected from wear and friction.Dig a groove in the leather using a grooving tool. Slide the guide to the distance you would like your groove to be dug from the edge of the leather. Lock the guide in place. Set the guide against the edge of the leather and pull the grooving tool from one end to the other. A small amount of the leather will be scraped off to leave a groove in your project. Repeat this process on the other side.
Using wing dividers, also known as a creaser, set them at the distance you would like the line to be drawn from the edge of the leather. Draw the dividers from one end of the leather to the other with one wing along the edge and the other marking a scratch in the leather to serve as your stitching line.

, There are several tools available to make marking stitches easy and accurate. Try several tactics and choose the tool you are most comfortable using.Over-stitching wheels make dips in the leather to stitch on as well as being used to run over the stitch to press it into the leather once the stitching is complete. These come in different sizes, the number relates to the number of stitches per inch.
Pricking wheels poke holes along the stitching line. Do not use this to run back over the project once the stitching is complete, as the sharp edges will damage the thread. These come in different sizes, the number relates to the number of stitches per inch.
Diamond hole punches create a series of marks which match the shape of the diamond awl you will push through. Some of these hole punches are able to puncture all the way through both sides of the leather to create holes on both sides.

, Determine how far apart you would like the stitches. Longer stitches should be used in larger projects, with the stitch distance scaling down with the size of the project. Mark the stitches using the tool you chose scaled appropriately to your project.


To use an over-stitching wheel, start at the beginning of the stitching line. Place the wheel firmly on the line and using a little pressure, push the wheel along your stitching line to create the bumps where you will puncture holes to stitch through.
Place your pricking wheel at beginning of the stitching line. Press the wheel firmly on the line and using a little pressure, push the wheel along your stitching line to prick the holes you will stitch through. These holes will need to be punctured again with a diamond awl.
Place the points of the diamond hole punch along your stitching line. Hold it firmly in place with one hand, while you use the other hand to hammer onto the top of the iron to puncture holes in the leather to stitch through. If you need more stitching marks than the length of the iron, place the end prong in the last mark to keep the spacing even and continue hammering along your stitching line until you have enough marks to complete your project.

, Using an awl, press it through the marks to make a hole to stitch through. This could require a lot of pressure if you are puncturing through several layers of leather. Make sure each whole goes all the way through each layer.


If you used a diamond hole punch with deep enough tines, it is possible this can puncture all the way through to create the holes while making the marks, making this step unnecessary.

, Place the item between the jaws of the pony with the stitching line just above the jaws. Clamp the jaws tightly enough to hold your project firmly in place while you work on it.If it is a large project which won’t fit in the pony, you will need to use a stitching horse.

, The needle should fit easily through the hole you have created. Push it all the way through every layer of leather and draw it completely out the back side.

, Pull both needles out the the side until the center of the thread is in the first hole. Draw both needles upward and match to points to make sure the thread is centered.

, Push the front needle from front to back through the second hole. Once the majority of the needle is through the hole, place your other needle below it so that you can grab the stitching needle with your thumb and forefinger the pull it the rest of the way through the hole.

, Take the second needle which you had placed on the bottom of the other needle, turn it toward the project and push it back to front through the bottom of the same hole the first needle just came through.When drawing this second needle out of the front, feed some of the original thread already in the hole out in the same direction you are pulling the needle. This will ensure that you do not puncture the thread.
If you do puncture the thread, draw the needle back out of the thread, then back through the bottom of the hole.

, Gently tug outward on both ends of the thread to tighten the stitch before moving on to the next hole. You should have an even amount of thread on both sides. Pull slightly up on the back thread and slightly down on the front thread.

, Always start from the front of the project with the first needle.

, Starting from the front of the project, push the first needle through the second to last stitching hole. This time, once the needle is most of the way through the hole, place the other needle on top of the first and pull it the rest of the way through the hole. Turn this second needle back toward the leather, and this time push it through the top of the hole.


This will be a little more difficult since there is already thread in the whole.
Repeat the back-stitch 2 or 3 times depending on the amount of stress which will be put on the seam in this area.

, Once you have completed 2 or 3 back-stitches, you can release the needle on the back of the project. Push the front needle through the next hole, leaving both threads on the back of the project one hole apart. Pull each thread tight. Using a sharp knife, tilted slightly upward to avoid damaging the stitched thread, cut off the extra thread as close to the leather as possible, leaving only a little nub where the threads came through the hole.


It is not necessary to tie a knot in the thread.
Nylon thread can be melted by adding a little heat from a flame, then press them into place for extra hold.

, Roll back over the thread with your over-stitching wheel or gently tap along the seam with a flat headed hammer like a cobbler’s hammer.

Dry out wet leather right away.,
Pack the leather item in newspaper or packing paper.,
Clean the leather with a vinegar solution.,
Seal the leather in a baking soda solution.,
Let the leather age to reduce the smell over time.",How to Get Bad Smells out of Leather1," If the leather is wet, or appears to be covered in mold or mildew, you need to remove any dampness quickly. The moisture can damage the leather permanently and create a smell that will be very difficult to get out. There are several simple methods for drying out the leather:Place the leather in a spot in your home that gets indirect sun. Direct contact with harsh sunlight can cause the leather to crack, chip and wear out. Choose a spot that is by a window that filters sunlight or that is behind a screen.
Use a blow-dryer on a low heat setting. Avoid bringing the blow-dryer too close to the leather as this can cause it to crack or chip. Run the blow-dryer at a distance over the leather to soak up the moisture and prevent big water stains on the leather.
Use a clean dry cloth to wipe the leather dry, especially if you are trying to treat a pair of leather shoes, a leather jacket, or a leather purse. Skip alcohol based products or odor-masking products, like perfume, and use a clean dry cloth to give the item a good wipe. The chemicals in these products can get into the pores of the leather and possibly damage the item.;
, The porous quality of newspaper and packing paper means they are both great for absorbing any bad smells in your leather item. Always check that the leather item is completely dry and that you are using dry newspapers. The loose fiber in newspaper makes it softer and more absorbent than other options, like office paper.Crumple up several sheets of newspaper in a box and place the leather item in the newspaper. Close the box and leave it sealed for one to two days.
Check the leather item to see if the newspaper has effectively drawn out the bad smell. You may need to leave the item in the newspaper for another day.

, The acid in the vinegar will help to counteract bad odors and the smell of the vinegar, which could be a bad odor to some, will also dissipate with the any other bad smells in the leather.Before you use any acid based cleanser on the leather item, do a spot test to make sure it won’t discolor the leather. Mix equal parts distilled white vinegar and water. Choose a very small area on the item and dab the vinegar solution on the leather. If there is no discoloration or cracking on the leather, proceed with cleaning the item with the vinegar solution.
Use a clean cloth to wipe the surface of the leather with the vinegar solution.
You can also use a spray bottle to spray the leather with the vinegar solution and then wipe it clean with a cloth.
If the odor is really bad, you can try soaking the leather item in the vinegar solution for five to ten minutes. Make sure you dry the leather well after the vinegar soak so it does not get moldy or full of mildew., Baking soda is great for absorbing bad odors and it is safe to use on leather. You will need baking soda and a pillowcase or a zip-lock bag that is big enough to fit your leather item.Place the leather item in the pillowcase of the zip-lock bag. Sprinkle a thin layer of baking soda over the surface of the leather. You can also sprinkle the inside of the leather item to remove any odors on the inside of the item.
Tie the end of the pillowcase or seal the zip-lock bag. Let the item sit in the baking soda overnight, or for 24 hours.
Remove the baking soda by using a small vacuum or a clean cloth. Brush the baking soda off gently to avoid scratching the leather.
Repeat the baking soda process until the bad odor is gone.

, Due to the nature of leather, smells that absorb into the leather, from cigarette smoke to the “new smell” of the tanning process, will gradually lessen over time. Instead of trying to mask the smell with perfume or odor-masking agents, which will actually prolong the time it takes for the odor to pass, use your leather item often. If you can stand the bad odor, wear your leather jacket, your leather shoes, or your leather shoes on a daily basis to help the leather age.The aging process will also soften the leather, effectively opening the pores of the leather, and releasing the bad odor.

Buy a leather cleaner.,
Condition the leather item.,
Consider getting the item professionally cleaned and conditioned.",How to Get Bad Smells out of Leather2," You can find professional leather cleaners at your local hardware store or even at your shoe cobbler’s. Always use cleaner made specifically for leather on your leather item.You will need to use a dry clean cloth to wipe the leather with the cleaner. Most cleaners can help to remove odors, preserve the color and sheen of the leather, and protect the leather from cracking.

, You should always condition leather items after you clean them. Conditioning the leather will help to remove any odors and maintain the color and sheen of the leather. There are several options for conditioning your leather:High quality linseed oil: This is a very effective natural oil for conditioning your leather clothing and other leather items. Avoid using cheap linseed oil, as it will not be very effective. Use a cloth to massage the linseed oil into the leather so the oil is absorbed by the leather.
Shoe polish: The oldest method for conditioning leather is also one of the best. Use liquid shoe polish on leather shoes, leather jackets, and leather purses. You can also use canned shoe polish for leather boots and shoes. If you’re cleaning natural leather, buy shoe polish that contains carnauba wax and natural ingredients.
Professional leather conditioner: This product can be bought at your local household supply store. Most leather conditioners come as a spray. You spray the conditioner on the surface of the leather and the chemical seeps into the pores of the leather. It then removes odors and helps to bring out the sheen of the leather.
Avoid using saddle soap on your leather item. It will require a lot of rinsing and may give the leather a streaky look or a sticky surface., If the odor resists home remedies or an over the counter leather cleaner, it may be time to consider bringing the item to a shoe cobbler to see about getting it professionally cleaned and conditioned. Depending on the leather item and the severity of the odor, you may be able to get the odor removed from the leather for a small fee.

Cleaning the area will remove dirt or oils, which will prevent discoloration and ensure the glue will set properly. It will also open the leather’s pores, making it more receptive to the products you’ll use to repair and recolor it., Gently run a spatula or the back of a knife against the grain of the scuff. Your goal is to carefully lift the scuffed fibers away from the surface. That way, you’ll be able to access the area underneath the fibers with leather glue., Apply a few drops of leather glue onto the edge of your spatula or the back of your knife. Pull the tool against the grain of the scuff to apply the glue to the underside of the scuffed fibers. Use short, even strokes to thoroughly and carefully apply the glue., After applying glue against the grain, rub the tool with the grain of the scuff to flatten the area and remove air bubbles. Rubbing with the grain will lower the scuffed fibers back into place, so they’re even with the leather surface. Use your finger to gently massage the area and remove excess glue., If you can match a recoloring marker to your leather, apply it in thin coats. Feather the outer edges of the recolored area to blend it with the surrounding leather. Light scuffs might not need any recoloring at all, so use your judgment after applying the leather glue."

Leave loose fibers that are shorter, or that you can’t access with the scissors, as they won’t interfere with your repair.You can purchase leather cleaner, binder, filler, and sealer separately or together in a professional repair kit. You can find the products you’ll need online or at your local home improvement store.

, Apply a small amount of leather binder to a clean, dry sponge, then coat the entire affected area. Check the product’s label for instructions about drying time, and allow it to dry completely before applying the next coat. For best results, apply 8 to 10 coats of binder to the scratched surface., Use a 1200 grit sandpaper to lightly sand the area where you’ve applied the binder. Use gentle, circular motions. Sand until you’ve created a smooth, even surface across the area undergoing repair.Blow away any residue or wipe the surface using a microfiber towel after sanding.

, Use a palette or putty knife to spread a thin layer of filler over deep scratches or gouges in the surface. Wait 20 to 25 minutes for the filler to dry. Apply as many coats as you need until the scratches or gouges are level with the surrounding surface., After applying filler and letting it dry, sand the surface once more with a 1200 grit sandpaper. Use an alcohol-based leather cleaner to wipe down the repaired area, then give it several minutes to dry.The cleaner will remove any residue and prepare the leather for recoloring.

, If its container doesn’t come with an applicator, use a clean, dry sponge to apply a thin layer of leather colorant. Let it dry according to its instructions before applying additional layers.

Combine colors if you cannot find a dye that is the exact shade you are looking for. For example, if you want a dark brown but the brown dye seems too light, mix a little black die into it. Use white dye to get a lighter color.;
, A basement, garage or even outdoor driveway will provide a good place to work.

,, Do not soak the couch. Instead, lightly rub it with a cloth that you dip in soapy water and ring out.

, Dip a clean cloth or rag into the acetone and rub it all over the couch.

, You want the leather to be wet so it absorbs the dye, but not soaked.

, Place some dye onto a clean rag or cloth and then rub it onto the couch. Make sure you wear gloves to protect your hands.


Work in small patches at a time. This will make the process easier and it will keep the leather looking more consistent as you color it. Spray one section, then apply the dye. Spray the next section and apply the dye and continue until the entire couch has been dyed.

,, You should put on as many coats as you need to get the right color you are looking for. Most leather couches will need between 3 and 6 coats.


Let the dye dry between each coat.

, This can be purchased wherever you get the leather dye. It may be called leather finisher or leather top coat. You can choose a glossy or satin finish.

Prepare the leather for the dye.,
Put on gloves and begin the dying process.

,
Shake the dye thoroughly, then rub onto the leather furniture with a new sponge.,
Apply dye in a thin, even coats over the entire leather furniture.,
Sponge or airbrush the entire leather surface with dye.,
Apply leather furniture top coat after the dye is done and thoroughly cured.",How to Dye Leather Furniture," Whether you want to re-dye it the original color, or perhaps change the color to a different hue, the choice is yours. There are many great sources for leather furniture dye, just be sure to use a professional and reputable source, and not an ""As Seen on TV"" type of product.;
, Avoid paint, which many stores may offer. You can choose your color off of swatches or color charts available from true professional vendors and suppliers, check with leather repair and restoration professionals or leather furniture companies to find high quality dye.

, You'll need good light, good ventilation and enough space to move freely around the furniture.

, This is to protect any flooring, walls, or nearby objects that you do not want dye to get on.


If there are any areas that you do not want dyed on the leather furniture, such as a reclining handle, push buttons or decorative tacks, etc, be sure to cover them using masking tape and/or paper towels to prevent over-spray.

, Use a very diluted dish soap and water mixture thoroughly to remove dirt, grease and grime from the leather's pores. Use about 5 drops dish soap in a bottle of water, shake, pour onto a rag or paper towels and scrub the leather gently.

, Use leather prep that you can get from a leather furniture dye distributor. Mist a sponge or paper towels and wipe down the leather, massaging the prep on to the surface but not spraying directly on the leather because you do not want to saturate it. Prep removes the protective silicon top coat of the leather, and using too much can damage the leather.


You may use other products such as acetone but these are extremely erosive and too much can actually cause a chemical burn and severely weaken the leather!

,, You may also apply dye with an airbrush tool, many people find this application to have a more even and smooth finish. When applying dye, be sure not to put it on too thick, thicker areas may result in a drip or thickness that will not cure totally and could later peel away if it does not bond to the leather's surface.

, Then dry (cure) the dye with a household hair dryer. Be sure all areas are cured thoroughly before applying any more layers of dye, if you are unsure if the dye is cured, you can wait an hour or two before applying the next coat.

, Continue until you are satisfied with the resulting color, its brightness and its evenness. Usually 2 to 4 thin layered applications is all that is needed for satisfactory results.

, This is to protect the leather as well as the dye. Be sure the top coat is totally dry and cures for at least 3 days before using the leather furniture!

,
Set the top foot of the C-clamp in the center of the metal object.,
Remove the C-clamp after 20 minutes.",How to Emboss Leather1," Embossing doesn’t work on pre-treated clothing or accessories.;
, You can use a charm or purchase a leather stamp in the design of your choice online. You can order custom leather stamps through sellers on Etsy.


If you use a metal charm, make sure it has cut edges, rather than a tapered design. It will make your shape appear more pronounced in the leather.

, The front side should be facing up. It must be near the edge of a table on which you can hook a strong C-clamp.

, You don’t want it to be sopping wet, so squeeze it out several times.

, Move the leather so that it can fit under the clamp.

,, Crank the clamp until it is clamped as far as it will go.

, Seal the leather with leather finish, if you want to improve the durability of the design and surface of the leather.


Leather finish should be applied after all embossing is complete. It should also be done before you sew or complete assembly on a leather project."

Repeat these steps with other stamps if you want to make a more intricate design.",How to Emboss Leather2," Buy 3-D stamps with a cylinder that can be inserted into any of the flat stamps. You can order custom stamps online or start with a set of alphabet stamps.


Make sure the metal cylinder will match your stamps. The cylinder is the piece you use to pound the shape of the stamp into the leather.

, Make sure the front of the leather is facing up. Decide where you want to emboss your design.

, If the water changes the color of the leather drastically, wait for it to dry a little.

,, Hold it firmly with one hand.

, Be careful not to move the stamp while you hit it. You can pick up the stamp, see if the impression is inlaid deep enough and align it for stamping again.It requires some practice to learn how hard to strike the stamp.

, Use a leather-finishing product when you have completed you embossing and before you assemble your final project.


You can also apply leather paint to the embossed design to give it more flair. Any alcohol-based paint can be applied before the leather is finished."

Pick a design.,
Determine the design placement.,
Wipe the leather with a damp sponge.,
Place the first stamp.,
Tap the stamp with a mallet.,
Repeat with the remaining stamps.,
Let the bracelet dry.",How to Engrave Leather Bracelets at Home1," For this technique, you will need to use craft embossing stamps, so you will also need to plan a design based on the embossing stamps you're able to find.


You should be able to find embossing stamps at any major craft store.
This technique works best if you want to engrave letters onto a leather bracelet, especially since letter embossing stamps are so easy to find. You can use embossing stamps to spell out names, inspirational words, or short quotes and sayings.You could also opt for a design involving numbers, simple shapes, or simple images. Keep in mind that simplicity is key here. If you want to create a more elaborate design, you will need to use the freehand method.
Before purchasing embossing stamps, make sure that the stamp face is no wider than the width of the leather bracelet you plan to use. Note that plain leather crafting bracelets are also available at most craft stores.;
, Determine how far apart you want each stamped image to be before you start any engraving.


Lay the leather bracelet flat on top of your working surface. Line the embossing stamps up side by side above the bracelet. Move and position the stamps as needed until the stamps are positioned evenly over the bracelet length.
If you cannot get the design to fit, you may need smaller embossing stamps or a smaller design.
It can be a good idea to lightly mark the left edge of each stamp on the leather bracelet using chalk. This chalk should be wiped away after completing the engraving.

, Thoroughly wipe both sides of the leather bracelet with a mildly damp sponge. The leather needs to be moist, but it should not be soaked.


Thoroughly saturate the sponge under running water, then squeeze out the excess moisture. The remaining dampness should be enough to moisten the leather bracelet.
The moisture weakens the leather, which makes it easier to emboss and engrave.
Too much moisture can cause the leather to dry out and crack, however.

, Place the bracelet down on a hard working surface and carefully position your first stamp in its proper spot.


Make sure that the ""right"" side of the bracelet is facing up. Engravings made with embossing stamps will not be deep enough to show through to the other side of the bracelet.
You must use a hard working surface. If you use a soft working surface, there will not be enough pressure to engrave the leather when you strike the stamp.
If you marked the placement of each stamp with chalk, make sure that the first chalk line lines up with the left edge of the stamp again as you position it in place.

, Hold the stamp securely with your non-dominant hand and strike the end of the stamp with a mallet using your dominant hand.


Strike the stamp one to three times using considerable force.
When you strike the stamp multiple times, make sure that you are holding it in the same position each time. Otherwise, your final design could be skewed and uneven.
After lifting the stamp away, you should see the impression of the stamp design engraved into the leather.

, Place the remaining stamps in their proper place and strike them with the mallet. Work with the stamps one at a time.


Follow the design layout previously planned and make sure that the stamp designs are spaced apart evenly. If you marked the left edge of each stamp with chalk, make sure that the left edges of each stamp line up with their corresponding lines before tapping them into place.
Take your time. Rushing through the process will increase the risk of error.

, Set the bracelet aside and allow any remaining dampness to dry. Once the leather dries, the engraved images should set and the bracelet should be ready to wear.


Wipe away any remaining chalk lines with your damp sponge before the bracelet fully dries.
If you want to decorate the leather further with dyes or embellishments, do so after the leather has been engraved.

Bevel the cuts.,
Outline the burnished lines in ink.,
Press into the leather.,
Paint raised areas with leather weld glue.,
Moisten the leather again.,
Round off the cut lines.,
Let dry.",How to Engrave Leather Bracelets at Home2," Place the leather bracelet over a sheet of tracing film and carefully trace the outline of the bracelet onto the film.


Lift the bracelet away once you've traced the outline.
Do not trim the tracing film down after creating the outline. The film must remain a little larger than the outline so that it is easy enough to handle.

, Draw your desired design into the outline on your tracing film. You can use either pencil or pen.


Draw a freehand design or use stencils to trace an intricate design onto the film.
This method is best used for more complex designs since many simple designs can be made using the easier, faster stamping technique.

, Use a moist sponge to moisten the grain side of the leather.


Saturate the sponge completely under running water, then wring out the excess. Brush this mildly damp sponge over the leather to dampen it.
The moisture lowers the resistance of the leather and makes it easier to engrave. Too much moisture can cause the leather to dry out and crack, though.

, Place the tracing film over the leather bracelet. Tape the film to either the bracelet or the working surface to hold it in place.


Make sure that the outline on the tracing film lines up perfectly with the perimeter of the leather bracelet.
The grain side of the bracelet should face up.
Note that you should also be working on a hard working surface, not a soft surface.

, Use a stylus or blunt modeling tool to trace over the design on your tracing paper.


Apply enough pressure so that each stroke sinks into the leather beneath the film. You do not need to cut through the film as you trace the design.
If you have any straight lines, consider using a ruler or similar straight edge to help maintain them.

, Remove the tracing film and go over the lines again, making them deeper and easier to see.


For simple outlines, you can use the same stylus or modeling tool to create deeper indentations.
For more complex designs, use a swivel knife and make actual cuts into leather.

, Trace along any swivel knife cuts with a rounded modeling spoon tool.


The idea is to bevel the harsh edges and lines of each cut, smoothing them out and making them look neater.

, Flip the leather bracelet over so that the flesh side or ""wrong"" side now faces up. Trace over the raised lines of the pattern with an ink pen to make them easier to see.


If the outlines of your design are not visible from the back of the bracelet, you may need to trace them again from the grain side of the leather using the rounded modeling spoon.

, Use a ball modeler tool and firmly press into any solid portion of the design that needs to be raised when viewed from the front side.


Make sure that you stay within the pen lines as you press the leather.

, Flip the leather back over to the grain side. Use a small paintbrush to apply leather welder glue to all raised areas of the design.


The glue helps ""plug"" the grains of the leather, creating a smoother finish.
Let the glue dry before continuing further.

, Use a damp sponge to moisten the grain side of the leather again.


As before, the leather should only be damp and not soaked.

, Use a rounded modeling spoon to bevel and round off all lines in the pattern.


Trace the lines as you did when beveling the edges before. This final beveling will create a smoother, neater appearance.

, Allow the leather bracelet to air dry completely. Once the bracelet dries, the engraving process is complete and the bracelet should be ready to wear.


Note that you should wait to apply any stains or sealants until after the engraving process is over.

An animal: A dog, cat, frog, mouse, crocodile, pig, etc. You name the animal and if you can find a basic template shape, it can be turned into a mouse pad.
An animal paw: This is a cute shape for a mouse pad, such as a cat or dog paw. Have a base piece (the paw shape) and a paw pad and three claw pads on top of the base piece.
An animal head: For example, a cat or dog head, a unicorn or horse head, etc.
A shape: Any shape is fine, from squares and circles to triangles and hexagons.;
, You can free draw a design (using a ruler or stencils for straight edges or specific designs). Or, you can print off a template of a design from internet pictures or trace around designs in a book or magazine. Draw the template design onto a piece of paper suitable for using as a template, making sure it is large enough to serve as a mouse pad. Once this is done, cut it out in readiness for using as a template.


If you need to change the size of a traced picture, see How to change the size of a picture using a grid.

, It is highly recommended that you only use wool felt, not artificial felt. Wool felt will ensure a quality finish that can withstand with the frequent movement of the mouse and won't interfere with the electronics of the mouse. Artificial felt can be used but should definitely include the step on adding a sealant, to ensure a smooth surface and to keep the felt intact from constant mouse usage (see sealant step below).

, Pin in place. Cut out the design from the felt.


If cutting out additional pieces, such as paw pads, lettering, eyes, etc., pin the additional templates to different pieces of felt and cut these out as well. These additional designs must be kept thin.

, Either stitch or sew in place, keeping these pieces very flat. Realize that by adding pieces, bumps are created that can hamper easy mousing.


If using fabric glue, ensure that it is dry before proceeding.

, Use the template to cut out the exact shape in the self-adhesive foam padding or non-slip shelf liner, then carefully attach the felt piece to the padding piece. If using self-adhesive foam, stick to the sticky backing that already forms part of the foam padding. If using the non-slip shelf liner, either glue or stitch in place.


Keep the join smooth, to avoid leaving wrinkles.

, This step is optional but can extend the life of the felt mouse pad, especially if you've used thin and cheaper felt; it also helps to keep the pad surface smooth for the mouse, especially if you've added lettering, paw pads, eyes, etc. from additional pieces of felt.


Either spray with a fabric sealant; or
Paint with a layer of Mod Podge to add a sealant finish. Allow to dry, then paint on another layer. Keep both layers very thin.

, The mouse pad is now ready for use. Place it on your desk, non-slip or foam side down and run the mouse over the felt side.

You are making the felt pieces twice the height of your phone because you will be folding them in half.

, Draw a line connecting this mark to the top left corner.This will make a front pocket for your case.

, If you want to have a pocket on both sides, fold the felt rectangle in half, first, then cut through both layers of feltThis will create identical pockets on both sides of the case. Discard the triangles you cut out, or save them for another project.

, Make sure that all the sides align. The cut piece of felt will go on the outside, and make the pockets.

, The uncut piece of felt will now be sandwiched in between the cut piece of felt. You will end up with a rectangle that is the same height as your phone.

, You want the case to be snug around your phone. Move the pins around until the case fits snugly around your phone. Once you are happy with the fit, slip your phone out.

, Pull the pins out as you go. You can match the thread color to your case, or use a contrasting color. You can sew this by hand, or on a sewing machine.

, Depending on how thick your phone is, you may need to cut down the seams. For a cleaner finish, cut them to within 2 millimeters of the stitching. For a more interesting finish, trim them using pinking shears.

, You can slide other items into the side pocket(s), such as credit cards and paper money.

Fold up the bottom edge by 4 inches (10.16 centimeters).,
Glue the side edges.,
Fold the top flap down.,
Consider adding a Velcro closure to the flap.,
Embellish the bag, if desired.",How to Make a No‐Sew Felt Bag1," Orient it vertically. You can use a different sized piece of felt, but it needs to be a rectangle, and oriented vertically, with one of the narrow ends facing you., You can fold it up by more to make a deeper bag, but this will make the top flap shorter., Lift the bottom flap up and run a line of hot glue down the edge. Quickly press the flap back down and run your finger along the edge. Repeat this step on the other side for the other edge., If you'd like to, you can cut the top flat into a V shape so that it looks more like an envelope. This is not absolutely necessary, but it can give your bag a nice touch. You can also cut the flap shorter, if you'd like to.

, You don't have to do this, but it will make your bag look more professional. It will also help keep it shut. Place one piece on the bag itself, and the other piece on the underside of the flap.


You can use self-adhesive Velcro or regular Velcro. If you are using regular Velcro, you will need to glue it in place.

This method is for a wine bag, but you can use it to make another type of bag as well. Simply change the dimensions to suit your gift.How wide the felt is depends on how many bags you want to make. The wider the felt, the more bags you'll be able to make.

, Keep the narrower edge on the fold. If you'd like to, you can cut it out using pinking sheers for an interesting effect.You can also round the top corners instead., Unfold your felt strip. Measure down about 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) from one of the narrow edges. Make two vertical slits in the middle, about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) apart, and ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) tall.The slits need to be the same height as your ribbon. If the ribbon you will be using is a different height, adjust the height of the slits accordingly.

, Start applying the glue about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) from the bottom. This will create the base of the bag.Apply the glue no more than 1/4 inch (.64 centimeters) from the edges., Choose a ½ to 1-inch (1.27 to 2.54-centimeter) wide ribbon that matches your bag.

Embellish the bag, if desired.",How to Make a No‐Sew Felt Bag3," These shapes can be anything you want, but it's best if they are simple.Great examples include: squares, semi-circles, hearts, and kitty heads.

, The strip needs to be about 3½ inches (8.89 centimeters) wide.If your shape has curved edges, like a semi-circle or kitty head, the strip needs to wrap around just the curved part.


If your felt strip is not long enough, cut several strips, and hot glue the ends together, overlapping them by ¼ to ½ inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters).
The strip can be the same color as your purse, or a different one.

, Keep the outer edges of the strip aligned with the outer edges of your shape. You will have a seam that is about ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) wide. Hot glue sets fast, so only squeeze out 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) at a time.


If your shape is curved, cut slits into the edges of the felt strip before gluing it down.

, Flip your purse over so that the front is facing you. Place it on top of the second shape, and make sure that the edges are aligned. Hot glue the other side of the strip to the second shape using the same method as before.

, The body of your purse is almost complete. You can leave the body as it is, with the seams on the outside, for an interesting touch. You can also turn the purse inside out to hide the seams on the inside.


If you choose to flip your purse inside out, you will need to cut notches into the seams if it's curved. If it's square, clip the bottom corners.
If you choose not to flip your bag inside out, consider going over the seam with a blanket stitch using embroidery floss. This will give your purse a nice design.

, This will make the strap for the purse. You can make it as long or as short as you'd like. You will be folding the strap in half lengthwise, so it will end up narrower than your purse. If you want the strap to be the same width as your purse, cut it 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) wide instead.


Make the strap about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) longer than you want it to be. You need this extra length to attach it.

, Once again, squeeze out the glue 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) at a time, or it will set too quickly. You can draw the glue just along the edges of the strap, or you can make little squiggles before folding it down. This will make the strap sturdier.

, Press it against the top edge of one of the side panels. Repeat this step for the other end of the strap and the other side panel. Make sure that they are centered.


You can attach the straps to the inside or outside of your purse.
If you choose to attach the straps to the outside, consider gluing or sewing a cute button over it.

, Cut out more shapes from colored felt. Hot glue them to the front of your bag. You can also stitch on some designs using embroidery thread instead. You can get as creative as you want here. It's best not to get too carried away, however; sometimes, less is more! Here are some ideas to get you started:


Try stripes, zigzags, or other geometric shapes for a square bag. Your initial would also work well.
Turn a red semi-circle into a watermelon by adding black seeds.
Hot glue smaller hearts inside of a heart-shaped pursed.
A kitty purse might need some eyes and nose. A set of whiskers might look cute too.

Grab some brown paper, butcher paper, or a brown paper bag.,
Measure the cover.,
Draw a horizontal line on the paper along the top and bottom edges of the book.,
Remove the book from the paper.,
Place the book back onto the folded paper.,
Open the front cover of the book.,
Close the book while keeping the paper folded around the cover.,
Open the back cover of the book.,
Slide each of the book’s covers into the newly created paper flaps.,
Decorate or label the book.",How to Make a Book Cover1," All of these types of paper can make an excellent book cover.

This type of cover can be left as is, or made fancier with stamping, painting or decoupaging. You could also use other papers: gift wrapping paper, photocopied design paper, and any other forms of paper that you consider strong enough to form a book cover.;
, Place the brown paper down on a flat work surface. Center the book on the paper.


If you are using a paper bag, you will want to cut the paper bag open so that it lays flat. Remove any handles as well.
Your paper should be bigger than your book so that you have enough of it to wrap around your book and create pockets for the covers to slide into.

, Use a ruler and pencil to achieve this.


This horizontal line will be your guide for folding your paper to help form your book pockets.

, Fold the paper in from the top and bottom to the drawn lines.


You want to crease the paper on the horizontal lines you’ve just drawn.
Note that folds can be made neater and cleaner by using a bone folder. A bone folder is a piece of plastic that looks like a knife. It is used to get perfect folds and creases without cutting the paper. , The back of the book should be facing down onto the paper. Center the book horizontally.


Make sure that the sides of the paper are of an even length on either side of the book. Then make sure you line up the book so that the top and bottom are flush with your creases.

, Fold the left edge of the paper in over the cover.


With the front cover open, take the left side of your paper and fold it over the cover. If you have too much paper and the fold goes too far for your liking, cut the excess paper.

, Keep the folded left edge of the paper tightly in position.


The paper should stay wrapped snugly around the front cover. You may have to reposition the book so that you don’t rip the paper on the book’s spine.
If the paper is too tight, move the book to give it more slack. You want to wrap the book without ripping the paper.

, Fold the right edge of the paper in.


Just like you did with the front cover, fold your paper over the back cover. If you have too much paper, cut some off.
Close the book to make sure that the paper fits around it.

, Do this one at a time.


You’ll notice that the folds and flaps have created a pocket. You can now slide each cover into the pocket for a better hold.
Provided the paper has been folded sharply and crisply, and the paper is of substantial heaviness, the cover should not need any taping down. However, you may want to tape the pocket down if you feel it necessary.

, The sky's the limit on making brown paper more interesting. You can draw on it, potato print or paint it (do before making the book cover, though). Or stick on a label and write the name of the book inside the label space.


Ribbon or braid can be glued down the spine for added effect and strength. This can be nice if the book is for a wedding, guest book, or another memento.
You can also write the name of the book, or the name of your class on the front of the paper to make it easier to differentiate.

Remove the book from the contact paper.,
Place the book back onto your plastic paper.,
Cut out triangles in each corner of the contact paper.,
Cut away the top flap inside your covers.,
Lift the bottom of the book off the plastic paper, leaving the front cover flap in place.,
Fold down the top and bottom portions of the paper.",How to Make a Book Cover2," Plastic film is probably the most standard covering for a book. You can use clear or colored adhesive plastic contact paper. Or you can use various types of book covering plastic that isn’t adhesive but is made for book covering.


Either type of plastic will protect your book. But, the non-adhesive method tends to be less damaging to the book in the long run. should you wish to ever remove the plastic covering, non-adhesive is easier to remove. You can also opt to make a plastic sheet protector book cover.
The chemicals in the adhesive may eventually tarnish the book. Additionally, the adhesive method is not an environmentally friendly way to cover a book because recycled versions of it have not yet been created.
Regular plastic coverings take a bit more work but can be easily removed. You can also try covering a book with plastic wrap.
Contact paper book covering comes in a roll. It is usually available from anywhere that sells stationery or craft supplies. Most rolls will have measurements printed on the backing of the contact paper, which will help you to align the plastic.

, Place the book on the contact paper. Center the book using the lines on the backing of the paper. If there are no guidelines, use a ruler. Think of this part as similar to wrapping a present.

, Leave enough room when cutting so that you have enough paper to fold over the front cover. This will free the roll from the portion you’ll be working with.


You should now have you book lying on top of a free, flat piece of plastic paper. There should be some excess paper around all sides of the book.

, Peel the contact away from its backing if you need to.


If you're using sticky contact paper that has a backing, you'll need to peel away the backing to reveal the adhesive side. When you lay the book back down, lay it on the adhesive side. The plastic will stick to the book.

, Open the front cover of the book to bring a fold over of plastic paper.


Bring your plastic paper over to the inside front cover of the book. You will want to apply a small piece of tape to hold the plastic in place. The repeat with the back cover. Don’t tape down the back cover yet.

, After you have folded the plastic over the corners you will have excess paper that needs to be trimmed and cut.


First cut two slits in the plastic on either side of the book’s spine. Then, cut off the corners of the plastic from the top and bottom of your book. Cut at an angle so that your scissors go up to the corners of your book.
You need to cut the corners so that you can easily cut away a layer of plastic inside the book covers. And fold down the extra plastic on the top and bottom of the book.

, You will see flaps that are no longer connected to the parts of paper that are extending on the top and bottom of your book.


Cut away these flaps so that you can easily fold down the extra plastic.

, You want to lift the book to reveal the spinal tabs you cut.


Then fold down the spinal tabs toward the center of the paper. Gently lower your book back down over the folded tabs.

, All that’s left to do is to open up your covers and fold the remaining parts of plastic paper into the inside covers.


Try to tape the plastic together to hold everything in place without taping the book if possible. Tape can be hard to remove from the book, especially without causing damage.
Check for air bubbles. Running a ruler across the cover usually dispels these. Then you’re all done.

Either way, covering a book with fabric is a nice way to keep the book in good condition. Fabric can also add a personal touch that makes this book unique and special to you.

, The fabric needs to be fairly substantial to protect the book, so avoid anything too flimsy.


Also get some lightweight fusible interfacing. Fusible interfacing is used to add a rigidity or stiffness to a fabric. The interfacing gets applied to the wrong side of the fabric, or underside to help form your fabric. , Take an iron and smooth out your fabric so that there are no wrinkles.


Any wrinkles that you have when applying the fabric to your book will stay.
Try using a fabric that is made to be wrinkle free to make covering your book easier.

, Place the fabric down on a flat work surface. Center the book on the fabric. Make sure you have plenty of extra fabric.


Draw two horizontal lines across the fabric along the top and bottom edges of the book. Extend the edges of the fabric beyond the book to provide adequate space for flaps on each side.
For best results, make the flaps at least 2 inches/5cm wide. For larger books, add even more width.






Leave a small allowance both above and below the horizontal lines when cutting.







, Cut out the fabric to the new measurements, giving yourself more fabric than the dimensions of the book.


You’ll want to give yourself some extra fabric to work with when cutting. Extra fabric also helps you to apply the fusible interfacing. When applying the interfacing, you’ll want to fold a small bit of the fabric over itself, around the interfacing.

, This will be the side of the fabric that faces into the book.


The fusible interfacing will have a bumpy side, the side that attaches to the fabric, and a smooth side.
Press it into the fabric with a damp cloth. Then take your iron and iron it for 10 to 15 seconds. If you need to move the iron, pick it up and place it down in a new spot. Don’t glide it to heat another spot of the interfacing.

, The interfaced side of the fabric should still be facing up.


The interfacing isn’t meant to be shown. When you lay the book down, it will be against the interfaced side of fabric. This means that when you complete your cover, the interfacing will be inside and not exposed.

, Lay the cover down and bring the left edge of the fabric in.


You want to fold the left edge of the fabric over the book’s cover to create a sort of pocket. Then, using a pin, pin the flaps of fabric together.
The top and bottom edges of fabric should extend past the edges of the book cover slightly. The extra fabric allows you to pin the fabric without pinning the book cover.

, Fold the right edge of the fabric in over the cover.


Repeat the same process for the other cover, pinning the flaps of fabric together.

, You will now have the general shape of your fabric book cover.


Fold down any extra fabric that extended passed the vertical edges of the book covers. You want to fold in any extra fabric and pin it to the rest of the fabric.

, Using a topstitch, sew across the top and bottom of the cover.


A topstitch is a method of stitching that has you bringing the thread over the edges of your fabric layers. The stitch will then bring the layers together. , You will want to make sure to stitch all your flaps together.


The top stitching will allow you to connect any flaps or pockets that have been folded over. The ultimate result will be one large pocket for you to slide your cover into.
Do this for both sides. You should have two pockets, one for each cover stitched.

, It's now ready for everyday wear and tear!


You can also reuse this cover on any other book that is the same size as your original one.

If you can, use wool felt in preference to synthetic felt mixes, as it’s a lot easier to work with. However, wool felt tends to be more expensive too.

, An average dimension (paperback, notebook) is typically 8.5” x 12”/21.5cm x 30.5cm. Although you may need your felt to be larger depending on the size or your books.

The sides of the felt need to be adequately large so as to fold over the edges of the book to create flaps.

, Fold the covers down. This will help you get an idea of how much felt you need.


The book should be centered on the felt, and should be opened and sitting flat.

, This tracing will tell where to fold the felt for the top and bottom. Don’t trace the vertical edges as these parts will get folded in to create flaps.


The extra width that extends past the vertical edges of the covers will turn into the flaps. If using the measurement for the felt provided above, this extra part should measure approximately 2 inches/5cm more each side.
Also add a 1/4 inch/6mm edge above and below the marked horizontal lines. This will give you extra felt to cut or fold.

, Lay it down flat on the work surface.


You will now have a piece of felt that is slightly larger than your book.

, Lay it on its spine and bring the covers down to lay on top of the felt.


Center the book onto your fabric so that each edge has an even spacing between book and felt.

, Take the portion of fabric that extends past your front your book cover and fold it over the cover. Pin The felt in place.


You should have excess felt on the top and bottom of your book so that you pin only the felt and not the actual book.
Repeat for the right side, pinning the felt in place. This creates the book flaps or slip pockets for your covers.
Carefully remove the book from the felt. Slipping the felt off the book carefully without disturbing the pins.

, Capture each side and fold in the stitching, as this is what keeps the slip pockets, or flaps, intact.


You can either hand stitch or machine stitch, depending on the final look you're after.

, Leave a small amount of felt above the stitching line, it's important not to trim too closely.


Don’t cut too close to the stitching as you risk cutting the thread and unraveling your stitching.

, Close it to make sure it sits tight. It should now be a well-protected book.

Mix the solution with a spoon or even just with your hands.After you prepare your glue solution, lay a couple of sheets of plastic wrap over your work surface. This will give you somewhere to lay your felt squares while they dry.

, Next, take one of your felt squares and dip it into the water. Make sure that the whole felt square is soaked through. Then, lift the felt square out of the water and wring it out over the bowl. Next, lay the felt square down on your plastic wrap and press it so that it is completely flat.Repeat the same process with the other felt square.

, After you have flattened both of your felt squares, leave them alone until they are completely dry and stiff. This may take a few hours.Keep in mind that the felt squares need to be fully dry before you move onto the next step. White glue also takes a long time to dry, so you may even consider leaving the felt squares to dry overnight., While your felt squares are drying, you can prepare the paper pattern. Lay the pattern on your cutting mat and use your precision knife and ruler to make straight, clean cuts along the guidelines of the paper patterns.Be careful when using the precision knife because it is sharp!

, When the felt squares are dry, you can use the paper patterns to cut out the felt squares. Place your felt squares on the cutting mat and use your ruler and precision knife to cut out the squares. Hold the ruler over each of the lines one at a time and run the precision knife over the line to make the cut.Again, be careful when using the straight knife! It is extremely sharp!

, Take your largest felt piece. This piece will serve as your box bottom. To shape the box bottom, you will need to create creases in the flaps that extend past the inner square area. To help you make the creases, hold the ruler over the area where the box flap and inner square meet., First apply some glue to the outer edge of one of the triangular flaps. Then, fold one of the square flaps over the triangle part of this triangular flap (where you just applied the glue). Press the edges together and make sure that they are lined up. Then, secure the edges with one of the clothespins.Repeat this process for the other corners of the box.

, The box bottom will need to dry completely before you do anything else with it. Leave it alone for about one hour or more if needed. The corners should feel stiff when they are dry.

, You will need to fold over the edges of the box cover to create creases similar to the ones that you made for the box bottom. Use the ruler to guide you as you crease each of the edges on the box.Do not secure the edges with glue yet.

, Before you secure the edges of the box cover with glue, you will need to decorate your box top. Otherwise, it will be difficult to secure pipe cleaners and other decorative items. You can decorate the top of your box however you like.Apply pipe cleaners to the edges. You can use fabric glue to secure pipe cleaners to the edges of your box top. Try lining the outer edge of your box top with fabric glue and then press a pipe cleaner into the edges.

Use glitter glue to add some sparkle. You can create interesting designs with glittery glue on the top of the box. Try making hearts, stars, or swirls.

Glue on beads, crystals, or other felt shapes. You can also secure beads, crystals, or other felt shapes to your box top. Use fabric glue to hold them in place.

, After you have decorated your box, you will need to apply glue to the edges to secure them. Apply some fabric glue to the triangular edge of one of the flaps and then connect it with the square edge. The square edge should go over the triangular edge. Press the edges together and then secure the corners with a clothespin.Repeat this process for the other three corners.

, After you have secured the edges, you will need to give them some time to dry. Leave your box top alone for about an hour so that the fabric glue can dry. Then, remove the clamps and enjoy your box!If desired, you can also decorate the sides of your box cover when it is dry. You can line it with pipe cleaners, add glitter glue, or apply other decorative items to the sides of your box cover.
Use your box as creative gift wrap for a present, give the box as a gift, or use it to store meaningful items.

Measure the width of your wall.,
Choose a large piece of felt for the base.,
Purchase a spray adhesive.,
Attach your felt to the wall.,
Trim the edges.,
Choose your theme.,
Make abstract shapes.,
Make felt faces.,
Make shapes that will fit on the activity wall.,
Make a variety of felt shapes.,
Attach your shapes.,
Create fun things with the shapes.,
Store your felt shapes properly.",How to Make a Felt Activity Wall for Kids," Before making a felt activity wall, you’ll need to know the width of the wall you hope to cover in felt. Use a measuring tape to take an accurate measurement of the wall.The amount of felt you’ll need corresponds to the size of the wall you’re trying to cover. The longer your wall, the more felt you will need.
If you don’t want to convert an entire wall into a felt activity wall for kids, measure only the part of the wall you’re interested in making available for the project.
There is no need to take a height measurement.;
, Once you know the size of the wall you’re trying to cover, visit your local fabric store. Obtain a quantity of felt that measures 48-60 inches (1.3-1.6 meters) high and as wide as the wall you wish to transform into a felt activity wall.For instance, if your wall is 10 feet wide, obtain a piece of felt in the color you desire that is 10 feet wide and 48-60 inches tall.

, To mount your felt activity wall for kids, you’ll need to obtain a spray adhesive or poster tape.You can easily obtain these at your local art supply store.You might worry that spray adhesive will damage your wall when the felt is removed. However, there is no need to worry about this.
If at some point you no longer wish to have a felt activity wall for kids, you can easily remove it using an adhesive remover manufactured with mineral spirits, baby oil, or citrus oil.Just apply the adhesive remover with a clean cloth. After removing the felt from the spray adhesives, hold the adhesive remover to the adhesive. After a few minutes, the adhesive will soften and you can wipe it up with a damp cloth.

, Spray the wall you will transform into a felt activity wall for kids with spray adhesive. Spray an even layer of spray adhesive in the center of the area that will receive the large felt base. Then, spray the back of the felt with an even layer of spray adhesive. Line the top edge of the felt up against your wall so that is straight in relation to your ceiling and floor. Unfurl the felt from the top to the bottom.Spray additional adhesive on the wall just before applying the felt.
If you see the felt base sagging or loose in any places, remedy the problem by rolling a small piece of poster tape into a tight cylinder and placing it behind the loose spots.
If you wish to use poster tape to mount your felt activity wall for kids, simply roll several pieces of poster tape into inverted cylinders (that is, with their sticky side facing out). Place these tape cylinders at even intervals of six inches (10 centimeters) or so along the edges of the back of the large piece of felt you intend to use as the base of your felt activity wall for kids.

, Once your felt is attached properly, it might have some ragged edges. Use your hand to gently peel back these uneven edges and trim them with scissors if necessary., If you want to use the felt wall to teach kids about a particular holiday or event, cut out felt shapes that are appropriate for that event or holiday. For instance, if you’re making a felt wall to celebrate Christmas, cut the felt wall into a Christmas tree shape using green felt. If you’re making the felt activity wall for kids who are celebrating Halloween, cut a measure of orange felt into a pumpkin shape and use orange felt.You could also choose more pedestrian themes like “city” or “farm.” A farm-themed activity wall for kids, for instance, might include barns, pigs, cows, and grain silos.

, If your child is very young, they will be much impressed by almost any shape you provide them for their felt activity wall. You could make simple shapes like ovals, circles, squares, or triangles. Cut these shapes out of different colors of felt.If you wish to craft multicolor felt shapes, you can use a needle and thread or a glue gun. For instance, if you wish to make a cow, you could cut the basic cow shape out of white felt, then sew or glue black spots onto the cow to give it an appropriately patchy look.

, Cut out a few differently-shaped heads (for instance a squarish head, an elongated head, and a head with a rounded jaw) and a few various facial features and/or accoutrements. For instance, you might create two brown eyes, two blue eyes, and three or fair different types of glasses. You could cut out a mustache, a beard, and hair of varying colors and lengths. Your child will have hours of fun mixing and matching the many combination of facial features., If your activity wall for kids is 10 feet wide, do not make a felt snake that is 15 feet long, as it will not fit on the felt activity wall. For the same reason, if your activity wall for kids is 160 centimeters tall, do not make a felt tree that is 180 centimeters tall., With many different felt shapes and settings on hand, you can swap them out from time to time. This will keep your child interested in the felt activity wall for kids. Create a diverse mixture of people, vehicles, weather conditions, robots, animals, and landscapes.Invite your kids to create their own shapes if they are old enough. Apply glue or sew for them where necessary.You might be able to purchase more complex or specialized shapes from retailers of school goods or children’s toys., The felt shapes will cling to the large felt sheet that comprises the base of the felt activity wall for kids. There is no need to use any additional adhesive. Your child can attach and remove the many felt shapes as they see fit., Felt activity walls for kids provide hours of fun. For instance, you and your child could create murals on the felt activity wall. Your child will love making jungle scenes or scenes of outer space. Identify scenes that your child likes and encourage them to bring these scenes to life.If you create “X” and “O” shapes, you and your child (or your child and their friends) could play tic tac toe on the felt activity wall for kids.
You could create alphabet sets to help your child learn new words and practice their alphabet., If you remove certain felt shapes and figures from the felt activity wall for kids, be sure to keep them organized. For instance, when you switch a regular felt shape on the activity wall for a themed shape like a Halloween pumpkin, put the felt pieces you remove into resealable plastic bags.If the pieces are too large for a regular bag, place them in a larger trash bag. Place the bag under the sofa or in another place nearby for safekeeping.

Sketch what you want to draw.,
Trace over your sketch.,
Erase your sketch.",How to Draw Using Only a Pencil1," One way to sketch is to draw basic shapes, such as circles and triangles. Then, connect the shapes as you see fit.


Sketch a circle where you want the light source to be. You don't have to keep it in the final drawing, but it will make it easier to determine where shadows would be. Consider sketching a few light lines where the shadows will be, so you won't have to think about it later on.;
, The pressure you put on the pencil depends on the style you're going for. For realism, don't make the lineart dark; keep it in the midtones, so you can blend it with the shadows. For a cartoon style, make the lineart dark and possibly thicker, to create a defined edge.

, Be careful not to erase your lineart. Erase carefully, and take your time.

, They should be mostly oval-like in shape, overlapping one another but not going beyond three rows or so per wing.

, These can be as thick or as lengthy as you like, but try to keep even the proportions of these feathers and the feathers from the previous step.

, You don't necessarily need to have too many extra lines or spots on your feathers, but the image at the right will show you how if you want those elements.

, To create a set, if your character is being viewed from the front rather than the side, simply mirror the drawing you've already done on the other side. And remember, when detailing/coloring, use your imagination!

Lay down your base tones.,
Smudge the graphite.,
Add shadows.,
Add highlights.",How to Draw Using Only a Pencil2," For each area in your drawing that would have color, lightly sketch using a dull pencil to create the base tone. Don't make it dark yet.


Work in small circles to create an even tone.

, Drag the tissue across the graphite. You could also use your finger, although that leads to oily paper and fingerprints. If you get any shadow out of the lines, and you don't want it to be, simply erase it.

, Sketch in layers; don't press hard for one layer, or you will create an indent in the paper. Consider your light source and where the darkest shadows would be.

, Erase parts of your shading in shine shapes. This can be used to make metal, dew, and other surfaces.


Keep in mind that, for example, hair isn't very reflective, while eyes are. Look at reference pictures to see how reflective a surface is.

Choose an old sweater that you know you no longer wish to use for wearing.,
Choose sweaters made only of pure animal fibers.,
Remove any parts of the sweater that are not to be felted.,
Cut the sweater into large pieces.,
Place the pieces inside a mesh laundry bag that closes firmly or a pillowcase tied with a firm knot.,
Place the bag of sweater pieces into the washing machine.,
Remove the bag from the washing machine when the cycle has finished.,
Throw the pieces into the dryer, if needed.,
Remove from the dryer.,
Store as for wool pieces in your craft materials.,
Make a felted project from the felt pieces.",How to Felt Old Sweaters," Be sure that it's not going to be a disappointment for anyone else in the family too, because once this sweater is transformed, there's no going back!

Don't have any old sweaters? Check the thrift store, your neighbor's yard sale or online auctions for suitable finds.;
, Since only animal fibers will felt, you'll need to check the label for the content of the sweater. Wool is the most used fiber for felting but you could also use a sweater made from cashmere, alpaca, camel hair or angora with wool (the angora cannot be used by itself, or it just doesn't turn into felt). Synthetic and plant-based sweaters do not felt; however, it is possible that a sweater with a very high level of animal fiber and a little synthetic may felt, provided the animal fiber forms at least 70 to 80 percent of the sweater.

As well as what the sweater is made of, the general rule is that the heavier the sweater, the heavier the felt resulting from it. Hence, for a heavy-weight project, a sweater made from heavy wool yarn would work well, while for a lighter-weight project, use lighter wool yarn, or alpaca or cashmere.

, For example, remove lace collars or sleeve ends, buttons, sequins or pearls, etc., This will make it easier to deal with once felted.

Separate the sleeves, front and back.

, This protects your washing machine from clogging up with excess fuzz caused by the felting process., Add laundry soap and put it through a hot cycle. Finish with a cold cycle rinse; this is an important part of the felting process.

Use a setting on the machine that allows for a good wash without there being too much water. Part of the success of felting relies on agitation or friction on the woolen object, so it shouldn't be swamped by water. So basically––a low water level plus high agitation.
Sometimes it is good to include clothing that enjoys a hot cycle wash, to act as weights on the sweater pieces and help them to shrink and felt up––think jeans and towels.

, Remove the pieces from the bag, being careful to toss away fuzz that no longer forms part of the sweater pieces.

If you feel that the washing machine has adequately felted the sweater pieces, simply allow them to air dry on the clothes line without using the dryer.

, Check that the lint trap is clean, as it is about to fill up again. Dry the sweater pieces on the hottest setting (high heat).

The dryer step can help introduce ""tightness"" or ""fullness"" to the felt if it's looking a little shabby or loose after just the washing process.

, You might have a whole lot of felt from the shrunken sweater pieces; success is determined by the pieces shrinking considerably and an inability to see the pattern or texture (threads) of the original sweater.

If the sweater pieces have not shrunk or you can still discern the pattern or texture of the sweater, the pieces need to go through the whole process again, until felted properly. You can also snip a bit at the edges of the felt––if it frays, it needs to be put through the wash and dry cycles again; if not, it's felt.
You may have to repeat the process several times with very heavy woolen sweaters, while a cashmere or alpaca might only take one wash and dry cycle. If it hasn't worked the first time and you didn't use a pair of jeans or a towel to add weight and something for the pieces to bump into, do so for the second wash.

, It is a good idea to store the pieces stacked, as this prevents the formation of wrinkles., There are lots of possibilities, including:

A felted blanket. Join various felted pieces together to form a patchwork felted blanket; you can incorporate other fabrics and embellishment materials such as lace and ribbon to complete the look.
Felted bangles. Wrap the felt around a bangle base that needs jazzing up. Glue in place. Tuft out the felt until you're happy with how it looks. Or, leave the felt flat and sew on embroidered flowers, sequins, beads, ribbon petals, etc. until the whole bangle is covered.
A felted purse.






Felted potholders.
Felt dolls, toys or figurines.
Felt accessories, such as flowers, hair bows, etc.
Felt laptop cover.

Add doors and windows.,
Feel free to add roads, people, other buildings, billboards, anything you can think of to the drawing!

,
Finished.

",How to Draw Using Perspective," Pick horizontal if you want the drawing to have short, small buildings. Pick vertical for tall buildings and skyscrapers.;
, This line is called the horizon. It should be parallel to the bottom of your paper. (Make sure you don't draw too darkly, this line is meant to be erased in some places!)

, This is your vanishing point. It determines which way your buildings point.

, The box will be the front view of the building. Make sure that the box's top and bottom are parallel to the top and bottom of your paper. And the sides are parallel to the sides of the paper. (If you skip this step, your drawing will turn out lopsided) Usually the box touches somewhere on the ground (below the horizon line), but then again, it's your picture, and you could make the building float if you want!(To make the building floating, draw the box above the horizon line)

, If there is a line(the former horizon line) inside of your box, erase it.

, Draw lines that connect those corners to the vanishing point.(Don't forget to draw lightly!)

,,


You now have a building base. You can add windows and doors if you want, too!

, Adding doors and windows is simple. On the front view of the building, you can draw simple boxes. But for windows or doors on the side of the building, draw a line parallel to the side of the building. Connect the ends of the line to the vanishing point and draw another line anywhere withing the building that's parallel to the other edge of the window. Erase the extra lines.

, Is there a hidden mole? Maybe there's a crooked tooth. These details make the picture more amazing.

, Or the hairline. Or the body. Whichever one is easier for you.

, Make sure you're facial features are aligned and they are still drawn lightly.

, Small strokes for the eyelashes, careful drawing for the nose. When you're done majority of the detail, just fill in the rest carefully. You wouldn't want scribbly lips, would you?

, Slowly draw the outline of the hairline starting from the head, downwards. When you're done the simple outline, fill in each hair VERY carefully.

, Draw the body very carefully, using small, short strokes. Then draw what the person is wearing. Maybe he's wearing a tuxedo, or maybe she has a bow in her hair. These all contribute to a detailed portrait.

, Focus on where the light is coming from.Then draw shadow accordingly.

To start off, think of your planned sketch.,
Look for shapes such as circles, squares, triangles, etc.,
Position yourself comfortably.,
Good hands: How does that help?,
Position your paper: This goes along with being comfortable, so put your paper at an angle that you feel comfortable with.,
If your item is small, place it in front of you where you can effectively sketch it.,
Begin Drawing.

,
Start from one side of the object, quickly and lightly take your pencil back and forth on the paper to make soft, light strokes.,
Be sure to constantly look up at your subject and compare the two.,
Don't be afraid to use the eraser.,
Apply Finishing touches: When you're done, take your eraser and remove the sketchy lines if you wish.,
Add more interest, add a poorly sketched (but still alright looking) background.,
Add Your signature!",How to Draw Simple Sketches," Visualize it in your mind and if you can, rotate it in your brain, to better understand what you'll be drawing.;
, to relate to. This will aid in the shading process, and even help you sketch look better if you understand the basic shape of what you are about to draw.

, If you are uncomfortable, your drawing will look worse than what it should, so get a nice chair, fix the lighting and put on some favorite music.

, If your hands are all sticky, wet or cold, your hand will not perform as well as it should.

, There's no set way.

, If it is something large, such as a car or tree, then get a clip board, sit down by it, and start sketching.

,, If you make a mistake, then you can easily erase the light lines.

, Do not do a blind contour (staring at your subject while trying to draw), although this is good for practice drawing, it can deform your drawing terribly.

, If you think you sketched lines too close or too far apart, erase them. Too many sketch lines on a drawing makes it look like your drawing is twisting. Going over the same line many times can make it dark and hard to erase if you decide it's wrong.

, To add value, on the darker, shaded parts of the object you're drawing, shade them on your sketch. Go from a very dark, and lighten it gradually to a very light shade.

, It'll make your drawing look better, and add some theme to it.

, Traditionally, after a sketch, artists lightly add their signature (Yes, in cursive) to the bottom right corner of their drawing. You can also add something like '13 to it, too if you'd like.

, Since the paper is thin and and pin is sharp, it will obviously go through. To prevent the pin from damaging anything or ripping the paper, rest the paper on top of the cardboard. Secure the paper by taping the edges to the cardboard. This will stop it from moving.

, Make sure the string is very tight. If you want to, you could tape it onto the pencil. That should secure it in place and stop it from moving.

, The pin should go through the string. Alternatively, you could tie the other end of the string onto the pin. After that, push the pin into the paper but not right through the cardboard. If you let go and don't tug on the pencil, the pin should stay up. Don't sweat if it doesn't.

, If the paper you are using does not make a perfect triangle, cut off the rectangular edge that sticks out and make it align perfectly. You should end up with a square folded into a triangle. Fold the triangle in half, noting where the folded ""bottom"" of the triangle is. If you have to cut off the bottom end of the paper, keep it and put it aside.

, Position the scissors along the bottom fold, and parallel to one of the edges going up to the top (your cuts should be somewhat diagonal). Cut almost all the way up to the double folded crease, but not quite. Keep about the same distance between each cut. (This might not be suitable for thicker paper, since the number of layers makes it difficult to cut through.) When you unfold the triangle into a larger triangle, it should look like the photo above.

, Turn it so that one of the points of the square faces you. It should look like the picture.

, Tape these two pieces together. You should see triangle shapes on each side of the roll.

, Take the next two paper lines and pull them together on the opposite side of the tube and tape together as before. This will be a more rounded shape and wider than the first tube.

,,, Do the other 3 pieces the same way. Now you will have 2 pieces consisting of 3 strands or ""arms"" each. (For smaller snowflakes, it may be easier to use double-sided tape or white glue in place of staples.)

,, This ensures that the snowflake shape is pulled into place. See picture at top for the finished snowflake.

Glue your blank triangles together.,
Push the outer corners in.,
Open opposite triangles.,
Try folding different sides.",How to Fold a Hexaflexagon," Your strip should be at least 12 times as long as it is wide. Construction paper will hold the folds better than standard notebook paper.;
, Equilateral means that all 3 sides are the exact same length. Make your first triangle by marking in about one knuckle. This will be the top point of your triangle. Make a diagonal fold, starting at this mark, with the long side of your strip. When you do so, you’ll see an equilateral triangle. There will be some excess paper on the top left of your triangle: cut this off. Open your fold to reveal an equilateral triangle.

, You want to finish with a strip of paper that has 19 equilateral triangles. If you started with a rectangular strip, be sure to cut off the triangles from the edges—you’ll recognize them as being different because they won’t be equilateral.


Try folding each triangle both ways to make flexing easier later on.

, Flip your strip so that the first triangle is pointing upward. Label this “1.” Your next triangle is pointing downward: label this “2” and the next one “3.” Your next one is once again pointing downward, label it “1.” Continue labeling 1-3 all the way to the 18th triangle. You will have one extra triangle. This won’t get a number., Flip over your strip. Skip the first triangle. The next triangle is pointing upward: label this “4.” The next triangle is also labeled “4.” The next two are both “5” and then the next two are both “6.” Repeat this pattern to the final triangle on your strip.You can color coordinate your triangles if it helps you identify which is which.
The blank triangles are on opposite ends of the strip, on opposite sides.

, Take the first two “4” triangles and fold them into one another. Next, fold the two “5” triangles like this, then “6,” and so on down your entire strip. In effect, you’ve folded a flattened spiral.When you flip it over, your paper should read 1-2-2-3-3-1-1-2-2-3.

, With your strip flipped so that the lower numbers are toward you, find the second set of triangles that read 1-1 and 2-2. Make a fold between the two: you should fold the longer side under so that you’re looking at triangles “2,” “2,” and “3.”, When you made the last fold, you’ll notice that you made a cane shape. The corner of your cane is made up of four adjoining “2” triangles. Under your fourth one, make another fold: once again, folding the “1” toward the back. When you do this, slide the end above the end of the cane to cover the lone “3” triangle.


Your product should now have 6 “2” triangles forming a hexagon and a “1” triangle as an extra flap on the top right of your hexagon.

, Flip your hexagon over. The extra “1” triangle that is attached to the top should have a blank face on the back of it. You’ll see the other blank-faced triangle to the left of it. Fold it down and glue the pieces together.This is your end product. It should have the same outer shape as a hexagon, but have layers within.

, Start by pinching two triangles together along one of the edges. Do the same on the opposite side and push the corners toward each other.

, Take the center of these triangles and open them to reveal the face of your hexaflexagon. If they refuse to open, try pinching an adjacent pair of triangles to loosen the folds., Now that you’ve seen how to open the hexaflexagon, try pinching different sides together to reveal all sides within. Faces 1, 2, and 3 will appear more often than 4, 5, and 6. Color or paste pictures on the six different faces and flex away."

",How to Cut Elegant Paper Snowflakes,"


;
,,,,,,, Stop at this point to make a star/snowflake with a pattern that repeats only three times.




, This will make a 6 pointed snowflake with a pattern that repeats six times.




, These will become the outside edge of your snowflake, so make them as interesting as you like. Cutting one side of the outer edge further away from the center than the other will yield ""points"" that stick out in the manner of a ""real"" snowflake.,

If your scissors begin cutting on one folded side, they must also end cutting on that same side. If you begin on one side and end on the other side, you will suddenly be making a much smaller snowflake.

, Three larger cuts to your snowflake blank will generally yield better results than 10 smaller cuts.,, (Cut away 75-85% of your blank.)

Use smooth, flowing curves for best results at first - This will make achieving the look easier. Attempt cutting the more angular flakes after you've mastered the tips.

Gather your materials.,
Connect the LED light with the battery.,
Cut a piece of tape about 5–6 centimeters (2.0–2.4 in) long, then cut it in half lengthwise.

,
Wrap the piece of tape around the battery to cover and secure the leads of the LED.,
Cut the other half of that piece of tape down to about 2 centimeters (0.8 in) in length.,
Your finished product should look something like this.
",How to Make a LED Flashlight to Draw or Write With1," These are listed in the ""Things You'll Need"" section below.;
, The longer end of the LED light is the positive (anode) end. This must touch the positive (+) end of the lithium 3v battery. The shorter end is the negative (cathode) end. This must touch the negative (-) end of the battery. Connecting these pieces should cause the LED to light up.

,, Make sure the LED is still on.

, Wrap it around the bottom of the LED, being careful that the leads don't touch their opposite battery sides. (The negative lead should not touch the positive side and vice versa.)

Place a ballpoint pen onto the inside of one feather.,
Remove the pen.,
Place the pen back onto the now glued insides of the feathers.,
Allow to dry.",How to Create a Paper Quill," A piece of printer paper is usually a fine choice.;
, Outline a feather shape next to the fold. Draw the outline so that one side of the feather is straight and is formed on the fold, as shown in the image.

, There should be one piece consisting of two feathers, still joined on the fold.

, This step can be as simple or as elaborate as wished; the image shown has recreated feather-like strokes using markers. Other ideas include calligraphy, watercolor paints or pencils, stencilling, stamping or even decoupage.

, The exact positioning will be dependent on the size and length of the ballpoint pen you've chosen; adjust it as needed.

, Spray or adhere glue to both insides of the feather in the area where the pen will be attached.

, Carefully fold the feathers to meet, capturing the pen in the middle. Gently mold the section of the feathers that sit over the pen so that it wraps around the pen as shown.


You can curl or bend the feather a little so that it won't seem so stiff.

, Once dry, the paper quill is ready for use or for wrapping as a gift.

Find a book that is a little thicker than your eReader and about an inch (2.5cm) larger in length and height.,
Remove the inside pages of the book, being careful to preserve the cover and spine.

,
Measure the cover for cutting if your cover is too large for your eReader, and cut the cover.,
Use tape to reinforce the spine and all of the edges.,
Select a fabric or contact paper that you like.,
Place a wide strip of fabric up the inside spine of the book, be sure to fold under the top and bottom of the fabric to hide the edges.,
Cut cardboard panels 1/2"" (1.27cm) larger than the length and height of your eReader.,
Cut two felt, fleece or thin foam panels the same size as above and attach them to your paper board panels with craft glue.,
Cover the panels with the protective material of your choice.,
Add elastic to one panel.,
Use glue to attach each of these panels to the inside of the cover.,
Insert your eReader and flaunt your brand new cover.",How to Make a Book Style eReader Cover," It can be large in length and height, but will need to be cut to size.;
,, The Amazon Kindle used in this demonstration is 7.5"" x 5"" (19cm x 12.5cm), so the cover was cut so that each panel measured 8.5"" x 6"" (21.5cm x 15cm), not including the spine.

, This will also help give the cut edges a smooth finish. If your book is already sized properly, you can still reinforce the edges using this step.

, This is used to cover your 'book'. It doesn't need to be very neat on the inside of the cover as these edges will all be covered up. Try to refrain from leaving lumps of fabric on the inside of the cover and you'll be fine. Hot glue works well to secure the fabric.

, These will be visible.

, (Something with a sturdiness like a cereal box or other product box will work well; standard cardboard will be too thick for this.) The Amazon Kindle used in this demonstration is 7.5"" x 5"" (19cm x 12.5cm), so the two inside panels are 8"" x 5.5"" (21.5cm x 12.5cm).

, These will provide your eReader with some padding and protection.

, No need to be too tidy with the backsides.

, You'll want to use elastic that is approximately 4 inches (10cm) or so in length to each corner of the panel that will be used for the inside of the back cover. Lay the piece of elastic across the corner approx. 1"" (2.5cm) in and wrap the excess elastic behind the panel (as seen in the step above). You can use a sewing machine to attach the elastic or hot glue. Repeat this at all four corners. (This will hold the eReader in place.)


Use the elastic to add loop closure for your case. You can do that now by placing a piece of looped elastic in the middle of the right side of the inner back panel. You can also add a button or other item to loop it over to the front of your cover.

, The panel with the elastic will go on the right. Allow the cover to sit overnight or up to 24 hours to be sure that all of the glue has fully dried.

, You'll have the wonderful feeling of holding a book in your hand and even nicer, this cover can fold backwards while you're reading, should you so choose.

If not, simply measure all the way around the laptop from the hinge side to the opening and then back to the hinge (as opposed to just the top); this will be the length of the fabric. Then, measure the width of the laptop plus each side; this will be the width of the fabric.
, One should be large enough to cover the laptop all the way around plus an inch (2.5 cm) in every direction; this will be the inside layer of the tote. The other should be half an inch (1 cm) larger than the first all around; this will be the outside of the tote. They can be the same colors or different coordinating colors. (If the outside layer is a durable water-resistant kind of fabric, so much the better.)
,,,, Flatten one corner of the bag so that the seam visually “splits” the triangle in half. Then, sew across the corner, keeping the new seam perpendicular to the existing seam (as seen below).

Find a cell phone case that fits your phone.,
Arrange the rhinestones on the back of the phone case.,
Choose and prepare your glue.,
Pick up a rhinestone and coat the back with glue.,
Press the rhinestones back onto the case.,
Continue gluing rhinestones to the case.,
Allow the glue to dry and cure before using the case.",How to Add Bling To Your Cell Phone1," You can use a clear one or a colored one. You will be gluing the rhinestones to this case, then slipping it over your phone. Do not glue the rhinestones directly to your phone.
, You can use rhinestones that are all the same size and color, or you can experiment with different sizes and/or colors. You can even do a simply design, like an initial or heart.

If you are using all the same size, arrange them in staggered rows, like bricks on a wall.
If you are using a variety of sizes, start with the largest ones first, then fill in the gaps with the smaller ones.

, Choose a strong adhesive, such as super glue, E6000, Liquid Nails, Gem Tac, etc. If the glue came with a precision tip, leave it as it is. If the glue came in a bottle or tube, squeeze out a coin-sized dollop onto a disposable plate.

You should do this even if the rhinestones are self-adhesive. The glue on these types of rhinestones is not very strong, and they will fall off if you don't glue them down.

, Use a pair of jewelry tweezers to pick up your first rhinestone. If your glue bottle came with a precision tip, apply a bead of glue to the back of the rhinestone. If you poured the glue out, then dip the back of the rhinestone into the glue., If you need to, use the tips of your tweezers to nudge the rhinestone back into place. Once you are happy with the placement, gently press down on the top of the rhinestones with the tweezers., Do not cover any holes for plugs, cameras, buttons, or speakers; work your way around them instead. You can cover just the back of your phone case, or you can cover the back and sides.

If you are covering the sides, make sure that the rhinestones fit. If they are too big, they'll hang off of the edges and snag onto everything.

, Just because the glue feels dry to the touch does not mean that your case is ready to use. Some types of glues also have a curing time. This can be anywhere between 24 and 72 hours. Check the label on your bottle of glue for more specific drying times."

Find some blingy items to decorate your case with.,
Plan out your design.,
Glue down your pieces one at a time.,
Fill in any gaps with tiny rhinestones or flat-backed pearls.,
Wait for the glue to dry and cure.",How to Add Bling To Your Cell Phone2," Don't get too carried away, however; choose about 3 to 5 blingy items to use as your statement pieces. Brooches, cabochons, and scrapbooking embellishments (such as resin roses) work especially well for this. Choose pieces that go well together, or your phone case will look too cluttered.Use pliers to break off the backs from clip-on earrings, stud earrings, or brooches.

, Arrange the pieces on your phone case, but don't glue them down yet. Again, do not get carried away; you will be filling in the negative space with smaller pearls and rhinestones. Do not cover up any of the holes for the camera, buttons, or microphone., Choose a strong, industrial-strength glue, such as E6000. Pick up one of your embellishments, and squeeze out some glue onto the back. Press the embellishment back into place on the case. Do this for all of the pieces.You can also apply some glue to the case itself, then press the piece into it.

, Squeeze out some of your glue onto a disposable tray or lid. Use a pair of jewelry tweezers to pick up a rhinestone/pearl. Dip the back into the glue, then press it onto the phone case. Fill the rest of your case in a similar manner.Buy rhinestones/pearls that come in a variety of sizes.
Start with the bigger ones first and finish with the smallest.

, Industrial-strength glue typically has both a drying time and a curing time. This can take anywhere between 24 and 72 hours. Check the label on your tube of glue for more specific drying times."

Get a clear case that fits your phone.,
Choose your glitter.,
Coat the back/inside of your phone case with decoupage glue.,
Sprinkle the glitter into the glue.,
Let the glue dry, then tap off the excess glitter.,
Apply another coat of decoupage glue and glitter, if needed.,
Paint the back/inside of the case with acrylic paint.,
Let the paint dry, then seal it.,
Allow the case to dry and cure completely before using it.",How to Add Bling To Your Cell Phone3," The case must be clear as you will be putting the glitter on the inside. If you use an opaque or colored case, the glitter won't show up!, You can use extra-fine glitter, chunky glitter, or even extra-chunky glitter. For a more unique look, try metallic confetti. You can also gather some tinsel or metallic streamers, then cut them at angles into tiny parallelograms., Flip the case over and set it down onto a sheet of wax paper or parchment paper. Use a paintbrush or a foam brush to apply a thin coat of decoupage glue (ie: Mod Podge).Make sure that your decoupage glue has a glossy finish.

, You can always sprinkle all of the glitter onto the case for the ultimate blingy look, but there looks you can try too. Here are some ideas:Sprinkle the glitter sparsely over the case for a starry-night effect.
Create an ombre effect by using more glitter towards one end, and less towards the other.
Focus the glitter on just one section of the case, such as a corner or the center.

, How long the glue takes to dry depends on the brand you used. Most brands will dry in about 20 to 60 minutes, however. Once the glue dries, turn the case on its side, and tap it against the table. Next, turn the case upside down, and shake out any excess glitter., If you went with an ombre or sparse effect, you likely got the coverage you needed the first time around. If you coated your entire case with glitter, a single layer was probably not enough. In this case, brush on another layer of your glue, and add more glitter.Remember to let the glue dry, then shake out any excess glitter.

, Use a brush or foam brush to apply the paint right over the glitter. This will create a background to help the glitter really stand out. Black or white are great options.If you covered your entire case with glitter, choose a color that matches the glitter instead.

, Once the paint has dried (about 20 minutes), apply a final coat of your decoupage glue on top. This will seal the inside of your case completely and protect it against scratches.You can also use a good-quality varnish or sealer for this step, if you prefer.

, How long this takes depends on the type of decoupage glue or sealer you used. Read the label carefully. Just because something feels dry to the touch does not mean that it is ready to use. Most sealers will have a curing time, and will be ready in about 24 to 72 hours.

Putting the case on before it dries can cause the glue to stick to your phone.

Blocking mats are more expensive than normal mats. You can place your work on a soft mat, such as a yoga mat. It doesn't make any difference.

, Apply the pins all over your work, until you are satisfied with how it looks. However, be sure to apply the pins straight, because once you block your work, you can't undo anything.

If you are blocking a scarf, using the pins, you can take the edges of the scarf to uncurl them and pin them on so they stretch.
You can get as carried away as you want––apply as many pins as you like. However, make sure you like how your work looks before letting it dry. Once you block it, you can't undo anything.

Secure the tails to the craft or to each other.",How to Make Yarn Eyeballs," Make the length about half the diameter, so if the straw is a quarter inch from edge to edge, make the segment an eighth inch. This isn't precise, so you can make your best guess. Cut as many equal-length segments as you want eyes and make the length consistent.
,, Leave a long tail, about the width of your hand. It will make the project easier to handle and give you something to use to secure the eyeball to your creation., Pull it snug, keeping a bit of tension on the tail. Don't pull so tight that the straw collapses.,, You may go around the straw multiple times.,





 Tails in back and one sideways stitch.

This leaves the original tail in back and a new tail out the side, plus one stitch going sideways across the center of the eye. Leave it pointing out the side if you plan to attach the side of the eyeball to the craft.




 Under one more loop (optional).

If you want to attach the back of the eyeball to the craft, instead, work through one more loop of thread towards the back.
Leave the tapestry needle on the eyeball for now. It will help you attach it later.

,, Leave a little tail here, too., On the last couple stitches, run the needle back under the stitches to create a knot and hold the stitches in place.,
Optionally, instead of just trimming the ends at this point, you could work the tails up through the center of the other color, so that the tails end up at the back of the eyeball.

,

If this is a side-mount eye (shown), cut the back tails short, leaving the side tails long.
If this is a back-mount eye, tie all the tails together at the back and leave them long.

, Note that you will probably have to do this before the head is stuffed, while you can still reach both sides of the fabric., Tie them tightly and, if needed, trim them short."

If in doubt, start with a card that's a little wider than you want. You can always trim the ends shorter later.;
, The number of loops, along with the thickness of the string, determines the thickness of the tassel., Fold this second piece in half., There should be no need to use a needle.

Start spinning.",How to Card Angora Fiber," Look for hand carders that have fine needles and carding cloth.;
, Don't take too much; judge how much is good to handle by the size of your carders and your own ability.

, Start on the bottom of one carder brush. Gradually add the angora fiber to the base of one carder brush and build up the amount.

, Fill in the rest of the hand carder brush.

, Start at the bottom and begin passing across the carded fiber from the first carder to the second carder. You will be transferring the angora fiber completely onto the other carder.

, As you are transferring the fiber from one carder to the other, the goal is to really line up the fibers together, in straight rows. Make sure that they are all parallel to each other.

, You should pass the angora fiber between the carders at least three times. When you have a good quality fiber to start with, three times should be sufficient; lesser quality fiber may require more passing.

, Once you start getting close to finishing the carding, check the length of the small fibers. They should be at least 3"" / 7.5 centimeter (3.0 in) in length. That makes the yarn easier to spin, more uniform and better overall.

, Once the fiber is the right length, and very smooth, it is ready to remove from the carder brush for use.

Lay down the carder brush.






Have the fiber facing up.






Take the bottom fiber (opposite to handle side of the carder brush) and roll the fiber off in the direction of the handle.







, Repeat as many times with new clumps of fiber as needed to complete your project.

, When you've made enough to fill your bobbins, commence spinning your yarn.

Make a hat block.,
Cover the hat block with saran wrap.,
Cut the felt into 2 circles.,
Form the top of your felt hat.,
Make a felt hat brim.,
Attach the felt hat brim to the crown.,
Using either heavy-duty silk or wool thread, sew the brim to the crown, permanently securing the crown and brim together.",How to Make a Felt Hat," This will provide you a base onto which you will shape your felt hat.

Glue several pieces of styrofoam blocks together. You may need as many as 3 or 4, depending on how big you want your hat to be. Allow the glue to dry before proceeding.



 


Carve your hat block out of the styrofoam. The size and shape of the felt hat you wish to make will determine the block's size and should be at least the size of your head. The hat block will determine the size and shape of the crown of your felt hat.






Coat the styrofoam hat block with white glue with a 1 inch (2.54 cm) paintbrush. Allow the glue on the block to dry before moving on to the next step.





;
, This will keep the inside of your felt hat clean. Pin the wrap at the bottom of the block using T-pins. Secure the saran wrap further by wrapping a rubber band at the pin line.

, Each circle should have a diameter 3 inches (7.62 cm) wider than the widest part of the styrofoam hat block.

, To do this, you will be stretching the felt over the styrofoam hat block.


Soak the felt in water. The felt should be completely wet, as opposed to marginally damp.






Center the wet felt on the hat block. Secure it with a T-pin at the center to keep it in place.






Stretch the felt over the hat block. Do so gently, so as to not damage the felt. As you stretch it, place T-pins evenly around the base of the styrofoam hat block.






Remove the top T-pin from the felt and styrofoam hat block. Leave the T-pins around the base intact for now.






Stretch the felt again, pulling harder. Continue to stretch your felt hat, placing T-pins every inch or so. When this step is complete, the amount of felt below the pin line should be even. Wrap a rubber band at the pin line to further secure the felt.






Coat the felt with white glue using a 1 inch paintbrush (2.54 cm).






Wet the second circle of felt before placing it over the first. Repeat the steps to stretch the second circle. Do not coat the second circle with glue after it is stretched. Allow the crown of the felt hat to dry.






Remove the felt crown from the hat block. With a pair of scissors, trim the excess felt off of the bottom.







,

Cut out 2 pieces of felt of the same size for your brim. No matter the size you want the brim to be, add 2 inches (5.08 cm) to your measurement.






Dampen each piece of felt for the brim. Coat 1 with white glue. Press them together to form a double layer, using a hot iron. Be sure to first cover the felt with a press cloth to protect it from the heat of the iron.






Cut a circular hole in the center of the brim. The whole should be 1 inch (2.54 cm) wider in diameter than the base of the felt hat crown.







, Put the crown back onto the hat block and pull the brim down over it. Secure the brim with T-pins.

, Remove the T-pins.

Tuck half of the beanie into the other, leaving you with a beautiful beanie.",How to Make a Fleece Beanie Hat," You can buy fleece in a variety of colors, patterns and thicknesses. Choose your fleece according to needed warmth and personal style, using whatever patterns and colors you want.


You can choose accessories such as buttons, sequins or gems to add later if you'd like.;
, Most adult heads are approximately 21 to 23 inches (53.3 to 58.4 cm) around. Fleece has some stretch to it, so you should be able to use a 23-inch (58.4-cm) hat pattern for most people.

, You want the stretch of the fabric to run across the width of your head, so that it will fit tightly. Check which direction the fabric stretches, too. What direction does it naturally pull towards?


This is also going to show you where the back side of the fleece is -- if you stretch the fleece between two hands, the fabric will naturally curl towards the backside (the side touching your head) of the fleece., You'll need a pattern to help you cut the right shapes and sizes out of your fabric. Search for ""fleece beanie pattern"" online and check out the shapes that you like. There are often subtle variations between hats, and this is your chance to choose the exact design you want.


Make sure your print it ""to size."" Do not print it to ""fit page,"" as the actual size of the pattern is crucial! Print at 100% or ""actual size."" They often provide a 1-inch square on the design that you can check with a ruler.
Most fleece beanie patterns differ slightly in their construction. They will have 4 side panels and a bottom band. Some patterns will allow you to work from one piece, while others will separate the fleece into up to five pieces.

, The following measurements provide more than enough fleece to make your hat from. Cut a rectangle of fleece that is approximately 23 inches (58.4 cm) wide by 12 inches (30.5 cm) tall. Reduce the measurements to 19 inches (48.3 cm) wide or 21 inches (53.3 cm) wide for a toddler or smaller adult, respectively.


When in doubt, leave a 1/2 inch of excess -- you can always cut it later, but it can make construction easier.

, Across the width means folding it like a sandwich, not like a hotdog bun. (14.6 cm by 30.5 cm). You should have a long, doubled up rectangle of fabric.

, Make sure that the point of the beanie aligns with the top of the longer side (30.5-cm). There will be a long horizontal line through the pattern, usually labeled ""stretch."" This line needs to be lined up with the natural stretch of the fabric, found earlier.

, Repeat on another stretch of fabric, preferably close to the first cut, so that you have 4 total domed pieces.


Make sure the pattern doesn't move on the fabric as you cut. Pinning it down with sewing needles is a good way to keep everything straight. Use at least two pins, if so.

, If you want a solid colored beanie, cur out four more domes from the same fleece. Simply repeat the process above with a new fabric for a reversible hat.


By now, you should have at least eight pieces of fabric in the dome-like beanie shape.

, Some patterns simply attach the domed pieces into a beanie, but that classic ""lip"" of a beanie is easy to add. This will be a rectangular piece of pattern, which you cut right at the fold in your fleece. This leads to one piece of fabric that is twice as long as your pattern, but folded in half so that it appears the same size. You will need two of these.


Remember to cut half in one pattern, half in the other pattern, if you're making a reversible hat.

, When finished cutting, you should have a total of 10 pieces of fabric:


8 pieces of dome shaped fabric.

4 in one color, 4 in another.


2 long pieces for the trim.

1 in one color, 1 in another.



, You will want to sew on the side that will be the inside of your hat. Remember that you can stretch the fabric to find what side is the back if it is not obvious. The side the fabric curls towards, when stretched, is the back.

, You want the good sides facing each other. Follow the curve with your sewing machine (1/4 inch seam allowance) to attach the two pieces, almost like a book. Use a straight stitch.


Make sure the overlap goes wrong-side-out, on the side that will soon be the inside of your hat. You will need to feed your fabric through the machine in a curved motion so that it follows the dome shape.

, When you get to the last side, pin the sides together and sew from the bottom of the hat to the top of the last dart tip. You should end up with four sewed together pieces.

, Take two of your book-like domes and place them together, good sides touching. Then pin them at the top, matching along the center seam. Try to make sure the seams both face the opposite way to prevent getting bulky. Do this with all four books, so you end up with two sets of matching fabrics pinned together.

, This will finally attach each of the four pieces of matching fabric into a ""mini-beanie."" Simply sew along the entire long edge of the dome, using the same 1/4 inch seam allowance, and a straight stitch. Repeat with the other set of fabric, leaving your two small beanies.

, Measure and fold a 3-inch (7.3-cm) hem at the bottom of your hat. You will now make the band at the bottom of your hat.

, Touch the shorter sides together, matching them up perfectly, then sew the two short ends together so you end up with a fabric ring. Repeat with the other hem piece.

, Wrap the ring of fabric around your hat, lining up the seam of the ring with one of the hat's seams. Pin it here and on the opposite side. Then use as many pins as you need to match up the edges, lining them up so you can sew them cleanly.


You want the good side of the hat fabric to be touching the good side of the hem fabric. Remember to stretch to check if need be.

, You may need to remove the sewing table extension, making it easier to sew in a circle. Use the same 1/4 inch straight seam, and slowly sew all the way around the bottom edge of the hat and ring to attach them.


Repeat with the opposite hat and hem as well.
For a little extra fun, mix up the fabrics -- use the hem from one fleece with the hat from the other.

, There is one place on each hat where the seam of the hat and hem are lined up. Press these seams together, then flip one hat over the other one so that they are nested in each other, like stacked plastic cups.

, This is your opening to allow the hat to flip successfully. Pin and sew the two hats together just like you sewed the hem onto the bottom of the hat. This time, however, you need to leave about 2"" of the edge unsewed, allowing you to pull it out easily.

, You'll end up with a weird, bean-shaped fabric oval. Reach into the opening with your fingers and gently pull the fabric back through.

, Push half of the oval into the other half, leaving you with your finished beanie! Stitch together the little opening you made to finish the edge and prevent it from unraveling.

Decorate your hat (optional).",How to Make a Paper Hat1," You can use a different kind of paper, but it will need to be about as big as a newspaper page in order to fit most heads. Newspaper also tends to be easier to fold that construction paper or printer paper.







;
, Your newspaper page should have two creases in it--one vertical crease running down the spine of the section, and one horizontal, where the section is folded in half. Make sure the vertical crease is closed, and position it at the top of your work space. Your piece of paper should now be lying horizontal.








, The shorter fold in the newspaper should now be running vertically. There should be a diagonal crease along the edge of the paper where you folded it down.








, This should create the same diagonal crease on the opposite side of the paper.









, You should only fold the top layer. Fold the edge up by about 2 or 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm).








, Fold the bottom up so that it matches the fold you made with the bottom of the front side of the paper.









, Start with the left outside edge. Fold it in 2 or 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm) toward the center of the hat. Then, fold in the right outside edge in. Make the fold the same width as the first outside edge you folded.








Adjust to fit. The distance between the outside edges can be adjusted, more or less, to fit your head.


, You can tape the outside edges down. Alternatively, you can fold up the bottom edge of the paper so that the outside edges are pinned down by the bottom fold.








, You may need to pop the inside out with your hand. Place the hat on your head.








, Add colors, glitter or other embellishments to your hat.

, From the incision, cut an oval shape out of the center of the hat. Make your oval a little smaller than you think it will need to be to fit around your head. You can always make your oval larger, but you will have to start over if you make it too large to begin with.








, Doing this will give your hat a visor shape. If you would prefer to have a circular hat, you can leave the back rim intact.








, Put some glue on one side of the cut and place it on top of the other side of the cut. Overlap them as much or as little as you want, depending on the size of your head. Hold the two sides together and let the glue dry.







, You can use one color for the whole thing, one color for the bottom and one for the top, or give you hat stripes--the design is really up to you! Allow the paint to dry before adding any other directions.








, Spray the hat with glitter, add pom poms, or cut out Styrofoam flowers and glue them on--the options are limitless.

Staple the hat together at the base.,
Apply glue along the seam when the hat fits.,
Decorate your hat.",How to Make a Paper Hat3," You should use a colorful piece of paper to make the hat more festive.








, To make a small hat, the length of the bottom of the hat should be 6 to 8 inches (15 - 20.5 cm) long (this is a good size for a birthday party hat). A medium hat should have a 9 to 10 inch (23-25.5 cm) base (this is a good size for a clown hat). A large hat should be 11 inches (28 cm) or more (for a wizard or witch hat).








If you do not have a compass, use a pencil tied to a piece of string.


, Make sure to follow along the pencil line you have created.








, It should have a point at the top and circular base at the bottom. Estimate how large the circular bottom should be by placing it on your head and adjusting the overlap of the two sides.









You can also lay the bottom against a flat surface and estimate what size you think would fit your head.

, Place it on your head to make sure it fits. If it is too small or large, take the staple out being careful not to rip the paper. Re-staple so that the hat fits better.







, Hold the edges together while the glue dries. Allow the glue to dry fully. You can remove the bottom staple once the glue has dried is so desired.








, Cut out designs from other construction paper and glue them onto the hat. Add sparkles or draw designs with markers. Glue a pom pom to the very top of the hat for a festive look.

Glue the buckle onto the hat.",How to Make a Leprechaun Hat2," Cut out a 3-inch by 2-inch (7.6-cm by 5-cm) rectangle from yellow construction paper. Cut out another rectangle inside of it to create a hollow buckle shape.The remaining outline should be between 1/2 inch to 1 inch (1.25 cm to 2.5 cm) thick all the way around. Keep the remaining edge evenly wide at all points.
Do not cut through the edge when cutting out the center. Pierce the center of the rectangle with your scissors or, if necessary, cut the center out using a craft knife or utility knife.
To make things as even as possible, draw the outline using a pencil and ruler before cutting it out.
The center piece can be discarded after you cut it out. Only the outline needs to remain.

, Apply a thin coat of school glue to one side of the paper buckle. Shake gold glitter over the glue and let dry.


For an even coating, apply the glue using a glue stick. Alternatively, you could also apply dots or lines of liquid glue and spread the glue out evenly with an old paintbrush or the tip of your finger.
Shake off the excess glitter after you apply it.

, Use scissors to cut a standard sheet of green construction paper in half, creating two skinny rectangles.


If you are uncertain about where the halfway mark is, fold the paper in half lengthwise or “hotdog style” Unfold and cut along the crease mark.
Alternatively, if you want a taller hat, you can skip this step and use the entire sheet of construction paper for the body of the hat.
If you do divide the paper in half, set one half aside and only work with the other half from this point on.

, Carefully draw a straight line along the bottom of one of the green halves. Color this bottom portion in with black marker, crayon, or colored pencil.


If you want to create an even bad, use a ruler and a pencil to lightly draw a straight line across one entire long edge of the green rectangle. The bad should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick all the way around.

, Apply glue along one short edge of the paper. Bring the other edge around so that it overlaps the glue-edge, forming a cylinder. Press the two edges in place and let dry.


The paper should face up, with the black band visible, when you apply the glue to one edge. The edge that overlaps this glue-edge should touch the glue from the backside of the paper, though.

, Place the cylinder on top of another sheet of green construction paper. Draw a circle around the cylinder that is roughly 2 inches (5 cm) wider than the cylinder itself. Cut this circle out with scissors.


If you need help making this first circle, you could trace the mouth of an upside-down bowl or similarly round surface. Just make sure that the diameter of the object you trace is larger than the diameter of the cylinder by about 2 inches (5 cm) or more.

, Place the cylinder on top of the circle again. Trace around it exactly this time, making sure that this second inside circle is the same size as the opening of the cylinder. Cut this circle out with scissors.


Avoid making the circumference of the circle smaller than that of the cylinder, since a circle that is too small will fall through when placed on the top of the cylinder.
Avoid making the circumference of the circle larger than that of the cylinder, as well, since doing so will cause the center of the ring to becomes too large, making it impossible to fit it onto the edge of the cylinder.

, Use glue or tape to attach the smaller green circle to the top of the hat.


Place circle on your work surface and set the cylinder on top of it. Tape the two pieces together, attaching the tape to the inside of the cylinder rather than the outside.
If using glue, you will need to lay the circle on your work surface and draw a thin line of glue around the edge. Set the cylinder on top so that it dips into the glue.

, Use glue or tape to attach the green ring to the bottom of the hat.


With the hat still upside-down, place the ring on top. Tape the two pieces together, attaching the tape to the inside of the cylinder and the bottom of the brim.
If using glue, place the ring on your work surface and carefully apply a line of glue around the inner edge. Set the cylinder on top so that it dips into the glue.

, Apply a thin coat of glue to the paper buckle. Press the buckle onto the black strip at the bottom of the hat and let dry.


Preferably, the seam of the hat should face the back, and the buckle should be directly across from the seam at the front of the hat.
This concludes the paper leprechaun hat.

Note that a ravel-resistant fabric is recommended for this project. If you can find a sturdy fabric, like felt, that works even better.
The original instructions for this hat are designed to work with small children. For an adult-sized hat, you may need an initial circle that is roughly 18 inches (45.7 cm) in diameter.

, Cut a small circle out of your original circle. The diameter of this circle should roughly match to diameter of the wearer's head.


To find the diameter of the wearer's head, wrap a tape measure around the part on which the hat will sit. Divide this number by pi, or 3.14, and round up to the nearest half inch to determine the right diameter for the hat.

, Use the same green fabric used for the circles. The length of the rectangle should roughly match the circumference of the smaller circle with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of extra material for a seam allowance. The width should be about 12 inches (30.5 cm).


The circumference of the smaller circle is also the same measurement as the circumference of your head.
For an adult-sized hat, you may wish to consider upping the width of the fabric to 18 inches (45.7 cm) for a more balanced hat.

, If you are using a fabric that is somewhat flimsy, place iron-on interfacing on the back side of the fabric and iron in place until bonded.


Note this step is not necessary if you are using a thick fabric, like felt, that is durable to stand on its own.
When using iron-on interfacing, cut out a sheet of interfacing that matches the dimensions of the body rectangle. Apply the iron-on side, which should be clearly marked, to the wrong side of the fabric and iron in place, passing the iron over the interfacing firmly and securely so that it does not peel up or shift in place as you iron it. Once cool, simply peel off the paper backing.

, Fold the rectangular piece of fabric in half widthwise, with the wrong side facing out, and pin in place. Stitch a straight stitch along the open end of the fabric, roughly 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) in from the edge.


If using a sewing machine, a simple straight stitch will work fine. If handsewing, try using a backstitch to give the thread a little more durability.

, With the wrong side still facing out, and the wrong side of the small circle facing up, pin the circle to one open end of the cylinder. Stitch in place.


The right sides of the fabric should not be visible to you at this present moment, but they should all face one another.
If using a sewing machine, a simple straight stitch will work fine. If handsewing, try using a backstitch to give the thread a little more durability.

, Turn the hat upside-down and right side out. Pin the inside of the ring to the remaining open edge of the hat and stitch in place.


If the outer edge of the ring threatens to fray, you can hem it or apply fray check to stop the threads from unraveling.
If using a sewing machine, a simple straight stitch will work fine. If handsewing, try using a running stitch so that the rim is a little floppier and more whimsical.

, Use sturdy, ravel-resistant fabric like felt and cut out a rectangle that is 4 inches by 5.5 inches (10 cm by 14 cm). Cut out a second rectangle from the center of this rectangle, making an outline that is roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick.


If the edges threaten to fray, you can hem them with a needle and thread or apply fray check to the edges.

, The strip of black fabric should be about 4 inches (10 cm) wide and the same length as your original body rectangle.


Use sturdy, ravel-resistant fabric, like felt.
If the edges threaten to fray, you can hem them with a needle and thread or apply fray check to the edges.

, Sew or glue the yellow buckle piece onto the center of the black band.


Try to place the center of the buckle directly over the center of the band. This “belt” portion of the hat should be fairly symmetrical.
You can hand stitch the buckle piece in place or hold it together using fabric glue.

, Sew or glue the black band around the bottom of the hat, just about the brim.


The band should almost lie flush against the rim of the hat. Bring the back edges together at the back edge of the hat, allowing them to overlap.
You can hand stitch the belt in place or hold it together using fabric glue.

Measure the size of your hat.,
Make a sheet of duct tape fabric.,
Form the duct tape sheet into a cylinder.,
Make the top of the hat.,
Make the brim of the top hat.,
Finished.








",How to Make a Duct Tape Top Hat," Fold a long strip of duct tape in half lengthwise so that there are no sticky areas. Wrap the strip loosely around your head and mark where it overlaps. Alternatively, use a measuring tape and record the inches (cm).






;
, This will form the upper section of the hat. It should measure the same length as the strip you wrapped around your head (or your recorded measurement). The width will determine the height of your top hat, and is variable depending on your preference, such as 10 inches (25 cm).









To make the fabric, lay down strips of the tape sticky side up. Overlap the pieces lengthwise by about a 1/4 inch (.6 cm). Cover the sheet with another layer of tape sticky side down to make a full sheet that is smooth on both sides. Smooth the tape firmly as you work to avoid air pockets or wrinkles.

, Bring together the shorter sides and tape them together.








,









Make another sheet of duct tape fabric large enough to cover the hole in the cylinder with about 2 extra inches (5 cm) on the edges of the circle.
Place the cylinder on the duct tape sheet and trace around it.
Draw a second circle around the first that is 2 inches (5 cm) larger on all sides. Cut out the larger circle.
Make about 8 to 10 equally-spaced cuts from the edge of the sheet to the edges of the smaller circle.
Fold the strips toward the center of the circle. Place the circle over the opening of the cylinder with the strips on the inside. From the opposite opening, tape the strips down to the inside of the cylinder.

,
Using a piece of cardboard large enough to accommodate the brim, trace the shape of the cylinder onto the center.













Draw a second circle around the first at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) wider on all sides, just as you did with the top, but larger. Cut out the larger circle.













Cut a small hole in the center of the cardboard.
From the center, cut 8 to 10 equally-spaced strips from the center hole to the edges of the smaller circle. This will create the hole for your head.













Fold the strips upward and tape them to the inside of the cylinder.













Cover the top and bottom of the brim with duct tape.

Find a sheet of newspaper.,
Fold your paper in half horizontally.,
Bring the corners to the center.,
Fold the bottoms of the paper up.,
Add decorations to your finished pirate hat.",How to Make a Pirate Hat2," Unfold the sheet of newspaper and spread it out on a flat surface. Make sure you have enough room to work.A solid sheet of newspaper makes for a large pirate hat. If you'd like a smaller hat, try cutting off about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from one of the edges., Keep the corners matched up so your hat is nice and even. Run your finger along the fold to make a good crease in your paper.








If you're working with kids, try telling them to fold ""hamburger"" style to make sure they get the fold right.

, Take the top right corner of the paper and bring it to the center of the newspaper making a triangle. Do the same thing with the other corner.








You should have two triangles now, with the vertical edges lined up in the middle of the paper. For a good hat, try to keep the edges straight. Make good creases when you have everything lined up the way you want it.Add some tape to the triangles if they start to unfold., You should now have a piece of paper that looks roughly like a pirate hat, except for two bottom flaps. Fold one bottom flap up to the bottom edge of the triangles, and tape it down to secure it.








Turn the hat over, and do the same with the remaining bottom flap.

, Your pirate hat is almost finished. The only thing left to do is decorate it. Draw a skull and crossbones on the hat, or print one out and glue it on.You could also draw a skull and crossbones on a piece of poster board. Cut out the design and then glue it on to your hat.

Decorate your cap.",How to Make a Pirate Hat4," To make a tri-corner pirate hat, you will need the following:A pencil
Twist ties
Scissors
Glue
A bowl about the size of your head
A ruler or other straight edge
Brown wrapping paper or a grocery bag

, Cut a strip of paper about 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide that can wrap around the rim of the bowl with 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) extra so the strip overlaps itself.








Don't worry if you have to glue 2 smaller pieces of paper together to form your band., You'll need enough paper to make two rather large cuts to form the top of the hat and the brim. Cut the first square to about 16 inches (40.6 cm) square and the second piece to about 24 inches (61.0 cm) square.








If you want to add a leathery texture to your hat, soak the pieces of paper in water and wad them up. Remove them from the water and flatten them out to let them dry overnight. Be careful not to rip your paper if you try this!, Place the bowl upside down on a table, and place the smaller of the two squares on top of it. Begin shaping the paper over the bowl by carefully pressing the paper down and around the rim of the bowl.







, Once you've pressed the paper over the bowl, glue your 2 inches (5.1 cm) strip of paper around the base of the bowl to form the hat band.








You may have to use a lot of glue to properly secure the band to the bowl., When the glue from the hat band is dry, cut away the excess paper beneath the hat band. Leave a little extra to tuck under the bowl of the hat.








To make cutting easier, slide the bowl over to the edge of a table and rotate the bowl as you cut.Once you've cut away all the excess paper, remove the bowl. Test the fit of the cap by placing it on your head. If the cap is too large, crumple it some more and try adding another band for more support. If the cap is too small, you'll have to start over with another bowl., Take the larger piece of paper and draw a vertical line down the center of the square. Make a mark about 20.75 inches (52.7 cm) from the bottom of the paper. Draw diagonal lines from the mark down to the corners to form a triangle.








Once you've measured the triangle, cut it out.Make a mark halfway down the side of each triangle. Draw a line to the opposite corner of each mark to make two smaller triangles.Using the bowl as a guide, trace a circle in the center of the triangle. You should now have a circle with six small triangles in the center of the large triangle.Draw three lines in the circle to cut each of the six triangles in half, making twelve triangles.Cut the inner triangles so that they spike up, but are still attached to the paper. Fold them upward until they resemble a crown., Apply some glue to the twelve triangles and secure them to the inside of the cap. You may have to use a lot of glue to get them to stick. Don't worry if you make a mess, as this is the inside of the cap and you won't be able to see it in the final product.








Let the glue dry completely before continuing., Fold each of the points on the brim to the center of the hat. The tip of each point should just touch the base of the cap. Make a crease on each of the folds and cut the points off.








Round off the corners by cutting away the straight edges left from removing the tips. You should have three rounded triangles on your brim.Wrap the rounded corners around a pencil and roll them up to the base of the hat. When you remove the pencil you should have a corner that stays slightly rolled.You can even roll the tips of each corner if you like, to add even more character to your hat. To do this, use your pencil and roll the tips in the opposite direction.At this point, you should start to see the pirate hat coming together.

, Wrap a twist tie around the eraser end of the pencil and twist it a few times. You should have a loop and two ends. Remove the twist tie from the pencil. Do this three times.








Line up the brim a little higher than the cap and make a hole through them. Run the straight ends of your twist tie through the hole. Turn the hat over and flatten the two ends to secure the tip of the brim to the cap. Do this for the other brim tips., You should now have a solid tri-corner pirate hat. Add a skull and crossbones if you like, or some buttons. You can even decorate the hat band, though most of it is hidden by the rest of the hat.Glue a few real buttons over the brim connectors to give your pirate hat a more authentic feel."

Check care tags before getting started.,
Test the cleaning procedure on a less visible area.,
Use a baby wipe.,
Mix soap and water.,
Apply water and baking soda.",How to Clean Saffiano Leather1," Before you choose a cleaning method, check for care tags attached to your Saffiano bag, jacket, or other product. These care tags often have recommended methods for cleaning Saffiano leather. If present, follow these directions and only use an alternate method if the recommended method proves ineffective., Whether you’re cleaning a handbag, a coat, or some other Saffiano leather product, there is always a chance that the cleaning method you’ve selected does more harm than good. To be sure you won’t damage your Saffiano leather, test your cleaning method of choice by applying it to a section of leather that won’t be visible.For instance, if you’re cleaning a Saffiano leather passport jacket, test your cleaning method on the inside of the jacket rather than the outside, where the area you really want to clean is.
When testing, check the surface of your cleaning cloth, sponge, or cotton swab regularly to see if you’re removing any color from the leather. If you are, find an alternate cleaning method.

, Baby wipes are perfect for cleaning Saffiano leather for the same reason they are good for cleaning babies: they are gentle and won’t cause damage when applied. You could use baby wipes to clean your Saffiano leather with gentle, circular motions. Alternately, you could rub the baby wipe in one direction across the surface of your Saffiano leather until it is clean., If a baby wipe didn’t quite do the job, you could try soap and water. Mix a few drops of liquid soap with about two cups (240 milliliters) of warm distilled water. Mix them together with a few gentle stirs and dip a sponge or soft hand towel into the water.With your sponge or towel damp (but not soaking wet), gently wipe the leather’s surface.
Use a dry sponge or hand towel to remove any excess liquid once you’ve cleaned the leather to your satisfaction.
Do not use tap water. The chlorine content could damage your Saffiano leather.

, If both baby wipes and soapy water have failed, try to clean your Saffiano leather with a baking soda mixture. Mix one tablespoon of baking soda with ½ cup (120 milliliters) water. Dip a hand towel or dry cloth into the mixture and gently rub the spot you wish to clean in a circular motion, or wipe the area with continuous wipes in one direction."

Apply rubbing alcohol to remove your leather’s shine.,
Apply acetone nail polish remover to remove dye.,
Use powered cleaners to get a faded look.",How to Dull Leather1," Put some rubbing alcohol in an empty spray bottle. Use the bottle to spray a light layer of alcohol all over your leather piece. You want the item to be damp but not drenched. Allow the alcohol to dry to give your leather a duller, weathered look.You can use a toothbrush dipped in rubbing alcohol to apply it to hard-to-reach spots.;
, Acetone can lighten or even remove dyes that have been used to color your leather. Pour a small amount of acetone nail polish remover on a soft cloth, and rub the cloth over any spots you want lightened. Focus on areas that would naturally fade in color, such as the bottom corners of bags or the elbow creases of jackets.This technique will work differently depending on the quality and color of the dye. If your piece has been heavily dyed rather than just receiving a surface dye, you may not be able to completely remove the color. Darker colors may not fade as well as lighter ones.

, Dampen the leather with a slightly wet cloth. Then put enough powder on the piece to create a paste. Scrub it into the leather using a soft-bristled brush, and then leave it on for about an hour. Remove the paste with a damp cloth and dry the leather.Powdered cleaners with bleach are best. These will remove layers of both dye and gloss from your leather. Don’t apply pure bleach to your leather, as it’s too strong in its undiluted form.
If you want to scratch up your leather as you do this, use a wire brush instead.
To darken your leather back up, apply some shoe polish. This will let you keep the aged quality while also restoring some of the color you’ve removed.

Take your leather to a professional if it is experiencing red rot.",How to Clean Old Leather," Knowing the type of leather you have will help you select the correct cleaning product. Natural or untreated leather does not have a protective coating, while treated leathers do. You can tell that your leather is untreated if it's soft to the touch and doesn't feel like it has a plastic coating.Untreated and natural leathers may change color after you clean them.
Treated or coated leather is easier to clean.;
, Use a cloth or soft brush to wipe off any initial dirt, dust, or oils that may have built up on the leather. Go over the entirety of the leather surface with the cloth and go in small circular motions in areas that are especially dirty.Regularly dusting your leather will keep it looking clean for a longer period of time.

, The type of leather you're trying to clean will help determine which soap or cleaning solution you need to use. For instance, if you are cleaning old leather shoes or an old leather saddle, you can use saddle soap. Remember to always read the instructions on the back of the packaging when using any leather cleaner.Methylated spirits is a common cleanser used to restore antique leather.Saddle soap or a cellulose-based cleaner like Cellugel can help you clean your old leather books without damaging them.For leather jackets and handbags, a solution of mild dish soap and water or leather wipes will work., Go over the entirety of your leather in small, circular motions. Make sure to rub the soap in especially damaged areas of the leather., The leftover cleaning solution can damage leather and cause extreme drying. Use a separate, clean cloth to remove all of the soap from the leather., Allow the leather to air dry for one or two hours. Do not use heat to dry leather because it can cause excessive drying and can weaken and crack it., If your leather is flaking or cracking, do not agitate the leather or you may rip it. Instead, lightly dust the leather item with a dry cotton cloth, feather duster, or soft brush.Typically you'll need to dilute leather cleaner with water before you use it.

, Dip a cotton swab into olive oil or baby oil and apply the oil to scratches or cracks on your leather. Allow the oil to sit for at least five minutes before buffing it into the leather. This should remove some lighter scratches. Let the oil dry before moving onto the next step.Do not use oil on natural leather or you may affect the patina or color in the leather.

, Purchase a leather conditioner such as mink oil, leather honey, or neatsfoot. Add a dollop of the leather conditioner to a clean cloth and rub it into your leather. Before going over the entire item, test a small area to see how it changes the leather's color. Use small, circular motions when doing this. Go over the entirety of the leather's surface so that the coloring is even., Before using or handling your leather, make sure that the conditioner fully dries. Following the proper storage will help keep your leather looking clean for a longer time.


Do not apply direct heat to the leather or it could cause cracking.

, Bending old leather could cause it to crack and break. If you are storing your old leather item, make sure it's on a flat surface that supports the leather's shape., Treat spills and stains immediately with a leather cleaner. The longer the stain sits, the harder it is to get out.

, This will help prevent additional cracking in your leather. It will also keep dust and dirt from settling on the leather. If you are storing things like shoes or gloves, stuffing them with polyester batting or unbuffered tissue paper will help the items retain their shape and will prevent cracking., Wear cotton or nitrile gloves when cleaning or handling your antique leather item. You can purchase these gloves at a department store or online. Wearing gloves will prevent the oils, dirt, and moisture from your hands from being transferred onto the leather., Red rot is a condition that breaks down the structure of old leather. This will usually look like peeling and cracking over the entire surface of the leather. Cleaning leather that is experiencing red rot is difficult if you don't want to damage and devalue the item. A professional will have the equipment and materials to restore your leather item."

Use rubbing alcohol.,
Make a paste.,
Use specialty stain removers.,
Take your leather product to a specialist.",How to Clean Saffiano Leather2," Dab a cotton ball in rubbing alcohol. Pat the Saffiano leather with the cotton ball where you wish to clean it. Do not rub or wipe the cotton all across the leather’s surface or you might cause the color to rub off. After about 15 minutes, when the leather is dry, soak the cotton ball again and gently wipe the spot you previously dabbed.Add a small amount of hand cream to a cotton ball. Rub the cotton ball into the spot you’ve been cleaning.
Use a dry cotton ball to remove excess hand cream.
You can use this method to effectively remove ink from Saffiano leather, but instead of applying hand cream at the end, turn your blow dryer on the lowest setting and use it to dry the spot where you applied the alcohol.

, Mix cream of tartar and lemon juice in equal parts to make a paste. For instance, you might mix one tablespoon of lemon juice and one tablespoon of cream of tartar. Rub the paste on the stain and let it sit for 10 minutes. Remove the paste with a rag dampened with distilled water and moisturizing soap.Dry the leather with a dry, soft cloth or paper towel.

, If you have a serious stain that cannot be easily removed using any of the prior methods, you might need to turn to a specialized stain remover. These are readily available from many big box stores and online. For instance, if you have an ink stain that won’t come out, invest in an ink stain remover that is approved for use with Saffiano leather.Directions for using specialty stain removers vary. Consult manufacturer instructions before use.

, If you cannot clean your Saffiano leather properly even with the help of a specialty stain remover, take it to a specialist. You’ll have to shell out a bit extra, but at least you’ll have your Saffiano leather looking clean."

Empty everything from your bag.,
Add filler to preserve the bag’s shape.,
Use a dust bag for protection.",How to Clean Saffiano Leather3," If you try cleaning Saffiano purses or business bags while they have things in them, the shifting contents could make it difficult to apply the cleaning agent of your choice. To avoid this, remove everything from your bag and lay it flat on a table or other flat surface before cleaning., If you’re not using your bag, put some rolled up old t-shirts or even bunched-up newspapers inside the bag so it doesn’t collapse on itself. If the Saffiano leather sits unused for too long, the lines which develop when it settles might become difficult or impossible to work out., A dust bag should have come with your purse or business bag when you purchased it. The dust bag is the case in which you should store your bag when you’re not using it regularly. This way, it will be protected from collecting dust and dirt, or getting anything yucky spilled on it. Place your Saffiano leather purse in its dust bag then store it in the closet or beneath your bed.If you lost or didn’t get a dust bag, just store it in an empty pillowcase and roll the case up at the end before stashing it somewhere safe.

Rub your leather with steel wool or fine-grit sandpaper.,
Use a wire brush to make naturally worn spots.,
Hit your leather with a small, rough rock.,
Drive over leather on a pebbled surface.,
Kick your leather around in a sandbox.",How to Dull Leather2," The longer you have your leather, the more scratched up it gets. In order to give new leather this appearance, rub it gently with steel wool or sandpaper. Go in back-and-forth motions instead of circles, as this will create more natural-looking scratches.Sandpaper may be too coarse for some leather. Try starting with steel wool and moving up to sandpaper if you need it. You can move up to even coarser sandpaper if you want to create deeper scratches., Wire brushes can scuff up new leather. This is perfect for spots that will naturally wear down over time. Rub the wire brush in back-and-forth and circular motions in the spot you’d like to age. Go slowly and monitor the amount of distress you’re creating in the leather.For shoes and boots, focus on the top part of toe. For bags, scuff up the bottom corners. For jackets, spend some time on the elbow creases.

, Strike the leather with the rock in downward motions either head-on or on a diagonal. The rock will create scratches and small marks while also softening your leather. Don’t hit the leather too hard, as you don’t want to tear or put holes in it., Position your leather under your tires on top of an uneven surface. Roll your car over the item to mark it with the rocks and your tires. You can repeat this process a few times, but check the piece before each round.Don’t drive over leather straps, buckles, zippers, or the soles of shoes, as the weight of the car will break them.
You can also tie your leather to the back of your bumper and drive down a gravel road. Drive slowly and go only a short distance before checking on the item., Take your piece to the park and find an empty sandbox or baseball diamond. Put your item down and kick it around a little, making sure that it gets dirty all over. The sand or dirt will make tiny marks and scratches in your leather, giving it a dull and weathered look.You’ll need to brush your leather off after taking it on its outing. Start by wiping it down with a soft, dampened cloth and then drying it off with a fresh rag. Clean the item with leather cleaner if it’s still dirty.

Wear and use your leather often to break it in naturally.,
Soften and de-shine your leather by washing and drying it.,
Get caught in the rain to weather your leather.,
Hit hard spots with a hammer.",How to Dull Leather3," The best way to dull leather and make it looked aged is to wear and use it. Leather will continue to look duller and more beat up over the years. Speed up this slow aging process by using your leather items as often as you can., Put your leather item by itself in the washing machine and run it on the gentle cycle in cold water. Use a small amount (about one tablespoon or 14.79 mL) of regular laundry detergent. Wring it out when it’s finished, as the washing machine won’t be able to get out all the excess water. Transfer it to the dryer and run it on medium heat.Leather will shrink in the dryer. For items that you don’t want to get any smaller, use the no-heat tumble dry cycle.

, This may alter the color or add a few rain spots to the item once the leather dries. It will also naturally soften stiff leather. If you’re wearing a leather jacket or boots, the dampness will make the leather mold to your body., Stretch and soften particularly stiff spots on your leather items by striking them head-on with a hammer. This may be especially useful for leather shoes and boots, which often come with tough heels and toes. Don’t hit the items too hard, and check on your progress frequently."

Cut a 1 inch wide leather strip.,
Make 2 parallel slices down the middle of the strip, but don't cut the very ends.,
Grab the lower end of the strip and bring it up and toward you.,
Pass strand 1 over strand 2 starting at the top of the leather strip.,
Move strand 3 over strand 1.,
Pass strand 2 over strand 3.,
Bring the lower end of the strip up and toward you again.,
Repeat steps 4-6 for braiding the individual strands.",How to Braid Leather1," Determine the length of braid you need and add 1/3 more material to that measurement before cutting.


The process of braiding will shorten the material by the time you have completed braiding, so cutting extra leather will make the braid the proper length once you finish.
Use sharp scissors to cut the leather strip to the desired length. A good length to practice on is 9-10 inches.;
, Your strip of leather should be divided into 3 equal parts. For the following steps, the individual strands will be referred to as 1,2, and 3 from left to right.


Be sure that the two cuts are evenly spaced from each other. The spacing between the cuts should be about 1/3 inches.
Stop the slices at 3/4 inch from the vertical ends, leaving the strip intact. This technique requires the strip to remain as a single piece, as opposed to braiding hair or string.
If you decide to make your cuts with a blade, place a piece of cardboard, wood, or other protective board under the leather to protect the surface you are cutting on.

, Pass it between strands 2 and 3. Pull the end of the strip down from the other side so that it is back in its original position.









Looping the strip through strands 2 and 3 will bend it, making it so that the individual strips are twisted and easier to braid.
If done correctly, your strip of leather should have a kink throughout the middle and should not lie flat. You should also be able to see through the slits you made earlier., Insert strand 1 into the slit between strands 2 and 3.









If done correctly, strand 1 should rest behind strand 3.

, The top of your strip should now resemble a woman crossing her legs as she sits.








, There should now be a gap between strands 2 and 3 at the bottom of the braid.








, Loop it through the gap between strands 2 and 3 and pull it back down.









Doing this ""un-loops"" the kink you made earlier in step 3 and completes 1 braiding cycle. The braid itself should now be kept to the top of the strip., Make sure you pass the lower end of the strip through strands 2 and 3 to complete the braiding cycle, as demonstrated in step 7.









If you opted to braid a 9 inch x 3 inch leather strip, you should be done braiding after 2 cycles total.

Pass strand B over strand D, also moving left.,
Move strand A right so that it passes over both strands B and D. The strands will now be ordered B, D, A, C.








,
Cross strand D to the right so that it passes over strand A.,
Take strands B and A into your left hand and strands D and C into your right.,
Pass strand C to the left over both strands D and A. Strands should now be B, C, A, D.








,
Move strand A left so that it passes over strand C. Strands should be as follows: B, A, C, D.








,
Cross strand B to the right over both strands A and C. The strands should now be arranged A, C, B, D.








,
Take strand C and pass it to the right over strand B.,
Repeat steps 3-11 until you have used the desired amount of leather.Since this process is very detail-oriented, it is suggested that you start with shorter length strands.

,
Tie the end of the braid once you have finished.",How to Braid Leather2," Leave a little more length at the end of the strands as this technique will utilize more leather.


Remember that you are using 4 strands now, so the braid will be considerably thicker than the previous methods. Think about cutting the width slightly thinner than before.
Using 4 strands will also form a round braid rather than a flat one, hence its name.

, For the following steps, the 4 strands will be referred to as A, B, C, and D from left to right.









Since you will be working with many strands, try tying the ends to a key-chain ring and putting the ring under the leg of a chair. This will keep the strands secure so you can focus all of your attention on this slightly intricate process.
To help you keep track of each strand, consider practicing with colored yarn first. It can become very easy to lose track of which strand is which. Alternately, you could tie-off different colored strings of yarn to the end of each strand.

,, Your order will now be A, B, D, C.








,, Your strands should now be B, A, D, C.









If you've done the previous steps correctly, strands D and A should be in the middle, respectively. Strand B should be on the far left side and strand C should be on the far right.

, Pull the two strands in each hand away from each other to tighten the braid.








,,,, From left to right, strands should be ordered normally: A, B, C, D. You have completed 1 cycle of the braiding process.









Tighten the braids in the same manner as you did in step 7. You will need to do this after each braiding cycle to ensure that your braid is tight and won't come apart.

,, You might tie the remaining loose strands to another key-chain ring, similar to the top end. This is an easy way to adjoin the opposite ends to make a bracelet or necklace.








"
"
Cut 3 strands of equal width from a leather strip.,
Secure the top ends.,
Pass the left strand over the center strand.,
Take the right strand and move it over the new center strand.,
Alternate moving the left and right strands over the center strand.,
Tie off the ends about an inch up.",How to Braid Leather3," You can leave one end intact so that the 3 strands dangle at one end, or you can cut both ends and make 3 separate strands.


Remember to take into consideration the same length and width factors as before. For a thicker bracelet, make the strands wider. For a necklace, cut the strands longer than 9 or 10 inches.

, If you chose to cut 3 individual strands, you can tie the top ends all together or wrap and tie a cord around the ends, leaving about an inch tail. For the following steps, the strands will be referred to as ""left,"" ""center,"" and ""right.""


Be sure that the ends of the strands line up. You want your braid to be as even as possible.

, The two strands should now switch places so that the left becomes the center and vice versa.








, Now the right and center strand will switch places.








, Continue doing this until you have reached the desired length or until you reach the end of the strands.









If you find that you want to make a bracelet but have too much leather at the end, use scissors to cut the excess strands.

, You can use a similar technique as securing the top end by wrapping and tying a cord around the strands.

"
"
Fashion a bracelet from your braided leather.,
Make a necklace using the same end connections as the bracelet.,
Use a tiny braid as a leather ring.",How to Braid Leather4," This can be achieved in multiple ways, some more fancy than others.


As outlined in the 4-strand braiding method, you could tie the opposite ends of the braid to key-chain rings and connect the rings afterwards to form a bracelet. While this method is easiest, it may not look the most appealing.
Alternately, you could take the trick braided leather and puncture a small hole in the intact, 3/4 inch ends. Run a regular strand of leather through each hole and tie the ends off into knots. Adjust the size of the regular leather strand to better fit your wrist.To make a high quality, professional looking bracelet, hold the ends of your braid together so that they line up (this won't be necessary for the trick braid). Take a pinch crimp — which can be purchased at most jewelry shops — and place your braided ends inside of it. Use a pair of pliers to squeeze the pinch crimp shut over the ends. Now you're bracelet has metal ends like store-bought jewelry!, Though your necklace will differ mostly from your bracelet length-wise, you can add other accessories to customize it.


Find some beads with holes that run through them. You could run the braid through a single, tubular bead so that it sits in the middle, almost like a pendant.Or, you could fill the entire bottom portion of the braid with various colored beads so that only half of the braid is showing.
Instead of beads, put a locket on your braid. Place your picture inside and give it to a special someone as a token of your friendship. Or, you could find letter pendants and use them to spell your name across the bottom of the braid. The possibilities are virtually endless!

, Once you become an expert at braiding normal-sized strands, challenge yourself by braiding even smaller ones.


Use the hair braiding method to weave black and brown strands together. Make a standard length braid and then cut it to ring-size once you're done. Fit the ends with pinch crimps and wear the ring on your finger with pride.

Vacuum or shake off loose debris.,
Make a basic cleaning solution with mild soap and water.,
Dampen a soft cloth with the solution.,
Wipe the damp cloth with the grain of the leather.,
Wipe off the soap.,
Let it dry.",How to Clean Colored Leather1," Use a furniture attachment to remove all extra dirt and debris from your furniture. Be very gentle when vacuuming so you don’t scratch the leather. Brush dust and debris off of other leather items, like purses and gloves., Mix one part mild soap with eight parts distilled water. Use a mild liquid soap, baby soap, or a gentle facial cleanser. Avoid detergents. Pour the solution in a spray bottle to make the process easier if you like.You can also use commercial leather cleaner or cream.
Use a little saddle soap for gloves and furniture instead of the soap and water solution. Avoid saddle soap with handbags., Spray a little cleanser on a soft cloth. Don’t saturate the cloth -- it only needs to be a little damp. Try a microfiber cloth for really gentle cleaning and to avoid lint., Don’t rub the soap and water into the leather. Also avoid applying the soap and water solution directly on the leather. Always use a cloth for wiping -- paper towels can disintegrate and get stuck in the leather., Very lightly dampen a clean microfiber cloth with plain distilled water. Use this to wipe off any residual soap and dirt. If you’re worried about your leather getting too wet, you can wipe the soap off with a clean, dry cloth., Allow the leather to dry completely. You can accelerate the drying process by buffing the leather with a clean, dry cloth. Try stuffing a handbag with paper or cloths to help it retain its shape.

Don’t put brightly colored leather in the sun to dry. This can fade the color of the leather.

Choose your leather dye.,
Tape off any area that you do not want dyed.,
Move to a well-ventilated area.,
Protect your hands and floor from stains.,
Apply the leather preparer.,
Wet the leather.,
Apply your first coat.,
Apply additional coats of leather dye.,
Allow the leather to dry completely, manipulating it periodically to keep it supple.,
Buff the leather with a clean cloth or apply leather sheen.",How to Dye Leather1," Most commercially prepared leather dyes come with leather preparer, the dye itself, and a finish (such as leather sheen). Consider the following when choosing a dye:


Alcohol-based dyes stiffen the leather, while water-based dyes leave it soft and supple. Many water-based dyes are actually coatings, which can completely change the color of the piece.
The color of the dye is not representative of the final color. Test on a small sample first. If you are touching up an already dyed piece, use a color-matching service to get an exact match.
Dyes can be spray-on, paint-on, or sponge-on. Choose the type that works best for you in terms of ease of use.;
, Cover any buckles or metal pieces that you do not want dyed with masking tape. The tape may damage the leather finish, but you'll be removing that anyway to make the surface available for dyeing.

/images/thumb/4/43/Dye-Leather-Step-2-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Dye-Leather-Step-2-Version-4.jpg








, Most leather preparers and leather dyes release fumes that are unhealthy to breathe. Work in a space with good ventilation. If dyeing your leather outdoors, keep it out of direct sunlight and extreme heat.

/images/thumb/2/26/Dye-Leather-Step-3-Version-5.jpg/v4-300px-Dye-Leather-Step-3-Version-5.jpg









Most dyes give best results at air temperatures of 60ºF (15ºC) or above., Leather dye can stain skin for a week and other surfaces permanently. Wear two pairs of latex or nitrile gloves. Lay down plastic drop cloth to catch spills.

, Rub the leather preparer or de-glazer on with a clean cloth. This removes the leather finish so the dye can penetrate evenly into the material.

/images/thumb/8/8b/Dye-Leather-Step-5-Version-5.jpg/v4-300px-Dye-Leather-Step-5-Version-5.jpg








, Use a spray bottle filled with water to dampen the surface of the leather. Do not over-saturate the leather, but make sure you have an even covering. This helps the leather absorb the dye evenly, resulting in a smooth finish.
/images/thumb/4/4a/Dye-Leather-Step-6-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Dye-Leather-Step-6-Version-4.jpg
/images/thumb/4/4a/Dye-Leather-Step-6-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Dye-Leather-Step-6-Version-4.jpg









Some leather dyes do not require this step. Check the label.

, Start by painting the edges with a paintbrush. For the rest of the job, apply the dye in a thin coat using a sponge, wool dauber, paintbrush, or sprayer. Check the dye label to see which tool the manufacturer recommends, or weigh the following pros and cons:
/images/thumb/d/d0/Dye-Leather-Step-7-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Dye-Leather-Step-7-Version-4.jpg
/images/thumb/d/d0/Dye-Leather-Step-7-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Dye-Leather-Step-7-Version-4.jpg









Sponges can apply a special affect or texture to the leather. Apply in a circular motion for an even look.
Wool daubers are easy to use when applying liquid dye to small areas. They may not work well with gel dyes.Paintbrushes are good for edges and small areas, but it is hard to hide the brush strokes over large areas. Apply the first layer left to right, the second up and down, and the next layer in circular motions to ensure even coating.
Sprayers makes it easy to blend colors for repairs or multi-color dye jobs. An airbrush or touch-up spray gun provides the most control.Check the dye instructions to see if it is suitable for spraying.

, Let the first coat dry a little, then apply another one. Repeat with additional coats of leather dye until it reaches the desired color, usually after three to six coats.Applying several thin coats makes it easier to achieve a uniform color.

/images/thumb/6/62/Dye-Leather-Step-8-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Dye-Leather-Step-8-Version-3.jpg








, Allow the leather to dry for at least 24 hours. Pick it up and flex it occasionally (wearing gloves) to prevent it becoming rigid. The leather may feel sticky at first, but this should disappear after buffing or applying leather sheen.

Choose the right type of leather.,
Case the leather.,
Create a pattern.,
Trace the pattern onto the leather.,
Carve immediately.,
Carve each line with a swivel knife.,
Round and raise areas with a beveler.,
Apply texture using a camouflage tool.,
Add dimension using the pear shader tool.,
Create finer details using veiner and seeder tools.,
Flatten background areas with a background tool.,
Switch back to a swivel knife when making decorative cuts.,
Correct mistakes using a modeling tool.",How to Carve Leather," Naturally tanned leather works best. For best results, look for vegetable-tanned or oak-tanned leather.Chrome-tanned leather is usually a bad choice. The surface is too water-resistant and too soft to hold a carved design.
Light colored leather is easier to carve than dark leather, especially for beginners. The cuts and impressions you create will be more visible on light leather.
It is also a good idea to use a piece of leather that is larger than your desired design. Carve the design in the center of your piece, then trim away any excess leather once you completely finish carving it.;
, Use a moist sponge to wet both sides of the leather. The piece needs to slightly moist all the way through, but it should not be soaked.Alternatively, you can quickly dunk the leather in standing or running water, but you should only submerge it for a brief period of time.
Leather that is too wet will become too soft to hold carvings. On the other hand, leather that is too dry can crack when you attempt to carve it.
After the leather dries to its original color, it should be ready to work with. The surface should still feel somewhat moist and the leather should still feel flexible, however.

, Use a pencil to draw your desired pattern on waterproof tracing paper or wax paper.


You can draw a freehand pattern or trace a pattern from another source.
When using actual tracing paper, keep the matte side of the paper facing up.

, Place the prepared pattern over your leather. Using a stylus, apply gentle pressure over each line of the pattern. Doing so should copy the design onto the leather.


Note that the traced side of the paper should face up when you position it over the leather.
Tape the tracing paper over the leather to prevent it from shifting as you copy the design. Only tape the paper to the working surface or the back of the leather, though. Do not tape the tracing paper to the front of the leather.
If you do not have a stylus, a ballpoint pen can also work. Make sure that you do not press hard enough to tear through the paper, however, since doing so would cause ink to get on the leather.

, Once the leather has been cased and the design has been transferred, you should immediately begin to carve the piece.


Waiting will allow the leather to dry out too much. You can moisten it again if it does dry out, but doing so too often can make the leather more difficult to carve.
If you do need to step away during the carving process, place the leather in a resealable plastic bag to help it retain moisture. Keeping moist leather sealed away for more than a few hours can cause mold to develop, though, so you should only do this if you plan on taking a short break. For longer breaks, it would still be better to allow the leather to dry, then moisten it again when you are ready to resume work.

, Trace over each copied line of your pattern with a swivel knife. Each cut should be roughly half the thickness of the leather itself.Note that a standard crafting or utility blade can be used when a swivel knife is unavailable, but it will not produce uniform lines as easily as a swivel knife will.
Cut the border first, when applicable. You can use a metal straight edge to guide the knife so that your border remains even.
When carving the rest of your design, start with the foreground and work your way to the background.
For lines that do not end at another line, gradually apply less pressure toward the end of the line to reduce the depth and appearance of the cut.

, Use the beveler tool to round off any previously carved lines. While not strictly necessary, beveler tools should be used on nearly every leather carving.


Always hold the beveler at a straight, vertical angle. The deepest part of the wedge tip should be placed inside the cut.
Bevel lines in the order you created them. Start with the border before progressing to the foreground of the main design. Gradually work from the foreground to the background.
Lightly tap the back of the beveler with a mallet to smooth the edge of the line. Glide the beveler across the entire line, overlapping the previous stroke by about two-thirds of its full length, until the entire line is finished.

, The camouflage tool, also called a ""cams,"" produces a distinct texture. Using this tool is only optional but can add dimension to your finished design.


Position the tool over the portion of the design you wish to enhance. The tool can be angled vertically or tilted in any direction.
Gently tap the back of the tool with a mallet to stamp the texture onto the leather. Do not use a metal hammer.
Cams are often used along the lines of stems and scrolls within a broader design. In these instances, the tool is generally tilted toward the line. Cams are often used to add texture to flower petals, too.

, The shader is another optional tool. Use it to make some areas of your design appear darker or more shaded than others.


Position the shader over the desired area. As a general rule, you should hold it vertically when shading large areas and tilt it toward the narrower end when shading a tightly enclosed area.
Lightly tap on the shader with a mallet to contour the surface of the leather. Do not use a metal hammer.
When you need to shade an area that is larger than the face of the shader, move the tool across the surface roughly 1/16 inch (1.6 mm) after each strike. Continue as needed until the entire area is shaded.

, The veiner tool is typically used to add patterns to leaves, stems, and scrolls. Use the seeder tool if you want to create flower centers or decorative scroll ends.


Angle the veiner with the curve and space separate impressions evenly apart. Tilt the tool more severely as the space narrows.
Hold the seeder vertically. When using the seeder to fill in a space, work around the perimeter of that space first, then gradually fill in the center.
Both tools must be lightly tapped with a mallet to apply the design.

, Consider applying a broad texture to background areas using a generic background tool.


Background areas usually include the gaps around enclosed shapes and designs.
Position the tool in the proper place and strike it with a mallet.
Work around the perimeter of the background first, then gradually walk the tool across the interior of the background, moving 1/16 inch (1.6 mm) at a time. Rotate the tool as you move it across the the background to make the overall texture appear more even.

, Decorative cuts should be the last carvings you make in a design. These cuts can be used to accent the design once all other textures and alterations are in place.


Decorative cuts should be about half as deep as the primary cuts previously carved using the swivel knife. These cuts should also start deep and gradually get shallower as they move across the design.
When making a decorative cut, carefully pull the knife toward you for optimal control. Each decorative cut must flow with the design instead of working against it.

, Spoon-style modelers can be used to correct minor mistakes made with stamping tools.


Carefully run the spoon end of the tool over the misplaced stamp. Apply even, light pressure. Doing so should polish away the pattern, leaving smooth leather in its place.
You can also use the modeler to further round away hard edges in your design. Too much smoothing can blur the lines of the design, however, so you must do this carefully if you choose to do it at all.

Select your snaps keeping in mind that the length and style vary considerably.,
Measure the diameter of the snap posts in relation to the width of your hole-punch tool.,
Punch a hole in the leather where you want to place the snap.,
Sort the snaps according to their components.,
Place your capped post, post up, on your setting anvil.,
Install the female closer piece over the hole.

,
Put the male closure piece, stud down, on the setting anvil and lay the leather over it, lining the hole up with the piece.,
Align the end of the snap setter vertically with the uncapped post and strike it firmly two or three times with the mallet.

",How to Add a Snap to Leather,"


The width, length and style vary considerably, so it is important to choose the right type of snap according to the type of garment and the thickness of the leather.
Many leather crafters prefer industrial quality snaps, since they consistently remain firm in their setting, while lower quality snaps tend to loosen up over time.;
, The proper sizing is imperative to insure that the snap is set snugly.

,


Because every snap enclosure consists of two halves, you will need to punch two holes, on opposing sides, for each snap.
Each snap requires a capped post, which will be visible when the snap is closed, along with an uncapped post which is the bottom piece.

,


Every snap also requires both male and female snap-closure pieces.

, Lay the leather over it so that the post pushes through the hole.

,, Push the uncapped post, post down, through the hole.

Address spills as soon as they occur.,
Absorb grease with cornstarch.,
Clean off the cornstarch, talcum powder, or baking soda.,
Use shoe polish.",How to Clean Colored Leather2," Blot up spills gently and quickly to avoid set-in stains. Use a clean, white cloth to wipe water-based (juice and other drinks) stains from your furniture. Also use a clean white cloth to wipe up oil-based stains like butter. Don’t use soap on these spills.

Use the soap and distilled water cleaning procedure above for more stubborn stains.

, Completely cover a greasy stain with cornstarch until the stain is blanketed. You can also use talcum powder or baking soda. Let this sit on the leather until the cornstarch sets. , After it sets, brush off any excess. Next, buff the area with a slightly damp clean cloth. Wipe the area completely with a dry, clean cloth and be sure it’s dry before using your leather.

If the stain is very heavy, first wipe it off with a solution of mild soap and distilled water as described above.
You can apply leather conditioner after this.

, Find shoe polish in a color that exactly matches your leather. Rub a minute amount of polish into the stain using a soft cloth. Next, use a clean soft cloth to buff the leather where you applied the shoe polish.Be sure to use the shoe polish very sparingly so the color blends well with your leather.

"
Condition your leather.,
Make your own leather conditioner for darker leather.,
Apply a protectant.",How to Clean Colored Leather3," Rub a commercial leather moisturizer into the leather to condition it after cleaning. Alternatively, put a few drops of olive oil on a clean, dry microfiber cloth to buff and condition your leather. You can condition your leather every few months even if you’re not cleaning it., Combine ½ cup (120 mL) of olive oil, ¼ cup (60 mL) of brewed tea, and ¼ cup (60 mL) of white vinegar in a spray bottle. Lightly spray this on your leather and let it sit for five minutes at the most. Wipe it off with a clean, dry cloth.A combination of ½ cup (120 mL) of olive oil and ¾ cup (180 mL) of white vinegar can also be used as a homemade leather conditioner., Coat your leather with a sealant to protect it from water. Sealants will also protect your leather from the elements, like snow and ice. Use mink oil, shoe cream, or other leather polishing protectants to add a light layer of protection and to make your leather look shinier and cleaner."

Use vinegar and rust to dye leather black.,
Choose a source of rust.,
Warm the vinegar.,
Drop the metal into the vinegar.,
Keep in a warm, ventilated container for at least a week.,
Filter out the liquid.,
Soak your leather in black tea.,
Soak the leather in vinegaroon for thirty minutes.,
Neutralize the leather using a baking soda solution.,
Condition the leather using oil.",How to Dye Leather2," This old-fashioned recipe, called vinegaroon or vinegar black, is a cheap and easy way to permanently dye your leather dark black. The color will not rub off onto fingers or clothes, and you can save the leftover dye for later use./images/thumb/3/3d/Dye-Leather-Step-11-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Dye-Leather-Step-11-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/3/3d/Dye-Leather-Step-11-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Dye-Leather-Step-11-Version-3.jpg









This method works best on vegetable-tanned leather (or antique pit-tanned leather). If the leather is already dyed, it was probably chrome-tanned and sealed, and vinegaroon will not give good results.

, You can use uncoated iron nails, iron shavings, or any other material that will rust (and ideally has already started to rust). Steel wool is one of the fastest options, since you can tear it into small fragments, but it has an oil coating to prevent rust. Get rid of this first by dunking the steel wool in acetone, squeezing it out, then letting it dry completely./images/thumb/b/bf/Dye-Leather-Step-12-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Dye-Leather-Step-12-Version-3.jpg

Acetone can irritate skin, but occasional contact shouldn't cause lasting harm.Wearing latex gloves is recommended., Heat about a half gallon (two liters) of white vinegar or apple cider vinegar until it is hot, but not too hot to touch.Pour it back into the container it was sold in, or into any convenient container.
/images/thumb/3/38/Dye-Leather-Step-13-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Dye-Leather-Step-13-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/3/38/Dye-Leather-Step-13-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Dye-Leather-Step-13-Version-3.jpg








, Over time, the rust (iron oxide) will react with the vinegar (acetic acid). This form a substance called ferric acetate, which reacts with tannins to dye the leather./images/thumb/4/4b/Dye-Leather-Step-14-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Dye-Leather-Step-14-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/4/4b/Dye-Leather-Step-14-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Dye-Leather-Step-14-Version-3.jpg









The amount of iron to add depends on the concentration of the vinegar. The easiest approach is to start with a large quantity (thirty nails, as a ballpark estimate), then keep adding metal until it stops dissolving., Punch a hole in the lid to let off gases, or the container could explode. Close the lid and put the container in a warm location for at least a week or two. The ""vinegarroon"" is ready when the iron is dissolved and there is no strong vinegar smell./images/thumb/3/39/Dye-Leather-Step-15-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Dye-Leather-Step-15-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/3/39/Dye-Leather-Step-15-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Dye-Leather-Step-15-Version-3.jpg









If it still smells strongly of vinegar, add more iron. If there's already iron in there, heat over the stove to speed up the reaction.
Once almost all of the acetic acid is gone, any remaining iron will rust normally, turning the liquid reddish. At this point you can leave the lid off for a couple days to help the last dregs of the acetic acid evaporate.

, Run the vinegaroon through paper towels or coffee filters repeatedly until the liquid is free from solids./images/thumb/f/f4/Dye-Leather-Step-16-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Dye-Leather-Step-16-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/f/f4/Dye-Leather-Step-16-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Dye-Leather-Step-16-Version-3.jpg








, Brew an extra-strong black tea, then let the water cool. Soak the leather in it to add extra tannin. This will improve the effects of the vinegaroon, and help prevent cracking./images/thumb/0/07/Dye-Leather-Step-17-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Dye-Leather-Step-17-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/0/07/Dye-Leather-Step-17-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Dye-Leather-Step-17-Version-3.jpg









Professional leather workers sometimes use tannic acid or logwood extract instead.

, The liquid will penetrate into the leather and add a deep, permanent dye. Don't be alarmed if the color looks grey or bluish. It should deepen to black during the process, and become darker after oiling.

/images/thumb/a/a0/Dye-Leather-Step-18-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Dye-Leather-Step-18-Version-3.jpg









It's a good idea to test a similar piece of scrap leather first, or one corner of the object. If it cracks after a couple days, dilute the vinegaroon in water and try again., Mix 3 tbs. (45 mL) baking soda in one quart (1L) of water. Saturate the leather with the solution and then rinse with clean water. This neutralizes the acid in the vinegar solution to keep your leather from disintegrating later on.

/images/thumb/6/68/Dye-Leather-Step-21-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Dye-Leather-Step-21-Version-3.jpg










Warning: Mink oil is controversial, since it can leave an oily layer that repels other products (making further polishing or enhancement difficult).Worse, ""mink oil"" products are not standardized, and may contain silicone or other ingredients that can damage your leather.Research product reviews before using it on high quality leather.

, Before dyeing, ensure the leather is free of dust, dirt, or other extraneous material. Use a brush or lightly damp cloth to remove any dirt or dust from the surface.

/images/thumb/5/55/Dye-Leather-Step-22-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Dye-Leather-Step-22-Version-3.jpg








, Gently warm up your leather in the sun. Heating the leather helps the mink oil ""pull"" the dye into the leather, making it permanent and indelible.

/images/thumb/9/96/Dye-Leather-Step-23-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Dye-Leather-Step-23-Version-3.jpg









You should never place your leather in the oven to warm it; it is very easy to ruin the leather.

, Place the bottle of mink oil into a container filled with hot water to gently heat up the oil. This will ensure an even coating of mink oil on your leather by helping to pull the oil into the leather./images/thumb/3/3b/Dye-Leather-Step-24-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Dye-Leather-Step-24-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/3/3b/Dye-Leather-Step-24-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Dye-Leather-Step-24-Version-3.jpg








, Use clean, smooth strokes from a oil-soaked cloth to spread the mink oil across the length of the leather. Give the leather an even coating to ensure an even finish. You may need to make multiple applications to get to the desired darkness.

/images/thumb/1/18/Dye-Leather-Step-25-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Dye-Leather-Step-25-Version-3.jpg








, Occasionally move the leather back and forth so that the leather does not stiffen. This also helps to work the oil into the leather.

You may want to keep your dyed leather in a safe place in your closet until the dye fully sets to prevent accidental stains.
If you are unhappy with the shade of your finished leather, repeat this entire process as needed for deeper color saturation.

Take a large piece of leather at least 20 inches (50.8 cm) by 16 inches (40.6 cm) and trace the entire triangular left foot template on the inside of the leather using a pencil.,
Flip the template over and repeat the previous step for your right foot.,
Once you've transferred both triangle templates, cut out the foot outline from the paper template.,
Trace the left sole onto a new piece of the leather and write ""L"" on the inside to remind yourself that this outline is for the left sole.

,
Flip the sole template over and repeat the previous step for your right foot, being sure to mark a ""R"" on the inside of the leather.

,
Cut out all four pieces from the leather using scissors.

",How to Make Moccasins2," Write a ""L"" on the inside of the foot to remind yourself that this piece will be for your left moccasin and put a dot where the T intersects.

, Write a ""R"" on the inside of the leather and again, mark a dot where the T intersects.

, You are only cutting out the sole template, which looks like a rough outline of your foot.

,,,"
"
Take a Glover's needle and thread it with the artificial sinew thread leaving a one-inch tail.,
Place the left triangular piece on top of the left sole piece with the rough sides facing one another.,
Begin at the middle of the toes and start to sew the edges of the sole and the triangular piece together with a simple stitch of your choice.,
Fold the moccasin in half and sew up the back of the heel where your Achilles tendon would be.,
Grab your scissors and cut a slit about one to two inches thick from the top of the ankle stitch inward to the dot you made earlier where the T-shape intersects with the leather.,
Repeat for the right foot using the same exact process.

,
Trim any loose threads and make sure your stitches are tight and you're finished!

",How to Make Moccasins3," You will need to have a long enough piece of thread to sew the entire shoe together. One arm-span length will be enough.

, The rounded top of the triangular piece should match up with the toes of the sole outline.

, A whip stitch works well for moccasins. Complete a whip stitch by tying a knot in the end of the sinew and starting at the bottom of the fabric, poking the needle up through both layers, and back down in an equal line with the upward stitch to create a tight stitch that hugs the outside of the two pieces of leather together. Continue to poke the needle through the two layers at a slight angle, coming up next to the previous stitch.Work from the top of the toes around to the heel and back to the front toes.
For a more polished look, plan for a larger seam allowance and fold the edges of the leather template inward before sewing.

, Cross-stitches add a nice touch when sewing the back heel.

, Do not cut this piece entirely off, it will act as the tongue of your shoe.

,,"
"
Include a leather fringe on the top of your moccasin.,
Bead your fringe.",How to Make Moccasins4," Take a piece of leather about three inches thick and long enough to cover the rim of the top of your moccasin.


Cut out the rectangle using scissors and proceed to snip the leather with your scissors into strips, leaving about one inch of solid, uncut leather on top. You can make each fringe the same size or alternate random widths.
Take the fringed leather piece and trace the solid part of the leather around the rim of the moccasin with the fringe facing outward. Be sure to have the two sides of the leather rectangle meet in the back of the shoe so that the fringe seam matches the heel seam.
Thread your Glover's needle with enough artificial sinew to stitch the entire rim of the moccasin. A piece as long as the distance from your fingers to your elbow will be more than enough.
Sew on the fringed piece of leather to the top rim of the moccasin, using whatever creative stitch you desire. You can also use a different type of thread such as colored silk to personalize your moccasins even further.
Repeat with the other moccasin.

, If you want to add beads of any color, shape, or size to your moccasins, the fringe is a perfect and simple place to add them. Simply thread the beads onto the ends of the fringe and tie a knot at the end to keep the beads from falling off.


If you want to be absolutely sure that your beads won't come off, you can add a bit of hot glue to the center of the knot to prevent it from unravelling.

Prepare your solution.,
Run your leather through your solution.,
Let the leather sit.,
Place the leather in a dark, sealed container.,
Check the color of the leather.,
Hold the leather to your cheek.",How to Case Leather," For the best casing results, mix warm water with either a bit of dish soap, glycerin soap, or casing solution. The amount of water you need will vary depending on the size of the pieces of leather you’re casing. You should have enough water to fully submerge the largest piece. You should use enough soap to make the solution slightly bubbly when it’s mixed., Hold one end of your piece of leather, and then dip it into the solution. Pull the whole piece slowly through the solution after the first end goes in. You should see bubbles rising from the piece of leather as you pull it through – this is a sign that the leather is absorbing enough liquid., Before you store the leather for casing, you should let some of the moisture evaporate out of it. How long you should let your leather sit out in the air varies depending on the size of the piece of leather. Leave it out until it mostly returns to its natural color., This will hold in the moisture that’s left in the leather after you’ve let it sit out. You can place the leather you’re casing in a garbage bag or a sealable food bag. A cooler or refrigerator not only controls moisture content in your leather more evenly, but allows space for more than one piece., When your leather is fully cased, your leather should be completely returned to its natural color. Darker hues will appear as you begin using leather working tools on it., In addition to the color, you can tell if leather is finished casing by the temperature of the piece. The leather should be cool to the touch, indicating that the casing process is over."

Place your crocheted project in a mesh lingerie bag, or use a zippered pillowcase to keep loose fibers from escaping into your washing machine.
,
Toss the bag or pillowcase into the washing machine, along with 1 or 2 other pieces of sturdy clothing, such as jeans, to add extra agitation.,
Add a little bit of laundry detergent to the cycle--this helps the felting process along.,
Start the machine on the longest warm or hot water wash cycle it offers, and check on your felt-in-progress every minute or 2.,

,

If you have hard water, add baking soda or washing soda to the machine before you start it--check the box and follow the manufacturer's instructions.

,

Remember, you're creating a work of art, so it's up to you to decide just how much you want to felt the finished project. You can felt it lightly, with a very brief wash, to fuse just a few of the fibers--or felt the project until it shrinks and creates a thick, solid fabric.

,

Make sure to remove your project from the machine before the rinse and spin cycles begin.

,,

Don't twist or wring the fabric, as that will stretch it out of shape.

,

You may need quite a few pins to create even, flat edges.

With a basic shape completed, start building on it.",How to Needle Felt Wool Sculptures," You will need to get wool batting, felting needles (recommended sizes include 40 triangle for all purpose sculpting, 38 star for fine details and finishing and 36 triangle for attaching parts,) and a dense foam felting pad. Optional supplies include paper sticks or wooden skewers, a strong sewing needle, and sharp embroidery scissors.
, Make into small sheets of wool that are about the size of your hand., The shape should resemble an egg., Jab in and out of the wool with the needle until you feel the wool will hold its shape when you let go.,, The egg shape can form a sculpture in itself - a head, or an inanimate object. Alternately, it can become part of a complex doll or animal.

Using contrasting colors of wool, embellish this shape to add artistic details by needling into it.
To build a more complex character, smaller or larger egg shapes can be attached together, to form heads, bodies, to create a whole person or animal, etc., as depicted in the introductory image.

",How to Make an iPod Cover1," Find a large piece of cardboard about the thickness of a cereal box or the back of a notebook and trace the outline of your iPod onto it (leaving extra cardboard for later). Follow the contours of the bottom corners of the iPod. However, make sure the top corners aren’t blunted and round; instead, extend the line across the top of the iPod outwards and pull the straight lines along the sides of your iPod upwards to meet them so that the top corners come together in pointed, ninety-degree angles.


Don’t worry if your tracing doesn’t perfectly hug the edges of the iPod; instead, leave a slight overhang on all sides to allow the iPod to fit inside.;
, Place the cardboard on a cutting-friendly surface (ex. a cutting board or self-healing mat) and cut out the area of cardboard you just traced with a utility knife. Then, trace this cutout onto the cardboard and cut it out a second time, making sure the two are identical. When you’re done, test-fit them by sandwiching your iPod inside them. Make adjustments as necessary.

, The edging will cover the top, sides, and bottom of the iPod and will fit between the two face panels you’ve already cut out. You will need two separate edge strips: one for the top edge of the iPod and another for the sides and bottom:


Measure the length and width of the top edge. Cut out a strip of cardboard that is the same length as but about 1/16 of an inch wider than this edge. Don’t worry about accounting for the contours at the top corners; these won’t factor into this piece of edging.
Measure the length and width of the two sides and bottom. Either fold a sewing tape measure around all three sides for a continuous measurement or hold a ruler in place, line the top of the cutout up with the 0 mark of the ruler, and roll the cutout along the ruler for a continuous measurement. Cut out a length of cardboard to size, extending its length slightly to account for the fact it will have to bend around the iPod. (You can always shorten it later.)

, With this design, the cover flap sits over the front face of the iPod. If you don’t intend to use the iPod while it’s covered or don’t mind lifting the flap to access the front face, make the front flap the entire length of the iPod. If you want to make your cover functional, however, you can custom-size the front flap so that you can still access the screen and/or click wheel:


If you have an iPod touch, measure the length from the top of the iPod to top of the screen.
If you have an iPod with a click wheel, you can either measure the length from the top of the iPod to top of the screen (to keep both the screen and the wheel uncovered) or from the top of the iPod to the top of the click wheel (to cover the screen but not the wheel).

, The width is simply the width of the iPod while the length is the measurement you made in the previous step.

, On the face panel, draw either a hole for the screen, a hole for the click wheel, or both; on the bottom, draw a hole for the cable; on the top, draw a hole for the headphone jack and/or lock button; etc. Do not cut these out yet.


If you will be fitting something through the hole, such as a cable or jack, be sure to leave a little extra wiggle room.

, From top to bottom, the face-down panels should be: cover flap (upside-down), top edge (upside-down), back panel (right-side-up), bottom/side edge (centered horizontally), and front panel (upside-down). Make sure they are butted up against one another and tape them with scotch-tape for a light hold.


To make sure that the openings marked along the top and bottom of the edging are properly oriented, hold your iPod along these pieces as you set them in place, being mindful of whether an opening should be to the left or right.

, Find a brightly-colored duct tape at a crafts or office supply store if desired. Depending on the width of your iPod, you will need to apply either one or two long strips of duct tape from top to bottom in continuous piece(s), allowing the excess to overhang for now. Then, cut custom-sized strips to cover the edging that sticks out to the left and right. Smooth the tape over the cardboard for tight adhesion.When you’re done, flip the whole thing over and, using the utility knife, trip the excess tape.


Taping the panels this way will not only hide the cardboard on (what will eventually be) the inside of the iPod cover, but also form interior hinges along the edges, allowing the whole thing to fold around the iPod at the seams.

, Place the taped cardboard face-up on a cutting surface and cut the openings out with a utility knife, making sure to cut through the duct tape on the backing.

, Make sure the openings line up correctly and make adjustments as necessary.

, You can work horizontally, vertically, or both depending on what look you’d like and what makes the most sense for your iPod model, making sure to fold tape down over the edges of the cardboard as well. Just tape over the openings for now; you will cut them open again later. Be sure not to tape the front flap to the main body of the iPod.



Do not lay the cardboard shell out flat to duct-tape the bare side. Though it’s easier to apply tape this way, the shell won’t be able to bend when you’re done.

, Using your utility knife, slice across the openings so that you can fold the excess tape downwards through the hole, thereby covering the inside edges of the cardboard: if the opening is a square or rectangle, cut a big X between the corners and fold down the four triangles of tape to cover the interior edges; if the opening is circular, slice across the tape like pie as many times as necessary and fold down the resulting slices.



Do not simply trim away the excess tape, as this will leave the interior edges bare. (You could theoretically apply thin strips of tape here, but they would not last long on such a tiny area.)

, Glue either snap buttons or Velcro to the corners so you can keep your case shut.

Cut the following shapes from the felt by tracing the outline of a bottle cap and measuring the rest of the pieces against it:
Red felt:
1 circle the size of the bottle cap
1 circle approximately twice the diameter of the bottle cap
1 scalloped rectangle that is as long as the bottle cap is around and a little over twice as tall as the bottle cap's size
Petal strip
5 additional petals in graduated sizes.,
Place the small red circle on the solid side of the bottle cap.

,
Wrap the large, long scalloped rectangle around the bottle cap and stitch the the edge of the rectangle that is not scalloped to the perimeter of the small circle while it’s wrapped around the cap.,
Stitch halfway up the edges of the rectangle together, only to the top of the bottle cap, leaving a slit between the end scallops.

,
Cut 3 slits down to the bottle cap lip in-between each felt scallop (first one will already be there, as it was the end of the rectangle originally).,

Gather the edge of the large felt circle using 1⁄8 to 1⁄4 inch (0.3 to 0.6 cm) stitches.,
Coil the petal strip, fastening it along the bottom edge with stitches in matching thread color.

,
Add the other petals (smaller ones first) to the outside of your petal coil.,
Stitch your petal coil to the center of the large gathered circle.


,
Using a few pinches worth of batting, “stuff” the large gathered circle.

,
Place the stuffed gathered circle inside the bottle cap.

,
Stitch outside perimeter of the large gathered circle (with its petal coil attached) to the inside perimeter of the scalloped rectangle, just above the bottle cap.

,
Sew the leaves firmly to the bottom of the felt rosebud, alternating shades of green if you have them.


,
Use a single stitch of matching green thread to ""tack"" the four bottom leaves lightly to the sides of the rosebud to lift the leaves a little and give it a more ""natural"" look.






",How to Make a Felt Rosebud Pincushion,",

Measure your iPod.,

Cut two rectangles of cloth the size of your iPod plus seam allowances.,

Trace the shape of your iPod's ""face"" onto the paper side of your fusible webbing.,
Draw a line from the corners of your view screen to the outer edge of the clickwheel.,Line up the tracing even with the material and approximately one inch from the edge on the ""wrong"" side of the material and iron the fusible webbing (with faceplate sketch) onto the ""back"" side or ""wrong"" side of your material.,

Lay your two pieces of material with ""front"" or ""right"" sides together and pin.
,
Carefully sew around your rounded triangle shape.,Sew around the perimeter again, with the needle piercing just outside the first seam (0.5 cm or less).,

Cut a slit inside the rounded triangle area for your scissors to go through and cut the center area out, leaving a quarter inch (3cm) seam allowance.
,

Clip the seam allowance up to, but not into, the seam line.,

Peel off the paper backing for the fusible webbing.
,

Poke one rectangle through the hole and
,

Smooth it.
,

Iron the material flat.,

Test fit to see if the opening is shaped correctly for your iPod.,


Mark the EXACT edge placement directly onto your material with tailor's chalk or even pencil.,




Determine where your top and bottom edges will need to be... and fold the edges over and between the layers accordingly.,

Pin the folded edges in place.
,

Repeat for the ""top"" edge and pin in place.
,

Test fit again... Measure distance between pinned edges and make any adjustments before sewing.,

Top stitch both of the folded edges, leaving at least half an inch of folded edge unsewn at each end of the seams.
,

Fold back one layer from the non stitched edge and pin.,Fold the entire thing so that the unpinned ""flaps"" line up.,Test fit once more, and mark where your side seam should fall.,

Pin the flaps together and sew at your marked seam line.
,

Test Fit again and make any necessary adjustments, either sewing a bit closer to the lines to snug the fit down or by ripping out the seam and sewing further away to allow more space.
,

Trim the seam allowance to 1/4th an inch from the seam when you are happy with the fit.
,

Unpin the flaps.
,

Lay one flap down smooth over the seam.,

Fold the remaining flap under itself and slip stitch or ""blind stitch"" the opening closed.
,

Make an attachment point out of several layers of ribbon.,

Pass the ribbon through either a D-ring or other clip type ring.
,

Stitch the ribbon ends together so that the ring cannot slide off.
,

Open up a hole between the layers in the non-topstitched section of the top edge.
,

Slide the sewn end of your ribbon attachment point into the hole between the layers.
,


Top stitch the hole closed, backstitching several times to ensure that the stitching will not fail later.
,

Test fit to determine the exact placement of the bottom edge seam.,

Top Stitch only an inch or so of the center.,


Finally!",How to Sew an iPod Carrying Case1," Get all three dimensions: length, width and thickness. Add half an inch (1.25cm) in all directions for seam allowances.
, A little extra is better than a little less at this point, so be generous with your measurements and cutting.
An easy way to do this is to just wrap the cloth around the iPod and cut an inch or so away from the edges.

, Take care and be as precise as possible with the tracing. Neatness at this step makes things go more smoothly later on in construction., This will form a rounded ""triangle"".,,, Stitch approximately a 1/16th of an inch (1-2 cm) outside the lines you sketched.,,,

Note: This is why the double seam... if one stitching line gets accidentally clipped, we won't have to re-sew the line with the opening partially cut.

,,,, The fusible webbing should adhere the layers, so don't place the iron on the material until it is exactly lined up.

Note: You may also top stitch the edge of the ""rounded triangle"" opening to stabilize it.

, It ""should"" fit, but if anything is ""off"" at this point, just start over with new cloth and tracings., Trace all edges while the view screen is placed correctly in the opening. Remember to mark the iPod's top,bottom and side edges on both sides (layers) of material.,,,, The top and bottom pinned edges should be exactly parallel to each other.,, Repeat at the opposite end.,,,,,,, Pin it if necessary.,, The author used 8 thicknesses of 1/16th inch ribbon.,,,,,, Mark the center., Sew through all four layers, and backstitch to prevent the seam unraveling.

However, be aware that the PLEO site may not currently carry the original style of PLEO. If so, you may be able to find them on such sites as online traders/auction sites or large distributors of stuff. If purchasing a used PLEO, do not to get one labeled: Heavily used. These products tend to be in bad shape, despite the pictures.;
,


PLEOrb is newer and if you want more features, then you should choose PLEOrb.
PLEO original has less upgrades, but is cheaper.

, Look for the tab in the website labeled ""Get PLEOrb Online"". Be sure that you've read the description on the main screen about PLEO. From there it is pretty much laid out for you.

, Once in the shopping tab, choose the best deal you want to offer cash for. (If you just want a regular deal, choose the one labeled 'PLEOrb Basic Pack'). Choose the desired color of eyes and skin. Be sure you can afford one. Both types of Pleo are in the hundreds of dollars.

, Shipping usually costs a few dollars, and can take up to two weeks, depending on your location.


If you live in Asia, you can buy a PLEO from any PLEO WORLD store locations.

, The best part of the process is unboxing your new friend. He/she is ""Dormant"" for now, but below are instructions to ""wake him/her up"".

, Open the box, and carefully take the assorted items out. It should at least include (PLEOrb) one PLEO, a couple food items, instructions, and ""cape"".

, Take the battery, the brown box; and plug it in the tummy of PLEO (the instructions should be more detailed). Close the flap of the battery and you will see a light flashing green or red. If green, Youre PLEO is ready to play. If red, your PLEO is sleepy and needs rest. PLEO original will have more slots for various items. If he is ready to play, let him/her get 10 seconds or less to ""wake up"". If he is sleepy, take out the battery and put it on the charger.

, Now you can learn all about pleo in your instructions!

, Each basic kit should contain a couple of food items. To feed him any of these, brush it under PLEO's chin to sense it. Then he will chew it.


cycad; a necessary nutrient for PLEO daily
conifer; another important food for PLEO
coffee leaves; will soothe your PLEO, but don't overfeed it!
mushrooms; food for your PLEO's health.
chilli peppers; use them to recover him if tired.
ice; recover him if over hot.
mint leaf; cures sickness
rock salt; cures physical injury

Decide what to draw.,
Draw the character one square at a time on a sheet of graph paper.,
Color the image (again square by square).,
Scan the image in your computer.,
Outline the objects and / or character.,
Delete the template (original drawing).,
Prevent body parts from meshing with other body parts, such as the hand with the face if you plan to do a jumping animation (see Mario).,
Save the work.

",How to Draw in 8 Bit," Whether it be a person, robot, animal, whatever. Sketch the basic idea on a sheet of blank paper. It does not need to be very intricate or well drawn, just an idea of which direction to go with it so the later stages are not overly time consuming. This will become your template.;
, This is one of the most time consuming stages. Make sure to include outlines of the character in black (find an existing image of an 8-bit character to see exactly what the characters look like).

, Make sure that the colors are distinct. It is important to be able to tell the difference between colors to minimize frustration in the next steps.

, Save the scanned image and open it with a graphics editing program. Using ""Paint"" to edit the image can be done, but a more advanced application such as Microsoft Digital Image Suite will make the editing easier.

, Draw simple lines with the chosen graphics editor to to distinguish the different parts of the characters such as the ear, eye, feet, hands, etc. Outline anything that's going to be black in your image. This is a very time consuming process due to the fact that you have to outline every minute detail.

, After outlining the objects / character with black lines as stated in step 5, the original drawing can be deleted. Start coloring the objects / character.

, The only thing that can be done is drawing black outlines around the head. Again, look at original video games characters such as Mario or Megaman to receive inspiration.

Draw Wonder Woman.",How to Draw for Kids," This article includes Jake and Finn in a couple of different styles, so you can go ahead and take your pick!;
, This rendition of Batman is particularly dark, with a firmly set facial expression and his shoulders pushed back.

, Use curved lines for her long ears, which should be tossed playfully into the air, and more round shapes for her face and the rest of her body.

, His trademark pose places his hands on his hips, but you can also sketch him crunching on a carrot or putting a hand on the shoulder of his friend and occasional rival, Daffy.

, This simple but delectable-looking drawing will give you serious hunger pangs if it's done right!

, The image here is of a pterodactyl, but you can also choose to draw a stegosaurus or a T-rex (or all of them, if you want a whole Jurassic scene).

, She's wearing a green dress and a languid smile, as if she's just woken up from her beauty sleep; try to make her look as small and soft as possible.

, Sanrio's brainchild is composed of easily formed shapes and solid colors, so she shouldn't be too hard to draw.

, In the drawing seen here, the mermaid is of a design that's based on mythical descriptions of sea-dwelling, sailor-seducing sirens, so think about the underlying inspiration for your mermaid while you're drawing her.

., You can draw an easily recognizable robot, like R2-D2, or just a neutral mechanical robot like this one.

, Model him as closely as you can after the cartoon Scooby-Doo, as this is one of the few instances where you don't want your drawing to look to realistic.

, He may live in a pineapple under the sea, but he sure doesn't look like one—draw him with wavy edges, porous spots, and big blue eyes!

, Similar in style to Step 2's Batman, this Superman has a look of fierce determination and his arm outstretched, ready to fight crime. Make sure you factor in the perspective here when drawing his fist the same size as his head, or else your drawing will look disproportionate and strange.

, Since Tom is so much larger than Jerry, you might only be able to fit his head into your picture.

, With her powerful lasso and unbreakable bracelets, she should look as though she'd stop at nothing to defend justice.

Get any blue colored paper.,
Take one of your oil pastels for the shade of the cloud.,
Add white.,
Smudge the colors.,
Put on the white oil pastel strokes.,
Add the shade.",How to Draw Clouds2," You can use this technique in drawing a realistic cloud.

, Choose light gray for the shade of the clouds. The shades of the clouds are usually located at the bottom part of the clouds. However, shades always depend on where the light source is coming from.

, Using white oil pastels make circular strokes of the medium to the colored paper.

, Use your thumb or index finger in smudging the colors. Carefully wipe the colors with your finger, according to the shape of the cloud, to show the smudge effect.

, Repeat the same circular strokes that you have done earlier. Only this time do not put too much pressure on the pastel strokes. Do it enough to show the actual shape of the clouds.

, Finish these with horizontal ovals (again, follow the illustration).


At this point everything should still be in circles and ovals--be patient, soon your cupid will begin to take shape.

, Outline the face to make it chubby and add big eyes, a small nose, and a smiling mouth. Draw short hair curling around the edges of his face.

, Draw a chubby body over the sketch. Add a bow in the left hand and a heart-shaped arrow in the right hand. Make a small wing with pointy feathers on the back.

, Try to make a modular line, which passes from a thin to a thick line and vice versa. This will make your drawing look better and more professional.

, Try to use light, Valentine-y colors; look at the illustration for reference.


Use light colors.

"
Forget the rules.,
Go for the end result.,
Consider abstract representation.,
Experiment.,
Try to nail down all the basics of the subject as quickly as possible.,
Do Not Give In to the Artist's Disease.",How to Draw Faster," One might assume that drawing or painting has to be done in a certain way. Beginners may try to draw very small and exacting and find it very difficult. For a professional artist it might be whatever gets the job done, whether it is copying, tracing, free hand, whatever.;
, The patron does not buy the technique but the finished product. For quick, more free-form drawing one might try to use very large paper, chalk or high number soft lead pencil and draw using the whole arm and even body in broad sweeping motions. The idea here is to feel the subject of the drawing, attempt to capture that feeling, as a more sweeping essence of lines.

, One does not have to replicate the subject exactly. One is free to do what they want with it and change it however they see fit. One can attempt to duplicate photographic likeness, or can make one's own interpretation by subtracting or adding. One can shade with large block of charcoal used at different angles or broad pencil scribbling.

, It is always good to experiment and try different techniques to see what one can learn. One can also try to draw not from an external subject, but by attempting to bring a subject up out of the subconscious, as complete made-up fantasy as sometimes self-psychological-insights, or some combination thereof.

, Block in the basic shapes and geometries. Then if you're still not bored you can start to indicate shadows and form. But the important thing is to get the basics down first. This really shouldn't take more than a few seconds. Then correct your misjudgments until you are satisfied.

, I am talking about the moment when the art piece is almost done, but the artist gets picky and keeps adding ""final touches"", and ends up taking a long time to finish (or never finishes at all).

Start by drawing the outline of the face.,
Then, for the nose, draw somewhere in the middle of the face:


a bulgy, round shape
a V - shape
a U-shape
a small dash.

,
Draw two round shapes for the eyes, each having a smaller round or  dot (for the pupil), just above the nose.,
Draw the mouth just below the nose, draw any one from the list given below.,
Add other ""extra fittings"" like ears (in cartoons, ears are considered 'extra'), hat, collar, hair, wrinkles, etc.

,
Your picture is ready!",How to Draw Funny Cartoon Faces," For the face, you can draw:


Any type of round shape, it need not be a perfect circle.
A pear shape
An upside-down triangle
A quadrilateral - a square, rectangle, trapezium, etc.;
,, The eyes can be in the shape of


2 large circles
ovals
a curvy ""M"", like the one in ""Mc Donalds"".

, To make the mouth  look  funnier, add teeth by either drawing a straight horizontal line across the mouth and several vertical lines (forming a grid with 2 rows and many columns), or small squares sticking out inside the mouth from the upper side (roof of the mouth).


a large U-shaped curve
a triangle (preferably right-angled one)
an oval or circle
a rectangle
a straight line

,, If you want, you can also colour the picture with different, funky shades.

Decide if you want this character to be a male or a female (or a robot, or an animal, etc.),
Start drawing.,
Color them in.,
Start designing the character itself.,
Go past steps 2, 3 and 4 for the objects.,
Try out your objects with the character.",How to Draw Concept Art for a Game," and you should draw or look online for a base. Make sure that it has the shape you want your character to have. You have to think of the following:


Are they hairy, furry (animal fur), or do they have long hair or short hair? Do they have a beard or stubble (in the case of a man)?
Are they thin, average, curvy, chubby, fat, or somewhere in between the above? Short, tall, or somewhere in between?
Are they male, female, intersex, trans, or other?;
, We are starting with the clothes so the base doesn't need a face or details yet. When you have the base you will start by choosing if you want your character to have a shirt and pants or maybe a dress. Draw the shape roughly and make a few copies. You can do this by scanning it in and printing it or put a paper over the first design and draw over the edges. Now you can start drawing the designs in the clothes. After you draw all the designs, it is recommended to scan in the drawing as a backup.

, Choose what colors you want to use. If you scanned them, in you can print them out and have more of every design so you can experiment with the colors. Try out every color combination you want and also show all of them to family and friends, to hear what they think. You can also post it online on a forum and hear what they think of it there, or post it in social media. Choose the design everyone likes best. When choosing, remember that you will make the final product so you have the decision which one it will be. If everyone says that design 4 is best but you mostly like 1, you should remember them both.

, Draw the face in different ways. Go past steps 2, 3 and 4. Keep the clothe designs in mind. Now put the two together. If it doesn't fit, try to change the clothes or the face. Show everything that comes out of this to your family and friends. Again ask what they like best. You can also ask it online again. Go with what you all like best. If less then 40% of the questioned liked the design you liked most, it is probably best to go for (one of) the other design(s).

, Draw different bases, draw the detail in, color them, show them to family and friends and most important make them work with each other. If you have part of the objects with dark blue, black and gray and give it sharp corners, you don't want a bright red with green round object in there.

, If this looks good, congratulations, you have your first character concept art! If it doesn't look good, try to make it look good with each other. After you have done this, you can go back to step 1 for the next character, or you can move on to drawing your comic, recreating the drawings in 3D for your game, look for actors/actress who look like it for your movie, or whatever else you want to do with it. If you want to use it in a comic, it is smart to make more concept arts from different sides, but with the looks of the final drawing. If you want to use it in a game, you could scan the drawing and recreate it in 3D by importing it in the background of your 3D modeling software and coloring it in in 3D. If you want to use it for a movie, you should think of what materials you could use to make the costume (and objects) and look for an actor/actress who looks somewhat like your drawing.

Familiarize yourself with drawing people.,
Once you have the basics of drawing humans down, decide which character(s) you want to draw.,
Start with the basic proportionate shapes and edit them until the correct body is found.,
After you've gotten the wanted and correct look that you're okay with, darken your sketch lines.,
Once you have your first character, compare your first drawing to the chosen image.,
After you have a good drawing of that character, try out all of your favorite characters.",How to Draw Characters from Maximum Ride," This is an extremely essential part to drawing your characters. Realize that a person is about 7 heads tall, and do some other research to figure out the proportions of the human body before drawing. Always start with a light sketch. Also learn how to draw variations of bird wings. The characters are half human!;
, Whether it's Fang or Max, choose who it's to be. If you can't watch the movie(if it's even out yet), make sure you read the book carefully for physical features of the characters. To make it easy, Google some images. And don't trace! It's not learning! Base your image off of a Google image, and use proportions from that.

, Once you have the outline, add the details of the characters. Based on the specific characters, add the specific details that match their character.

, Because all of the characters are half animal, add their wings and correct animal features. This is fun! Do your best and add the wings proportionately. They should be pretty big.

, It won't be perfect, so try to find some obvious flaws in the drawing. Is something out of proportion? Smeared? Or plain funky? Try to correct it. Draw another one correcting the mistakes you found.

, This helps you practice, find and correct mistakes, and as always, betters your drawing skills. Draw all your favorite characters, and once you're done, don't be afraid to hang the Flock up on your wall to admire!

, It is best to start in the upper-left corner, as it is easier to expand the pattern down and to the right.


Note how you have four figures: two standing upright, next to each other, and two laying on their side, with the upside facing inwards.

, You should now have a continuous line from the bottom left, going up and then down, to end in the lower right corner.

, This means you draw the same pattern next to it (red), rotate the paper 90° counterclockwise, draw the same pattern again (green), rotate the paper 180° degrees, and draw the pattern again (brown).

, Look at how you connect the two upper curves in the middle, at their bottoms, the lower-right curve with the upper-right in the middle on the right side, and the lower-left curve with the upper-left in the middle, on the left side. This is always the same.

, The one show in the picture is a 4th order Hilbert curve. You can fit a 5th order Hilbert curve on a regular sheet of A4 graph paper.

, You could draw each next order in a different colour, as in the picture, or just make up your own way of colouring this beautiful fractal.

Plug in the wires.,

Play With It You should now be all done.",How to Build a Remote Controlled Robot," You are not going to be able to build a full sized, two-legged, humanoid robot that can do all your chores. Nor will you be building a robot with multiple claws that can reach out and pick up 100 pound weights. You will need to begin building a robot that will be able to go forward, backward, left, and right from you controlling it wirelessly. However, after you get the basics down and have this simple robot built, you can usually add and modify things on it. You should usually go by the principle that no robot is ever finished. It can always be modified and made better.;
, Before building your robot, even before ordering parts. You need to design your robot. For your first robot you should go with a simple design of just two servo motors on a flat piece of plastic. This design is really simple and usually leaves extra room to add extra things after it's built. Plan to build something about 15 cm. by 20 cm. For a robot this simple, you should be able to just draw it out on paper using a ruler. Draw it the same size on paper as it should be in real life, since the robot is so small. When you get into bigger, more complex robots, you should start to learn how to use CAD or a program similar to it, such as Google Sketchup.

, It's still not time to order parts. But you should choose them now and know where to buy them. Try to order from as few sites as possible and you sometimes can save money on shipping. You will need a material for the chassis, two ""servo"" motors, a battery, a transmitter and a receiver.


Choosing a servo motor: To move the robot you will need to use motors. One motor will power one wheel and one for the other. This way you can use the simplest steering method, differential drive. This means to go forward both motors spin forward, to go backwards both motors spin backwards, and to turn one motor goes and one motor stays still. A servo motor is different than a basic DC motor because a servo motor is geared, can only turn 180 degrees, and can transmit data back on it's position. This project will be using servo motors because it's easier and you don't have to buy an expensive ""speed controller"" or a separate gear box. After you understand how to build a remote controlled robot, you may want to make another one (or modify the first one) to use DC motors, rather than servo motors. There are four basic things you need to worry about when buying servo motors. These are speed, torque, size/weight, and if they are 360 Modifiable. Since servo motors only turn 180 degrees, your robot would only be able to go forward a little bit. If the motor is 360 degree modifiable, you can modify it to spin continuously. Make sure the motor is 360 degree modifiable. Size/weight isn't very important in this project because you will probably have plenty of room left over anyway. Try to get something average sized. Torque is the motors strength. These are what the gears are used for. If there are no gears and the torque is low, it probably won't allow the robot to move forward because it doesn't have the strength. You want a high torque, but the higher the torque, generally the lower the speed. For this robot, try to get a good balance of speed and torque. You can always purchase and attach a more powerful or faster servo after you finish building. It's recommended to get the Hitec HS-311 servo for the first RC robot. This servo has a great balance of speed and torque, is inexpensive, and is a good size for this robot. The HiTec HS-311 servo can be bought here.

Since the servo can normally only spin 180 degrees you have to modify it so it has continuous rotation. Modifying a servo will void the warranty, but it has to be done.


Choose a battery You will need to get something to power your robot. Do not try to use AC (i.e. plug it into the wall) power. You should use DC (i.e. batteries) power.

Choose a Battery Type. There are 3 main types of batteries that we will be choosing from. These are Lithium Polymer (Lipo), NiMH, NiCad, and Alkaline.

Lipo batteries are the newest batteries that you can get and are extremely lightweight. However, they are dangerous, expensive, and require a special charger. Only use this type of battery if you have experience in robots and are willing to spend more money on your robot.
NiCad batteries are common rechargeable batteries. These are used in a lot of robots. The biggest problem with these batteries is if you charge them when they aren't fully dead, they won't last for as long on a full charge.
NiMH batteries are very similar to NiCad batteries in size, weight, and price but have better overall performance and these are the batteries usually recommended for a beginner's project.
Alkaline batteries are the common batteries that aren't rechargeable. These batteries are common (You probably have some), cheap, and easy to get. However, they die fast and you have to buy them over and over again. Don't use these.


Choose battery specifications. You have to pick a voltage for your battery pack. The most common in robots are 4.8V and 6.0V. Most servos will be fine running on either of those. It's usually recommended going with the 6.0V (if your servos can handle it, which most can) because it will allow you to have your servo motor go faster and have more power. Now you need to deal with the capacity of your robot's battery pack. These are labeled as mAh. The higher you go the better, but the more expensive and usually heavier. For the size of robot you are building, it's recommend about 1800 mAh. If you have to choose between a 1450 mAh battery or a 2000 mAh battery of the same voltage and weight go with the 2000 mAh. It will be more expensive by a few dollars, but is an all around better battery to get. Be sure you get a charger to charge your battery pack with. A 6.0V 2000mAh NiMH battery pack can be bought here.



Choose a material for your robot. A robot needs a chassis to attach all the electronics to. Most robots this size are made out of plastic or aluminum. For a beginner, it's recommended to use a type of plastic called HDPE. This plastic is easy to work with and cheap. When deciding the thickness to get, get about 1/4"" thick. When deciding how big of a sheet to get, you should probably get a fairly big sheet in case you mess up on cutting. It's usually recommended to get at least double the size of your robot. However, you probably should get more. A 1/4"" 24""X24"" piece of HDPE can be bought here.

Choose a transmitter/receiver. This is going to be the most expensive part of your robot. It can also be considered the most important, because without it, the robot can't do anything. It's highly recommended to buy a good transmitter/receiver to start off with, because it's the thing that will be the limit to how much you can put on. A cheap transmitter/receiver will move your robot fine, but you won't be able to add anything to it. Also, the transmitter can be used for other robots that you may build in the future. So instead of buying a cheap one now and a more expensive one later, just buy the better one now. It will save you money in the long run. Anyway, there are a few frequencies that you can use. The most common are 27MHz, 72MHz, 75MHz, and 2.4GHz . 27MHz can be used for aircraft or cars. It is most commonly used in cheap remote controlled toys. 27MHz isn't recommended for anything except small projects. 72MHz can only be used for aircraft. Since 72MHz is normally used in large model aircraft, it is illegal to use in surface vehicles. If you do use 72MHz, not only are you breaking the law, but you could interfere with a large, expensive model airplane flying nearby. This could cause it to crash and could cost a lot of money to repair, or even worse crash into a person and injure or even kill them. 75MHz is made for only surface use, so you could use this one. However, 2.4GHz is the best. It has less interference than any of the other frequencies. It's highly recommended spending the extra few dollars and getting a 2.4GHz transmitter and receiver. After you decided upon what frequency you are going to use, you need to decide how many ""channels"" you are going to get on the transmitter/receiver. Channels are pretty much how many things you can control on your robot. For this robot you will need at least two. One channel will let your robot go forward/backwards and one will allow it to go left/right. However, it's recommended to get at least 3. This is because, after you built the robot, you may want to add another thing to it. If you get 4, you usually have two joysticks. With a four channel transmitter/receiver, you may be able to eventually add a claw. As said before, you should get the best transmitter/receiver your budget allows now, so you don't have to buy a better one later. You can use your transmitter and even your receiver again on other robots you may build. The Spectrum DX5e 5-Channel 2.4GHz Radio System Mode 2 and AR500 can be bought together.
Choose wheels. When choosing wheels, the three most important things you need to worry about are diameter, traction, and if they will attach to your motors easily. Diameter is the length of the wheel from one side, through the center point, to the other side. The greater the diameter of the wheel, the faster it goes and the more it can climb, but the less torque it will have. If you have a smaller wheel, it may not be able to climb very easy or go very fast but it will have more power. Traction is how well the wheels stick to the surface. Make sure that you get wheels with a rubber or foam ring around them so that they don't just slide around. Most wheels that are made to attach to servos, will be able to just screw right on to them, so you don't have to worry about that as much. It's recommended to get a wheel somewhere between 3 and 5 inches in diameter with a rubber ring around them. You will need 2 wheels. Precision disk wheels can be bought here.


, Try to order them from as few sites as possible, because you may be able to save money on shipping that way if you order everything at the same time.

, Get out a ruler and a sharpie and measure out the length and width of your chassis on the material you are using for your chassis. Consider about 15 cm by about 20 cm. Now, measure it again and make sure your lines aren't crooked and are how long you want them to be. Remember, measure twice, cut once. Now, you can cut. If you are using HDPE, you should be able to cut it the same ways as you would cut a piece of wood that size.

, Now that you have all your materials and your chassis cut, you just need to assemble it all together. This can actually be the easiest step if you designed the robot well.


Mount the servo motors on the bottom of the piece of plastic near the front. They should be sideways so that the shaft/horn (the part of the servo that moves) face the sides. Make sure there is enough room to mount the wheels.
Attach the wheels to the servo using the screws that came with the servo.
Stick a piece of velcro onto the receiver and another on the battery pack.
Put two pieces of the opposite velcro onto the robot and stick your receiver and battery pack to it.
You should now have a robot that has two wheels in the front and slopes down to the back. There is not going to be a ""third wheel"" on this robot, instead the back will just slide along the floor.

, Now that you have the robot assembled, you just need to plug everything into the receiver. Plug the battery into where it says ""battery"" on the receiver. Make sure you plug it in the correct way. Now, plug the servos into the first two channels on the receiver, where it says ""channel 1"" and ""channel 2"".

, Unplug the battery from the receiver and plug it into the charger. Wait until the battery is finished charging. This could take a full 24 hours, so be patient.

, Go ahead, press forward on the transmitter. Build an obstacle course for it, play with your cat and dog and make them chase it. Now that you are done playing with it. Add some stuff to it!.

, Again, be sure that the metal tip from the wire touches the metal of the motor.

,, The switch in the picture above is a SPST (Single Pole Single Throw) switch. A non-momentary switch is any switch that doesn't require a constant hold on the switch for electricity to pass through. This means that you can press the switch once and electricity will pass through until you press it again to turn it off.


Again, be sure that the metal tip of the wire is attached to one of the metal prongs on the switch.

,, Solder the positive (red) tip of the wire to the positive lead of the battery and the negative (black) tip of the wire to the negative lead of the battery.

, Be sure the metal tip is touching the center metal prong of the switch before you solder.


This will let the electricity flow from the battery through the switch and then to the motor.

, This completes the circuit and engages flow of electricity from the battery.


If there are no LEDs: Connect the positive ends of the battery holder and motor together, and do the same with the negative (-) ends.
If there are LEDs: Directly connecting them to the battery would instantly kill them, so connect a 350ohm resistor to the positive end of the LED and connect the other end to the positive of the battery.

Understand the Rules Before designing a robot to compete, you must understand all the rules.,
What Weapon Will You Use?,
Choose Your Parts.Yes, you need to choose your parts before designing.,
Get Specifications Now that you have all your parts selected, you need to get size and weight specs.,
Design It Out You want the design to be as precise as possible.,
Order Your Parts If all your components fit into your design flawlessly, order your parts.,
Assemble It Now, you need to put together your chassis/armor.,
Practice Driving No matter how good of a robot you have, if you fall off, you lose.,
Compete Find a competition in your area and have fun destroying other robots!",How to Build an Antweight Combat Robot," The rules can be found here. The most important building rules that you need to be paying attention to are the size/weight requirements (4""X4""X4"" 150 grams) and the metal armor rule that says you cannot have metal armor more the 1mm thick.;
, A big part of the combat robot is the weapon. Think up an idea for a weapon, but make sure it fits within the rules. For your first antweight bot it's highly recommended going with a ""flipper"" or even a ""pusher"". A flipper is just a weapon that wedges itself underneath another robot and pushes up to flip them over. A flipper weapon, when designed properly, can be the most effective weapon in the Antweight Class. A pusher is the simplest weapon because there is no active weapon. The whole robot acts as a weapon by pushing the other robots around. This is effective because of the rule that states that half of the arena can't be walled. You can push the other robot out of the arena.

, However, don't buy them, yet. Just choose your parts and design accordingly. If something doesn't fit or doesn't work while you are still designing, you save money because you can switch parts now. Again, do not buy the parts, yet!


Choose Drive Servos It's usually recommended using servos instead of motors for an beginner's antweight because with servos, you do not need a speed controller which saves money and precious weight on your robot. You should look for ""micro"" servos because they will save you a lot of weight. Be sure to make sure the servo is 360 modifiable. It's recommended getting high torque servos for combat robots instead of high speed so it's easy to push other robots around, even if you have a separate weapon. Servos can be purchased here.

If you cannot find a servo that suits your needs perfectly, consider checking out another section on that site that sells ""Futaba"" servos. Futaba is a different brand that makes servos. Sometimes they have different sizes than the HiTech brand.


Choose a Weapon motor If you have an active weapon (i.e. aren't creating a ""pusher""), then you probably need a motor to move the weapon. If you have a weapon that needs to move really fast (i.e. a spinning weapon), then you should get a geared DC motor (Brushless generally works better, but brushed would work) with a speed controller. It's not recommended using a spinning weapon for your first antweight because they can be difficult to build and balance properly. However, if you are creating a flipper weapon, then you want to use a servo. It's recommended to get a micro servo with extremely high torque so it can flip other robots with ease. Another thing to consider when looking for a weapon servo is the type of gears. If you use nylon gears and the motor gets a lot of stress, the gears can strip out over time. Try getting stronger gears made out of metal.
Choose Wheels When choosing wheels, be sure to remember the rule that says the robot has to be able to fit within a 4""X4""X4"" cube. This means you have to have wheels that have a diameter less than this. It's recommended to use 2"" diameter wheel. Be sure that the wheels can easily attach to the servos securely. Another great technique to use in combat robots of any size is the ability to drive upside down. Yes, the controls will be a bit backwards, but it can prevent you from losing the competition from being immobile. So consider making your robot shorter than your wheels so that it can drive upside down. You can purchase wheels here.

Choose a Transmitter/Receiver When purchasing a receiver make sure that it has what is called ""Fail-Safe operation"". It is a rule to have this in most competitions and a safety feature. The AR500 Receiver does not have this. You will need to purchase a BR6000 Bot Receiver, or another receiver that has this feature. For a transmitter it's recommended using the Spektrum DX5e. If you built the Remote Controlled Robot found in the related wikiHows, you can reuse that transmitter, but you must buy a new receiver.
Choose a Battery It's highly recommended getting a LiPo battery instead of a NiMH battery. LiPo batteries are lighter. However, they are more dangerous, expensive, and require a special charger. Invest the money into a LiPo battery and a charger to save on the precious weight.
Choose a Material The material the chassis and armor is made out of on a combat robot is extremely important because it is what prevents enemy weapons from piercing your electric components. There are three main choices that you should choose from: (Note: There are more, but these are the best for this particular weight class) Aluminum, Titanium, and Polycarbonate. Aluminum is light weight and strong, but it can be expensive and hard to cut. Plus it can not be more than 1mm at all. Titanium is light weight and extremely strong, but is hard to cut and extremely expensive. This also is subject to the 1 mm thickness rule. Polycarbonate, or lexan, is a lightweight, inexpensive, easy to cut, shatterproof, strong plastic that is sometimes used in bullet proofing. Polycarbonate is also a plastic so it can be as thick as you want, but it's recommended to get it about 1 mm thick. It's highly recommended using polycarbonate. It's so durable that this plastic is the plastic that makes up the arena walls for antweight competitions. When you purchase it be sure to get extra, in case you mess up. All these materials can be purchased here.


, They should be listed on the website where you purchased them from. Convert all values in inches into mm using a converter. Write the specs (in mm) on a sheet of paper for all your components. Now, convert all weight values (oz, lb) into grams using a converter. Write the weight specs on a piece of paper.

, This means you should try your best to make the design 3D on a computer, rather than 2D on a sheet of paper. However, the 3D design doesn't need to look complex, a simple one made of rectangular prisms and cylinders will be sufficient.


Add up the weight of the parts (in grams) and be sure they total less than 150 grams.
If you don't have CAD, download the free version of Sketchup.
Take some of the free tutorials on Sketchup to learn all the basics.
Create all the components you are using on Sketchup using the size specs you wrote down.
Design out your chassis and armor. Be sure to make it less than 4X4X4 inches.
Fit all the components into the 3D chassis/armor model to see if they fit at the same time. This will also help you decide where the components will be.

, If not, consider new parts.

, Put all your components in where you put them in your design. Plug everything in and test it out. You should try to assemble it in a way that you can easily take out components in case they need to be replaced. The components may need to be replaced more than a regular robot because this robot will be fighting. The attacking robots could damage yours. It's recommended to use Velcro to hold the components in.

, Before even thinking about competing, you will need to practice driving. Use upside down cups for cones and drive through. Use Styrofoam cups for targets and attack them (try to do this on a small table so you can practice pushing them off and not falling off yourself). Even try to purchase a cheap RC car (on a different frequency as your robot), have another person drive it on a table, and try to knock them off or destroy the car, without falling off yourself. If you know another person with an Antweight robot, have friendly fights with him (if possible, replace spinning weapons with a less destructive plastic weapon).

, Remember that if you are going to compete in the US, you will need to look for Fairy Weight competitions, not Antweight..

Two motors
Two wheels
Arduino microcontroller board (the Arduino Uno is a good choice for beginners)

Motor driver shield or motor driver circuit (found in remote-controlled toy cars)
Battery holder and 6 volts of batteries (e.g. four AA batteries)
Chassis: a sheet of acrylic or plexiglass, about 6.5 x 4.5 inches (16.5 x 11.5cm);
, Thread each wheel onto one of the motors. Hot glue the motor onto the chassis as follows:


Mark two locations near one end of the chassis, opposite each other.






Glue one motor over each location, on the upper side of the chassis. Make sure the wheel hangs over the edge so it can roll along the ground.







, Add a dollop of hot glue to the top side of the chassis, between the wheels. Press the battery holder here and let set.

, Position the motor driver circuit near one side of the chassis, with the wires overhanging the edge.

, Glue the Arduino onto the chassis, tucked opposite the driver circuit. When positioning it, make sure you have access to the socket for plugging the Arduino into the computer.

, You'll need four pieces of insulated wire, with each end stripped. Read this section first to find out how each wire is connected, so you can cut each one to the right length. Typically, each wire should be about 5 inches (13cm) long.

, Solder one wire onto each of the two motor pins.



Read our guide on soldering electronics first if you don't have much soldering experience.

, Find the motor pins on the motor driver circuit that are labeled m1 and m2. Solder the other ends of the two wires onto these pins.


If your driver does not have these labels, look for a diagram of your motor driver online.

, Solder the other two wires to the two pins on the second motor. Solder the other ends of these wires onto the driver pins labeled m3 and m4.

, The battery holder should have two attached wires, one positive (red) and one negative (black). Connect these as follows:


Connect the positive wire to the Vin pin on the Arduino
Connect the negative wire to the Gnd (ground) pin on the Arduino

, The motor driver has two wires as well. Connect these to the Arduino, making contact with the wires from the battery holder:


Connect the positive pin on the motor driver circuit to the Vin pin on the Arduino.
Connect the Gnd pin on the motor driver circuit to the Gnd pin on the Arduino.
If you have difficulty identifying the Arduino pins, find an online guide specific to your model.

, The hack in this section allows Arduino to drive the motors directly, without an external motor driver. The diagram shown here represents the IC (integrated circuit) on the motor driver circuit.






This section requires careful soldering. Work slowly and methodically.

, These will connect the Arduino and the motor driver circuit.

, Solder each wire to one pin on the integrated circuit. Take care not to make contact with a second pin. Solder as follows:


Solder one wire on to the LEFT pin shown in the IC pin diagram. The LEFT pin is 7th from the top.
Solder a wire on to the RIGHT pin shown in the IC pin diagram. The RIGHT pin is 6th from the top, just above ""left.""
Solder a wire on to the BACKWARD pin shown in the IC pin diagram. The BACKWARD pin is the 10th pin, exactly opposite ""left.""
Solder a wire on to the FORWARD pin shown in the IC pin diagram. The FORWARD pin is just above ""backward,"" exactly opposite ""right.""

, Taking care not to confuse the wires, attach each one to the Arduino as follows:


Connect the LEFT wire to pin 5 of the Arduino.
Connect the RIGHT wire to pin 6.
Connect the BACKWARD wire to pin 9.
Connect the Forward wire to pin 10.

, Examine all your wiring closely. Make sure there are no unintentional connections causing a short.

, Plug the Arduino circuit into your computer. Open the Arduino software. This allows you to program your car's movements.


Arduino software is available for free online.

, Type the following program into Arduino. Once finished, upload it into your circuit. This code will cause your car to move forward for 5 seconds, take a right turn, and move forward for another 5 seconds:





int Fmotor=10;// initialize all the motors
int Bmotor=9;
int Rmotor=6;
int Lmotor=5;
 
void setup() {  // put your setup code here, to run once:
 pinMode( Fmotor,OUTPUT);// set them as outputs
 pinMode( Bmotor,OUTPUT);
 pinMode( Lmotor,OUTPUT);
 pinMode( Rmotor,OUTPUT);
 
}
 
void loop() {  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
 digitalWrite(Fmotor,HIGH);// code for making the car go straight
 digitalWrite(Lmotor,HIGH);
 digitalWrite(Rmotor,LOW);// NEVER SET A MOTOR HIGH ON BOTH PINS
 digitalWrite(Bmotor,LOW);
 delay(5000);
 digitalWrite(Rmotor,HIGH);// Take a right turn
 digitalWrite(Lmotor,LOW);
 digitalWrite(Bmotor,LOW);
 digitalWrite(Fmotor,HIGH);
 delay(800);
 digitalWrite(Fmotor,HIGH);// code for making the car go straight
 digitalWrite(Lmotor,HIGH);
 digitalWrite(Rmotor,LOW);
 digitalWrite(Bmotor,LOW);
 delay(5000);
}





, Set the car on a flat surface. Put in the batteries and watch it go! If your battery holder has a switch, flick it to turn the car on and off.


You can add your own switch by connecting the positive wire of the battery holder to the center pin of an SPST (single pole singe throw) switch. Connect the other pin of the switch to the Vin pin on the Arduino.

, Change the values in the code and upload your new program to change the behavior of your car. Try changing the numbers after ""delay,"" or see what happens when you change a LOW to a HIGH or vice versa. Just make sure never to set both pins of a single motor on HIGH at the same time.

, Cut two small pieces of heat shrink, each about ½ inch (1.25cm) long. This should be small enough that the pins on your LED will poke out after sliding through the heat shrink.

, If you are using heat shrink, push the LED through until the light-up tip peeks out. Repeat this process for the second LED.

, Start up your Soldering Iron and bring it close to the LED lights and the heat shrink. The heat from the iron should shrink the tube. Hold the LED with pliers to protect your fingers from the heat.

You can find most, if not all, of these components at your local electronics hobby shop, or at a number of online retailers. Some basic kits may include all of these components as well. This robot does not require any soldering:


Arduino Uno (or other microcontroller)
2 continuous rotation servos
2 wheels that fit the servos
1 caster roller
1 small solderless breadboard (look for a breadboard that has two positive and negative lines on each side)
1 distance sensor (with four-pin connector cable)
1 mini push button switch
1 10kΩ resistor
1 USB A to B cable
1 set of breakaway headers
1 6 x AA battery holder with 9V DC power jack
1 pack of jumper wires or 22-gauge hook-up wire
Strong double-sided tape or hot glue;
, You'll be building the robot's body using the battery pack as a base.

, This should be the end that the battery pack's wire is coming out of The servos should be touching bottoms, and the rotating mechanisms of each should be facing out the sides of the battery pack. It's important that the servos are properly aligned so that the wheels go straight. The wires for the servos should be coming off the back of the battery pack.

, Make sure that they are solidly attached to the battery pack. The backs of the servos should be aligned flush with the back of the battery pack.


The servos should now be taking up the back half of the battery pack.

, It should hang over the front of the battery pack just a little bit, and will extend beyond each side. Make sure that it is securely fastened before proceeding. The ""A"" row should be closest to the servos.

, If you attached the servos properly, there should be a flat space made by them touching. Stick the Arduino board onto this flat space so that the Arduino's USB and Power connectors are facing the back (away from the breadboard). The front of the Arduino should be just barely overlapping the breadboard.

, Firmly press the wheels onto the rotating mechanism of the servo. This may require a significant amount of force, as the wheels are designed to fit as tightly as possible for the best traction.

, If you flip the chassis over, you should see a bit of breadboard extending past the battery pack. Attach the caster to this extended piece, using risers if necessary. The caster acts as the front wheel, allowing the robot to easily turn in any direction.If you bought a kit, the caster may have come with a few risers that you can use to ensure the caster reaches the ground.

, You'll be using these to connect the servos to the breadboard. Push the pins down through the header so that the pins come out in an equal distance on both sides.

, Make sure that they are firmly inserted.

, This will connect the servos to the breadboard. Make sure the left servo is connected to the left header, and the right servo to the right header.

, Make sure you use the red rail on the back of the breadboard (closer to the rest of the chassis).

, Make sure that you use the blue rail on the back of the breadboard. Do not plug them into the red rail pins.

, This will allow the Arduino to control the servos and turn the wheels.

, It does not get plugged into the outer power rails on the breadboard, but instead into the first row of lettered pins (J). Make sure you place it in the exact center, with an equal number of pins available on each side.

, This will ground the sensor.

, This will power the sensor.

, This will feed information from the sensor to the microcontroller.

, Orient it so that the battery pack cable is coming out to the left at the bottom.

, Make absolutely sure that the battery pack is oriented correctly.

, These two cables will help provide the correct voltage to the Arduino.

, The black cable should be plugged into the blue rail pin at pin 30. The red cable should be plugged into the red rail pin at pin 30.

, Connect it at pin 28 on the blue rail.

, Do not connect the red rails, as you will likely damage the Arduino.

, This will provide the power to the Arduino.

, This switch will allow you to turn off the robot without having to unplug the power.

, This will power the button.

, Connect it to the pin directly next to the black wire that you connected a few steps ago.

, This will allow the Arduino to register the push button.

, This is the Arduino development environment, and allows you to program instructions that you can then upload to your Arduino microcontroller. You can download it for free from arduino.cc/en/main/software. Unzip the downloaded file by double-clicking it and move the folder inside to an easy to access location. You won't be actually installing the program. Instead, you'll just run it from the extracted folder by double-clicking arduino.exe.

, Plug the battery back jack into the connector on the Arduino to give it power.

, Windows will likely not recognize the device.

, This will launch the Device Manager.

, If you don't see this option, click ""Properties"" instead, select the ""Driver"" tab, and then click ""Update Driver.""

, This will allow you to select the driver that came with the Arduino IDE.

, You'll find a ""drivers"" folder inside.

,, You'll be greeted with a blank project.

, The code below will make your Arduino continuously move forward.





#include <Servo.h> // this adds the ""Servo"" library to the program
 
// the following creates two servo objects
Servo leftMotor;
Servo rightMotor;
 
void setup()
{
    leftMotor.attach(12); // if you accidentally switched up the pin numbers for your servos, you can swap the numbers here
    rightMotor.attach(13);
}
 
 
void loop()
{
    leftMotor.write(180); // with continuous rotation, 180 tells the servo to move at full speed ""forward.""
    rightMotor.write(0); // if both of these are at 180, the robot will go in a circle because the servos are flipped. ""0"" tells it to move full speed ""backwards.""
}




, Click the right arrow button in the upper-left corner to build and upload the program to the connected Arduino.


You may want to lift the robot off of the surface, as it will just continue to move forward once the program is uploaded.

, Add the following code to the ""void loop()"" section of your code to enable the kill switch, above the ""write()"" functions.





if(digitalRead(2) == HIGH) // this registers when the button is pressed on pin 2 of the Arduino
{
    while(1)
    {
        leftMotor.write(90); // ""90"" is neutral position for the servos, which tells them to stop turning
        rightMotor.write(90);
    }
}




, With the kill switch code added, you can upload and test the robot. It should continue to drive forward until you press the switch, at which point it will stop moving. The full code should look like this:





#include <Servo.h>
 
// the following creates two servo objects
Servo leftMotor;
Servo rightMotor;
 
void setup()
{
    leftMotor.attach(12);

Choose an alternate mode for the transformer.,
Lay out the top, right and front side views of alternate mode on a piece of graph paper.,
Lay out the top, right and front views of the robot skeleton on a separate sheet of graph paper.,
Choose a piece of the vehicle mode that looks like it could be used in robot mode.,
Pick out the next form on the vehicle mode by choosing a limb of the skeleton that is adjacent to the part just chosen.,
Design a hinge assembly.,
Continue to add parts to the robot mode by using pieces of the vehicle mode.,
After the robot mode skeleton is completely covered, fill in the vehicle mode by assigning any extra mass to limbs.,
Produce the design in some way, like a 3D model.",How to Design a Transforming Robot," Referencing can be done on the internet, though a real life reference will work better as front, right and top views will need to be drawn of the alternate mode.
, When drawing the views, it is helpful to draw a box that will encircle each view, and then drawing the view inside. Each view can be an outline of the overall form, save for any separate parts that are desired (In this case, the wheels are drawn separately because they will be independent of other parts in the final design).


If the design is going to be symmetrical along an axis, then split each view where that axis is relevant, though keep the other side for symmetric parts that will cross the axis. Snapping the drawing to the gridlines of the graph paper can make the drawing easier and will simplify the physical design process later. When laying out each view, use a straightedge to make sure that a feature in one view lines up with the same feature in a different view. It is important that the end drawing is basically a 2D representation of a 3D object.

, These views do not need to be much more detailed than stick figures; what is important are the proportions of each line because this will be the guide for the robot mode. robot mode views should take up approximately the same amount of space as the alternate mode views to ensure that the form is used efficiently; a larger skeleton would create a spindly robot and a smaller skeleton would end up with a lot of unused mass.


The robot skeleton should be drawn to the same scale as the alternate mode on the other piece of paper to ease the transfer of distances later. Making sure each limb lines up to an approximate gridline is also important, as it will make the design phase much easier.

, This is going to ground the design and create a starting point to develop the transformation from. Using a pencil, outline the form from the vehicle mode in all three views. Redraw this outlined form in the planned place on the robot mode, make sure that the part is the same in both modes (i.e make sure that the same views are visible on both sheets of paper). If the part looks OK, outline it on both sheets in the same color of colored pencil.

, What is most likely already decided is the the height of this part, so the width and length can be set to whatever looks aesthetically desiring and won't occupy the volume of another part. after the basic views of this second part are drawn onto the robot skeleton, place the same part somewhere inside the alternate mode drawings (the piece should be touching the previous part and if it does not line up exactly, follow the steps below to design a hinge


, Sometimes the part as it is placed in the alternate mode may not line up with it's placement in robot mode. A hinge can be designed that will allow two parts to relate to each other exactly in both robot mode and vehicle mode while still allowing the parts to be connected.

Draw the two pieces on another piece of paper, the exact same size and the exact same position as they are aligned in the alternate mode. If the pieces only need to be manipulated in one plane of movement, then one view is fine. Otherwise, multiple views of the relation will be required depending on how many planes the part will be rotated across.











One part will be mobile and the other grounded. Draw a dot to symbolize the axis that the piece will be rotated around and then rotate the piece about that axis (keep in mind that the part should ideally be moved into position with as least rotations as possible). Draw this updated view directly below the first for reference. When rotating about the axis, each point of the part moves in a circle. If any point of the mobile part clips the grounded part, shear the collided section off by drawing a curve from the nearest 90-degree extension from the axis past the point of collision with a red colored pencil; any part colored in red will be the new feature of that section of the part. If the part is now rotated into the correct position, then skip the next step. If not, continue on to the next step.






Select another point that will be the axis for rotation and rotate the part about that axis. Repeat this step as many times as possible to get the part in position. make sure to record the axis of rotation for each movement.
Record the position of each axis relative to the mobile and grounded parts (and possibly the other axis) of the first drawing on the third sheet of paper. If there is only one axis point, draw a circle around it that will symbolize the hinge assembly (preferably the diameter of whatever the smallest increment is on the graph paper for simplicity). If there is more than one axis point, draw a single path to the axis points using straight 90-degree lines. If the axis of rotation is located off of both parts at any given point, an extension of one of the parts might need to be drawn in place of an additional assembly. A hinge part is generated by making an eighth-inch border around the part and making the part a quarter inch thick. If more than two axis are used, the hinge assembly will require <the amount of axis points - 1> parts. The hinges will be stacked. Draw the position of the hinge(s) in both the starting and ending assembly. The hinge(s) should be the same shape, size and relation to each other in both assemblies. The hinge assembly will substitute some of the volume in the starting parts, so make sure to account for that.











Draw the hinge into both the robot mode and vehicle mode views. Use the third page to reference the position of the hinges.







, Make sure to to not use space that is used by another part(This is why there are three views) and use up as much of the alternate mode's mass as possible to minimize extraneous parts. It is OK if not all the mass of the vehicle mode is used up. Outline each new piece with a new color of colored pencil.

, It is suggested that the vehicle mode layout (and possibly the robot mode layout) be traced to account for the extra design. More hinge assemblies may be required to deal with these parts.

, Some parts may require further refining and checking, which can be done by redrawing the design and modeling the design in some form. The hinge assemblies are designed to be filled with a small pin the diameter of a paperclip (~ 1/32""). The design may need further development depending on the desired means of production.

;
, Draw a line from side to side at approximately the center. This is the “Horizon Line” or the place where the sky and earth meet. It is also referred to as “Eye Level.” At eye level, you will only see the front and one side of the rectangle.

,, It will be viewed at eye level. Draw a rectangle in the space to the right of the vanishing point on the horizon line, half above and half below.

,


Bear in mind that the only lines you will draw in this exercise will be horizontal, vertical (to the paper’s edges) or to the vanishing point.

, Erase the guide lines; the two lines to the vanishing point and the horizon line where it shows through the rectangle. Erasing the horizon line will make your rectangle appear to be a solid shape and will now be referred to as a cube.

, Make an X with your ruler from corner to corner on the first rectangle representing the front of the building. Through the center of the X, draw a vertical line. Make it as high as you want your roof peak to be.

,, Mimic the slope of the roof at the back. Do this by placing your ruler against the angle and lightly dragging it to the back. Draw this line to close the roof shape.

, Run a line from the roof peak to the vanishing point.

,, Remember to use only two kinds of lines for this: vertical or to the vanishing point. Make doors rectangular shaped, tall enough for a person to pass through. Windows can be rectangles, squares, even round. To do round, make a square and round off the four corners.

, This is a rectangle rising well above the highest peak of the roof. Add another line to give it depth.,, Copy your house to a piece of 140 pound 11” x 14” watercolor paper from a pad.

One method is to trace your sketch at the window. You might have to darken the lines of your house with pencil or fine line Sharpie for the sketch to show through onto the good paper. Hold your sketch behind the good paper and up to the light. Shift it around to determine where you want your house to go. Tack the sketch with masking tape it to the back of your good paper. Use a ruler for all lines.
Another method is to use graphite paper from the art or craft store, an artist’s erasable version of carbon paper.







, Ask yourself, what makes an house a country cottage? Do research on the internet. For ideas, Google “romantic cottages in watercolor” or “coloring pages of storybook cottages.“ Or, simply use your imagination and add whatever makes you happy.

, Siding will provide depth and texture; stucco, brick, stone, wood shingles, etc., They come in a great variety. A thatched roof is often seen in country cottages in storybooks.

, Do extra lines around it for depth and solidity. Add a window (s), texture, doorknob, raised panels, etc.

, They will represent and showcase the life that happens inside the house. Add additional lines for moldings and still more to break up the space into panes. Add window boxes and/or shutters. Show character by having them arched, narrow, or in an attic space, shaped like an eyelid., Low walls, picket or stone fences, a trellis or an arbor, shrubbery or landscaping elements, trees, paths, a rock garden or path, flowers, flagstones, etc.

, Draw landscape elements to place the house in a special setting. Vary types of tree shapes for interest., Angle it to the side, curve it and have it narrower close to the doorway and flare and fade it out as it goes into the scene. Drawing it straight down from the house and making it too rigid will have it appear to be standing upright, a situation to avoid.

, Gather whatever watercolors you prefer, brushes, a water bucket and paper towel or tissues to help control the flow of paint., Flow the paint over the shapes.

, There is no right place to begin. Work with light, diluted washes initially. This will help you see your scene in color and is easy to make corrections if you wipe away a wet area with tissue. Allow the piece to dry before doing additional layers or washes. Use a hairdryer if you wish.

, Better to stop earlier rather than overworking it. Remember there are lots of ways to edit your work, sponging off to lighten areas, over painting with another color, etc. You can add finishing touches indefinitely as they occur to you. When finished, sign your work. Start a new painting at this point., Hang it when finished and enjoy retreating to it whenever you want. No packing required.

,, Fill in with some foliage around the base of your cabin. Add shrubs, bushes, all shapes of trees, flowers, vines, ground covers of all types.

, Remember to have lines for the siding go to the vanishing points. On roof, follow the angles that are there. Finish windows and door with extra strips of wood, and show curtains.

, Trees will add height and diminish the cabin somewhat. Distant mountains or hills are a good way to make the cabin feel protected and snuggled into the scene., Review various type of siding. This can be anything you can imagine; roughly hewn logs, flag or cobblestones, knotty boards, cedar shake shingles, etc.

, Bring the scene to life by adding suggestions of people living there. Add window boxes, awnings, fancy window panes, etc. and any other ornamentation you wish.

If you've drawn in pencil, you may want to scan or photocopy it before coloring your mandala.",How to Draw a Mandala,"






;
, On a mandala template, the centre will be marked. If drawn with a compass, the hole in the paper is the centre. If drawn with a plate, draw a light line in pencil from the top to bottom, and from the left side to the right side; where these lines cross is the centre.








, Line up your motifs along directional lines. (Think of a compass, with lines North-South, East-West, NE-SW, and SE-NW.) If you have a mandala template, these will be marked on the paper. If you're drawing your own template, you'll need a ruler and protractor to mark some lines lightly on your mandala. Using 45° angles is a good standard; you will end up with 8 lines. (You can just imagine the lines, but it won't work as well.)








, A diamond or square, a circle, or a star all work well. (These are your ""motifs."")








, (You can change colors at any point.)








,, Easy motif shapes include teardrops, flowers, fans, spirals, geometric shapes, and any other forms you like, such as butterflies, birds, dolphins, etc. Repeat some of your motifs, and introduce new ones as you go. Draw some shapes on the directional lines, and some shapes between the lines, to make a more satisfying design. This is especially important as you move outward, where there's more space between the lines.








, As you move outward, your motifs may be larger since you have more space to work with. You can then start putting one shape inside another, again creating more interesting shapes.








, That's fine. The mandala is finished when it feels finished to you.








, That way you can colour it more than once, and share it with others to colour.

, Again, focus on using the 4H more. Use the 2B for the basic lines.

, Use the 4H and 2B for the shadows. Careful smudging works very well.

, 2B for basic lines, 4H for the shadows. The 2B should also be used a bit. With a lot of drawings, the bottom lip is not heavily outlined. This is where shadowing needs to be focused on more.

, This process should be done like the nose and eyes-with a 2B and 4H. Carefully does it.

, This is where smudging comes most useful. Don't be afraid to use an eraser.

For a challenge, try making a non-symmetrical Apollonian Gasket by changing the size of your second circle.",How to Create an Apollonian Gasket," The following terms are used in the instructions below:


Apollonian Gasket: One of several names for a type of fractal composed of a series of circles nested inside one large circle and tangent to all others nearby. These are also called ""Soddy Circles"" or ""Kissing Circles"".
Radius of a circle: The distance from the center point of a circle to its edge. Usually assigned the variable r.
Curvature of a circle: The positive or negative inverse of the radius, or ±1/r. Curvature is positive when dealing with the outer curvature of the circle and negative for the inner curvature.
Tangent: A term applied to lines, planes, and shapes that intersect at one infinitely small point. In Apollonian Gaskets, this refers to the fact that each circle touches each nearby circle at only one point. Note that there is no intersection - tangent shapes do not overlap.;
, Descartes's Theorem is a formula that is useful for calculating the sizes of the circles in an Apollonian Gasket. If we define the curvatures (1/r) of any three circles as a, b, and c, respectively, the Theorem states that the curvature of the circle (or circles) tangent to all three, which we will define as d, is: d = a + b + c ± 2 (sqrt (a × b + b × c + c × a )).


For our purposes, we'll generally only use the answer we obtain by putting a plus sign in front of the square root ( in other words, ... + 2 (sqrt(...)). For now, it's enough to know that the subtraction form of the equation has its uses in other related tasks.

, In the steps below, we'll make our own simple Apollonian Gasket. It's possible to draw Apollonian Gaskets by hand or on the computer. In either case, you'll want to be able to draw perfectly round circles. This is fairly important. Since every circle in an Apollonian Gasket is perfectly tangent to the circles next to it, circles that are even slightly misshapen can ""throw off"" your final product.


If drawing the Gasket on a computer, you'll need a program that allows you to easily draw circles of a fixed radius from a central point. Gfig, a vector-drawing extension for the free image editing program GIMP, can be used, as can a wide variety of other drawing programs (see the materials section for relevant links). You will also probably need a calculator application and either a word processor document or a physical notepad for taking notes on curvatures and radii.
For drawing the Gasket by hand, you'll need a calculator (scientific or graphing suggested), a pencil, compass, ruler (preferably a scale with millimeter markings, graph paper, and a notepad for note taking.

, Your first task is easy - just draw one big, perfectly round circle. The bigger the circle is, the more complex your Gasket can be, so try to make a circle as large as your paper allows or as large as you can easily see in one window on your drawing program.

, Next, draw another circle inside the first that's smaller than the original, but still fairly large. The exact size of the second circle is up to you - there is no correct size. However, for our purposes, let's draw our second circle so that it reaches exactly halfway across our large outer circle. In other words, let's draw our second circle so that its central point is the midpoint of the large circle's radius.


Remember that in Apollonian Gaskets, all circles that touch are tangent to each other. If you're using a compass to draw your circles by hand, recreate this effect by putting the sharp point of the compass at the midpoint of the large outer circle's radius, adjusting your pencil so that it just touches the edge of the large circle, then drawing your smaller inner circle.

, Next, let's draw another circle across from our first one. This circle should be tangent to both the large outer circle and the smaller inner circle, which means that your two inner circles will touch at the exact midpoint of the large outer circle.

, Let's stop drawing for a moment. Now that we have three circles in our Gasket, we can use Descartes's Theorem to find the radius of the next circle we'll draw. Remember that Descartes's Theorem is d = a + b + c ± 2 (sqrt (a × b + b × c + c × a )), where a, b, and c are the curvatures of your three tangent circles and d is the curvature of the circle tangent to all three. So, to find the radius of our next circle, let's find the curvature of each of the circles we have so far so that we can find the curvature of the next circle, then convert this to its radius.


Let's define the radius of our outer circle as 1. Because the other circles are inside this one, we're dealing with its interior curvature (rather than its exterior curvature), and, consequently, we know its curvature is negative. - 1/r = -1/1 = -1. The big circle's curvature is -1.
The smaller circles' radii are half as large as the big circle's, or, in other words, 1/2. Since these circles are touching each other and the large circle with their outside edge, we're dealing with their exterior curvature, so their curvatures are positive. 1/(1/2) = 2. The smaller circles' curvatures are both 2.
Now, we know that a = -1, b = 2, and c = 2 for our Descartes's Theorem equation. Let's solve for d:

d = a + b + c ± 2 (sqrt (a × b + b × c + c × a ))
d = -1 + 2 + 2 ± 2 (sqrt (-1 × 2 + 2 × 2 + 2 × -1 ))
d = -1 + 2 + 2 ± 2 (sqrt (-2 + 4 + -2 ))
d = -1 + 2 + 2 ± 0
d = -1 + 2 + 2
d = 3. The curvature of our next circle is 3. Since 3 = 1/r, the radius of our next circle is 1/3.



, Use the radius value you just found to draw your next two circles. Remember that these will be tangent to the circles whose curvatures you used for a, b, and c in Descartes's Theorem. In other words, they will be tangent to both the original and second circles. For these circles to be tangent to all three circles, you'll need to draw them in the open spaces in the top and bottom of the area inside your large original circle.


Remember that these circles' radii will be equal to 1/3. Measure 1/3 back from the edge of the outer circle, then draw your new circle. It should be tangent to all three of the surrounding circles.

, Because they are fractals, Apollonian Gaskets are infinitely complex. This means you can add smaller and smaller circles to your heart's content. You're limited only be the precision of your tools (or, if you're using a computer, the ability of your drawing program to ""zoom in""). Each circle, no matter how small, should be tangent to three other circles. To draw each subsequent circle in your Gasket, plug the curvatures of the three circles it will be tangent to into Descartes's Theorem. Then, use your answer (which will be the radius of your new circle) to draw your new circle accurately.


Note that the Gasket we've chosen to draw is symmetrical, so the radius of one circle is the same as the corresponding circle ""across from it"". However, know that not every Apollonian Gasket is symmetrical.
Let's tackle one more example. Let's say that, after drawing our last set of circles, we now want to draw the circles that are tangent to our third set, our second set, and our large outer circle. The curvatures of these circles are 3, 2, and -1, respectively. Let's plug these numbers into Descartes's Theorem, setting a = -1, b = 2, and c = 3:

d = a + b + c ± 2 (sqrt (a × b + b × c + c × a ))
d = -1 + 2 + 3 ± 2 (sqrt (-1 × 2 + 2 × 3 + 3 × -1 ))
d = -1 + 2 + 3 ± 2 (sqrt (-2 + 6 + -3))
d = -1 + 2 + 3 ± 2 (sqrt (1))
d = -1 + 2 + 3 ± 2
d = 2, 6. We have two answers! However, because we know that our new circle will be smaller than any of the circles it is tangent to, only a curvature of 6 (and therefore a radius of 1/6) makes sense.
Our other answer, 2, actually refers to the hypothetical circle on the other side of the tangent point of our second and third circles. This circle is tangent to both of these circles and to the large outer circle, but it would intersect the circles we've already drawn, so we can disregard it.



, All Apollonian Gaskets start the same - with a large exterior circle that acts as the edge of the fractal. However, there's no reason that your second circle necessarily has to have 1/2 the radius of the first - we just chose to do this above because it's simple and easy to understand. For fun, try starting a new Gasket with a second circle of a different size - this will lead to exciting new avenues of exploration.


After drawing your second circle (regardless of its size), your next act should be to draw one or more circles that are tangent both to it and to the large outer circle - there's no right way to do this, either. After this, you can use Descartes's Theorem to determine the radii of any subsequent circles, as shown above.

Build the gimbal.,
File down the bottom edges of these blocks as needed so the pendulum doesn't hit them when it swings.,

Attach an oak block under the table for a deeper hole and better support.

,
Tie a string to the balsa arms where they are connected together, lead it through a screw-eye on top of the pole, and back down to a small jam cleat or groove where it can hold the pen in place above the paper until you are ready to lower it.

",How to Make a Three Pendulum Rotary Harmonograph," This table top is a 3'x3' square of 3/4"" thick plywood. The legs are 1½"" x 1½"" square and about 37"" long, with triangular braces cut from 1½"" x 8""x 12"" wooden pieces. The legs are splayed out slightly to give the table strength, and to allow the rotary pendulum to swing without hitting a leg.


Screw and/or glue the braces to the legs first, and then cut their tops together at a slight angle with a table or circular saw.






Adjust the leg lengths to give a table-top height of about 37"".






If you want to be able to fit the table through doorways without taking off the legs, you might need slightly shorter legs and pendulums.





;
, Drill 3 holes of 3"" diameter through the table surface for the pendulums to hang through. The hole for the rotary pendulum should be centered in a corner about 8"" from each side just clear of the leg brace underneath. The other two holes should be aligned near the opposite edges, about 8"" from the common side, and 3"" from the other. You'll need a special large circular drill bit for this. Alternatively you can first drill a smaller hole, and then cut a wider opening with a jigsaw.

,


Start the indentation in the metal plate with a small drill bit (such as 1/8"") and then continue with a larger bit (such as 1/4""). Be careful not to drill all the way through.






Unless you have a good drill press, it may be easier to position the indentations of the plates on the table after you create the fulcrum blocks with protruding screws below, because it can be harder to accurately position the screws in the blocks later to align with the indentations.

, The pendulum shafts are made from 4' long 3/4"" diameter wooden dowels. Hardwood blocks, 3/4"" x 1½"" oak, are used as a fulcrums so the pendulums can rest and rock on the table with minimal friction. For the two lateral pendulums, use 5"" long blocks, and for the rotary pendulum, use a 2¼"" long block. Drill a 3/4"" hole through the center of each block, and screw 1¼"" #10 screws through each end. The tips of the screws will rest in the indentations of the metal plates on the table to keep them in place while rocking.

, Glue and/or screw them such that the screw tips are 12"" from the top end of the dowel and facing downwards. The pendulum should hang down 36"" below the top surface of the table with about a 1"" clearance from the floor.

, The rotary pendulum needs a gimbal mechanism that allows it to swing in any direction. This is made from a large metal washer with 2½"" outer and 1"" inner diameter. The washer rests on screw tips protruding from under the table, and then the pendulum rests on the washer. Drill pairs of indentations into the washer on each side, off 90 degrees between the sides, to allow rocking on two perpendicular axes.


Here are views of the rotary pendulum gimbal from above and below the table. In the view from below, note the oak blocks (3/4"" x 1½"" x 5"") supporting the two screws (1¾"" #10) protruding upwards and diagonally.







, Likewise file down the corners of the fulcrum block if necessary so it doesn't hit the table when swinging.

, 2½ lb lifting weights from a sporting goods store work well, but typically have a 1"" interior hole. You can stack several weights and slide them together onto the 3/4"" pendulum dowel by using a 5"" long 3/4"" metal pipe nipple, with a 3/4"" to 1"" bushing screwed onto the lower end. A 1"" steel clamp attached to the dowel fixes the weights from sliding off, and allows easy adjustment of the weight's height to give different swinging frequencies.

, Cut about 1"" off the top of the rotary pendulum dowel, so it is slightly lower than the other two. Then mount an 11""x11"" square of thin 1/8"" board to the top of this pendulum, using a small oak block glued to it for support, with a 3/4"" hole for the dowel.


Wrap some tape around the top of the dowel to get a tight fit, or just glue it on.






Use two rubber bands, or some clips, to hold the paper in place on the platform.







, Connect a 30"" long balsa stick to the top of each lateral pendulum using a thin nail. Bend the nail back and forth a little in the balsa to allow the the arm to rotate smoothly and move up and down slightly. The nail hole will slowly loosen further during use.

, Note that if you plan to use your harmonograph regularly, such as in a museum setting, a more robust solution for these arms that won't wear as quickly might be necessary.

, To make a simple pen-holder, drill a 1/2"" hole on the end of one arm, and cut about 4"" down the center of the arm to make a clothes-pin like device. Alternatively, just glue a real clothes-pin to the end of one of the arms. Pictures of both versions are shown.

, It is convenient to be able to raise and lower the pen gently without disturbing the motion of the pendulums. To do this, insert a 30"" pole into a hole near the center of the table, just far enough from the paper platform that it won't be hit by it (about 12"" from the rotary pendulum hole).

Think about what you want to symbolize.,

Pick the image that works best for your product.,
Keep it simple.,
Pay attention to color.,
Evaluate your final symbol.",How to Create a Symbol1," Think about the objects or images that carry meaning for you. Make a list of all of these objects and images. If you are designing a symbol for your product, then try to think about what images best represent your product.


Keep in mind that your symbol does not need to be a literal representation of your product, but it should have a strong connection with your brand. For example, having a shoe as your symbol might be too literal if your product is shoes. Instead, you might represent what the shoes allow wearers to do with your symbol, such as run faster or enjoy the outdoors more.
If you are designing a personal symbol, then focus on images or objects that might represent important aspects of your personality, heritage, or the message that you want to send.For example, if you are Irish you might incorporate the shamrock or some elements of Celtic design into your symbol.;
, Gather some materials for sketching such as paper, pens or pencils, and draw a rough sketch of each of the images or objects you listed. The sketches don't have to be perfect, but remember you want your symbol to send a clear message to people who see it.


As you sketch, try to keep your goals for the symbol in mind. What message do you want to send?

, After you finish your sketches, look over them and think about which one is the most effective. If you are creating a symbol for your business, then the image should be something that is eye catching and easy to recognize. Try to pick the image that you feel has the strongest impact.Try showing your sketches to different people and see which one they prefer. Make sure to ask them why they prefer this image as well. You can use the input to adjust your symbol if needed.

, Simplicity is key in creating an effective symbol. Try not to over design your symbol with lots of embellishments and details. Remove any unnecessary detail or anything visually distracting. Once you have identified any unnecessary or distracting elements, you can either erase them or start over.Some examples of simple yet effective symbols include the Nike swoosh, the Olympic rings, and the Microsoft windows.

, The color of your symbol can also have a strong effect on the way that people perceive the symbol. Familiarizing yourself with basic color theory can help you to come up with a harmonious and visually arresting symbol.


If you are using multiple colors in your symbol design, then make sure that they complement one another. For example, you might chose two polar opposites such as black and white, or two shades of one color, such as light blue and dark blue. Other colors can be jarring if placed beside each other, such as orange and pink.Experts in the psychology of color argue that we have emotional responses to certain colors.Consider this when choosing colors for your symbol. For example, red can signify energy, power, passion, anger, and blood., When you have finished creating your symbol, take a closer look at it and try to determine if there is anything else that might improve it. Some questions you might ask yourself include:


Is it simple and appealing?
Does it communicate your message well?
Do the colors work?
Is there anything (big or small) that you’d like to change about it?

Done!",How to Draw the Golden Spiral1," You'll need to draw a system of squares that will end up ""inscribing"" the spiral, acting as guide lines for your drawing. Gather your materials, making sure that you have everything––the list of what is needed is found in the Things You'll Need section below all the steps.;
, This works by adding the two previous numbers: You get the next one starting from 0 and 1; so, it goes 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, etc. The length of one side of each square should equal a number in the sequence (the 0 is not needed for drawing any of the square), but the beginning point can be called (0,0), if we set it up that way. You will have a 1X1 square (use any unit of measurement you want, at any size, just be consistent) with a second 1X1 drawn next to it on the left side of the first, then down to put 2X2, and right for 3X3, then up for 5X5, and then left to fit 8X8. Below all that, put 13X13 and so on, to as large a square as your paper can fit.

, Draw each of these squares in a counter-clockwise pattern. It will finally form a spiral as you draw a curve through the squares (as instructed later).

, Put your compass, pivot point and pencil, as shown in the picture, with its length set at one unit (side of the first square) long. Turn it 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

, Adjust the compass so it is now two units long. Again, turn it 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Then 3, then 5, next 8 and continue this process until the squares each have the curving spiral through them.

Think about what you want your logo to represent.,
Choose the letters that you want to have in your logo.,
Choose a striking font.,
Use a specific design program or an online application.,
Get creative.,
Evaluate your logo for readability and clarity.,
Hire a professional graphic designer.",How to Create a Symbol2," Logotypes are the stylized and graphic illustration of a name or a group of letters. Logos differ from abstract symbols because logos include text. Logos are usually associated with brands or products, but some people have personal logos as well. You might want to create a logo for your business or just for your name or initials.


Before you get started, think about why you are creating a logo. For example, do you want to include a logo on your job application materials or personal website to help you stand out?Or will this logo appear on your products?
You should also consider who will be viewing your logo and for what purpose. What might appeal to this audience? For example, will the intended audience respond better to some modern-looking or something more traditional?

, Your logo can be a full or partial part of your business name or personal name. If you are creating a logo for your business, then you may want to have the full business name in the logo or just abbreviate it. If you are creating a personal logo, then you may want to use your full name or just your initials.


If you decide to use an abbreviation, then you may need to add a symbol or a design element to make sure that your audience knows that the symbol represents you or your business.

, Some fonts can evoke powerful emotions and feelings, while others may appear bland and emotionless. The font that you choose is central to your logo so make sure that you choose one that is striking but also easy to read.


Try checking the fonts that are available in your word processing software or check out online databases of fonts for ideas and inspiration.If you decide to use more than one font, try to keep the number of different fonts to a minimum. Experts recommend using just one or two., There are many design programs available that can help you to perfect your logo. You can use a design program to produce your logo as a jpeg, tif or png file which can be easily circulated and added to different kinds of documents.



Adobe Illustrator is one of the most popular graphic design software programs.
You are usually required to pay for these programs, but it might be a worthwhile investment if you need a high-quality logo or if you are planning to produce multiple logos.

, In order to make your letters into a recognizable, original and striking logo you will have to use your imagination and think creatively.


As with symbols, color is important. For example, if you are designing a logo for an all-natural face cream, then you might choose earth-tones to communicate to your audience that the product is natural and free of artificial ingredients.In contrast, bright neon colors might send your audience the message that the product is more artificial or high-tech.
Try joining the letters together in an aesthetically pleasing way. For example, you can use shared strokes to link the letters together., Clarity is important when you are designing a logo. Make sure that the logo still looks the same when it is re-sized. It should be easy to read and look good no matter what size it is. Remember your logo may be printed on different sized materials, like on a small business card.


Make sure that the image is still recognizable if it is inverted as well.If you are using the logo for printed materials then print out the logo and look at it as it would appear on paper. This might help you to identify flaws easier than when you look at it on your computer screen.

, If you are struggling to design an effective logo, consider hiring a professional designer. The top firms charge thousands of dollars for logo design but there may be a freelance designer in your area that will charge less.


Try to find a designer who specializes in creating logos for your particular purpose. He or she may have some great ideas about what will work best for your needs."

Consider hiring an attorney.,
Complete a search for similar trademarks.,
Look for potential logo and symbol similarities.,
Fill out a trademark application.,
Pay the filing fee.",How to Create a Symbol3," Trademarking a symbol or logo for your business is a complex process and there are several things that can go wrong. Consulting an attorney who specializes in trademark law is the best way to protect yourself and your business from problems later on.Keep in mind that trademarks, copyrights, and patents protect different types of intellectual property. Trademarks are used to protect symbols, logos, and designs that distinguish your company’s products from your competitors., Before you decide to trademark your symbol or logo, it is important to conduct a search for similar trademarks. Otherwise, you run the risk of trademarking a symbol or logo that is identical or similar to a competitor’s symbol or logo.


You can search for similar trademarks at: http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks-application-process/search-trademark-database


, As you search the database for similar logos and symbols, you should consider the similarities between your logo and/or symbol and those of your competitors. Some things that may affect whether or not your trademark will be accepted include:Sound. Even if your logo is spelled differently than your competitor’s logo, the way the words in the logo sound can be grounds for rejecting a trademark application. For example, if your competitor’s product is called “J. Time,” you could not call your product “Jay Thyme.” These both sound the same when you say them.

Appearance. Trademarks also cannot look the same. Therefore, you could not use “J. Time” as your logo with a different font. For a symbol, you could not use an image that looks similar to one of your competitors.

Meaning. Logos cannot share meaning either. For example, you could not have a brand logo called “Fortunate” if your competitor’s logo bore the name “Lucky.” These words mean almost the same thing.

Commercial Impression. You also cannot use a symbol or logo that might lead to confusion for your customers. For example, you could not use the same symbol as a competitor and just leave out the words in the logo. The image would confuse customers about whether or not the product was made by your competitor.

, Once you are certain that your product’s logo and/or symbol does not infringe on any of your competitors’ logos or symbols, then you can complete an application to register your trademark.


You can file your application online by visiting: http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks-application-process/filing-online


, The cost of filing for a trademark is somewhat high. It ranges between $225 and $325, depending on the type of form you fill out. The three different types of forms include the TEAS plus form, TEAS reduced fee form, and the TEAS regular form.For the plus form and the reduced fee form, you will need to authorize email communication.
You have to complete a full application for the plus form, which offers the lowest filing fee ($225).
The TEAS regular form is ideal for those who do not want to complete the full application right away and do not want to receive correspondence via email."

, It should be congruent and behind the first square you drew. You should now have two squares overlapping one another. The further they are apart, the longer your house will be. (For a relatively square house, the distance between the squares should be about a quarter of either square’s length.)

, Draw lines connecting the corners of each square. Make sure you connect each to the nearest corner, and that you then connect that to the other square. This will make your squares into a three-dimensional cube.

, This will determine the point of the roof. It should be high in comparison to the house’s base, but not more than half its height.

, They should all be attached to the dot by a smooth, straight line. This will be the roof.

, All of your inner lines should be gone except for the line that differentiates the roof from the base of the house. (You can still erase it if you want, but it will be harder to tell where the house stops and the roof begins.)

, The windows should be small and square, and not too close to the walls’ edges. The door is a rectangle with a circle for a doorknob. If you want you can draw a window on the side of the house, but it needs to be a parallelogram, not a square.

, Create details and make sure you shade correctly. It works best if you choose a bright color for the base of the house, and an equally bright color for the roof. Then take darker versions of these colors, and color in the other side with them; this will shade your drawing effectively.

",How to Make a Paper iPhone," Use an online image search for the type of iPhone you want. Since different generations of iPhones have different dimensions, you’ll want to do a search for the specific generation you want.








If you search for the generation you want with “paper craft” also in the search bar, you should come up with several results that are to the proper scale.;
, Use a high-quality printer to print your iPhone template. You can use plain printer paper, but glossy photo paper is going to give you a much better result.







, Many paper craft templates will actually have the lines around which you need to cut the template. Cut the screen, back, and sides of the phone out of the piece of paper.








Don’t cut the pieces out separately. You will make folds in the paper to form the shape of the iPhone, so you will need to cut the template out as one piece rather than cutting out the screen, then the back, etc., Make a 90-degree fold on each “side” of the phone. This will give you the general shape of the phone. You will still have small tabs along the outside edge of the phone. Don’t worry about those just yet; they’re where you will eventually glue the folds together.








, In order to give the phone some stability and heft, you should place a piece of cardboard inside the template before gluing it together. Start by tracing the screen size on a piece of cardboard.









If you really want to make a sturdy prop, then you can always make the filler from plywood instead of cardboard.

, After you have the design traced, cut out the piece of cardboard. Be careful to make straight cuts so that it doesn’t misshape the paper when you place it inside.









Depending the the thickness of cardboard you use and the dimension of the generation of iPhone you printed, you may need two or even three pieces of cardboard to reach the proper thickness. If this is the case, line all of them up, so they’re flush and glue them together.

, Once you have the cardboard to the proper thickness, place it between the front and back portion of the template. Use a small dab from a glue stick to glue the cardboard to the screen and back so that it doesn’t move around inside the finished product.









The cardboard should be the same size as the folded template, but even a tiny amount of slippage can bulge the paper or make visible creases in it.

, Use the glue stick on the protruding tabs on the template and finish assembling the phone. It will be as simple as sliding the tab under the overlapping part of the template, lining it up so it doesn’t appear jagged on the printed portion, and holding it for a moment to dry.








Many paper craft templates may also have slots for you to stick the tabs into to help hold the finished product together., A thin, clear piece of plastic on the screen will give the printed home screen a more textured and glossy look. Start by tracing the screen size on the piece of plastic.









The piece of plastic should be rigid but still very thin. The type of plastic that libraries use as jacket covers on hardback books is perfect; however, do not vandalize a library book. If you ask nicely, they might simply give you one, or you can use another similar material.

, Make sure you cut very straight and inside the line where you traced the image, so you can’t see the lines you drew on the material.









Don’t worry if this makes the screen cover very slightly smaller than the iPhone shape since screen covers usually are a tiny bit smaller anyway.

, The Home button at the bottom of the iPhone screen is always slightly concave. By cutting a small circle the size of the Home button out of the plastic, you’ll give the space a stronger illusion of depth. Use a craft knife so you can cut out the circle without actually cutting all the way to the edge of the plastic.








, Use a very small piece of clear double-sided tape to affix the screen cover to the screen portion of the phone. With the gloss from the piece of plastic, you’ll hardly be able to see the tape.









If you print the initial template on glossy photo paper, this will make the tape even more difficult to see.

Print the CD covers.,
Print on heavy-duty CD cover paper.",How to Design CD Covers1," A variety of computer software programs equipped for designing and printing individualized CD covers are available, most of them available for free download. You can customize your own photos, add text, and size them appropriate for jewel cases, or your own slip-cases. Any of the following are perfect for designing CDs:

Print Master Gold;
, In some programs, you'll be able to select this when you open the program, but if you're using a multi-purpose software, like Illustrator, you'll have to define the size of the project. CDs are 4.724 inches square (120mm x 120 mm), so use the box tool or set your parameters accordingly.It might be appropriate to change the background color to something like dark gray, or whatever you'd like the base color scheme of the CD to be, to make the changes more obvious.
If you want to create the back cover for a jewel case, as well, the dimensions are 5.906 in. x 4.646 in. (150 mm x 118 mm), to make space for the folding line. To create the back cover, follow the same steps as follow.

, This tutorial will assume you're using an Illustrator-like program, but you should defer to the specific design software you're using. In general, though, you want to create a new layer on top of the base layer, then select an appropriate image for the cover.


Browse through your saved photos or search for one online. The simpler, the better, in general. You can change the background color scheme to match your desired image later, if necessary.
Select ""Import Image"" and resize and trim the image to fit the box, if necessary. You can usually do this by dragging.
Alternatively, if you're trying to replace a lost cover, you can search for and save an image of the cover online and import that. Skip the next few steps and go straight to printing, if this is the case.

, Add another layer on top of the image and draw a text box to include text on the CD cover. Use complementary fonts, sizing, and coloring to match the image you selected for the cover. Generally, you won't need to include more than the title and the name of the artist, or you could just include something simple, like ""Dave's Awesome Mix"" if it's a CD of your own making. It's also perfectly fine to leave text off entirely for a more artistic look.

, Any time you're printing and cutting, the edges may very occasionally, so you should probably keep the most valuable imagery and text somewhere near the middle of the design. Try to keep important stuff at least an 1/8 of an inch away from the borders., Make sure to make sure the sizing parameters in your printer match the size of the CD cover. Select ""Print Preview"" to be sure that you don't need to resize the document before you print out a physical copy.

, This can be found at most arts and crafts stores, as well as office supply facilities. CD cover paper is perforated on the edges, allowing you to easily break apart the individual front and back covers.

Finished.",How to Make a Toilet Paper Cable Organizer," It helps to identify what cords and cables need tidying before making the organizer––in some cases, you might need to make a few to account for the different parts of the house where cords tend to ""gather"".

Ask family members to let you know what chargers, cords or other cable devices they have at their own desks and work areas, so that your inventory accounts for everyone's needs. Ask them if they'd like a cable organizer and mark down how many you'll need to make.



 


Categorize “like” cables into piles. You may be able to use one toilet paper storage roll for more than one cord or charger if they're small enough.






Determine if all the relevant cables/cords can be stored safely inside a toilet paper roll. In some cases, the cord will be too long, thick or oversized and won’t fit inside the toilet paper roll. In some cases, it isn't going to be a good idea to bend or flex the cord to fit.





;
, While in many cases a shoebox will work perfectly, if you have a multitude of cables, you might need a larger box. The size of the box will also be affected by where you intend to place it, such as on or behind the desk, on a shelf, etc.

Choose a strong box in excellent condition. If you cannot find a decent box, consider purchasing a Tupperware bin or small storage box. It needs to be durable and strong.






Stock up on toilet paper rolls. Ask family members to keep the cardboard roll––simply provide a bin or hang a bag on the back of the bathroom door where you can collect the rolls. It may take a few weeks to build up an adequate supply unless you're already hoarding the rolls for craft purposes.






Only keep toilet paper rolls that are in good condition. Throw away crushed or ripped ones, as they won't work.







, Try the simple approach first, of lining them up side by side. Depending on the shape of the box, you may need to angle some of the rolls or move them around a bit to fit properly. Experiment with what works best.


Glue the toilet paper rolls down to the bottom of the box. Alternatively, bunch them together and bind with tape. Either way, you’ll need to find a way to secure the rolls inside the box. Depending on the size and number of empty rolls, choose a system that will keep them in place (either through tape or glue).






If the box is large enough, it's a good idea to designate an extra ""free space"" area that will hold those cords that are too big to fit inside the toilet paper rolls. For example, if there is space, set aside a small area alongside the box wall to lay longer cords on the side––block off the area with a piece of cardboard in order to keep the toilet paper rolls in place. (It will be stronger if the card is glued in place but you won't be able to shift it to enlarge or decrease the space once glued.)







, Shift and move the rolls around as needed, to accommodate the cords.

Where possible, try stuffing in two (or more) like-cords in the same toilet paper roll. By categorizing the same type cords together, they're easier to find and space is conserved.






Fiddle a bit to find the optimal organizational flow. You may find you keep rearranging things to make it easier to access the most-used cords, cables and chargers; rearrange until you're satisfied with how it works, then stick to the pattern you've created.







, The box isn't the star of the show, it's just a functional item. Place it out of sight if possible (or decorate it if you want it on show). It's a really good idea to place a lid on it if possible, as this will prevent any build-up of dust and fluff.

, Enjoy being able to quickly access your cords and cables from the one spot.

Prepare the CD case.,
Use good-quality cardstock for the base.,
Plan your design.,
Decide how you'll do the text.,
Consider scanning your image.",How to Design CD Covers2," If you just want to make a new insert for a jewel case that you already have, remove the old one, or clean up the jewel case some for the new cover. Remove stickers, fingerprints, and other markings from the case with a fine cloth and a small amount of isopropyl alcohol.


Alternatively, you may find it easier to buy new jewel cases for your CD or for burned CDs. Full-size, with the capacity for back covers, and half-size jewel cases are available, usually in bulk. Since they have a tendency to break over time, it's a good idea to buy new ones.

, Get some heavy-duty cardstock that's still thin enough to fit inside the jewel case comfortably and cut it to size using a paper-cutter, or scissors. Use the following dimensions as a guide:


Front cover: 4.724 inches x 4.724 inches (120mm x 120 mm)
Back cover: 5.906 inches x 4.646 inches (150 mm x 118 mm

, The image you create for the cover can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be. Consider the songs that are on the CD and the image they create, and start going through old magazines, text books, snapshots, and other materials for collage elements. It's usually a goo idea to use a pencil to lightly draw in where your CD cover images will be placed before you get started, as a template, but it's also good to just start free-handing if you want to experiment.


Old textbooks can be a great source of weird images and diagrams that can make for good CD art. Head to the thrift store or the library for toss-aways that you can cut up.
Try combining disparate elements to make for weirdness. A picture from a cereal box can look suddenly great for a punk rock CD, when everyone's eyes are cut out.
When you have your images, start gluing them on, using a simple glue stick. It might seem too primitive, but a good quality Elmer's glue stick or rubber cement is usually the best way of getting the pieces down on the base.

, You can hand-write the text onto the image lightly, using pencil and then going over it with dark marker, or you can print out individual words and glue them onto the image separately for a DIY look.


It can also look cool to use stamps to mark out letters and words on the cover. Invest in a set of stamps at a craft store that you'll be able to use for label-making.
Want a real punk alternative? Go ransom note. Cut out individual letters from the newspaper and magazines and spell out your title and the name of your band on the cover. It'll look slightly psychotic and totally rad.

, To mass-produce your hand-designed cover, you'll need to scan the image into the computer and follow the steps in the previous method. That will be much easier than drawing them out, one by one.


Likewise, if you want to design a 3D image, made up of collage and hand-drawn elements, it might be better to scan it and print out a 2D image to keep in the jewel case.

Use plain paper to fold a sleeve.,
Secure the folds with staples or glue.,
Design the sleeves accordingly.,
Slip into a plastic slip case for protection.",How to Design CD Covers3," If you want to make up a simple sleeve to keep a CD in that you can design by hand, all you need is a piece of paper, some glue, and some good folding. It's easy, if you've got a ruler or a CD for a guide. All you've got to do is:


Fold a sheet of US letter-sized, or A4 sized paper horizontally, leaving a 1-inch (2.5 cm) overlap.
Fold in both sides approximately 1.75 inches (4.5 cm) inward.
Open the paper flat and re-fold the two vertical side strips, then slide the CD into the pocket of the longer side, beneath the vertical side strips.
Refold over the horizontal and fold in the 1-inch (2.5 cm) overlap to complete the square.
Tuck the overlap into the remaining pocket and press flat.

, After you create the pocket, it's a good idea to secure it to make sure the CD will stay up and won't fall apart when you give it away to someone. Good options are usually staples, glue, or even just tape.

, Use the same method described in the previous section, using old pictures or drawings to decorate the outside of the CD case as normal. It's usually a good idea to remove the CD from the sleeve while you're doing this, so you don't have to worry about messing it up with glue or ink.


One cool idea is actually designing the paper before you fold it, making the image wrap around the outside of the case. It can make the case look unique, if you don't know where the folds are going to be in each one.

, One little hack for securing your DIY CD cases is to take the pages from one of those old CD books people used to carry around in their cars, pre-iPods, and carefully cut the pockets out to use for security. You can even use these and just slip CD-sized track lists into the same pocket for a quick alternative.

Color the computer, if you wish.

",How to Draw a Computer," This will be your computer's monitor. For LCD monitors, make the rectangular cube be a bit thinner and a bit closer to the first cube you drew of a line connecting the two sides (front and back together).;
, Newer monitors have buttons on the side that are away from the mainstream seen area that are drawn as an oval or circle with the power symbol that looks like a circle that isn't closed at the top and have a perpendicular line extending from above this cut out into the center point of the circle (and that isn't attached to either part of the circular part of the symbol, but the olden-days monitors of the late 80s and early 90s contained on-off switches for the monitor that can be drawn as a rectangular switch on one of the sides of the monitor.

, This will be it's stand that will seem like it connects in the back of the monitor.

, The absolute base point of this, creates the stability point for the monitor, ensuring the stand won't have the computer fall over on it's own. If this computer is an LCD monitor, you can also make it curved, as long as it has a connection point to the monitor itself while the glass panel seems to hang freely from the connection point in back of the monitor.

, Draw a rectangular cube to the right of the computer's monitor. Make sure to draw a small circle for the power button on it and a thin long oval and a button or two inside of it for the CD/DVD/Blu-ray drive.


Older computers of the 80s and 90s were elongated and even half as tall as those we know today as a CPU. Many had square diskette drives where 3.5 inch and 5.25 inch disks(to scale, these would seem smaller) could be inserted that weren't drawn as an ovular shape, but had an additional green light on the smaller drive and an additional closing switch (that can be drawn as a J-shaped hook over top of the disk drive itself).
Optical drives can be a bit trickier to draw (however, they're drawable too.) These drives are thin ovals that are a little bit wider than they are thick. Current drawn drives like this are generally operated as disc slide-in insert versions and those drives not requiring a tray. Although these types were popular in the late 90s and early 2000, a bunch of these types are still operable to this day in 2017!

, The square layout should resemble the key layout on your keyboard.

, If you want a simpler version, you can draw an oval shape with the top divided into two and a button placed in the middle.

, Draw one other cube (or rectangular cube). For older style printers, you can draw to unconnected lines coming out of the top - as these are the paper feeder spot. For the newer printers, you can adjust the placement and angle at which this paper feeding area is placed and place it below that and curve the lines at the end in the style of a cube. You can make this one hard-wired or wireless, dependent on your thoughts on the matter.

, If you wish, you can also draw a set of speakers, a UPS, a Wi-Fi router,and other accessories.

, Try to avoid drawing wires through other pieces that aren't being connected. Don't draw wires through your LCD monitor's base if it connected to a set of speakers and if it's coming from the CPU.

, Apple products look like an apple that's had a bite taken out of it from the top-righthand side (jagged as it may be), while Hewlett-Packard (just the two lettered lower-case""hp"" denoted) and Dell (with it's all uppercase ""DELL"" insignia denoted) and several other major ones are just alphabetical letters. Gateway is a Dalmatian-spotted (almost 3D like) box above the word ""Gateway"" (where the G dips below (by a little) the rest of the word in it's traditional form ""ateway"").

In the case of the former Gateway logo, one of these ""spots"" on the box was colored in green while the remainder were colored in black.
On a really old Apple computer, the apple was colored in rainbow colors, starting with the apple's stem colored in, in green.While not used too much anymore in homes, there are big companies such as IBM which had it's trademark IBM logo in the bottom right of all the products they made.,"

Imagine the setting.,
Plan out the militaries.,
Think about the weapons.,
Draw the background.,
Draw the militaries.,
If you want, add details to the soldiers.,
Draw the weapons if you haven't already.",How to Draw a Good War Scene," When and where is the fight taking place? Is it in a town, an open field, a small village, or somewhere else?


If the battle is in a town, make sure to draw houses or buildings. Keep in mind that depending on the time period the town was built in, the buildings and paving will be different - if the town resembles a Medieval European setting, the roads may be paved with stones. Conversely, if the battle takes place in a futuristic city, the buildings may be illuminated in manners that they wouldn't usually be.
An open field can be useful if you want to show different fighting types, such as trench warfare or using new weapons for the time. However, it can be unrealistic if the battle is taking place somewhere important, such as a country's capital.
Keep in mind the time and weather of the battle. Are the soldiers fighting under the cover of darkness, or are they battling in broad daylight? Is it storming or snowing, mildly cloudy, or is the sky clear?;
, Make sure that the members of each army can be distinguished.


When drawing people, make sure that they look somewhat real. A soldier without eyes, hands or arms wouldn't be drafted into the military.
How many sides are fighting against each other? Is it a simple one-against-one war, or are certain sides being backed up by their allies?
A lot of soldiers wear uniforms, as opposed to normal clothing or metal armor. If these are added into the picture, it should make it easier to tell which side is which.

, How are the sides fighting each other? Are they using swords and shields, guns and tanks, planes and ships, or computers?


If you want it to be realistic, try to make the weapons match the time period - a medieval setting wouldn't have highly advanced guns. Likewise, a sword in a futuristic time period wouldn't make a lot of sense, and the soldier wielding the sword would likely get killed very quickly to the opposing soldier with a gun. However, keep in mind that if one side isn't as technologically advanced, while the other is much further ahead, it would make more sense for an army to have somewhat older weapons while another army has extremely advanced weapons.
In a futuristic time period where everything is dependent on computer technology, this could make cyber warfare an interesting prospect. Holograms could intercept one army, or messages wouldn't make it through to another. However, there are limits to what computers can do. It's extremely unlikely that a computer hacker could put up a solid wall on a battlefield through the computer.

, Do a light sketch, in order to make sure it can be easily erased if needed when drawing the battle. Don't have flat landscapes - unless the soldiers are fighting in something such as trench warfare, it's not likely to be that simple.


If the battle is taking place in a major city, such as a country's capital, keep in mind that armies will likely be targeting buildings, as well. The city is not going to look perfect. There are many different things that can be done to buildings - they can be bombed, set on fire, vandalized, you name it. Do what feels right for the scene.
Keep in mind that most landscapes are not perfect. Open land will likely have some hills or dips, and cities may be sloped due to being located on hills. There may be obstacles on the battleground, such as trees, vehicles, boulders, or debris.
If the battle site has been the site of marches or other destruction, there will already be some damaged parts of it, and any low-growing plants and trees will be trampled, ripped out, or just broken. Keep in mind that if the site was set on fire at some point beforehand, whatever burned will be scorched, and what little wildlife remains will not be blooming.

, You may want to draw the militaries first to avoid having to erase too much of the background. Drawing the soldiers first can also make it easier to determine where the focus of the picture will be.


Make sure that the members of each military are somewhat distinguishable. You don't need to draw every single soldier, but make sure that it's easy to tell which side is which. You can accomplish this in different ways - it can be something as big as an entire uniform, or as small as a band wrapped around their arms or legs.
Keep in mind how people will be fighting. Unless the battle is taking place back when shotguns didn't have very good aim, it's unlikely that everyone will be standing in a row and firing at the other side. Depending on the time period, make sure you include different weapons, not just swords or guns.
Not everyone has to be fighting. Some people can be ducking under cover, some people can be getting the injured off the battlefield, and some could be helping civilians escape. A battle isn't dependent on simply firing at people.

, Keep in mind that if a soldier is a veteran, they may already have some scars. Maybe one soldier can have unusual eye colors or one could be wearing a small trinket that's special to them. It helps to give them some more individuality.


You don't have to add in details, but adding in details can make the picture tell a bit more of a story. A soldier fighting in a war is good, but a soldier fighting in a war with a scar on his hand and a snarl on his face shows that he's dedicated to winning the war.

, Some weapons are usually best to draw while drawing the soldiers, such as swords or guns. However, some weapons aren't used with the hands. Keep in mind that there are other fighting styles than just person against person.


Try adding war vehicles. Airplanes, for example, can be used anywhere at all. On land, tanks and cannons can give advantages to one side. If the battle is at sea, ships and submarines can be commonplace, depending on the time period.
Certain weapons, such as grenades or bombs, are usually not thrown by hand, but rather dropped by plane, due to the injuries that the soldiers would get from their detonation. Other types of weapons, such as flamethrowers or poison gas, are usually not used due to the inhumanity of them.
If the battle is futuristic and is using cyber warfare, there can be many different ""weapons"". Holograms could cause one army to retreat, or another army could learn how to use machines to change weather patterns and make it difficult to fight. Keep in mind, though, that if a hologram is put up, it is not solid, and can be easily walked through.

Identify the body/object you want to make an FBD of.,
Draw a simple representation of the body.,
Think of which forces are acting on the body.,
Draw the forces one by one using arrows pointing to the direction of the force.,
Draw the remaining forces.,
Label your forces properly and your basic FBD is done!,
Add information about the weight.,
Add the push forces.,
Add the normal force.,
Add the friction force.",How to Draw a Free Body Diagram,"


Example: A man is pushing a 10kg box on a rough floor, with a coefficient of friction of µ = 0.6, by applying a 20N force. You will select our body to be the box.;
,


Example: Make a square to represent the box.

,


Example: These are (1) the weight of the object, (2) the pushing force of the man, (3) the normal force applied by the floor, and (4) the friction force due to the rough floor.

, Always start with the weight because all objects have weight.


Example: (1) For the weight, draw an arrow pointing downward because the weight is the pulling force of the earth's gravity, which is always downward.

,


Example: (2) Draw an arrow that follows the direction of the pushing force. (3) Draw an arrow pointing upward for the normal force because it should always be perpendicular to the floor. (4) Draw an arrow that is opposite the direction of motion of the box for the friction.

, However, if you wish to put the magnitude of the forces, you may continue to the following steps.

, The weight of the object is equal to mass of object*acceleration due to gravity.


Example: W = m*a. W = (10kg)*(9.81m/s^2) = 98.1N. Write this beside its respective arrow.
Note: Forces are measured in Newtons or N.

, The magnitude of the pushing force applied by the man is given as 20N. Write this beside its respective arrow.

, The normal force is equal to the magnitude of the weight that acts perpendicularly to the floor. In this case, all of the weight is acting perpendicularly to the floor, therefore, N and W are equal in magnitude. So, N = 98.1N. Write this beside its respective arrow.

, The friction force is given by the formula: f=µ*N. Therefore, f = 0.6*(98.1N) = 58.86N. Write this beside its respective arrow.


Now that all forces are represented with their direction and magnitude, your FBD is ready for further engineering or physics analysis!

Reference images (either self-taken photos or images found online);
, If a box appears asking permission to open it, say yes., Any size canvas will work, but you can always go bigger than necessary and then crop it later. The resolution should be at either 300dpi, which is printing resolution or 72dpi which is digital resolution. You can also name your file here, but this can be done later when saving., This will be a horizontal line across the entirety of the canvas.  This will help you determine what the eye should focus on. To help you determine the eye level, here are some examples:

If you want to focus on the layout of a room or location, choose an eye level that is near the top of the canvas.
If you want to focus on the details of the ceiling of buildings, forests, or caves, then the eye level should be near the ground.
If you want it to be from the perspective of a person, then base it on the relative height of the objects in the background.

, This well help determine the sizes of objects in comparison to one another. There should be at least one vanishing point, but there can be more based on the perspective you want.,, This will make it easier to paint and you can fix issues that appeared in the rough sketch such as perspective issues or add new components in., You can do this on one of the sketch layers. Draw arrows starting at the direction of the light source and going away from it, stopping when it hits an object in the sketch., You can do this by using either the eyedropper and altering the color or just your eye. You can either place splotches of the color on a new layer or click the swatches or scratch pad icons for the menu., This color will set the mood for the entire piece. This color can be the sky if you are doing an outdoor piece or the darkest color of the palette for a cave or forest background., If you need to, you can do different types of objects on separate layers, or break it into background, midground, and foreground. In the image, I decided to do different types of objects. I put this all into a folder so I could hide the layers easier., The shading will be based on the light source in step 1 of the coloring section., Do this as much as you see fit with as small of a brush as you think will best work. Don’t be afraid to experiment with brush types and sizes., Much like step 6 in the coloring section, experiment and play around with it. You can always click undo. I added a slight orange tint to the image., This can be done by clicking file and then save. It defaults as a .SAI file. This will keep all layers in case editing needs to be done. Change the file name if you want., This will be depending on if you chose to keep it digital or plan on printing it. Prints are better if saved as .jpeg while digital pieces are better as .png files. The file name from step 1 of exporting should still be there so you would most likely not need to rename it."

Find your art form.,
Go to the art store.,
Find a teacher.,
Go to school.,
Never stop reading.,
Practice.,
Give yourself time to improve.",How to Be Good at Art1," It is important to find a type of art that you enjoy. This can mean trying a few different varieties settling on the one you love best. Consider drawing, painting in oils, painting in watercolors, drawing with charcoal, sculpting, making installations, and wood carving. Be open to experimenting with different styles of art.


You might find that a trip to the art store will make your choice for you. Certain art media are more expensive than others. Consider starting off with something like drawing, which does not require expensive materials, and then moving on to other forms of art once you have the skills and resources to support them.You might also find that as your skills evolve, you will move on to more complicated forms of art. After you develop the ability to replicate shapes in drawing, you might want to introduce colors and move on to painting.;
, It's hard to be a good artist without the right gear. Think about the basics first, to keep it affordable to allow you to experiment. Once you're happy with the art form you've chosen, start to expand your art kit and add more advanced items until you have a decent amount of tools at your disposal.If you can't afford the items, look online for locals selling their art equipment.

, Go to art shows or look online for local artists. Once you find one who you like, talk to her about lessons. Remember, you don’t need to rediscover all of the artistic techniques that have been developed over the past two thousand years. There are people who can teach you these methods.Professional feedback can also be very helpful for your development. Learning from your mistakes is vital and usually requires someone else who can see your work objectively.

, Usually art school is the best way to master your craft. But, if you’re having trouble getting into a good art school or don’t believe that a four year degree fits your schedule, there are other options. Most community colleges offer art class that you can take individually. These are usually cheap and can even help you develop the skills to get into a better school.Fear not. Although art school can be a great way to improve your skills, there are few fields where your degree matters less than in art. Ultimately, you will be judged on the basis of what you produce., There is always room to learn new techniques and styles. While the internet has some of these resources, you will find the most comprehensive treatment of these subjects in full length books. Start with the art books that you can find in your local library and then look online for the best reviewed books., If you don't practice, you won't get better. You should make practice a habit. Allot a specific amount of time per day to practicing—even better allot a specific period in the day to practice. Don’t be afraid to challenge yourself and try new things when you practice.


Try things that you know that you can’t do. You can learn a lot more by grappling with things you don’t know than by repeating things you’re already good at.Don’t worry about how good what you’re doing is. The only way to learn new things is to experiment.Try a master study. A master study a type of practice wherein you take a great work of art and replicate it. It probably won’t be perfect. But you will be learning from the best., Give yourself plenty of time to improve and test the direction your art is taking. This means being patient and giving yourself time to stand back and obtain a bigger perspective of where you're headed. Most importantly, keep at it.


Personal style takes time to develop. Don't expect it to be innate. It is like the sculptor chiseling away at the rock; what you're capable of can take years to be revealed.

Be strange.,
Get out of here.,
Be aware of your influences.,
Be prepared to change your style over time.",How to Be Good at Art2," Vanderbilt psychologists have found that people who are a bit weird are more creative.Art that is unique generally sells better than art that simply shows a high level of skill. Having a distinctive style of living is often part of an artists’ trademark. In other words, bucking norms might help you become a more original artist, and, even if it doesn’t, it certainly makes for better marketing., Art is about recreating personal experience in an original way.In order to do that, you need to have experience doing something other than looking at a computer screen. Get out of the house and go see the world.


A walk through nature, like a walk through woods or along the beach, is thought to increase creativity. These sort of walks allow us time to be alone with our thoughts and introduce us to experiences that we don’t encounter in our everyday life.Travelling to another country can introduce you to a new culture and unfamiliar experiences. A lot of studies have indicated that spending time abroad can improve creativity. Even thinking back to a time when you were out of the country can cause a temporary burst of creativity., It is common for great works of art to pull on the work of other artists. It is also, however, easy to replicate other people’s work without realizing it. A particularly impressive image can be engraved in your memory so that you unconsciously recreate it while searching for something new. Expose yourself to a lot of influences and, when you create something, ask yourself how if it too closely resembles the work of someone else., Keep things fresh and be prepared to pursue new paths as you grow as an artist. Even if you have developed a signature style, you might find that it gets old with time. Experimentation does not necessarily mean giving up what you have done before, just developing a wider repertoire.

"
"
Consider the value of a career.,
Advertise.,
Network.,
Join a community of artists.,
Hustle.",How to Be Good at Art3," Art isn’t necessarily about money. But it is a lot easier to devote the time to developing your craft when you don’t have to work a full time job at the same time. Think of the money you earn from art as liberating you to pursue what you love. A career can cascade; as you earn the money to support yourself, you can spend more time developing skill and a reputation as an artist., You should build a portfolio of your own work and then do everything you can so that other people find and purchase it. Today that is normally done online. Post your work on social media and build a website that features your best images.If you want to be old fashioned, find a coffee shop that looks like it needs some extra decoration. Bring your portfolio and show the owner your work. Ask if she would be willing to put it on display and refer interested customers to you. She will get a better the ambience out of the deal and you will get to advertise your work.

, Subscribe to local art papers and be aware of art shows, festivals, or seminars. When you attend events, be yourself and be sociable. Try to meet people who could connect you to clients or galleries where you can sell you work.


Perfect an elevator speech. The principle of the elevator speech is that you can give it to someone on a short elevator ride and by the end they be interested in exchanging information with you. In a few sentences you should be able to tell someone what makes your work interesting. If it doesn’t seem to work, keep on revising it until you find something that grabs people.
Bring a lot of business cards so that when you meet people who are interested in you work, you can easily share your contact information. Include a website that features your work on the business card. Keep track of all of the business cards you receive and set up appointments to meet with people after the event., Become known in your art community as a supportive person with a genuine interest in the progress of your fellow artists. When you make comments, be constructive, not destructive. Help people to learn through guidance and constructive feedback. Use this community to get feedback on your work and meet potential clients.Don’t be jealous of other people. If you develop a reputation of helping out other artists, they, in turn, will help you.Consider forming a collective to pool your resources. You can rent out a space to display your art or even share the expenses of a studio collectively. In the end, you won’t just be saving money, you’ll be introducing one another to new customers., Ultimately, most artists don’t make ends meet by doing just one thing. They have multiple sources of revenue so that when one disappears, backup jobs are still on the table. Sell works online, put others in galleries, look for public art contracts, apply for grants, and teach. Not only is this a good way to make ends meet, you’ll also learn about what the most lucrative business models are."

, Draw lightly because you will eventually erase these lines.

, Each cell should only connect to two other cells, and the path from the “start” cell to the “finish” cell should pass through every cell. Try to make the path through the cells counter-intuitive.

,, (Please refer to Figure 1 (attached) for an example of a maze with steps 1-6 complete.)

, The borders between cells should fit together like the teeth of a zipper. However, unlike a zipper, the teeth should be of variable width and length. Draw new, permanent cell boundaries. (Shown in attached figure 2.)

, The paths should be about one centimeter wide, and their borders should be the width of one line drawn with a pencil. Only draw lines that are parallel to the edges of the paper. Make every part of your maze area either a path or border between paths. Do not create any dead end paths inside cells. Consider the MTF instinct when drawing your approaches to critical points. (Refer to the large attached maze for an example of maze paths.)

, Make sure that you did not inadvertently block a critical point in your maze and that an unbroken path exists from start to finish.

, Try to make sure that no spots exist where the junction of two lines is ambiguous and it is “debatable” if the path is blocked.

Draw things completely free style, and make your own art.",How to Master the Etch a Sketch," There are many other models including miniatures, color variations, and upgraded ones, but you will find that the and the right. The left knob controls the horizontal lines. Turning it clockwise will make the cursor move right, counter-clockwise will move the cursor left. The right knob controls the vertical lines. Clockwise: up, and Counter-clockwise: down. You should practice until you can control the direction with little thought.;
, This can be done by turning both knobs evenly at the same time. But ensure that they move together otherwise you will end up creating a circular shape, which you don't want. The combination of their directions will guide the cursor in a diagonal line. This will take diagonal lines all the way from one corner to the next in all directions. With practice it will get straighter.

, Start with triangles. Get to the point where you have control over the cursor. That is the trick: control. The hardest shape to make is the circle. You must carefully direct the cursor using all four diagonals in a circle motion. If you can make a fairly large perfect circle, you will have much more capabilities with your drawings.

, Try to draw still life. Set out fruit and try to draw the shapes. try to draw plants or flowers. Find things with odd curves or shapes, and try to draw them on the Etch-A-Sketch.

, You can do this by simply starting at the left, filling in the area you want by moving the cursor up and down while slightly moving it to the right until the area is shaded. You may read more about shading in sketching, then try to imitate some shading styles. What you do is up to you.

, Buildings are a good start. You can easily draw the square structures, but then try to draw two dimensional buildings with façade details. Try a city-scape. Get pictures of buildings online, and try to make replicas of them. Draw a farm building. Draw bridges, or anything structural and simple.

, Practice making depth. Draw trees, grass, animals. try to put together a picture with multiple things happening. Also try to start developing tricks to damage control; the ways you can cover up or lessen the impacts of mistakes. Sometimes, shading over or over-tracing can make some mistakes disappear, but also know that some attempts simply need a good shake.

, On the Etch-A-Sketch, you can draw completely separate objects, however it is very difficult, so you must find ways to connect them, whether making subtle extensions or using the border to transport the cursor. The eyes and the nose are the hardest, but using the design of the hair and the eyes, you can easily work with what you have.

, Be creative. This is a new medium to master, so there are no rules to break.

Start by creating a vanishing point by drawing an “X” at the center of the paper.,
Then for the next step draw a series of poles on the right side.,
For the left side draw a series poles and add in some perpendicular benches.,
Then for the next step draw the roof of the pathway by illustrating its checkered pattern.

,
Next is to sketch houses on the left side and a beach scene on the right side of the drawing.

,
Finally end the drawing by sketching lines that will highlight or outline the path and roof.

,
Ink over your drawing and you’re done.",How to Draw Perspective1," Then from the center through the edge of your paper draw lines, but make sure also that the lines you have drawn can be used on your drawing.;
, When you almost reached the center or the vanishing point you can substitute the poles to a series of lines.

, Remember to draw lines again when you almost reach the center or the vanishing point.

,,,, To ink over your drawing use a black pen or marker with different kinds of points so that there will be some variation of texture on your drawing.

"
"
Determine the horizon in your drawing.,
Choose the vanishing point.,
Sketch the main objects.,
Give detail to your drawing respecting the proportions dictated by the reference lines you sketched before.
",How to Draw Perspective2," Draw a horizontal line for the horizon with a hard pencil. The horizon lines determines how far the viewer can see based on the terrain and the distance of the viewer from the ground.

, This is what will determine the effect of the perspective. As a reference, the most basic vanishing point would be located in the center of the paper horizontally and over the horizon line. If you set the vanishing point to the right, the drawing will look as if the point of view is moved to the left of the objects. The vanishing point for some objects can also be above or below the horizon lines depending on the inclination of the planes in respect to the ground.

,


Take care to draw all the horizontal and vertical lines perfectly horizontal and vertical.
The lines that start near the point of view and get farther should be drawn extending towards the selected vanishing point. This will give the perspective effect.

,"
"
Determine the horizon in your drawing.,
Determine the point of view, which is the approximate location of the eye of the person viewing the drawing.,
Determine your first vanishing point.,
Determine your second vanishing point.,
Sketch your main objects drawing the vertical lines perfectly vertical, the horizontal lines moving to the left at an angle towards the left vanishing point and the horizontal lines moving to the right at an angle towards the right vanishing point (all the horizontal lines should converge in one or the other of the vanishing points if extended far enough).

,
Give detail to your drawing respecting the trends given by the horizontal lines sketched for the main objects.",How to Draw Perspective3," Sketch a horizontal line for the horizon as in the first method.

, This point may be located below the bottom of the paper (outside the paper.) You don't need to actually mark the point.

, The usual method for this is to sketch a first line from the point of view in a 60 degree angle to the left and mark your vanishing point where this line intersects the horizon.

, For this you will draw a second line from the point of view in a 30 degree angle to the right. Again, the vanishing point will be the intersection of this line and the horizon. The 60 and 30 degree angles can be different, but the angle between the lines that go from the eye of the observer to the vanishing points have to form a 90 degree angle.

,, These lines will determine the proportion of the sizes of the objects when they are located closer or farther from the point of view.


Make light, temporary guidelines with a ruler (shown here in green) to make sure your details are in perspective. Erase these guidelines later.

"
"
Notice that the three point perspective includes the two point perspective or perspective with two vanishing points plus it also has a third perspective point or third vanishing point in the vertical perspective aspect as from near the ground for instance looking up at a tower -- as the viewer is facing a vertical corner (edge) of the object.

,
Consider that the third point can be any fourth, fifth,... view for an angular, tilted or rotated part of a drawing, but it is usually based on parallel lines in each part and relates those parts that are actually parallel to each other.

,
Look at the staircase example to see that different ""3rd point"" depends on the angle of the item being viewed.",How to Draw Perspective4,",, So then there can be several ""other"" vanishing points off at ""some odd angle vanishing upward into the sky (or downward)"" in a picture, for example another identical staircase could be oriented (rotated) differently as for example shown in the same drawing of a lobby of a building, etc.

"
"
Think about scenes such as landscapes that have no parallel lines.,
Draw this kind of perspective with object sizes generally getting smaller into the distance, and the drawing elements like tree limbs, becoming thinner and less detailed in the background, with textures, shading and colors showing less contrast as they are farther away so that colors fade (become lighter) and become tinted toward blue color tones in the distance.

",How to Draw Perspective5," This kind of perspective is of irregular shapes like crooked trees, boulders, mountains, rubble, stones, gravel, and sand dunes, etc.

Realize just how much your spiritual CV counts.,
Remember that in life, you're always a winner.,
Embrace your purpose.,
Remember life's ultimate purpose.,
Take into account that where your attention goes, your spiritual energy flows.,
Live ""the now"" with enthusiasm.,
Realize that positive cynicism is always useful.,
Look your best every day.,
Use your intelligence with benevolence and vice versa.,
Know when to admit it and quit it.,

Paint your world mentally positive every day.,
Go forth positively, enjoying all you can and spreading joy.

,
Make complimentary premonitions about the beauty about to unfold in the lives of other people.,
Be a neutral partner to life.",How to Be a Spiritual Winner," The manner in which you lived, loved and related here will count toward your spiritual CV, meaning that such negative actions as murdering, destroying, pillaging and disparaging others are never excused by spiritual choices. You know better, you have a big brain for, so use it wisely to be considerate of leaving other people in as good a place as possible, not worse off.;
, As long as you follow your virtues, and live in your truth, you will be given beautiful gifts in return for simply going about your life. When you're positive, you're automatically in control.

, What do you feel is your spiritual purpose in life? Is it to be the backbone for everyone around you, or to help others? Whatever your purpose may be, live that purpose and never try to fight it! Live within the moments where you feel the happiest.

, Some people are meant to be in your life so you can learn something beautiful, and begin a new chapter. Perhaps you will even be meant to stay with them for the rest of your life. When someone doesn't easily leave your life, think about it carefully. Perhaps they were meant to stay there.

, So, make your focus positive. Remember that in life, there is no 'good' or 'bad', as such. There is only life's will, and what is meant to be. Accept the bad in stride with the good, because it is all going to make you stronger, and bring you to a better place in the end.

, That means, don't take life too seriously. Implement a rule of ""10 seconds"" for worry, anger, frustration etc., then letting go, as a way of controlling the negativity in your life. Limit your anger or worry to 10 seconds a day to take control of the negativity in your life

, That is, be positive but don't be blind to what can go wrong in life because plenty can. Yet, with good planning, forethought and consideration of the consequences, then you can manage what doesn't work out.

, When you're dressed and looking good, you're prepared for the day and anything that may come your way. Being ready lets you be more decisive, and it lets you be spontaneous with your plans. Plus, it can boost confidence.

, Putting your EQ into high action enhances your IQ and makes people like you a great deal more. Learn to balance emotions with reason, for neither is king of your soul but both play their role.

, This is a really helpful maxim. Look to your own personal vice and revoke the disasters you've created, if at all possible.

, When people walk away, make sure you've uplifted them in some way. Whether that be making them happy, making them laugh, or giving them assistance, free them and do them a kind act.

, Avoid making win/lose or lose/lose situations an inevitability. Nobody wants those as the outcome. Be a good source of compromise.

, This is far more helpful than self pity, which causes other people to run miles away from you and does nothing to help you dig your way back out of that ditch. Self compassion is about being kind to yourself, respecting that what you're going through is hard but you're never alone in life's adversities and is also about being mindful that you matter and deserve care and a break from self-criticism.

, That's their job! This doesn't mean you have to succumb to their job description as if it's also yours, because it most distinctly isn't. Your job description is to be self-compassionate, boundary-creating, composed and hopeful. And maybe adventurous too, to travel beyond the negative things you'll inevitable bump into along the way.

, Use your vast imagination to come up with endless permutations of positive ways of viewing the world, your life and your place in the world and beyond.

,, Let them all be positive. Do you feel a certain way? Then write down what you think may happen in the future, even if you feel it's out there.

, Let life take you where life wants you to go, and end up where you are meant to be. Don't let false notions make you negative. Stay as neutral as you can in your daily affairs, because everything is subject to change. Just ride the wave.

Build a relationship with God.,
Praise God and give thanks first.,
Confess and repent of sin.,
Ask God for forgiveness.,
Make amends with other people.,
Pray against evil that may be around you.,
Be honest with God about what you are feeling.,
Ask God specifically for what you want.,
Invite God to work in the ways He wants to work.,
Call on God to hurry in answering your request.,
Close by saying, “In Jesus' name.” The Bible teaches that the name of Jesus Christ is powerful.,
Be patient waiting for God to Work.,
Continue to praise Him.,
Trust that God will act according to his will.",How to Ask God for Something," God will hear your prayers whether or not you are following Him, but He is more likely to answer those who are close to Him. If you’ve never started reading God’s Word and following Jesus, that’s a good step before you ask Him for something. Learn to listen and obey what He asks of you.This is not to say that He won’t grant your request if you aren’t a follower. It simply means that you’ll be better able to communicate with Him if you have a relationship with Him.
Think about the difference between a stranger and your best friend. If a friend asks to borrow some money or a stranger on the street asks, you’d be more likely to give to your friend. It’s not a perfect comparison, but it’s similar.;
, When you come to God in prayer, don’t go straight to asking for something. It is better to praise Him and thank Him for what He has already done. Praise Him for being loving and mighty. Thank Him for guiding you and blessing you. Beginning this way shows God that He is more than someone you ask for things.Praise and thanks must be genuine, not a tactic to butter God up so you can ask for what you want. You must really mean what you pray.
Start by saying, “God, it’s amazing how well you have taken care of me and provided for me. I’m thankful that you are strong and that you never turn away from me.”

, After you have a relationship with God, it is important to make sure you’re on good terms with Him. If you are living in ongoing sin, or you’ve committed sins recently, you are separated from God. You must confess those things and turn away from them. This will mend the broken connection with God.The reason this is important is that sin means going against what God wants from you. When you sin, you separate yourself from God.
To confess and repent simply means to tell God that you know you have sinned, that you are sorry, and that you want to change.
Pray to God, “I’m sorry I was so rude to my neighbor. I know you love Him, too, and I should treat Him as you want me to. I will work harder at being patient and kind to Him.”

, Along with confessing and repenting, ask God to forgive you for those sins. Seeking forgiveness is the step that has to follow confession. Once God has forgiven you, the lines of communication will be much more open between you and God.There is not a specific prayer of forgiveness you must pray. Tell God that you are sorry and that you want Him to forgive you for wronging Him.
Pray, “God, I’m sorry for lying about what I did last night. I should not have done that. Please forgive me for my dishonesty.”

, If you are angry or have hurt someone, it’s hard to pray an honest prayer to God. Take a minute to think about any relationships you have that are out of sync and make an effort to fix those first. Resolving problems with others opens you up more to asking something from God.It’s not enough to think of what’s wrong if you don’t make an effort to fix it. Get in touch with the person and seek reconciliation before going to God.
Apologize to them or forgive them, depending on what is wrong between you.

, If you are living for God, you may have evil that is against you, holding you back from God. Pray that God would remove any spirits who seek to keep you distant and distracted from God. Spiritual warfare will keep you from being able to effectively communicate with God.It may be worth your time to learn more about what spiritual warfare is and how it can affect your prayer life and living for God.
Pray, “God, I feel like there is evil that is surrounding me. In Jesus' name, please rebuke these spirits. Do not let them come between us. Tell them that they have no power over me.”

, God knows everything you think and feel, so there is no sense in hiding. As you are asking for what you want, be completely honest about your thoughts and feelings. Honesty will open God’s ears to your prayers.

, Tell God what you want or need and ask Him to provide that for you. Be specific about your request. Even though God knows what you want and need, He wants you to ask Him for it. God can answer vague prayers, but being specific creates a deeper bond between you and Him.Being specific does not guarantee that God will answer your request in the way you want Him to. He may have other plans for you.
Say to God, “I’m hurting for rent money this month because of the doctor bills. Please let me pick up some extra hours at work so that I can pay my rent.”
Remember that God will not give you something that goes against His will. Check your heart and check the Bible to see if what you are asking for is against His will.

, Although you may have many specific things you want from God, another good thing to pray is that His will be done in your life. Ask Him to move and use you however He wants, not only how you want. Ask Him to help you want the things that He wants for you.The benefits of praying in this way are many. Although you may know exactly what you want, God may have much more for you than you could think to ask for. If you only ask for the thing you want, you could miss out on a larger blessing.
Say to God, “Lord, I really want to start a new job this month, but I know that you might have something more in store for me during this time. I pray that you would show me your plans, even if it isn’t exactly what I want.”

, If you are asking God for something, you probably want Him to act quickly. Being honest with God means telling Him that you want Him to work quickly. He is on His own time, so it may not happen at the speed you want. It is still good to ask Him to hurry because you’re being honest about what you want., Every time you pray, but especially when you are asking for something, end by saying, “I pray this in Jesus’ name.” This acknowledges that God moves through Jesus and that Jesus is powerful.This is not like saying magic words, and it should not be used as a way to exploit God’s blessings. It is simply a way to show that you are submitting to God’s will through Christ.

, Remember that God works on a different timeline than you do. If He doesn’t answer as quickly as you hoped, do not give up on Him. Wait on His timing and remember that there may be a reason He does not answer as quickly as you want Him to., While you wait to hear God’s answer to your prayer, you must keep honoring Him and giving Him praise. It is important to be be thankful and worshipful even when you haven’t received what you want yet. If you only praise Him when He acts as you want, your praise may not be genuine., If you don't believe that God has the power to act, your prayer loses power. You must believe that He has heard you and will act based on His will. If your request fits His plan, then he will grant what you want, but remember that God doesn't always answer the way you want Him to."

Find out about the enlightenment.,
Realize that every religion is based on the experience of enlightenment of its founder: Christianity of Jesus, Islam of Muhammad, Judaism of Abraham, Buddhism of Buddha , Hinduism of many enlightened.,
Realize that God is a mystery that can be described as personal and impersonal.,
Realize that there are different conceptions of God within the same religion.,
Prove God through the enlightenment.,
Question the other person's lack of belief and ask them if they know about the complexities of the sciences.",How to Argue for the Existence of God," Spiritual enlightenment means to obtain a spiritual revelation or deep insight into the meaning and purpose of all things, to communicate with or understand the mind of God, or to achieve a fundamentally changed level of existence whereby one's self is experienced as a non-changing field of pure consciousness. Mysticism is the pursuit of communion with, identity with, or conscious awareness of an ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God through direct experience, intuition, instinct or insight. , The center of a religion is enlightenment. Religion will lead to enlightenment. Moses was enlightened, as he saw a shining (burning) bush after many years of a secluded life in the desert. He saw the light of God in the bush. Jesus became enlightened, after John the Baptist gave him the Enlightenment energy (kundalini energy). After this Jesus meditated 40 days in the desert. Then the devil (his ego) left him and the angels ministered to him (he was able to help with the enlightenment energy his fellow human beings). Buddha got enlightenment after six years as a yogi under the Bodhi tree. Mara (the devil) disappeared and Buddha rested in happiness. , In Judaism, Christianity and Islam God is seen as an acting person. God is a supreme being, which can be addressed as a person and asked for help. Hinduism, Buddhism and Taoism (Chinese philosophy) prefer the abstract concept of God. God is a higher consciousness field (cosmos, unity, happiness).

, Moses has in contrast to Jesus, an abstract concept of God. In his central definition Moses describes God as: ""I am."" These words refer to God as a happy state of being which one experiences in the enlightenment. In the words ""I am"" the royal road to enlightenment is mentioned. Man must develop a cosmic consciousness. He loses the sense of his self (ego). He experiences himself as pure consciousness, as one with everything and can say only, ""I am."" He can not say: ""I am the ... (name)."" He identifies himself with everything. In yoga it is called Sat-Chid-Ananda, the compound from being, unity and bliss.

, There are millions of witnesses in the world for the fact of enlightenment. Million people in all cultures and at all times have attained enlightenment. They have all had the same experience, although they have used different words to describe God: ""nature, universe, Tao, Brahman, Nirvana, Manitou, Allah, Yahweh"". Modern science has studied many enlightened and confirmed their specific abilities. Everyone can check the proof.Thoroughly investigated by U.S. brain researchers several years ago was Matthieu Ricard. They found a particularly large inner happiness, serenity, inner peace and compassion. , If they do then how can they possibly think that such a perfectly run world can exist without another force managing it? One planet slightly sped up or slowed down could destroy the whole of mankind. Yet it hasn't happened.

"
Listen to your partner attentively.,
Ask clarifying questions.,
Validate their emotions.,
Demonstrate that you understand.",How to Be Responsive to Your Partner1," Show your responsiveness by giving your partner your complete attention when they are talking. Resist the urge to interrupt or rush them to finish. Use your own body language to encourage them to keep talking.


Turn your body to face them. Lean forward. Nod to show agreement. Make appropriate eye contact. Relax your arms in your lap or at your sides. Depending on the context of the conversation, you may even take their hand into yours or caress their arm or shoulder.;
, To better understand your partner’s message, ask questions. Wait until they seem to have taken a pause before asking. Then, you can ask specific questions that encourage your partner to expound more on a certain aspect of their message or to go deeper into what they are thinking and feeling.Clarifying questions might sound like, “What did you mean by exasperated?"" or “Sounds like you could use a break. Am I right?”

, Validation is a key aspect of being a responsive partner. To do this you have to listen for feelings language in your partner’s message. Then, make a statement that shows your partner that you relate to or appreciate their unique feelings and perspective.If your partner's words or facial expression indicates anger or confusion, you can validate this by saying, “I can sense that this has gotten you very upset” or “You seem confused by the outcome.”

, The best listeners listen to understand, not reply. Paraphrase or summarize your partner’s message to show you comprehend what they’re trying to say.For instance, your partner says, ""My mom and dad got in a fight and I think they might get a divorce. I don't know what to do."" You might repeat what you heard in your own words by saying, “Let me see if I understand this correctly. Your parents had a big fight and you're worried this will lead to divorce?""
You might summarize by pulling together various chunks of the message into a cohesive whole to verify your understanding. Summarizing might sound like “So your parents were arguing and yelling. Your dad stormed out of the house and you haven't heard from him since. Is that right?”

"
"
Acknowledge your partner’s emotional experience first.,
Use “I” messages to state your feelings.,
Seek out a solution that is mutually beneficial.,
Be vulnerable.,
Reestablish the emotional connection after a fight.",How to Be Responsive to Your Partner2," A responsive partner is not only in tune with their own emotional experience, but their partner’s as well. You can show your concern for your partner’s well-being by acknowledging their feelings, even when you are disagreeing.For example, if you shout or speak harshly to your partner, acknowledge their feelings before continuing the discussion. You might communicate concern by saying something like, “I didn’t mean to come off as harsh” or “I can see you’re hurt maybe we should postpone this conversation.”

, “I” messages, as opposed to “You” messages, help facilitate communication and conflict resolution. This happens because you are able to take ownership for your own thoughts, feelings, and experiences without shifting blame onto your partner. “You” messages often spark defensiveness.An “I” message might sound like, “I feel confused by your reaction to what I said. I want to be there for you, but I’m not sure how.” This is better than, “You are acting strangely. I don’t understand you.”

, Responsive partners care more about the relationship succeeding than winning an argument. That’s why the focus is on arriving at terms that both partners can agree on. Sometimes, the mutually beneficial solution may be to just drop the subject. In other times, it may require compromise from both parties.To compromise, determine how important the issue is to both of you. Then, brainstorm viable solutions that allow both of you to get some or most of your needs met.
For example, if you are planning a vacation, but it doesn't matter where, you might allow your partner to choose the destination. But, you might compromise and each pick two activities that you'd like to do.

, Responsiveness often comes down to being the one willing to give in or apologize first. During a disagreement in a romantic relationship, you and your partner may temporarily forget that you’re on the same side. If you have the courage to take an emotional risk, you may be able to bring the argument to a swift close.


For example, both partners may be hurting, yet pretending not to be. Simply stating your vulnerability, “My emotions are raw right now. I really need you” can help break down barriers between you., The worst thing you can do is end an argument with a gaping chasm between you. Healthy relationships require that you two be able to return to a state of connection in order to move forward after conflict.For some partners, this may translate to “makeup sex.” For others, it might be a gentle caress, a hug, or a light-hearted joke after a disagreement. It doesn’t matter what you do, as long as you restore the emotional connection.

"
"
Be present.,
Reflect on what worked previously.,
Show that you care.,
Notice what they respond to during intimacy.",How to Be Responsive to Your Partner3," Certainly, there will be times when you are caught up in your own thoughts and feelings and unable to fully attend to your partner. Nonetheless, the majority of the time, you should try to tune in to what your partner may be feeling. Notice the nonverbal cues that tell you what’s going on with them, and help you devise an appropriate response.For example, you might notice when your partner gets a creaky tone of voice that they are deeply emotional. At this time, you might be clued in that they need your full attention. Shut off any distractions and practice active listening.

, You don’t have to reinvent the wheel each day. You can enhance your responsiveness and better attend to your partner’s feelings and needs by recalling similar encounters. If your partner told you last month that they want you to listen without trying to fix their problems, keep this in mind when a new problem arises., A big part of being a responsive partner is being compassionate. Your relationship satisfaction and emotional connection depends on you being a decent human being. In other words, you can’t be a responsive partner and not show warmth and concern for partner as a person.For example, you are watching a sports event or your favorite TV show and your partner comes in sighing heavily and slamming doors. Responsiveness would require for you to pause the TV and attend to your partner’s emotional experience.
Show compassion by asking what’s the matter, offering a hug, or suggesting something fun to help cheer your partner up.

, Another way to address your partner’s needs is through intimacy. It can be tempting to let go and only focus on your own needs during intimacy. But, tuning into your partner’s likes and dislikes, and responding appropriately can forge a deeper connection between you—both in and out of the bedroom.For example, if your partner seems to enjoy a caress down their back, you might ask, ""Do you like that?"" to see if they would like you to continue.

Love your family.",How to Be Loved by Your Family," Talking about the problems in an attempt to clear things out will help you to better identify the actual problem as perceived by the family members in question and can get all of you started on making amends.;
, They can act as the go-between and come up with suggestions for moving ahead on impasses.

, In this case, you aren't going to change their perspective but you can change your reaction to their griping. Acknowledge their concern, validate their importance but stop putting yourself in the position of being an adversary to their problem. They have problems but you aren't going to be either a part of those problems or a solution. Stay polite and kind.

, Is it sufficient? If not, what can you do to improve things and make more time to spend together?

, Go on a picnic, visit a museum, go to a sports match, etc. Use joint interests to arrange fun things to do together on a regular basis.

, Listen to music, read, watch movies or TV, garden together. Everyday activities can be a way of spending more time together and making things more interesting for one another too––use chore time as a chance to talk and catch up on each other's news.

, Are you being difficult in certain ways? Are you making things hard for certain family members on purpose? Do you back talk to, refuse to be supportive of or dismiss concerns of family members? If so, think about why you're doing these things and what you might be able to do to turn these things around.


Does that family member really deserve your demeaning or thoughtless treatment?
Notice the mistakes you've made in the past and don't repeat them.

, Improve your attitude and work on the things that family members comment on. Perhaps there is a nub of truth in their complaints about your grades, your work attitude, your commitment to a relationship or your lack of goals. Don't presume it's all nagging and pushiness. Some of what they are saying is most likely for your own good, in that they're trying to protect you from life's hardships and motivate you to be the best you can be.

, In turn, expect them to be the same. Set the standard by being trustworthy and trusting them.

, Attempt to be rock solid in the face of the outside world, so that people perceive your family members as a supporting unit. There are enough people ready to make life tough for you without it starting at the home front too.

, Follow the give respect and take respect policy; even a basic thing like saying ""good morning"" each day will make a big difference.

, Help your family members out. If your parents come home late at night after work; try to make a simple dinner such as feta cheese salad for them, instead of making your mother cook for you again. If your sibling is not doing well at school, show him or her how to succeed with the subjects. If your cousin is getting bullied, explain ways to cope. If your grandparents are struggling financially, discuss the options for downsizing and budgeting with them.

, For example, don't ask your father to wake you up in the morning; instead set an alarm clock beside your table. Or, don't expect your parents to bail you out financially all the time, especially not as an adult.

, It's your parents, siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents, etc. You know what will make them happy, so do your best to try and achieve that regularly.

Spend time getting to know your younger sibling(s).,
Practice good listening skills.,
Handle sibling conflicts with maturity.,
Help out your parents.,
Recognize the special role you have as an older sibling.,
Let them be there for you too.,
Quit comparing yourself with your sibling or siblings.,
Be a positive role model.,

Take time for yourself and be a kid.,
Respect and love them for who they are.,
Find ways to help and teach when you can.,
Be realistic about what a ""responsible eldest sister"" means.",How to Be a Responsible Eldest Sister," Since you are closer in age to your siblings than your parents, you likely are more able to have fun and play with your brothers and sisters. Having fun helps grow a positive relationship, the sort that makes a family work well together. Play games, read books, watch movies, and engage in each other's interests. Find things that you can enjoy doing together.;
, Listen attentively, asking questions for clarification and respecting his or her point of view—even if your sibling is wrong. Respectful, active listening builds your relationship and encourages your sibling to trust you. This is hard, especially since you, as the older sister, is probably better at this that your younger siblings. But good listening will teach your sibling to do the same...eventually!

, Listen and stay as calm as you can. Seek to understand the other person's point of view before getting mad or passing judgment.


If you are getting angry, say something like: ""I need to take a break. Please let's talk about this later when we are both calmer "" and walk away. And follow through by coming back when you are calmer.
Get help from a parent when necessary. Sometimes having an adult authority reinforce rules, proper behavior, and so forth can really help. Let the adults help you by letting them do some of this work.
Apologize if you hurt your sibling.

, Every family has those days when the adults are overwhelmed with household responsibilities. If you are of age that you can help out, do so when you have the time and energy.


Help out with household tasks when needed. It could be as simple as helping track down a wayward piece of clothing, folding the laundry, or picking up some milk at the corner store.
Watch your siblings. Giving your parents even an hour break can make a huge difference. Take your brother on a tricycle ride around the block, play dolls with your sister, or just sit and watch TV for a while.

, Parents are great, but sometimes an older sister or brother is even better for a particular issue. Sometimes your parent(s) may not realize your sibling needs help right now, or your sibling may want to talk to you instead of them. Offer your help, whether it's helping them fix a problem or just offering a listening ear. It will mean a lot to them.

, Communication goes two ways in a strong relationship, and just as you listen to your siblings, give them opportunities to listen and help you. Siblings love to feel that they're making you happier, even if it's just by giving you a drawing after you had a bad day.

, Comparing yourself—positively or negatively—to a sibling sets everyone up for trouble. You may be related, you may even be very similar, but you are all unique individuals.


Be a good role model for appreciating your sibling's unique characteristics. Maybe your brother is just not the athlete you are, but you see he is a keen negotiator. Point out his gifts, rather than belittling him for not being like you.
Remember your positive features. This can be hard if a younger sibling has a particular skill that you do not. For example, perhaps your sister is a charming actress. Remember that your skills are no less important, even if they are less visible.

, When you are uncertain about whether something is a good idea, ask yourself ""Would I be okay with my little sibling(s) seeing this and copying me—now or someday?"" If not, it's probably a bad idea.


You will mess up sometimes. This is normal and okay. You do not need to be a perfect role model—this is why you are a human instead of an angel.
When you do mess up, your siblings will learn from your mistakes.

, You are a big sister, which is just not the same thing as an adult parent. Even if you are a legal guardian to a younger sibling, realize that you do not have the maturity or experience an older adult would likely have. There are some problems you will not be able to handle on your own. You may need to get a parent, older relative, or friend to help. Here are some reasons you might want to tell an adult:


Your sibling is not respecting your boundaries, such as interrupting a date
Health or safety is at risk (from dangerous rule-breaking to suicidal thoughts)
You do not know how to handle a problem
You can't fix the problem, but an adult could
The problem involves an adult, and not you. For instance, your sister's feelings were hurt when Dad yelled at her. You might bring this to your father's attention, or talk to your sister about the incident, but it needs to be settled between your sister and Dad. You should not be put in the middle

, Being responsible, especially if you are young, is difficult. You are not a third parent, you are not a teacher, and you are not a robot who is capable of constantly being ""on."" Not even an adult can do that constantly. Your first responsibility is your own health and happiness. Take plenty of time to relax, enjoy your own hobbies, and feel balanced.


Practice setting boundaries with siblings. Young children often constantly want attention, affection, and interaction, but you need space too. Phrases that may be helpful include: ""I need some quiet time right now."" ""I love you, and I need some space right now.""
If your siblings do not respect your boundaries, tell your parents. You deserve peace, and your siblings need to learn how to respect others' wishes.
Get the support from parents or guardians to find balance. It may be difficult, especially if dealing with a single working parent, a disabled or sick parent, or a situation in which you are truly responsible for a younger sibling. Especially if you are a teenager, you really need time to be with friends, go to skate parks and school dances, participate in sports or clubs, and be a young person.
Help negotiate appropriate boundaries with adults. If you are a very responsible child, parents sometimes need to be reminded that you have needs as a young person. Sometimes there are dire family situations that require an older sister to essentially be a parent. But if at all possible, you need to have a childhood which includes time for yourself. For instance, teens need to have time to hang out with friends, develop hobbies, have time to homework, and just have fun sometimes.

, Everyone has certain characteristics that make them unique. Focus on the things you love about your siblings, and the things that make them special.

, Your siblings will look up to you, and any lessons they can learn are often appreciated. Take time to discuss a new social skill or teach them to draw. Many times, they love it.

, There are incredibly responsible older sisters who go above and beyond expectations. But most of the time girls and women fall short of this Hollywood ideal. The reality is that Big Sister is not a job one asked for, and it is not easy. And while you can choose your friends, you cannot choose your siblings. It is not an easy relationship. Older sisters are often supposed to be more responsible, mature, and nurturing than younger siblings, even though that is more of accident of birth than because there is something inherent about being born first.

You will need their encouragement and support, even if they are not interested in joining you on your quest to get healthy.


If your family isn't aware of what you're trying to do, they may tempt you to eat foods that are not in your diet plan, unintentionally or otherwise. Telling them about your plan to get healthy will help them to understand when you say ‘no’ to unhealthy foods and hopefully make them a little more sensitive to your needs.
Telling your family about your decision will also help you to stick to your goals, because there will be other people to hold you accountable for what you eat and what exercise you do.
Once your family see the progress you've made — whether you intend to lose weight, increase your energy levels or get fit — they may be tempted to join you!;
, Eating a balanced diet is an essential part of becoming healthy. Eating healthy food in the correct proportions can help you to lose weight, gain energy, sleep better, have clearer skin and stronger hair and nails, along with a wealth of other benefits. However, following a balanced diet when your family does not can be difficult, as it will involve preparing your own meals. Here's some info on what a balanced diet should include:



Fruits and vegetables: These foods provide the body with minerals and vitamins. It is important to eat at least five portions of vegetables and fruit per day You can do this by eating a piece of fruit with breakfast, having a green salad for lunch, eating two portions of veg with your dinner and having some fruit or veg as a snack throughout the day.

Carbohydrates: Carbohydrates are foods that provide the body with energy. When following a healthy diet plan, it's best to eat wholemeal foods to get your daily carbohydrate intake. This includes wholemeal bread, whole-wheat pasta, and brown rice.

Protein: Protein helps to repair worn out cells and aids in the healing process. Foods that are rich in proteins include meat, fish, eggs and beans. Stick to seafood and white meat such as chicken and turkey as much as possible when following a healthy diet, as red meat has a higher fat content.

Healthy fats: Healthy fats are necessary for your overall health and to ensure that your metabolism is working efficiently. Good sources of healthy fats include avocados, oily fish like salmon, mackerel and trout and raw nuts and seeds like almonds, walnuts sunflower seeds and flaxseed.

, When your family are eating your favorite, unhealthy meals, it can be very difficult to stick to your diet plan. In this situation, it's best to substitute the food that they are eating with your own, healthier versions, as this will stop you from feeling like you're missing out.


For example, if your family are eating a pepperoni pizza from your favorite take-out, you can try making your own pizza using wholewheat flour, homemade tomato sauce and low-fat cheese, all topped with a selection of healthy veggies. In this way, you can still eat pizza with your family, but cut your calorie intake in half!
You can also substitute your family's unhealthy desserts (like ice cream or chocolate cake) with your own healthier treats. Try having a fresh fruit salad with yogurt, eating a wholewheat muffin, or making stewed apples with brown sugar and cinnamon. You'll still get to satisfy your sweet tooth without breaking your healthy eating plan.
Try to find foods that capture the taste and smell of tempting foods without the calories. This will make it easier to watch others eat junk foods.

, If you don't want to go to the hassle of making an entirely different meal from the rest of the family, you can still eat the same foods — you just need to make an effort to control your portion sizes and make one or two healthy additions to balance out the meal.


For example, if your family is eating spaghetti and meatballs, you can still enjoy the meal without sacrificing your diet. Just take a small portion of spaghetti (have a look at the package to see the recommended portion size), then fill the rest of your plate with steamed veggies.
Or if you're family are eating burgers from the grill, try eating the burger without the bun (white bread is basically empty carbohydrates with no real nutritional value) and filling the rest of your plate with a healthy green salad. You still get to enjoy the taste of barbecued red meat, but it'll be guilt-free!
Try to find out what your family is planning on eating well in advance. This gives you time to figure out what needs to be added to the dish to make the meal balanced and healthy.

, Drinking water is an essential part of a healthy diet — it keeps you hydrated, aids with digestion, leaves your skin looking clearer and flushes toxins from your system. It is recommended that you drink at least 8 glasses of water per day.


Sometimes we mistake thirst for hunger, so when you feel hungry try drinking a glass of water instead. Drinking a glass of water before each meal is also a good way to limit your appetite and prevent you from overeating.
You can also increase your water intake by drinking herbal teas, so drink as many cups as you like each day. Some herbal teas have additional benefits — chamomile has calming properties, ginger aids with digestions and green tea is full of antioxidants.

, Exercise is an essential part of any plan to get healthy, because it helps to burn extra calories and to distribute nutrients to different parts of the body. Exercise also helps to prevent diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity.


It is important make exercise part of your plan to get healthy and stick to it. Studies show that even ten minutes of physical exercise per day can have a positive impact on the body. Exercises that can be done daily include walking to work, swimming, skipping and dancing.
Exercise is always easier if you have someone else to do it with you. Even if your family isn't ready to change their diet, they may be willing to join you for a daily run or dance class. It doesn't have to be the whole family — if you can just get your mother, father, daughter, son, brother or sister involved, the rest of the family may follow.
Try to find an exercise that you enjoy and do it for at least a half hour each day. Even if it's difficult at first, you'll find it becomes gradually easier as your fitness increases. Don't make the excuse that you ""have no time"" for exercise — everybody can find an extra 30 minutes in their day, you just need to want it enough!

, Being healthy isn't all about eating right and getting enough exercise, it also involves taking care of your mental health by avoiding stress and making sure you get enough rest. Even if your family life tends to be a bit crazy and stressful, it's important that you set aside some ""me-time"" as part of your health plan.


Some things you can do to de-stress and relax include yoga, meditation, reading a book and or even taking a warm bath in the evening.
Also make sure you are getting enough sleep — you should be aiming for 8 hours per night, 6 at the absolute minimum. Getting enough sleep ensures that the body is not overworked and that you are ready to perform well at work or school the next day.
If issues with your family or work are bringing you down, consider seeing a counselor who can help you work through your problems and come to terms with any negative feelings you've been having. Having a healthy body is no good if you're not in a healthy state of mind.

, In addition to taking care of your diet, exercise and mental health requirements, staying healthy within a big family also involves avoiding sickness when it hits your household. Luckily, there are several measures you can take to avoid catching an illness from your family members.


Hand washing is one of the most basic things that can help you to avoid becoming sick. This includes washing hands before and after visiting the toilet, before cooking, before and after changing the baby’s diaper, and after touching any dirty tools or surfaces.
It's also important to wash and disinfect your hands after touching anything that has been touched by the family member who's sick. It's a good idea to have hand sanitizer wipes or gel easily available for these situations. In addition, any toys that sick children have been playing with should be thoroughly cleaned to avoid passing the illness onto other kids in the family.
Don't share any dishes, cups or utensils with sick family members. The dishes should be cleaned with soap and hot water after the sick person has used them — this helps to prevent spread of germs from one person to another.
When one spouse is sick, make an effort to to face in opposite directions while sleeping and avoid kissing one another. Bed sheets should be cleaned frequently in a hot cycle in the washing machine. These precautions will help to avoid the transmission of some common ailments like the cold and flu.

, Once you've adopted your own fit and healthy lifestyle, you can start slowly convincing your family to join you. One great way to do this is to get the whole family involved in the cooking process.


Get kids to help you with baking by doing simple tasks such as sifting the flour during home baking, or beating the eggs for a healthy omelette.
Ask family members what their specific likes and likes and dislikes are — if Dad doesn't like onions, maybe you could leave them out of the next salad you make.
Host a family pizza night — everyone can roll out their own wholewheat pizza dough and load it with their favorite healthy toppings. This is also a fun way for the family to spend time together.

, When healthy food looks good, it makes it a lot more tempting to eat, so try to jazz up your healthy dishes by adding colorful fresh ingredients and interesting textures.


If you're trying to get kids to eat fruit, a colorful fruit salad will look a lot more appealing than a few brown pieces of apple. Mixing in some fresh fruit juice or yogurt will also add flavor to the dish and make it more interesting.
If you're trying to convince adult members of the family to eat salad, you may not have much luck with a boring combination of lettuce, tomato and cucumber (although these make a good base). Try adding things like strawberries or olives for color, nuts and seeds for texture and eggs and avocados for flavor. A tasty dressing made from olive oil, balsamic vinegar and crushed garlic can also help to make a salad more attractive to picky eaters.

, Another, sneakier way of introducing your family to healthy eating is to hide healthy foods in tasty dishes. In this way, your family can enjoy their mealtimes, but still benefit from the vitamins and nutrients that healthy food provides.


On it's own, spinach isn't a very attractive ingredient, but if you try hiding it inside puff pastry with some garlic and low-fat cheese, your family will soon be fighting over it! You could also try introducing items like lettuce, carrots and bean sprouts inside homemade spring rolls — be adventurous!
Making vegetable soups is another great way to get your family eating more healthily without compromising on taste. Ingredients like carrots, zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower, sweet potato and squash all work fantastically well when blended into a soup, and once you jazz them up with things like fresh herbs, a drop of cream or a splash of soy sauce, your family will forget about wanting processed foods.

, Herbs and spices are a Godsend for any cook who is trying to make mealtimes more interesting for picky eaters. By taking advantage of herbs and spices, you can recreate the processed flavors that your family love in a much healthier, more natural way.


Popular spices include cumin, turmeric, cinnamon and nutmeg, while common herbs include parsley, thyme, rosemary, basil and mint. Experiment with adding different combinations of herbs and spices to meat and vegetable dishes and you'll open up a whole new world of flavor.
You can also play around with other flavor enhancers, such as soy sauce, fish sauce, garlic and ginger, flavored salts, vegetable, beef, chicken and fish stocks, and the zest of citrus fruits.

, Healthy eating isn't just about what you eat, it's also about how you cook it. So even if you're having a tough time converting your family to salad, you can easily convince them to make a couple of healthy changes to the way they prepare their food.


Instead of frying meats or boiling vegetables, switch to grilling, steaming or baking in the oven. These methods are much healthier as they don't require much fat for cooking (like frying) and don't boil away nutrients (like boiling). With a little seasoning, the food will taste just as good, but the number of calories it contains will decrease, while the nutritional value will increase.
Switch to using healthier, unsaturated fats when cooking, such as olive oil, coconut oil and clarified butter and stay away from unhealthy vegetable and seed oils, such as corn oil, canola oil, grapeseed oil and sunflower oil. Always cook with real butter instead of margarine or lard. This simple switch can have a significant impact on your family's overall health.

, Variety is the spice of life, as they say, so avoid preparing the same kinds of healthy meals night after night, or your family will soon get bored and slip back into their old ways.


For example, you could try having an Indian themed vegetable curry with brown rice one night, a chicken and vegetable Chinese stir fry another, steak and green salad the next night and grilled salmon with asparagus and sweet potato fries the next. Just because you're eating healthy doesn't mean mealtimes have to be boring!
Also try to take turns with the cooking — another family member might come up with a fantastically delicious idea for a healthy meal, which you would never have thought of. Involving other family members in the cooking process might also help to get them more motivated about eating healthy.

, Sitting everybody down at the table and having dinner as a family will help to reinforce the idea that you are all getting healthy together. It will also help to make your mealtimes more enjoyable, as you can talk to one another about your day and just enjoy one another's company.


No matter how busy each of you are, it's important that you make time for one another. Eating together will also help you to stay on track with your healthy eating plan, as it's much more tempting to order take-out when you're dining alone.
Make sure everyone in the family has their own dinnertime duty, so the work isn't left to one person. Someone can be responsible for cooking, someone else can set and clear the table, while someone else is in charge of the washing up. You can rotate these duties on a nightly or weekly basis, if you like.

, Once you've got the healthy eating down, it's time to rope your family into doing some exercise. If you have young kids in the family they shouldn't be too difficult to convince, but older kids and busy parents might be a little more of a challenge!


Think about organizing a family day trip at the weekend, where you all go hiking or swimming or even for a long walk through the woods. Pack a healthy picnic and take this as an opportunity to spend some quality time together.
If you have a garden or backyard, make an effort to get outside more throughout the week. Start a soccer tournament with your kids, shoot some hoops with your sister, or do some gardening with your mother. Any kind of physical activity is good!

Create a family scrapbook, family photo album, or work on constructing an extended family tree together.
Present your research and stories to other family members. These conversations will help foster a sense of closeness and shared experience.;
, Rather than a parent-child relationship, work on creating an adult peer relationship. Even though parenting is a lifelong commitment, the nature of the parent-child relationship must transform as children become more psychologically, socially, and economically independent.Communicate not as mother and daughter, but as mutual friends who enjoy common interests and activities. Discuss problems, issues, and questions thoughtfully and calmly, the way two friends would.
Maintain a sense of humor and affection. Rely on your decades-long relationship to reminisce and joke with each other about funny memories or situations.

, Consistent parental interest, attention, and approval is critical to any parent-child relationship no matter the age or stage of the children.


Nurture your daughter’s development even as an adult through encouragement and reassurance. Research has shown that a mother’s continued support can foster important psychological development for an adult daughter developing an independent sense of self and identity., Mothers often report more tension in their relationship with their daughter than with sons.Often, this tension stems from both intergenerational differences and disagreement over habits, traits, and general behavior.Recognizing these barriers can be the first step in creating a healthy relationship between you and your daughter.

, It can be difficult for a mother who did not work to accept that her daughter, who works full-time, will have less time to devote to household tasks or childcare.


According to the U.S. Department of Labor, women comprised 47% of the total labor force in 2010.But in generations past, women were more likely to stay home after marriage in order to raise children. In 1960, only nineteen percent of married women with preschool age children worked outside the home.Many older mothers are concerned that their daughters who work and also have families are over-extended and stressed. These opinions over work and lifestyle differences can strain the bond between parent and child., In addition to generational differences, disagreements can stem from interpersonal conflict between mom and daughter.


For example, mothers may still perceive their adult daughters as lazy, lacking respect, or irresponsible, even though these traits are more associated with the earlier teenage years., Seek out hobbies and activities that deepen the mother-daughter bond and provide relaxation and fun for both parties.


Pursue fun activities together. Exercising, shopping, trying new restaurants, seeing movies, making crafts, getting spa treatments, or even something as simple as getting coffee together can help mothers and daughters find fun connections.

, If you and your daughter don’t live close enough to interact on a regular in-person basis, try using other methods to connect.


Phone and video calls, as well as texting and using social media apps to connect daily or weekly can help ease the burden of distance.
Schedule a weekly or even a daily chat date at a mutually agreeable time.

, Attending family reunions, family outings, or doing activities with other friends of the family can be relaxing and enjoyable, and takes away the pressure of spending too much one-on-one time.

, Getting away from the daily grind can help both moms and daughters relax, recharge, and improve communication.


Family vacations have proven mental and physical health benefits, including decreased depression and an improvement in heart health.Taking vacations with family members, including mother-daughter trips, help create fun memories, improve resilience to changing circumstances, and allow families to be with each other without the stresses of home., Writing notes, giving small gifts, or even saying “Thank you” or “I love you” can go a long way to improving the relationship between both mom and daughter.

, A sense of respect for the privacy of the adult daughter’s choices is a key part of a functional mother-daughter relationship.


Allow relationship change to happen naturally. Know that it is normal to experience transitions in the mother-daughter relationship. Changes like marriage, moves, and the arrival of grandchildren can cause both moms and daughters to reexamine how they interact with each other.Avoid offering unsolicited opinions. A mom’s advice, while well-meaning, can feel like negative judgement., Work toward respectful communication on all issues even when mother and daughter disagree. This creates a sense of mutual consideration between mom and daughter, rather than the daughter feeling that her mother wants to dictate her daughter’s choices.


Respect your daughter’s need for independence. For example, mothers who constantly call, text, or show up uninvited can make adult daughters’ feel smothered and resentful., Unless there is reason to suspect that a daughter is engaged in an unhealthy or abusive relationship with her significant other, it is especially important for mothers to nurture and support their daughters’ close connections with others.


Avoid inserting yourself or taking sides during arguments between your daughter and her significant other.
Refrain from criticizing your daughter’s partner – this can become a source of unhappiness and trouble in their own relationship.Respect the couple’s privacy. Understand that your daughter’s relationship with her partner is separate and distinct from your relationship with her.

, Daughters want to know that they can trust their moms with private information.


Avoid telling other family members or outsiders about a daughter’s life problems or issues., Whether it’s babysitting grandchildren, helping a daughter move, or caring for her when she’s ill, a mother’s help is always appreciated no matter the daughter’s age.

Never think about other things when someone is talking. Instead, focus only on what's being said. If you feel your mind wandering, return your thoughts to the speakers words.;
, When talking to someone, you often are focusing on what you're going to say next. This tendency can can get more intense when talking to a family member. If you're, say, discussing a family problem or disagreement, you may be eager to share your thoughts. However, do not think about how you feel or wish to respond. Focus only on the speaker and their thoughts and opinions on the matter.You can think of how you will respond later. Now, pay attention to what is being said. Make understanding your family member's perspective your priority.
Remember, you will be better equipped to think of a thoughtful response if you actually understand what's being said. Communication will be better overall if you are able to truly understand the other person's point of view.

, You want the speaker to feel valued. Make sure to show you're listening. You can convey you're paying attention via non-verbal cues. Nod as the speaker talks, smiles and laugh when appropriate, and maintain eye contact., It's okay to embrace a pause. A couple of seconds of silence in a conversation is not a bad thing, and allows the speaker a chance to fully express themselves. Instead of immediately launching into your response, pause for a moment after the speaker finishes talking. This will allow you to make sure they're completely finished talking.People have a natural tendency to pause when they speak. If you notice the speaker has paused, do not assume they're done talking. Give them a few seconds before you respond.
If the speaker does not start talking again after a few seconds have passed, it's safe to assume they've finished talking.

, Part of listening is understanding. If there's anything the speaker said you did not understand, ask. When someone finishes talking, ask for clarification if necessary. This will convey you are truly listening to your family member and value their perspective.Ask questions that encourage open discussion. For example, ""What do you think of the situation?"" and ""Where do you think we should go from here?""
Avoid asking ""why"" questions. These can come off as judgmental and make the speaker feel defensive. For example, don't ask, ""Why did you decide to take that job?"" Instead ask, ""How did you come to that decision?""

"
"
Restate what has been said.,
Help family members summarize their experiences.,
Reflect on what's been said.,
Use ""I""-statements when it's your turn to talk.,
Accept you don't always have to solve someone's problems.",How to Be a Good Listener to Your Family2," Briefly summarizing what the speaker has said can go a long way towards effective communication. Everyone wants to feel valued and heard, so reiterating a family member's point can convey you were listening. It can also give the family member in question a chance to hear your interpretation of your words, and clarify as necessary.Try to briefly paraphrase what you heard when the speaker finishes. For example, ""So, it sounds to me like you're a little frustrated with mom right now because you feel like she's not treating you like an adult.""
This can help you make sure you understood the speaker. It will really show you're listening and allow you and your family to communicate better.

, You want to help someone figure what they're feeling and why. After listening, try to help your family member summarize their experience.For example, start with something like, ""Okay, let me make sure I'm clear on what you're saying.""
Then, ask questions to help your family member frame their experience. For example, ""You're upset that mom gives unsolicited advice on your car insurance. How would you say you feel about that? I'm sensing frustration."" Helping a family member put a label on their feelings can help them better understand a situation.

, After allowing a family member to talk, reflect briefly on the subject. Try to figure out not just what's being said, but why it matters. For example, say things like ""I feel like this is really important to you"" or ""I'm getting a sense this is something we should all talk about as a family."", Family situations can be complicated. You may sometimes disagree or take issue with what's being said. When disagreements arise, use ""I""-statements. These minimize objective blame as they place the focus on your personal feelings over an objective assessment.An ""I""-statement has three parts. It begins with ""I feel..."" after which you immediately state your feelings. Then, you state what led to those feelings. Finally, you explain why you feel the way you do.
If you disagree with a family member, avoid framing your feelings in a judgmental manner. For example, ""Mom is just trying to help and you know you've had problems with money in the past. You're really frustrating me.""
Instead, reframe that sentiment using an ""I""-statement. For example, ""I feel frustrated because you're angry at mom when she's just trying to help because I think her concerns are legitimate and she does care about you.""

, With family, you're often inclined to help. However, you can't solve another person's problems. Oftentimes, a family member just wants someone listen and empathize. Allow the person to talk and resist the urge to jump in and provide your two cents on the issue."
"
Do not interrupt.,
Refrain from offering advice.,
Do not change the subject prematurely.,
Avoid hurrying the speaker.,
Refrain from judgment.",How to Be a Good Listener to Your Family3," Interrupting can put the breaks on effective conversation. Always allow a few seconds of silence after someone finishes talking before offering your response. This allows you to make sure the speaker is done talking.Do not talk over someone either. No matter how passionately you feel about a subject, do not start talking until the other person has finished.

, Unless you are explicitly asked, do not offer advice. Unsolicited advice can make it seem like you're not really listening. You're only hearing what you want, and offering advice in response. If someone just wants to talk, refrain from trying to tell them what to do., Never change the subject before the speaker has gotten their words out. Even if a subject makes you uncomfortable, it's important you let the speaker express themselves.If there's family drama, you may be tempted to hurry the speaker. For example, if they talk about how you talked to your father last week, you may start talking about something you saw on TV that night.
Avoid doing this. Part of communicating with your family is talking about difficult subjects at times. You need to allow conversations to flow where they will, even if a topic upsets you.

, Never rush the person talking. Do not interject with your interpretation before the speaker is finished just to hurry the speaker along. Never say things like, ""Can you get to the point?"" This will make it seem like you're not invested in the conversation., Even if you're frustrated or angry with someone, try to cultivate empathy when listening. Try to understand how the person feels and why. It's never a good idea to listen with judgment, as this will reduce your ability to fully communicate. Even if you disagree with someone's actions or opinions, avoid judgment."

Discuss the expectations with your partner.,
Be loving.,
Take Responsibility for the household!,
Maintain a great Appearance.,
DON'T Forget about the Cooking!,
Plan ahead, with the aim to have a delicious meal on the table when your spouse gets home from work.,
Pay close attention to little things.,
Don't Forget the Errands!,
Organize your time!,
Be Happy!,
Show Respect.",How to Be a Good House Husband," Discuss realistic expectations, and how to meet them as best as you can. The definition of a good house husband depends on which house you live in. It is also very culture-dependent. Do not presume that you have the same expectations because you may find out the hard way (through arguments) that you don't. Sit down and talk it over. What are the things that need to be done to keep up with in the home? What are the responsibilities in the home? If you are primarily responsible for keeping the house clean, others may take responsibility for cleaning up after themselves: putting dirty laundry in the hamper, placing things where they belong after they are finished using them, emptying the trash, putting dishes in the dishwasher, etc. If you are also caring for young children during the day, you may be surprised by how difficult it is to also keep up with household tasks. Others in your family may need to help with the cooking and cleaning, if possible.


Be aware that housekeeping is not as simple as it sounds. Men without military training may not have the basic skills to accomplish all the cleaning tasks or even know what they are. If you've never organized a house, shopped for food and household essentials, cooked or cleaned up because your mother did all these things, your results will not be as effective as any adult woman taking on these tasks. You'll take longer doing it and with less effective results. If possible, get your experienced spouse to walk you through how she does all these things.;
, Love is an important ingredient for a successful household. Remind your kids and wife or significant other that you love them, often. Pay attention to your wife or significant other and children. Like say that boy of yours is dying to go to the park for some baseball. Make an effort to spend as much time as possible. If you do this, your family will know that they are loved.

, You are now the ""homemaker"" of your family. Being the homemaker, it is your responsibility to make it a home. Ensure the cleanliness of the home and that repairs and maintenance are completed. One of the greatest advantages to the house husband is that you can now take the time to do the needed repairs or maintenance items that would have taken time away from your family when you were away at work.

, It is all too easy to stop paying attention to your appearance when you have a no reason to ""dress to impress"" at the office. Try to spend some time each day making yourself look good and well kept. There is no reason why you can't still maintain a good appearance, even if you have no plans of leaving the house that day. Further, your wife or significant other would love to come home to see you looking good -- not dumpy and unkempt.

, Remember when you would work all day, how great it was to come home to a freshly prepared meal. Now that you are a house husband you can ensure your family eats a delicious meal, prepared for them with love, every day of the week.

, Microwave meals are not suitable cuisine, so find a recipe book you like and start experimenting. Having a great meal ready for your family is good way to let them know that you have been thinking about them. A good meal can be an expression of love and a warm welcome home.


Crock pots and other slow cooked meals may give you the chance to get other chores done while the food cooks. They tend to be very tasty.
If you want them eating healthier, treats should be something of a special occasion. Everyday snacks could be fruit, vegetables or healthy grains while a big production dessert could take place sometime on the weekend for everyone to enjoy it together.
Budgeting for food is another big part of the job. Prepackaged anything costs more, the more home cooking you do, the better the family will eat both in health and in terms of luxury. Buying non-perishables in bulk is often cheaper than small boxes or quantities.

, Remember family birthdays, wedding anniversaries, etc. Attention to detail adds up to big attention, and you will have a happy marriage as a result.


Remember the personal treats that cheer up your loved ones individually. If you remember the kids' favorite foods and fix them regularly or surprise your spouse with flowers from the garden or a candlelit bath - these things create memories. If you do these small affectionate things more often than calendar holidays and birthdays, they create very powerful memories. They don't have to be big, just personal. Keep track of the things that cheer up your spouse and your kids individually, write them down sometimes when they're not home. When they have a really bad day, that's when to trot out the comfort food or the surprise foot rub.

, Remember, there is more to keeping a family happy than what is in the immediate house. Don't forget the important errands that can add up and take a lot of time to do. By doing one or two a day you can keep up with them, and they will not get unmanageable or take up mass amounts of time on weekends or family time. Pick up the dry cleaning when it is ready, Run to the market when you know something is needed, pickup packages and other items that may need to be retrieved. Overall, just make sure that the errands and tasks are done. Your family will appreciate you for it.


If you don't like shopping that often, you can reduce the number of errands by planning ahead and doing them in groups. If you want to get in shape, bicycle for perishable shopping and only use the car when you're stocking up non-perishables or big stuff.

, It may not feel like a job, but there's a reason why half the human race did it full time for a living for so long. It's easy to get overwhelmed with the wide variety of different tasks that need to be done every day, especially maintenance cleaning that gets interrupted by minor problems and crises. Appliances break, the time you take fixing it or running out to replace it means you start dinner late, all of a sudden the stuff that needed to be done isn't all done and there's no food. Folks get annoyed at this especially if they take their own skills for granted and think what you do is a no-brainer. First experiment and find out how much time these tasks actually take, then budget three times that time for how long they really take when everything goes wrong. Life always happens.


Budget a small personal treat for the tasks you don't enjoy. It can be small like a pack of gum or non-monetary like taking the time to play a game. Or just put a dollar into a jar till it adds up for something big that you want. Small personal rewards make it easier to motivate yourself to do things that you're reluctant to that need to be done. Change is good for this if you need to break it down to different specific chores and a lot of them need doing. Or when you finish a chore faster than you planned and still did a good job, put a note in the ""time bank"" and build up to where you can spend most of a day playing a video game or whatever.

, Anger spreads fast. Remember when mom was furious? What a scary thought! Happiness will be effective tool on your household, and will provide peace in your home.

, When a child does something good, (For example: Get an A on a test in a class they were failing in, learn to ride their bike, etc...) Tell them how proud you are. Acknowledge your families contributions, no matter how small you may think they are.

For some people, it might entail attending a child’s baptism and confirmation, while other people might expect continual spiritual guidance. Make sure you are clear on exactly what you are agreeing to so that you avoid confusion later down the road.


Some people even choose secular godparents to help their child’s moral development. If this is the case, make sure you understand the moral values of the parents and find out what other expectations they have.Traditionally, godparents were responsible to raise the child should anything happen to the parents. This is often an expectation and an important part of this role. The family is likely entrusting their child to you should anything happen to them. It is important to clarify if this is expected ahead of time and to be ready for that responsibility. Because of this aspect of the role, it is not something to accept lightly. Take time to consider whether you are ready and willing to potentially raise a child.;
, Not all Christian churches are the same or even expect the same from a godparent. Find out what their specific denomination (or non-denomination) expects and make sure you are comfortable with their beliefs.


Keep in mind that certain denominations require you to be a member in order to be a godparent. For example, Catholics expect a godparent to be a practicing Catholic.Lutherans also have this expectation.The Church of England, on the other hand, allows for godparents of other denominations.Make sure you meet the church’s requirements.

, Being a godparent can be a significant time commitment. To prepare, set aside some time in your schedule to devote to your new role and make note of any important dates such as the child’s birthday and baptism. Planning ahead will ensure you have enough time to spend on your godchild.


If you aren’t sure how much time to set aside, try starting with two hours per week. This will allow you sufficient time to connect with your godchild as well as preparing gifts or cards and spiritual encouragement. You’ll probably find that some weeks require less time and some weeks require more time, but this is a good starting point.

, Being a godparent is not only a commitment to a child, but also to the entire family. It is an honor to be given this role and requires a positive bond with the parents too. This is why godparents are often a relative or close friend of the family. Make sure you prioritize and respect this special relationship.


You could try throwing a baby shower or host a special dinner for the family. Try to assist them when the baby comes or offer to watch the child while the parents have some much-needed rest. Anything that shows that you care and want to be involved with their lives will be much appreciated.

, A godparent is also a baptismal sponsor in many denominations. This often involves standing with the family during the baptism and answering questions to solidify your commitment as a godparent.The child’s baptism is often the starting point for being a godparent and you play a prominent role in this ceremony.In the Church of England, at the baptism ceremony the vicar will ask questions such as: “Will you pray for them, draw them by your example into the community of faith and walk with them in the way of Christ?” and “Will you care for them, and help them to take their place within the life and worship of Christ’s Church?” Your response to these questions would be, “…With the help of God we will.”Beyond the baptism, godparents are expected to be present at other religious milestones, such as a first communion or a confirmation. Being there to celebrate your godchild’s milestones is an important part of showing your support.

, Spiritual guidance is an important aspect of being a godparent. To effectively fulfill this role, you need to be certain of your own spiritual convictions. Make sure you are spending time with God, reading the Bible, attending church, and developing your beliefs. When you are in a good place spiritually, you will be able to effectively help your godchild as well.If you are struggling with your beliefs, you could try joining a small group or finding a mentor. This could help you to work through some of your doubts and learn from others.
A daily devotional is also a useful tool in nurturing your faith. Choose one that will help you draw near to God and provide encouragement.

, Take time to talk with your godchild about God starting at an early age. You can start by telling your godchild that God loves them and, as they grow, you can talk about your own journey with God.


If you need help communicating your faith, you can use a religious book for children and spend time reading with them. You can also find out what they are learning in Sunday school or religious eduction and have a conversation with them about it. For example, you could say, “I heard you were learning about Jesus dying for sin and rising from the dead. What do you think about this? Do you have any questions?”

, Consistently praying for godchild is perhaps one of the most important things a godparent can do. Try to make time each day to ask God to watch over your godchild. Let your godchild know that you are praying for them. This shows them that you are thinking of them and you care., Whether it’s just a reminder that God loves them or a Bible verse that means a lot to you, giving personal spiritual encouragement will help your godchild grow. You can be creative and share an inspirational picture with them or share something new that you learned about God.When your godchild is a bit older, you could send them an email saying something such as, “Dear Nancy, I just wanted to let you know that I’ve been thinking and praying about you. Today when I was reading the Bible, I was especially encouraged by 2 Samuel 22:20: “brought me out into a broad place; he rescued me because he delighted in me.” I just wanted to remind you that God loves you and delights in you and is always with you, and so am I. Love, Godmother”

, Share some of your favorite Bible stories and let your godchild know which parts of God’s word are especially meaningful to you. Early on, you can use a Bible for young children and then gradually progress to the full Bible. Make sure to talk with them about what you are reading and to answer any questions they might have.


For example, with a young child, if you read a story about David and Goliath, you could say something like, “See how God kept David safe? Even though there was something scary, God watched over David and helped him. God loves you and is with you too.”

, If you have solidified your relationship with your godchild starting at an early age, as they grow they will be able to come to you with questions and thoughts about life. It is important to be the person that they can always come to with doubts and questions. You can make a big impact by providing wise advice and sharing ideas from a spiritual perspective.Eventually your godchild will be trying to find their place in the world. If they come to you with questions about their purpose or meaning in life, you can provide valuable insight, such as, “John, I’ve watched you grow from a young age and you have always been incredibly creative. Why don’t we pray about it together and ask God to show you how you can use your beautiful creativity to glorify him.”

, Even if you attend a different church, try to visit your godchild’s church on occasion. Make sure you are familiar with their teachings and ministries. Attending church with your godchild is a positive spiritual activity you can share. You will also be better prepared to help them if they have any questions or need your support.

, Besides connecting spiritually, try to connect in other aspects of your godchild’s life. Perhaps you can take them out to dinner once a month or try a special activity together like painting. Familiarize yourself with their hobbies and find a fun way to get involved. There is no substitute for developing a solid relationship with your godchild. This is a foundational aspect of a lifelong commitment to them.


Perhaps your godchild is involved with sports or music or other extracurriculars. Try to attend as many of these events as you are able. It will mean the world to your godchild to have your support. You could even help out the parents by driving your godchild to an event.
Try to stay up to speed with what they are learning in school. For example, if they are learning about the Solar System, you could ask them, “What’s your favorite planet?” They might even be interested to hear that when you learned about the Solar System, Pluto was a planet!

, Come up with certain activities that you will do each year. Maybe for Christmas you will make cookies together or for Easter you could dye eggs. This will give you a special time to look forward to and help ensure that you consistently connect.


Ask your godchild for ideas about traditions they’d like to have. Traditions don’t have to be traditional! Maybe your godson loves cars and wants to go to watch a race each year for his birthday. These traditions can be unique to the two of you and honor your godchild’s distinct personality.

, Not only does this show your godchild that you care, but it is a great way to connect with them. You can give religious gifts such as a special Bible or religious jewelry. You can also give general gifts, for example a stuffed animal on their birthday. Make sure to send holiday and birthday cards too. A handwritten note on any occasion can go a long way. It is always nice to hear that someone is thinking of you and cares about you., Since your commitment is to the parents as well, try hosting a dinner at your home and invite the whole family to join. Solidifying your relationship with the entire family is a great way to be involved in your godchild’s life.


You could have a casual game night where everyone brings their favorite game. It doesn’t have to be fancy. Sometimes pizza and games are more meaningful than an elegant dinner party.

, If you live far apart, or if one of you moves, you can still stay in touch. Try video chatting or talking on the phone. You can also use email or even text messaging. Make the most of the technology available to you to continue this special bond no matter where life takes you., Children need positive role models. When your godchild sees the way you conduct yourself, they will want to emulate it. Make sure your behavior is in line with your faith so that they can learn from not only your words, but your actions.You could volunteer somewhere together, like working at a soup kitchen or building homes for those less fortunate. When you show your godchild that caring about other people is important, this will help them to learn empathy. Doing an activity together will also help your connection and let them see the ways that you care about people.

, Be available to the child during any difficult periods, such as a family illness, divorce, loss of a job, or other unfortunate events. Let your godchild know that they can always confide in you when they are having a hard time or if they need a shoulder to cry on. Your support will be desperately needed at these times and you can provide guidance and encouragement to help them get through it.

, In case of a terrible tragedy, if you have agreed to be the legal guardian, be prepared to step in for the parents. Give your godchild time and space to grieve while letting them know that you are always there for them. Help them to the best of your ability and don’t underestimate how important your love and support is. You will never replace their parents but you will play a vital role in helping them through this tragic time.


You don’t have to help them through this alone. Sometimes a child will need counseling or outside support to cope with tragedy. Don’t be afraid to ask for help if you need it.
Recognize that everyone deals with grief differently. Your godchild will likely behave in a different manner than you are accustomed to. This is to be expected and it is important to be patient and allow them time to heal.

Make your every visit a memorable one for your uncle/aunt by making them feel important and loved.

",How to Be a Favourite Niece or Nephew," This is a crucial part of being a good niece or nephew. Be respectful of your aunt/uncle's beliefs and personality. It is also important never to argue rudely with them. Show acceptance of their opinions by not rebelling. If you disagree, say your opinion and listen calmly to their viewpoints. No need to yell or scream; it doesn't do good to any of you.;
, If you have cousins younger than yourself, try to bond with them by offering to babysit them, teach them, advise them or by playing with them. If you have older cousins, be respectful and honor their philosophy and way of life. Ask for guidance and appreciate all that they do for you. If they tell you to do something, be obedient unless it is immoral, unlawful or harmful to yourself.

, If they are incapable of doing something themselves, offer to help. For example, walk their dogs, run errands, fix small things around the house. If they are ill, make some vegetable soup and offer it to them. Traditionally, it is a very good deed to bring tea or coffee to one's loved elders every morning and ask if they need anything every night. Try doing this with sincerity, and do not stop unless you feel like it is a terribly dreaded part of your life.

, Whenever you visit your uncle/aunt take something for them. Homemade or baked items are a good idea. If you aren't yet able to make things yourself, a hug or a warm compliment are great things to give. Otherwise, be thoughtful. Think of what they like and bring to them. For instance, if your aunt loves jewelry, bring her a pearl necklace and say, ""For the shining pearl in your soul.""

, If your aunt/uncle are religious and share a religion with you, go to your holy site with them and worship reverently. If they don't share a religion with you, visit their worship sites and see some of the rituals, and have them do the same for yours. If they are not religious, take them to tours, seeing different buildings where people worship.

, If your aunt/uncle has a pet, be friendly with it, even if you don't like it. If they like something that you hate, accept their likes but don't force yourself to take them up. Cherish any shared hobbies and enjoy them together. Meanwhile, be obedient and follow the rules of the family. If you feel the rules are unjust, try to get them changed in an orderly manner rather than disobey them rebelliously.

, Do random acts of kindness. Try not to forget a holiday or birthday. If you do, then make it up with a kindly gift and an affectionate smile. Never lie to your aunt/uncle, and be as kind and respectful as possible.

, Be thankful for the moments you have together. Watching old films or photo collections, playing golf, swimming in the sea, reading together...whatever it is, if you and your aunt and uncle like it, cherish each moment.

Do not assume the invitation is extended to your family or significant other.",How to Be a Guest During Birth1," If there will be other guests present at the birth, ask the mother who she has invited so that you can anticipate the environment during delivery.


If she has invited her children, ask if she would like you to take charge of watching them or taking care of them during and shortly after the delivery so that she is not worried about monitoring them.
If someone with whom you do not get along well has been invited, consider whether you should attend the birth; inviting your personal drama into the birth experience may be uncomfortable for the mother and other guests at the birth.;
, Some women may want your encouragement while others may prefer to simply have you stand back and stay quiet. Although this may always change once childbirth begins, it is good to have an idea of what the mother expects your role to be in advance.

, If you are close friends or siblings with the mother, do not assume she included an implied invitation for your spouse or children to attend.


If you are the partner of the woman delivering, do not assume that you can invite your parents or additional guests without the mother’s permission. She may resent you for doing such during or after birth.

Be prepared to learn about yourself – and your family.",How to Attend Family Counseling," Getting loved ones to attend family counseling together might take some effort and organization. Whether you’re trying to convince your spouse, your parents, or your siblings, you’ll first need to have a frank talk. Ask your loved ones to sit down so you can communicate your desire with them.Let your loved ones know that you want to have an important talk, i.e. “Bill, I have something really important that I want to talk about with you. Can we sit down together?” This will help them focus their attention and also communicate that they should take what you have to say seriously.
Pick a good time and place for your conversation. Choose a moment when your loved ones are not busy but can give you all their attention. You might approach them in the evening, for example, after they return from work and are settling down.
Choose a moment when your family members are relaxed and at ease. Avoid bringing up the subject in a public place or if you are fighting.;
, The whole point of talking to your loved ones is to propose family counseling, so be direct and to-the-point. At the same time, be prepared for some possible push-back. Approach the topic gently and with patience and try not to get angry or defensive.Try saying something like, “Maria, I’ve been thinking and wonder if we might communicate better with some help. What do you think about family counseling?”
Show empathy, i.e. “I know this is a hard conversation, but I’m only saying this because I care about you and our relationship. I wouldn’t be asking if I didn’t love you and want things to be better between us.”
Since your loved ones might not be receptive to what you say, consider using “I” statements, i.e. “I think that family counseling could help us” or ""I'd really try and find a way to stop fighting with you, and I think having some help would be useful for me."" This wording can help you express your feelings but avoid language that assigns blame to others.

, Your loved ones might be more receptive to the idea of family counseling if you focus on how it can solve problems. Stress the practical element: how therapy together will teach you to fix problems in your relationships and communication, rather than the chance it gives you to vent your feelings.For instance, you might say something like “I want to get counseling so that we can learn to get along better and find compromises” rather than “I want to go to counseling so you can understand me better.”
Point out that family therapy can show you problems in your behavior and family roles, teaching you how to work through issues. Family therapy can also allow you and loved ones to improve your ability to communicate, express thoughts and emotions, and solve problems together.

, Your loved ones ultimately have a choice: they might be receptive to counseling or they might not. People may be afraid, distrustful, or skeptical that therapy can work. But even with a refusal, don’t lose hope. There are still other alternatives to family counseling that can help you and loved ones improve your relationships.For instance, propose a weekly family meeting where you can talk about the state of your relationship. Or, promise to spend 10 minutes every day listening to your loved ones’ feelings.
You can also try self-help material. Books like Getting the Love You Want and The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work explore things like communication and dealing with conflict and power struggles in relationships.
Don’t forget that you can seek counseling on your own, too. Every member contributes to a family’s dynamic and is responsible on some level for the quality of relationships. You can learn a lot, even if your other loved ones aren’t present.

, In general, family therapy is useful in dealing with problems that arise in family relationships. However, there are different focuses. Family therapists can help parents cope with a child who acts out, for example, or improve spouses’ person-to-person communication. The type that’s best for you largely depends on your needs.Are you dealing with an at-risk child? There are family therapies that focus on kids and adolescents who show behavioral problems, delinquency, or substance abuse.
Does a family member have a drug or alcohol problem that is affecting the group? This can be another focus of therapy.
There are also family therapists who work on marriages or help families cope when a member has a severe physical or mental illness.

, Your primary care doctor should be able to refer you to a therapist, if you express the desire to see one. You might also get advice from another medical professional like a psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker, or nurse. Just ask. They should be able to give you advice, suggest names, and to help you find someone in your area.Ask plenty of questions about potential therapists. What are his or her training and credentials, for example? Are they licensed and do they specialize in family psychotherapy?
Ask too about location, availability, and format. How long is each family counseling session? How many sessions are usual? Is the therapist available in emergencies?
Inquire about cost and insurance, as well. How much does the therapist charge per session? Does she require full fees paid up front? Will she accept payment from your insurance provider?

, Check online for family therapists and family therapy resources, too. Start with a general search in your area, like on Google, i.e. “Family therapists in Baltimore,” but don’t neglect other specialized search engines. There are a number of therapy websites with special tools to find practitioners around the country.Psychology Today hosts a Therapy Group search engine on its website, for instance. You can search your locality and then narrow the results to find specialists in things like divorce or family conflict.
A second tool is the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy’s therapist locator. Search by the name of your area to find lists of nearby licensed Marriage and Family Therapists.

, Apart from your doctor and online resources, you might also consult with local health organizations in your area. Contact places like hospitals, mental health clinics, community centers, or even university counseling services to see if they offer family therapy sessions. You can either call, inquire in person, or send an email.For example, call your local hospital and ask what kind of family counseling services they can provide. Some places, like the Rhode Island Hospital, run family therapy clinics for help in a range of psychological issues.
Most universities also have counseling services – including family therapy – on campus for students and staff. Contact a college or university near you to see if you can make use of their programs.

, You’ll also want to know what sort of methods your potential therapist will use in treatment. Family counseling can draw on a number of techniques, each with their own assumptions and goals. The method may depend on your situation or on the therapist’s preference.Ask if Structural Family Therapy is for you. SFT assumes that problems are inside of the family structure – that is, the therapy focuses on interactions in the group rather than on the individuals. The idea is for the therapist to change the family’s ingrained ways of interacting.You might also ask about Brief Strategic Therapy. This form of counseling is short and tries to take stock, again, of how the family interacts as a system. The therapist will try to identify problems and will then set goals for change, alongside “tasks” for members to do outside of sessions.
Consider Functional Family Therapy, too, especially if you have an at-risk child. FFT tries to lower the negativity that’s often found in such families, by focusing on changing behavior at the individual level. This can take place by working on members’ skills in parenting, communication, and problem solving., Most people think that family counseling involves the entire family (or both members of a couple) in the same room. This is only part of it. Family therapy can take place in group sessions, but the therapist may also want to meet individually with each member of your family. Be prepared to participate, whether on your own or as part of the group. In fact, the cooperation of each member will be key to the counseling’s success.Some therapists prefer to have the whole family together in sessions. More often, though, you should expect to have some full sessions in addition to some apart or in smaller groups with the therapist.
Sessions typically last for about 50 to 60 minutes each. Family therapy courses are also usually fairly short and last no longer than 6 months.

, One of the basic ideas behind family counseling is to see you and your loved ones as a unit. Families are not just isolated individuals, but made up of people who are part of social groups and systems. Each member of a family influences the behavior of the other members, father, mother, sister, brother, and other relatives.Say that you are in therapy to address behavioral problems with your child. A therapist can help connect the child’s problems to what he experiences as a member of the family. Perhaps he is doing poorly in school because a parent has been laid off; perhaps he acts out because he overhears arguments and is afraid his parents are going to divorce.
A family therapist might also ask you to change your behavior and relationships with other members of the group. For instance, she might ask you to change how you communicate with loved ones.

, Family therapy has to include a good deal of exploration of you, your loved ones, and your roles in the larger unit of the family. Getting family counseling may well teach you a lot about how you interact, express your thoughts and emotions, and solve or create conflicts.One of the therapist’s aims is to help you see how you and your loved ones interact, i.e. what are the family roles, rules, and behavior patterns. Then, with this knowledge, you can find ways to work out issues more effectively.
A therapist can also point out your family's strengths and areas that need improvement. Perhaps you are close knit and loyal to each other, but do not express emotion easily. The therapist might then focus on encouraging you to communicate more easily and openly.
Armed with knowledge, family therapy should help you find ways to cope with family conflict and, ideally, gain a better sense of understanding with your loved ones.

Consider attending a childbirth preparation class with the mother.,
Learn the biology of birth.,
Prepare ideas of what to do during the waiting period.",How to Be a Guest During Birth2," If you are the partner or principle guest of the mother, make sure you are ready to assist her during delivery with helpful tips, reminders, and encouragement.


A childbirth preparation class will teach you the stages of delivery, options for pain management, breathing techniques, assistance tips you can use as a guest during birth, and even what to bring with you to the delivery.

, If you have been invited to attend the delivery of a child, it may help to learn how labor and delivery function.


Knowing the basics of what the mother is experiencing and how labor is expected to progress can help you calm the mother, prepare yourself for the sight of blood, and inform you of how long you can expect to be on your toes as a guest.

, Many times, labor can begin hours before delivery occurs; as a guest, you may wish to think of strategies for keeping the mother pleasantly occupied during dilation.


Write down a list of things to discuss or safe activities to do while she is waiting to begin delivery. Suggestions include talking about future vacations, taking a walk, giving her a massage, listening to music, taking a bath (you may wish to pack a swimsuit), sitting on an exercise ball to relieve discomfort, watching the mother’s favorite movie on your laptop, and other low-stress activities to kill time and calm everyone’s nerves.

"
"
Remember that the focus is on the mother.,
Recognize that the mother may change her mind.",How to Be a Guest During Birth3," Think of nice things you can do to put the mother at ease or increase her comfort.


If you are taking a break to get a snack or drink, ask if there is anything you can bring her. Offer to get extra pillows, a blanket, or other comfort items from a nurse.
Avoid complaining about feeling tired, sore, bored, or nervous. You are there to provide assistance and share in a wonderful experience, and complaining about your own discomfort or discontent is unlikely to improve the mother’s experience.
Purchase a gift in advance or bring flowers with you to the hospital to show your love and encouragement to the mother.

, Labor and delivery can be challenging and even upsetting for many women.


If you sense the mother is no longer comfortable with your presence, offer to leave for a moment or temporarily give her some privacy.
If the mother requests that you leave, obey her wishes and remember that she is probably just overwhelmed; it is not necessarily a reflection of your relationship with her. In some instances, she may just want a few minutes without her guests, after which you may be able to return.

Ignore them.,
Overdo the sorrow.,
Sing.,
Make a really annoying noise.,
Say something really dumb.,
Pretend to be really, really deep.,
Prank them.,
Try the ""why"" game.,
Poke the person constantly.,
Repeat something over and over again.,
Mimic them.,
Comment on everything they say.,
Just repeat every instruction they are given.",How to Annoy Your Family and Friends," Pretend they're not there. Just act as if you cannot see them, hear them or feel their presence. Act as if they aren't about at all.;
, If you are bugged by a decision they've made or something they've said, go overboard in the upset stakes. Show them you're upset and if they ask you to do something hang your head low and say you've got plans or quickly run to the toilet. This will make them worried about you, making sure that you don't get the blame for what happens tomorrow.

, Don't just sing, sing horribly, kind of like a walrus dying of suffocation. Aka, really bad. Also, make it a really annoying song.

, Self explanatory.

, For example, ""How does the reproductive system of a duck work?"" Say it over and over again.

, Say something really sweet, and then put JK or LOL or ROFL at the end of it.

, Whoopee cushions are outdated. Here are better pranks. Use a pinprick to make some tiny holes in a drink straw. Or, wait for a rainy day and make paper confetti, put it in an umbrella and then watch when someone opens it.


Plenty more pranks can be found in wikiHow's pranking category.

, Ask a simple question and when they answer, just ask ""Why?"" after every answer.

, When they look over at you, hide behind your hands. As if by hiding your face in your hands, they won't see you. Then repeat.

, For example, ""Hey , hey , hey , hey , guess what? I'm bored!"" It works like a charm.

, This is perfect if you have patience. If they say a word that's really long and you can't quite remember, just say ""blah"". Works every time.


While mimicking, use a really annoying voice. It could be anything from squeaky and high-pitched to a simple accent.

, Not nice comments, either; comments that come across as cynical, disbelieving and deflating are the best. This works well while talking in a small group.

, If your teacher says, ""Clean up your desk!"" to your friend, whisper, ""Yeah , clean up your desk!"" Make sure the teacher can't hear you.

Do it your way.,
Be patient.,
Care for children.,
Care for the elders.,
Be yourself.",How to Be a Family Woman," There are no set rules about having a family although many people have grown up thinking that there is a clear right and wrong way of doing everything. Unfortunately too many people care about what other people think. It is better to do actions involuntary and the way you like to do it. It is not good to depend on others to do your duties.


An example. This is just one example of trying to over control a situation in family life. As a woman there are so many stereotypes and expectations that so many think that they should try to live up to. This is a very unrealistic task for any woman to put upon herself.





;
, Whether you are married or not the person that you live with is undoubtedly the person that you spend the most time with. This can cause all sorts of situations that you probably never even though about until you find yourself in it. Because every couple is different and they all have their own dynamics it is hard to give an answer that will apply to everyone.

The main piece of advice is to become the king or queen of patience. All you can do it be patient. No matter what the situation it is always better to take a deep breath and think about the predicament you are in, instead of rushing in than finding out later that you made the wrong decision. Or even worse saying or doing something that you regret. Apply that to all aspects of family life but especially when it comes to your other half.







, Children on the other hand need a more active approach. If you are just stood looking at them, taking a deep breath when you are supposed to be exerting some kind of discipline you are not going to leave a very big impression.

Fast reflexes are the key, reactions to an ever changing, highly emotional, tiny person is definitely what you need. The worst thing that you can do is lose your temper. Of course children need to know what is right and wrong but screaming at the usually confused child is not the answer. However neither is just being walked over. The most important thing when it comes to parenting is consistency, children will be able to worm through any loop hole that they can find.
Don't change your mind when you have made a decision or make it acceptable to do something on a one off basis as it can become confusing for the child when they think that it is okay and then get told off for doing the same thing later on.







, Another completely different relationship is the one between you and your parents and mother and father in law. If you are lucky enough to have a completely calm family where everyone gets on with each other all the time, It is essential. However if you are like the majority of the population and come across some issues along the way then the best thing you can do is try to appeal to a side of everyone that you can get along with, also try not to be too opinionated about everything for fear of causing upset, but not to the point of being fake.

, In the end you have to do what works for you in all aspects of family life. When you find a rhythm or framework that works for you stick with it without comparing yourself to anyone else. As the saying goes, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it.""

Express Your Feelings.,
Assess your reality, as it is.,
Put things into perspective.,
Maintain your health.,
Learn about the stages of grief.,
Seek emotional support.,
If you love children, consider other ways to have children in your life.,
Address situational issues.,
Take time for yourself.",How to Accept Not Having Children," Acknowledge your emotions, however varied they are, and make it a point to express them outwardly. The way you express yourself is personal to you and may involve crying, screaming, laughing, singing, writing, talking or any other of the countless forms of self-expression.;
, It is important that you are realistic about life's circumstances. If you know that you will not have children, then you must accept that fact before you can move forward. Consciously incorporate the following practices into your daily life:


Instead of thinking of what should have or could have been, focus on what is and what can be.
Imagine your future without children. Make plans for yourself that revolve around not having kids. Envision your plans coming to fruition and you being happy in those plans.
Remove painful reminders from sight. If you have baby items that you acquired in the hopes of having a baby, pack them away or give them to someone who will use them.

, Remember that everyone must deal with unwanted life circumstances at times, whether it be death, illness or involuntary childlessness. Relating to others on this level may help you feel less alone.

, Get the appropriate amount of sleep, and make sure you are eating well. Neglecting your physical health can complicate the acceptance process.

, Accepting not having children is similar to any type of serious loss in that you will experience grief in its many forms. Understanding how grief manifests will prepare you to be able to manage it.


Denial. You may be in disbelief, and mentally unwilling to accept the reality of not having kids.
Despair. This is perhaps the most easily identifiable stage of grief, and is characterized by general symptoms of depression.
Remorse. You may begin to question or blame yourself for not having children, and this can lead to unnecessary guilt.
Anger. The anger associated with grief is not necessarily aimed at a person or a thing, but rather at the circumstance itself.
Fear. When the reality of involuntary childlessness sets in, it may cause a sense of panic or anxiety.
Physical grief. The physical symptoms of grief include insomnia, irregular appetite changes, headaches, unexplained body aches, nausea and fatigue.

, Getting outside help is extremely important to the process of coping with not having kids. There are many places you can go for this type of support:


Mental health professionals. Find a therapist or counselor whom you feel comfortable with if you feel that you are experiencing obstacles to overcoming uncomfortable emotions.
Support groups. Search online and in your local newspapers for support groups for the involuntarily childless. Connecting with other people who share your experience can be a great source of comfort.
Religious organizations. If you belong to a church or other religious institution, then you may be able to receive free counseling from someone you already know and trust.
Family and friends. Expressing what you are going through to people who love and care about you can be a healthy way of dealing with the grief of not having children.

, You don't need to be a parent in order to help them and watch them grow.


Help friends and family members with their children. Babysit for your best friend, or spend time at your brother's house playing with and caring for his children. The children will enjoy playing with you, and the adults will be thankful for the extra help.
Consider volunteering at a place where you can work with children. Try becoming an aide, teaching underprivileged children, volunteering for church programs, coming as a guest to schools (e.g. to talk about your job), or working with disabled children.
Take a job in which you will be expected to work with children.

, Deal with the cause for involuntary childlessness in order to fully acclimate to a life without children.


If you want children but have an unwilling partner, the decision to not have children can put a great deal of stress on the relationship. It may be difficult to avoid withholding resentment toward your partner, and you will need to rebuild the relationship once you learn to cope with not having children. Work through relationship issues with the help of a couples therapist.
Keep communication clear with your partner. Tell them that having kids is very important to you, and ask why they don't want kids. Then listen carefully. Try to find some middle ground: would they be okay with having kids in five years? What about deciding to wait, and to discuss it again a few years from now? Try to find a solution that can satisfy you both.
In order to accept not having kids due to infertility, it is important that you not place blame on yourself or your partner. Take time to recover physically and emotionally from any medical treatments you and/or your partner may have endured and recognize that the stress from those treatments is likely complicating your ability to cope with not having children.

, Childlessness does not mean an end to happiness. Spend time with people you love, take a long bubble bath, work on your hobbies, and do things that matter to you. You do not need children to live a positive, meaningful life.

"
Recognize that you may be labeled as the ""bad guy."",
Weigh the pros and cons.,
Ask for advice.,
Decide if an alternative arrangement would work better.",How to Uninvite Annoying Relatives1," If you are rescinding an invitation that you sent previously, understand that doing so may not win you any favors with the person or the other guests. Typically, it’s poor etiquette to withdraw an invitation after it has already gone out.The person will likely be offended by your decision. This may even jeopardize your relationship with them or others.;
, Since there may be some negative fallout from revoking an invitation from a family member, you should carefully consider your reasons for doing so. What has the person done to warrant no longer being invited?


Did you have a disagreement with the person recently and are choosing to withdraw the invitation for emotional reasons? Has there been an incident that caused you to doubt their ability to behave appropriately?
Make a list of pros and cons for not having this person in attendance. A pro might be “avoiding a scene after they have too much to drink.” A con might be “them causing a fuss if you take back the invite.” Review your list to help you decide if revoking the invitation is the best course of action.Keep in mind that you can't always take back the invitation. In some cases, not taking back the invitation will be the best course of action.

, Choosing to uninvite a relative is a difficult decision, one you shouldn’t take lightly. It may help to discuss the matter with a close friend or other relative whom you can trust. Reach out to this person and get their opinion.


You might say, “I’m seriously considering uninviting Rachel from the barbecue. I heard about the fiasco she caused at the Andersons' gathering the other week and I don’t want to have that kind of drama at my event. What do you think?”, Before making the leap to fully uninviting the person, determine if there are other ways you can manage their behavior while still allowing them to attend.


For instance, if your relative has trouble controlling their behavior when drinking, you might limit their access to alcohol or totally remove alcoholic beverages from the menu for all guests.
If two relatives are at war with one another, you may be able to have both in attendance by separating them. Seat them far away from each other and assign a point-person to make sure contact is restricted.
If you have a relative who tends to curse, tell inappropriate jokes, or start drama in some other way, decide if they might agree to modify their behavior for the event. For example, you might tell them, “Hi, Joel, I know you have a trouble reeling in that potty mouth, but there will be some conservative guests in attendance who aren’t comfortable with curse words. Can you be mindful of your language? If so, then I would love for you to attend.”"
"
Have the conversation face-to-face, if possible.,
Be frank about your reasons.,
Don’t apologize.,
Stay calm if their reaction is negative.",How to Uninvite Annoying Relatives2," If you arrive at the conclusion that the only way forward is to uninvite the person, do so with tact. The most courteous method to do this would be in-person. Ask the individual to meet with you in private.


You might invite them out for lunch or coffee and have a chat. Say, “Uncle Tom, how about you and I go out for coffee on Tuesday. I need to talk to you about something.” Choosing a public venue might decrease the odds of your relative becoming irate or making a scene.
If your annoying relative lives out of town, arrange a time to talk with them on the telephone. Avoid uninviting guests through email or social media. Even if it’s hard, do your best to approach the issue in a mature way, which makes it more likely that you will be able to preserve your future relationship with this person., Prepare for the discussion beforehand. Review your pros and cons list. Develop a script to help you guide the conversation and rehearse it before the meeting. When you have the conversation, aim to be polite yet firm. Avoid vague language. Explain your rationale with brief and direct language.


You might say, “I’m glad you chose to meet with me Uncle Tom. This is hard for me to do, but I know it’s the right decision. Since you and Dad are still on bad terms, I think it’s best if you don’t attend the wedding. My fiancee’ and I really want the event to be calm and low-key. And you two haven’t even been able to stay in a room together without arguing lately. I hope you understand.”Chances are, if this person has gotten into trouble for their behavior or have a history of inappropriate conduct, they will probably understand your decision., Saying “I’m sorry” sends the message that you’re wrong and makes it seem like you are taking ownership of their bad behavior. If you are uninviting a relative because of their behavior, don’t feel bad. You aren’t responsible for other adults’ behavior, but you are responsible for the satisfaction of your other guests at the event. If you’re worried that the person will ruin the affair, don’t blame yourself for uninviting them.Instead of saying “I’m sorry” say something along the lines of “I don’t want to hurt your feelings.” This demonstrates that your choice is made with good intentions while still showing that you stand behind your decision.

, There's a possibility that your loved one will react negatively to this situation. Being uninvited can be humiliating to them, so try to be understanding. Don't take anything they say personally. Simply stay calm and offer your support.


You might say, ""I can see that you're upset. I didn't intend to hurt you, but I believe this is the best choice.""

"
"
Explain that your guest list is limited.,
Apologize for someone who spoke on your behalf.,
Be firm with those who invite themselves.,
Anticipate having other guests boycott the event.",How to Uninvite Annoying Relatives3," In some cases, a relative may have been unintentionally invited. Maybe you accidentally selected their name while setting up an event on Facebook. Or, maybe you talked about an event in their presence and they assumed they were invited. Whatever the case, you might be able to make up an excuse for having to disinvite them.


Say, “Jessica, I clicked your name by accident when setting up the page for Samantha’s baby shower. It would have been nice for you to come, but we have to keep the guest list under 15 people. I’m sorry that this happened.”

, If an invitation was extended without your permission, do apologize for the miscommunication. You might say, “Hey, Derrick. Ronnie told me that he mentioned the party to you last week. He shouldn’t have done that. Our guest list is very exclusive. I’m sorry for this mix up.”


Even better, you might suggest that the person who made the mistake deal with the situation. Tell them, “I saw Regina the other day and she’s under the impression that she’s invited to the party. She tends to drink too much, and I’m worried that she will make a scene. Can you please uninvite her?”

, Some family members automatically assume they are allowed at any event hosted by their relatives. Maybe they never got a formal invitation but have plans to attend. Let them down gently.


For example, you overhear your cousin talking about what she will wear to your bridal shower. You might say, “Oh, Candice, I didn’t realize you were planning to come. The shower next weekend is going to be just for coworkers. But, I’d love to get together with you some other time, just the two of us.”, The worst outcome of uninviting one guest is to have other guests refuse to come out of solidarity. Depending on how important their presence is to you, you may try to convince them to come. However, don’t allow yourself to be coerced into having an annoying guest in attendance.


Stand firm in your decision, even if it means a few people not agreeing with you.

Call a family meeting if there is a problem you think needs discussing.,
Spend quality time together as a family.",How to Function In a Multigenerational Household," Every living arrangement has its benefits and drawbacks, and in order for it to work, the benefits must be recognized and outweigh the drawbacks. When the going gets tough, remembering why you've chosen to live in a multigenerational household will help to cope with any conflicts that may arise. Some of the reasons families choose to live together are:


Money. Loss of a job or unexpected expenses, like divorce or death in the family.
A big move, where one family unit lives with another family unit or member who is already in the area until they can become familiar with the area and establish their own home.
A desire to live in an area with high costs. By having more family members live in a single house, the family can afford a nicer, larger house in a better neighborhood and with better schools.
Working parents who prefer to have their own family members care for their children instead of strangers.
Elderly relatives who need to be looked after by family instead of home care services.
An emphasis on preserving religious beliefs and customs.
Unexpected circumstances, such as a debilitating injury, heart problems, or an incurable disease. An extended family living situation can provide a helpful cushion if and when such circumstances arise.;
, If it's a temporary situation, let your family know what your situation is.

,


Does anyone in the family have health issues that need to be addressed, such as an elderly parent needing special care, or a child with learning disabilities?
If their care is home based, which of the other family members are primarily responsible for this care?

,


Address your concerns about privacy. It can be hard to have privacy in this living situation. Make sure everyone understands the importance of privacy, and have consequences for anyone who invades anyone's privacy in any way, whether it's the Internet, your diary, going through personal belongings, and even listening in on phone calls.
Part of maintaining boundaries is each member of the family knowing that giving advice, especially when it comes to problems or arguments by a married couple within the house, should only be given ""if asked for."" Never get into the middle of a couple's argument unless it's a case of abuse.
Set physical boundaries. Some people have more ""physical"" personalities than others. Let your family know about your concerns about physical violence and/or inappropriate touching.
Set acoustic boundaries. It's likely that at least one person in the house will enjoy hearing loud music or even television. Tell those who want loud music or television to use headphones.
Set bathroom rules. Some people are more accepting about using the bathroom at the same time than others. Have locks on the bathroom doors to prevent accidental interruptions and embarrassments.

, If the adults do not remain mindful of each other's rights and responsibilities, homework can sometimes be a source of discord in the house. What causes problems is a non-parent adult's sense of how far they should be allowed to go in deciding what is best for children. It's especially important for tell your parents and grandparents, as well as other family members not to counteract the rules you've set for your own children .

, Of course, there are times when the unforeseen happens. If all the adult members work together, most problems can be resolved.

, If it is a more personal problem, take the other family member aside and discuss it quietly. As mentioned earlier, there should be a time and a place where any family member can have privacy. It is under those circumstances that many personal problems can be addressed and resolved before they erupt into a major conflict.

Include the OpenLayers CSS file.,
Add fullscreen and zoom slider controls.,
Remove an interaction.,
Add a popup overlay.,
The finished map.

",How to Change Advanced Features of an OpenLayers 3 Map," Openlayers provides a CSS file that sets the appearance of controls really nicely, so we should import that first.




<link href=""http://openlayers.org/en/v3.12.1/css/ol.css""
  rel=""stylesheet"">


;
, Once the CSS file is imported, you'll see that the map already has 2 controls; zoom in and out buttons, and an ‘i’ button for showing map attributions. We'll also add 2 controls of our own, which don't require any configuring (their default settings are fine).




var fullscreen_control = new ol.control.FullScreen();
map.addControl(fullscreen_control);
 
var zoom_slider_control = new ol.control.ZoomSlider();
map.addControl(zoom_slider_control);




, Interactions let us 'interact' with an OpenLayers map in way such as panning and zooming using a mouse. They are invisible, and an OpenLayers map will already have several interactions when you create it! One interaction that is sometimes a bother 'zooms the map when you use your mouse wheel'. To remove it, iterate through the interactions and remove any that have the same type as ‘MouseWheelZoom’.




var interactions = map.getInteractions();
 
function remove_interaction(interaction, index, array) {
  var is_mouseWheelZoom = interaction instanceof ol.interaction.MouseWheelZoom;
 
  if (is_mouseWheelZoom) {
    map.removeInteraction(interaction);
  }
}
 
interactions.forEach(remove_interaction);




, Overlays are elements that can be positioned in a specific location on the map. They can be used to add information to a map feature or a location, like adding a popup that displays the name of a country. Overlays are powerful because OpenLayers can use any most HTML elements as overlays. Also note that if you'd like to add interactivity - such as the popup only appearing when you click something - that must be added separately.




<div id=""popup"" class=""popup"">Chad</div>








var popup = new ol.Overlay({
  element: document.getElementById('popup')
});
popup.setPosition(point_feature.getGeometry().getCoordinates());
popup.setPositioning('bottom-center');
popup.setOffset();
map.addOverlay(popup);

First determine the hardware components and resources needed.,
Build the compute nodes.,
Install the servers into the rack.,
Install the Ethernet switch above the server chassis.,
Install the PDU (Power Distribution Unit).,
With everything installed, you can begin the configuration process.,
Install the message-passing interface, resource-manager, and other necessary libraries.,
Network the compute nodes together.,
Test the cluster.",How to Build a Supercomputer," You will need one head node, at least a dozen identical compute nodes, an Ethernet switch, a power distribution unit, and a rack. Determine the electrical demand, cooling and space required. Also decide on what IP address you want for your private networks, what to name the nodes, what software packages you want installed, and what technology you want to provide the parallel computing capabilities (more on this later).


Though the hardware is expensive, all software listed in this how-to is free, and most are open source.
If you would like to see how fast your supercomputer would theoretically be, use this tool: http://hpl-calculator.sourceforge.net/
;
, You will need to assemble the compute nodes or acquire pre-build servers.


Choose a computer server chassis that maximizes space, cooling, and energy efficiency.

Or you can utilize a dozen or so used, outdated servers - whose whole will outweigh the sum of their parts yet save you a sizable lump of cash. All processors, network adapters, and motherboards should be identical for the whole system to play together nicely. Of course, don't forget about RAM and storage for each node and at least one optical drive for the head node.

, Start from the bottom, so the rack isn't top heavy. You will need a friend to help you with this - the dense servers can be very heavy and guiding them into the rails that hold them into the rack is difficult.

, Take this moment to configure the switch: allow for jumbo frame sizes of 9000 bytes, set the IP address to the static address you decided on in step 1, and turn off unnecessary routing protocols such as SMTP Snooping.

, Depending on how much current your nodes may need at maximum load, you may need 220 volts for high performance computing.

, Linux is the de facto OS for HPC clusters–not only is it the ideal environment for scientific computing, but it doesn't cost a thing to install it on hundreds or even thousands of nodes. Imagine how much it would cost to install Windows on all those nodes!


Begin with installing the latest version of the motherboard BIOS and firmware, which should be the same on all nodes.
Install your preferred linux distro on each node, with a graphical UI for the head node. Popular choices include CentOS, OpenSuse, Scientific Linux, RedHat, and SLES.
This author highly recommends using the Rocks Cluster Distribution. In addition to installing all the tools necessary for a compute cluster to function, Rocks uses a great method for 'distributing' many instances of itself to the nodes very quickly using PXE boot and the Red Hat 'Kick Start' procedure.

, If you didn't install Rocks in the previous step, you will have to manually setup the necessary software to enable the parallel computing mechanisms.


First you will need a portable bash management system, such as the Torque Resource Manager, which allows you to break-up and distribute tasks to multiple machines.
Pair Torque with the Maui Cluster Scheduler to complete the setup.
Next you will need to install the message passing interface, necessary for the individual processes on the separate compute nodes to share the same data. OpenMP is a no-brainer.
Don't forget the multi-threading math libraries and compilers to build your parallel computing programs. Did I mention that you should just install Rocks?

, The head node sends the compute tasks to the compute nodes, which in turn must send the result back, as well as sending messages to each other. The faster the better.


Use a private ethernet network to connect all the nodes in the cluster.
The head node can also act as a NFS, PXE, DHCP, TFTP, and NTP server over the Ethernet network.
You must separate this network from public networks, which ensures that broadcast packets don't interfere with other networks in your LAN.

, The last thing you may want to do before releasing all this compute power to your users is test it's performance. The HPL (High Performance Lynpack) benchmark is a popular choice for measuring the computational speed of the cluster. You will need to compile it from source with all possible optimizations your compiler offers for the architecture you chose.


You must, of course, compile from source with all possible optimization options for your platform. For example, if using AMD CPUs, compile with Open64 with -0fast optimization level.
Compare your results on TOP500.org to compare your cluster to the fastest 500 supercomputers in the world!

Unplug the power cord from the back of the computer.,
Cut off the connectors.,
Open up the power supply unit by removing the screws connecting the top and the bottom of the PSU case.

,
Bundle wires of the same colors together.,
Start by drilling holes using a dremel tool or drill to the size of the banana jack post you are going to use.,
Connect all the pieces together.,
Build the voltage regulator circuit.,
Attach build circuit board with some kind of liquid adhesive to the case so that it sticks to the side somewhere.,
Attach potentiometer to drilled hole in case and paste it with the hot glue.

,
Attach V regulated wire out of the PC board onto the last empty post on your supply case and solder it onto it.,
Using this LCD will tell you what your regulated voltage out is from that post.,
Do a check following the checklist in the tips section to make sure everything is connected correctly and everything is cleaned correctly.,
Once finished power up the power supply using switch in the back of the supply and LED should turn on along with fan and there should be no problems.

",How to Build Your Own Variable Bench Power Supply Using an ATX Power Supply," Make sure your computer is turned off first!;
, (Leave a few inches of wire on the connectors so that you can use them later on for other projects).

,, The color code for the wires is: Red = +5V, Black = Ground (0V), White = -5V (not used), Yellow = +12V, Blue = -12V, Orange = +3.3V (not used except if you have a brown wire in your supply, Purple = +5V Standby (not used), Gray = power is on (output), and Green = Turn DC on (input).

, Also drill a hole for the LED, and also cut out square piece where the LCD will go and also drill room for a potentiometer with knob.

,


Connect one of the red wires to the power resistor, connect all the remaining red wires to the red binding posts;
Connect one of the black wires to the other end of the 10 ohm power resistor, one black wire to a resistor (330 ohm) attached to the cathode (shorter lead) of the LED and the other end of the LED (anode) connected to the gray wire,all the remaining black wires to the black binding post;
Connect the +12VDC wires to the desired post( but leave one wire left alone so that you can use for variable voltage), the -12 VDC to desired post(the excess piece of wire cut and save for variable voltage section).
Variable voltage binding should be left alone at this point and nothing should be soldered to it.
Note some power supplies might have a brown sensing wire and or a pink wire. If you have a brown wire, solder it to the 3.3v orange wire and cut the rest out since you won't need to use them, and if you have a pink wire, solder it to the red wire.
Please also notice the rubber grommets in the picture that are at the binding post. these are to be put on first then put on the nuts because this is to prevent metal nuts from making contact with the metal case so there for no shorting all the other binding posts together.

,


Using the components gathered, build the following circuit on a circuit board, but solder wires to the potentiometer to make it out of circuit. By that i mean only the wires are to be attached to the pc board rather then the actual pot being soldered. This is because we are attaching the potentiometer to the case so that we can use it as a knob to turn it to adjust the voltage we want.
Note that the way you will power up the circuit is using those +12VDC wires and -12 VDC wires.

, Use hot glue to paste it.

,, This will be your regulated voltage coming out.


Attach LCD voltmeter to case and then hook up power to the LCD using +12VDC supply from the bindings and hook up to ground and then hook up the +input to the regulated post and the - output to the ground post.

, This regulator can regulate voltages from 1.2VDC to 24VDC.

, And please read tips so that you can follow things more clearly.

The System variable JAVA_HOME, points to JDK installation path, which specifies the location of the java run time environment. Populate the JAVA_HOME Variable Value with the location path of your JDK installation. CLASSPATH points to a list of file paths of directories or jar files, which would be used by applications for searching Java programs and libraries:

 %JAVA_HOME%\lib;%JAVA_HOME%\lib\tools.jar

Give a project name:
Select the “context” and finish it. Now create a new file for this project by selecting File -> New -> File and give it a name like “Test.jsp” for example. Edit this file and save it.
Then, start tomcat from menu Tomcat -> Start. You will see the starting information in Eclipse console.
Open a web browser and input the URL (http://127.0.0.1:8080/ProjectName/JSPfileName) in the navigation bar.

,, Decompress the zip file and move the “*.jar” file (eg. mysql-connector-java-5.1.18-bin.jar) to the “\common\lib” subfolder under Tomcat installation directory (eg. C:\old\d\Tomcat 5.0\common\lib).

, At first, you need to create a test table in your MySQL database, and insert several rows of data. Then, write a simple JSP program to retrieve the data from the test table and display.
If you can see the data of test table from a web browser, all done. Congratulations! Now you can start your Servlet or JSP programming.

Make a list of things you know annoy him.,
Brush up on your list and prepare for the next time you see him.,
Be rude.,
Be indecisive.,
Play dumb.,
Pretend to give up all of your hobbies and interests to focus on him.,
Always ask him what he's thinking.,
Arrive late.,
Talk, ask questions, and make a lot of comments while he watches tv or a movie.,
Use, or don’t use, your words.,
Be as needy as possible.,
Pretend to change him.,
Be immature.",How to Annoy Your Boyfriend1," Does he get annoyed by a particular accent? Does he dislike particular bands or genres of music? Does he feel annoyed being tickled? These are simple ones, but the list goes on and on.;
, Especially if you are around each other regularly, annoying him on a consistent basis is easy, so long as you remember your list and are prepared to imitate that accent, blast that music, and tickle him to your heart's content. Just remember to annoy him for a laugh and not cross the boundary into anger.

, If you're cold-hearted and cruel, this should come natural. Forget every bit of manners even exist for a few minutes. Talk over him, be obnoxious, pester him, nag constantly, and play keep away with his things. See if you can get a laugh out of him.


Be wary if he has a temper and try not to really hurt his feelings or you may come off as more a bully than an annoying girlfriend.

, For example, ask where you should eat out, veto his suggestions, then have no suggestions of your own. Better yet, offer something he suggested earlier in the conversation.Be aware of the time and place. Don't make yourselves late for a reservation or try this when he is already having a long day.

, Fiddle with your hair and gaze at him with a slightly glazed expression as you fixate on his lips.


When asked for an opinion, giggle and say you don't know anything about that.

, Who cares if you were a state champion volleyball player before? He loves video games so the only workout you should get is from playing FIFA online. It can be cute and endearing to pretend you're just like one of the guys.

, The more you ask, the more annoyed he will be. Take the approach of being an inquisitive child. The more you ask ""why"", the shorter your conversation will be. Pepper in some sarcasm to punctuate that you are just trying to make him laugh.

, Note the appropriate time to execute this strategy. Don't be late for a work function but you can be late for a social outing with your friends or family to make him squirm at any awkwardness. You don't have to say sorry but show up in time so any awkwardness is bearable and can be laughed at after the fact., Try to do this especially during an action sequences or important parts in the story. Better yet, do it while he watches sports and the score is close.Some guys are more intense when watching their favourite programs so be sure to gage the context.

, Correct him about his inaccurate facts or ways of doing things. Employ the silent treatment to get whatever you want.


Don't give him the silent treatment too long or you could create a volatile situation. Make sure to laugh once he understands that it's a joke.

, Look to gain his approval or pretend to suffocate him for a short period of time. For example, try to help him with stuff after he says he doesn't need any help., Complain about what he does and tell him that you want him to change. Make him laugh by acting out a parody of how he should be doing things correctly. Exaggerate movements and tell him to do things incorrectly so he knows that you are joking.

, The little things always count. Do annoying things such as calling his name multiple times, keep touching him when he's trying to concentrate etc.

"
"
Try to have conversations over text while he's working or with friends.,
Call him repeatedly.,
Message him whenever you're free.,
Never put your phone down.",How to Annoy Your Boyfriend2," It is also funny to make him squirm with sexual innuendo when he can't talk. You can also send nonsensical emoticons in response to his texts. Don’t tailor the type of communication channel to the content of the message., Pay attention to his schedule and, when it is appropriate, call him 2 or 3 times in a row even if you no longer have anything to talk about the second and third time.


This can be funny as long as he is not driving or needing to keep a tight schedule.

, You can even say something like ""just wanted to annoy you"", to let him know that you are being playful. If he says he's busy then you can say that will just annoy him when he's free.Texting random facts or pictures can be both fun and annoying depending on the dynamic of your relationship.

, Whether you’re texting with your friends or playing a game, constantly using your phone is definitely irritating when your boyfriend wants to spend time with you.Taking selfies and using social media every chance you get allows you to detach from the situation so be sure to reengage when the joke is over.

"
"
Be self conscious.,
Limit his time with his friends.,
Play the crazy jealous girlfriend.,
Ask him what he'd do in 'hypothetical' situations.",How to Annoy Your Boyfriend3," Talk about how 'ugly' or 'fat' you think you look, even if you don't feel this way. Ask him if you look fat. When he tells you, 'no', be sure to continue pestering him but don't make him too uncomfortable.Fish for compliments. Never ask directly for acknowledgement, rather user sarcasm or the tone of your voice to let him know that he should compliment you.

, Anytime he wants to go out without you, pretend to whine and pout. Playfully, ask him if he's going out to pick up chicks but reassure him once the joke is over.Make him choose between hanging with his guy friends or hanging out with you. You can make the choice obvious by saying something obviously playful like, ""you can either play poker with your friends or you can stay home with me and clean the garage.""

, Men absolutely hate it when their girlfriend asks who they were with and what they were doing. Suspicion is not an aphrodisiac so only pretend to be a crazy jealous girlfriend and don't go too far into the role.Stick to light suspicious questioning. If you start checking his phone and computer for evidence of what he's up to when you aren't around, you may have bigger issues in the relationship.
Lightly tease him if he hangs out with other females.

, Female mini-tests of getting proof that he loves you or will choose you over something/one or (god, forbid) will die for you.


Be insecure. Question things he does and pretend that he is doing it intentionally to slight you.

"
"
Tell him that you’re a princess and deserved to be treated that way.,
Get him to drive you around.,
End your time with him abruptly.,
Go out with your friends.,
Make a fuss about everything.,
Always want more.",How to Annoy Your Boyfriend4," Scare him by pretending to go shopping for expensive gifts you want him to buy for you. This is especially effective if your relationship is still new. When you plan dates with your boyfriend, tell him to take you to a fancy restaurant. Act like you aren’t being spoiled but it’s your right to demand expensive dinners., Make him your personal chauffeur for a few hours or a day. Get him to wait for you in the car and not do anything else but be at your beck and call. Just when you know he's about to reach his limit, text or call him and let him know that it was a joke. Don't go overboard and make him resent you.

, After a long day of getting him to run around for you, don’t give him a chance to get romantic or close to you. Tell him to take you home so that you can sleep. Once you see that he's annoyed, show him that you are considerate of him.

, Cancel plans with your boyfriend and tell him that it's because you have to go out with your friends. Make sure that you don't cancel anything important and that you don't go too far and make him feel alienated.

, Pretend to get irritated for the smallest reasons and be bitchy. If he thinks it's PMS affecting you, pretend to pick a fight about how he doesn't understand you and knows nothing about women.


Don't go over the top and make him question your character. Make it clear that you are exaggerating.

, Nothing can ever be enough for you. He buys you roses, you want chocolate. He hugs you twice a day, you want him to hug you 3 times a day. He talks to you for 1 hour, you want him for 3. Sarcasm and tone are effective to convey feign displeasure.

Think about how self harming makes you feel and any possible triggers for your behavior. Use “I” statements when you explain why you self harm to your partner and try to be as honest as you can.People self harm for a variety of reasons, such as trauma like physical or sexual abuse or the death of a loved one. Social issues like bullying and psychological issues like an eating disorder can also lead to self harm. You may or may not identify with these reasons as someone who self harms.

Remind him he does not have to pay for everything just to impress you.,
Tell him if you don't like it.",How to Act when Your Boyfriend Keeps Paying for Everything1," Take some time and check in with yourself about how you feel when he pays for everything. There is a chance that if you're reading this article, you might be uncomfortable with it for one reason or another. Know that there is no right or wrong way, only how you feel about it.Ask yourself why you are okay with it or why you are not.


Do you like feeling pampered or spoiled by him?
Are you concerned that he's paying for everything when he doesn't have the money to do so?
Do you worry he feels obliged or obligated for some reason?
Does it bother you when he refuses to let you pay for something, or even split the cost in half?
Does he offer to pay because he thinks that you cannot afford to pay?
Do feel obligated to him or like you have to acquiesce to his requests because he pays? This can include any impacts to your physical relationship or the control of the relationship.
Do you think he pays to show off?;
, Think about where you are in the relationship and why he might be doing this. Have you just started dating? Or are you just “seeing each other” and haven't made it exclusive yet? If so, he may be paying for everything to impress you or because everything is new.Maybe you two just have different attitudes towards money.If you have been dating for awhile and he's always paid, maybe he feels like he has to keep paying or maybe it's time to revisit how you manage finances as a couple., It may be something that is really important to him or he may feel like he has to, to impress you. Money can be a sensitive topic so make sure it's a conversation you have carefully and calmly.Open the topic. ”Hey, I've noticed when we go out, you always pay. Don't get me wrong, I love being spoiled by you! I was just wondering if that's something you like doing or something you feel like you have to do.”
If you are afraid you are missing out on certain dates or trips because he doesn't have enough money to pay for both of you, and doesn't want you to pay anything, let him know. “I just don't want us to miss out on things because you feel like you have to pay all the time. I can pay sometimes too.”

, Maybe you have just started out dating each other, or maybe he set up an expectation he feels like he needs to uphold. He may feel like he has to pay for everything to impress you or continue to impress you. Let him know that is not the case, or remind him of it periodically.


“You know I care about you, whether you take me out or whether we are just at home.
""Just so you know, I'm impressed by you not your money.”
Tell him other things that impress you about him that do not include him paying for things.

, If your boyfriend paying for everything bothers you, let him know. It is important to keep open and honest communication in your relationship. Try and pick a time where you are both calm to talk about it. Avoid attacking him or appearing to blame him, but rather explain your side of things. Use ""I"" or ""me"" statements to keep the focus on how you are feeling, and have the goal be finding a solution.“I feel like maybe you think I can't take care of myself, or take care of you.”
""I'd really like to pay for myself once and awhile. It's important to me.""
""It makes me feel like things are not equal between you and me. How can we fix that?""

Let your significant other know how you are doing day to day.,
Try not to hide your self harm from them.,
Accept encouragement and support from your significant other.",How to Act When Your Significant Other Finds Out You Self Harm2," Another way you can act when your partner finds out you self harm is to check in with them on a day to day basis. Try to have a meaningful conversation with your partner at least once a day and let them know how you are doing. If you are having a bad day, be honest about this and let your significant other know. If you are having a good day, tell your partner and celebrate this together.


For example, you may tell your significant other, “I had a bad day today and I need some support” or “I’m feeling good today and I appreciate your support.”

, Though you may struggle with your tendency to self harm on a day to day basis, try not to keep your habit from your significant other. Often, you feel a sense of shame when you self harm. But hiding it from your partner will only make your relationship more difficult and push your partner away. Being honest about your self harm and talking about it will show your partner that you are not keeping any secrets from them.For example, you may say to your significant other, “I self harmed today because I wasn’t feeling good” or “I self harmed today because I felt triggered.”
Don't be surprised if they ask you to pull up your sleeve or pant leg to see if you have done more self harm. Remember that they care about you, so it's normal for them to be worried about your safety.

, Part of working through the issue with your partner is accepting their encouragement and support. Your partner may suggest that you talk to a mental health professional or your doctor if your tendency to self harm gets worse or becomes more frequent. They may also encourage you to build your self-esteem and confidence so you can stop self harming. Try to be open to their suggestions and not get defensive or angry at them.For example, you may say to your significant other, “Thank you for always encouraging and supporting me. I appreciate you” or “I appreciate your support and encouragement. Thank you for listening and being there for me.”
If your partner suggests that you stop self harming and you are not ready, tell them that you need more time. Be honest about where you are at and let them know putting pressure on you to stop will not help the situation.
You may say, “I need more time. Please respect my decision” or “Putting pressure on me will not make this better. Please respect my choice.”
If you do want to stop self harming but don't think you can, be honest with your partner about it. You could say, ""I really want to change this part of myself, but I don't know how to stop."" Be ready to accept professional help after you talk to your partner about wanting help.

”I can't believe I got to see my favorite band! I'm going to remember this forever. Thank you!”

, Even if you have talked about it and you have decided that you are okay with him paying for everything, make sure he knows he doesn't have to. Every once and awhile tell him he doesn't always have to pay. This way, as you go forward in your relationship he'll know it's okay if he has to cut back or stop at some point due to financial difficulties. He'll know that it is something he can talk to you about and not feel embarrassed.

, If he likes taking you out to treat you, find your own ways to treat him or make him feel special.If you are good at cooking or baking, make a meal or dessert for him on special occasions.If you are artistic, you can create something especially for him. You can also do an activity with him you don't normally do, like watching a sports match or game.Just spend a little extra time and effort making sure he feels valued, as well.


You should not feel obligated to do anything in return for your boyfriend taking you out. Whatever you do, make sure you are comfortable with it and that it comes from a place of wanting to do it, not feeling like you have to.

, As a way to keep up on the maintenance of your relationship make sure you talk about the money issue from time to time. If you notice that there are little arguments popping up about who pays for what, or if you notice he is getting stressed out about paying for things, it's probably time to talk.Open up the topic. ”Hey, is everything okay? You seem stressed.”
Change plans for the evening. “We don't have to go out tonight. How about we stay home and I'll whip something up?”
Remind him that you are in this together. “You know you can talk to me about anything. I know we just want each other to be happy.”

Offer to pay.,
Split the bill down the middle.Another way to change it up is to offer to split the bill in half or to “go dutch” (each person paying for what they ordered) with the bill.,
Pay for alternate dates.,
Go on inexpensive or free dates.",How to Act when Your Boyfriend Keeps Paying for Everything3," If you have decided that you are not okay with him paying, and you have talked about it, then the first step is to start changing the behavior. The next time you are out, offer to pay the bill. He may be paying all the time because you haven't offered to pay.Since you two have talked about it and how you feel about it, there shouldn't be any arguments. Try being lighthearted about it, keeping your tone bright and cheery.


”Nope! My turn!”
”Hey, you've covered like the last 10 meals. I'm paying tonight.”
If he takes out his wallet, ”Uh-uh, put it away mister. Tonight is on me.”

, It doesn't need to be a big deal; just let him know that you'd like to pay for yourself once in a while, starting with this bill.


An alternate way is to split the bill by items. Instead of splitting in half or for what you have ordered make an agreement to split up by parts. For example, if he pays for dinner then you pay for drinks and dessert. If you are going to the movies, he can pay for the tickets and you pay for drinks and popcorn.

, You can also take turns with who pays for what dates. This works well with friends, too. If he pays for dinner one night, the next time you go out, you pay. Then the next date you have he pays, and so on, back and forth. This is a good way to evenly split the responsibility of paying without having to do check math every time the bill comes.

, If you are uncomfortable with him paying for everything, but you can't come to an agreement about it, then just plan for dates that are very inexpensive or free.There are tons of fun, low key things you can do that are cost effective.This way, you still get to date and have fun, without the stress of figuring out who is going to pay or worrying about getting into an argument about it.


For example, you and your boyfriend could go hiking or biking at a local park, take a trip to the beach, go to a free outdoor concert in your community, or stay in for a movie night.

Being honest can improve your happiness.,
Work on reestablishing trust in your relationships.",How to Admit the Truth over the Phone," It helps to get it all out beforehand so you can feel more prepared. Try writing down shorthand notes of what you want to say, or write it out word-for-word and read it when you speak to them on the phone. Even if you don’t stick to your “script” when the call actually happens, you’ll at least have a reference point so you don’t forget to say anything important.Don’t just write down the facts, or confessions. Also write down the feelings you want to express, and anything emotional you want to make sure you get across to them. Letting them know that they are still important to you despite the lie will help them get past it.
You could start by saying something like, ""I want to come clean about..."" or ""I have something that I'm a little embarrassed to tell you, and..."" You can also say something like, ""I want to tell you the truth about..."";
, When you make the call and they pick up, start off by asking them to let you say everything you need to say before they talk. This might confuse them, or even make them a little anxious, but it’s important that you get everything out before any arguing or anger bubbles up. By the time you finish, the other person will have heard your reasoning, and they will have had a little extra time to calm down if the initial truth made them upset.


Say something like, “I have something important I want to tell you, and I’d really like it if you could listen to everything I have to say before talking or getting upset.”

, After you’ve finished, if they are still upset or are lashing out, try not to get angry or upset yourself. Try to refrain from getting defensive. Instead, work on listening and letting them get out their feelings. Think about how you might feel if the roles were reversed and you were the one hearing the truth. How would you feel?Instead of arguing, let the other person know you understand how they feel. Validate their feelings. Try saying something like, “I completely understand how you’re feeling right now. You have every right to feel that way.”

, If they get upset and hang up, for example, they may just need some time to cool off. Give them a few minutes before you call them back. If they refuse to answer your call backs, leave them a message explaining that you are sorry, and that you will be there when they are ready to talk.


Say something like, “I understand that you’re upset, and I’m going to be here whenever you feel ready to talk things over.”

, Whether you’re confessing to a lie or simply telling someone some really important news, it’s important to maintain your cool while speaking. You won’t have the advantage of body language to assist you in getting your feelings and points across, so you’ll have to rely entirely on your voice. Speak slowly rather than rushing through it. Just do your best to keep your cool and be calm while speaking.If you’re telling some emotional news, it’s okay to get emotional and let that emotion come through in your voice. Your emotion should essentially be on par with what you’re saying, so you won’t want to sound like a robot if you’re saying something especially emotional.
You want to make sure you sound believable, so make sure how you’re speaking doesn’t sound too rehearsed or forced. Even if you’re working off what you’ve written down, try not to read it verbatim, or sound too monotone.

, This would be the best time to call. You don’t want to call them while they’re at work, for example, or when they’re out running errands. Try to find out when they’ll have some time to themselves so they will be able to focus on the phone call, and possibly to deal with whatever they might end up feeling afterwards.Consider sending them a quick text or e-mail and asking when they’ll have some free time. Then, you can plan to make the call when you’re sure they have a moment.

, If you call and they’re busy or don’t have much time to talk, tell them you’ll call them back later. You could suggest they call you themselves when they have time, but then you risk being unprepared when the phone does ring. It’s probably better to set a time when you can call them yourself.


Think about how much time you think you’ll need to get your point across. Let them know you have something important you want to talk to them about, so that they might be more compelled to give you a good amount of their time and attention.

, If you withheld the truth or lied in order to prevent an argument or fight, think about the consequences of taking that route. By lying or omitting the truth, you may have made the situation even worse. If you chose not to tell the truth in order to protect yourself or someone else, consider whether doing so Will be worth the possible reactions or consequences once the truth comes out.If you’re still debating whether or not you should come clean, think about what could be wrong with keeping up the lie or continuing to withhold the truth. Weigh the consequences of both choices, and consider which will ultimately be the best option.

, It’s likely you had reasons for withholding the truth or telling a lie. Whether those reasons are very important, or possibly a little petty, it’s still important to consider what they are and explain them to the other person. Even if they don’t think your reasons are valid, you will have at least explained yourself to them. Then, it might be easier to start fresh.Sometimes, people tell small lies just to make social interactions easier. Those little lies could eventually snowball into bigger ones, and once the truth comes out, the other person or people could feel especially deceived or betrayed. If you tell a small lie, come clean about it before it gets any bigger., The next time you are about to lie or withhold the truth, think about why you have done so in the past. Are those same reasons at play again? Why are those particular factors causing you to continually avoid the truth? Be more aware of your own social and emotional habits. This could help you better understand your own choices and be able to curb the instinct to lie or withhold the truth down the road.

, You don’t have to jump right into being completely open and wear your thoughts and emotions on your sleeve, but taking a few simple steps towards openness could help you feel more comfortable with communicating openly with others. For example, if you are especially excited about something you just bought, instead of just saying you’re excited, tell someone why you’re so excited. It’s simple and not super revealing, but it ultimately leads to a more meaningful and intimate conversation.You might also try avoiding the phrase “I don’t know” if someone asks you how you feel or what you think. It’s easy to throw that out there when you want to avoid the subject or aren’t sure what to say, but being open and honest is always a better option.

, Studies have shown that being honest can help make you feel better about yourself. By being open and honest, you can actually improve your own quality of life by building and maintaining trust in your interpersonal relationships. If you admit the truth or come clean about a lie you’ve told, you’ll likely feel better afterward, and better able to move forward from the incident.Ultimately, people feel the need to see themselves in a positive light, which means maintaining a certain code of ethics or morals. Lying often impedes on that positive image, so being honest can help keep it positive.

, If you have broken some trust in your relationships by lying or avoiding the truth, it’s important to work towards strengthening that trust again. Make promises you can follow through with, and make sure you keep them. Be open and honest through verbal communication. Talk things out rather than keeping them inside. Try to always explain your own perspective on things when having discussions, making plans, or making decisions with a partner or friend.Healthy relationships are built on trust and understanding. Working on being a trustworthy person that the people in your life can rely on will help strengthen all of the relationships in your life.

Consider inviting the new person to join you sometimes.,
Invest in other relationships.,
Spend time on yourself.,
Tell an adult if the other person or your friend is bullying you.",How to Act when Someone Is Stealing Your Friend," Does this new person try to get between you and your friend, or do they naturally fall together? Does anyone make an effort to include you in the discussion?


Perhaps your friend is just making new friends, and nobody intends for you to feel left out.
Maybe the new person is interested in befriending your friend, but doesn't click as well with you.
Or you and your friend are drifting apart.;
, Have you ever teased your friend to the point of hurting their feelings, pushed them around, or argued with them a lot? Do the two of you seem to not have much in common anymore? It may be that the new person isn't the cause of the problem, but that there is an issue between the two of you.


If you're feeling confused, try asking an adult for advice, like your parent or a guidance counselor.
If you're growing apart, it might be time to let the friendship fade.

, Be honest and considerate. It might be that your friend didn't realize this, and will then fix the problem by including you more.


Example: ""Kaja, I need to talk with you. Lately, when we're hanging out with Melanie, I feel a little left out. I'm glad that you're making new friends, but I'd like it if we could hang out a bit more together.""
If there are any issues in your friendship, your friend is likely to bring them up then.

, Most people do not intend to ""steal"" friends; they just naturally click better with one person than the other. Assume that they mean well unless they have proven otherwise.


Even if they have been rude or mean to you, try not to be rude back. Be the better person, ignore the bad behavior, and go ask an adult for further advice.

, This way, you will maintain a strong relationship.


Plan outings together: to the beach, around town, to an amusement park, et cetera. This will give you and your friend bonding time.
Do arts and crafts. Try painting, making friendship bracelets, drawing pictures of your favorite characters, et cetera.
Get your friend's phone number (if you haven't already).
If your friend wants to invite the new person, say ""I'd rather it just be the two of us this time, okay?"" Then include the new person some other time (or let them hang out with your friend on their own time).

, Despite the rocky start, you could become a great trio!


Try planning some events that involve only you and your friend, and inviting the new person along to some other events.
It's okay if you don't want to befriend the new person. However, don't actively avoid them or try to separate them from your friend—this is cruel and could lead to bullying.

, Make new friends, hang out with old friends, and spend time with your family members. Spending time with other people will help you gain perspective, and it will help you stay balanced.

, It's important not to get too hung up on one relationship. Engage in your hobbies, take good care of your health, and spend plenty of time relaxing. Take care of yourself first.

, Maybe they truly don't mean well, or they're pushing things too far without listening when you say so. Here are some ways to tell if you're being excluded on purpose:


When you enter the room, people walk away from you
People say upsetting things about you behind your back
You're being threatened
People make jokes that hurt your feelings, even if you say that it's upsetting you
People don't listen when you ask them to knock it off

Plan to spend time alone and in groups.",How to Act Around Your Girlfriend," Speak to your girlfriend the way you would want to be spoken to by a close friend. Regardless of whether you are sharing a good laugh or arguing, a healthy relationship is always based on mutual respect.


Manage your tone of voice. An important part of communicating involves tone of voice. Speaking in a kind tone that lets her know that you care about her is very important. Never call names. Name-calling is an ultimate sign of disrespect. Don't expect your girlfriend to tolerate it.
Refrain from cursing. Part of speaking to your girlfriend kindly and treating her with respect is avoiding cursing at or in front of her. Your girlfriend may find cursing very offensive, so err on the side of caution and refrain from doing it.;
, Body language is key to understanding a person’s feelings on a deeper level than they may be expressing verbally. Experts say that about 55% of communication involves body language, so picking up on your girlfriend's nonverbal cues may give you inside information about her feelings. Take her cues. If your girlfriend is enjoying the moment, her body language will likely reflect that feeling. She may be smiling coyly, making consistent and lingering eye contact, or leaning her body in towards you. She will appear relaxed, and her face, body, and feet will be directed toward you. This shows you she is engaged in the moment. Pay attention to these cues to know when you are doing something you should continue doing, whether in an intimate setting or amongst a group of peers.
Notice if she is feeling uncomfortable in a situation. If you believe that something is making her uncomfortable, taking her aside and asking her about it can help. If she is indeed uncomfortable, help her remove herself from the situation. If she is feeling a bit nervous, you may see her playing with something in her hands, stroking her hair, touching her neck, or playing with her necklace. These are called “pacifying behaviors.” Watch for them. , Just as you should pride yourself in being your own person, so should your girlfriend. You should be proud that she has her own thoughts, opinions, and dreams. Encourage her to share them with you as she chooses.


Accept differences in political stance, taste in art or music, and interest in recreational activities. Whether or not they are the same stances and interests as yours, her opinions and tastes matter. Just remind yourself that -- although you'd like to be -- you're really not the authority and arbiter on all things, personal and public. Just think of your differences as part of the ""spice of life."" Wouldn't it be boring if you two agreed on everything?

If you feel like you can’t respect her opinions, this might not be the right relationship for you. If you differ on fundamental issues -- a desire for monogamy in the relationship, for instance, or the religious upbringing of your children -- it might be time to reevaluate the relationship. While you should still treat her opinions and feelings with respect, you may realize they are just not compatible with yours.

, Honesty is the cornerstone of all healthy relationships. Being honest with your girlfriend is extremely important right from the beginning. While it is sometimes difficult to be honest, it is always, always the best policy. Keeping a web of lies straight can be quite stressful. Besides, what's the point of maintaining a relationship built on deceit?


Be honest from the start. Trust can be very hard to regain once it's broken. Instead of risking being caught in a lie, just be honest from the beginning. A relationship built on lies will never make you truly happy.
If you have told a lie, admit it. The best thing you can do is to have your girlfriend hear the truth from you and not from someone else. She will respect you more for your ultimate honesty (once she gets over the shock of being lied to.) She wants to believe you -- and believe in you.

, Apologizing is one of the best ways to show your respect for your girlfriend. It doesn’t require a grand gesture, but it must be genuine.


Apologize sooner rather than later. The best time to apologize is as soon as you know you were in the wrong.
Speak from the heart. Say something like, “I’m really sorry I hurt your feelings. I’ll try to do better next time.” This can be as powerful as a dozen roses. It will feel to her like a heavy weight has been lifted from her heart.
Don’t force your apology. If you don't mean it, don’t bother. A fake apology is worse than none at all.

, As she is your girlfriend, you should be thinking about her. When you do, let her know. A simple text message or phone call if you are apart, or a gentle touch on her back or arm if you are together, are small ways to let her know you care.


Try a simple message: “Just wanted to let you know I’m thinking about you.” A little gesture like this may make her day.
Bring up a recent memory. For example: “I can’t stop thinking about the time I accidentally dropped all the eggs on the floor and you slipped on them! It’s been making me laugh all day.”
Begin with a compliment: “Your beautiful smile has been on my mind all day today!”

, Subtle actions can go a long way with your girlfriend. Using your manners and going out of your way to be particularly polite and thoughtful around her will be highly appreciated. However, you should look to reach an agreement about the type of thoughtful behavior that she will appreciate. Talk with your girlfriend early on about which types of traditionally courteous behaviors fit into your lives and which do not. For example, you may want to pull out her chair for her, but she may find this patronizing. Communicating about these behaviors will help avoid any misunderstanding. Here are some suggestions for courteous behaviors she may appreciate:


Open the door for her. This move has been appreciated by women for centuries!
Walk on the outside of the sidewalk, closest to traffic. This is a quiet sign of protection. Put your arm around her in busy, public places.
Offer to pay the bill at dinner. Even if she refuses and asks to split the bill, your offer will not go unnoticed.
Introduce her. It might bother her to be standing next to you chatting with a crowd of your friends when none of them knows her name. Make sure the first thing you do is introduce your girlfriend. This will make her feel important to you and let her relax a bit in conversing with your friends.

, Whether you are alone, amongst friends, or at a crowded bar of strangers, let her know that she is the one who has your eye and your heart.


Make eye contact with her from across the room. Let her know she’s the only one on your mind without having to say a single word. A smile always helps.
Take her feelings into consideration. For example, when you are making plans, discuss them with her. Make her feel like half of a couple.
Compliment her. Whether it’s a new outfit, a new haircut, or simply the way her smile lights up the room, tell her you've noticed and approve (even if you don't completely!)
Spoil her a little bit. Has she been eyeing a certain scarf at the mall? Buy it for her and give it to her as a “Just Because It’s Thursday” present.
Thank her when she brings you something, helps you with something, or does something kind for you. A simple ""thank you"" can mean a lot and will make it more likely she'll go out of her way for you in the future. Better yet, thank her for no reason at all -- just for being herself. An unexpected kindness will warm her heart for days.

, Your girlfriend’s friends (and family) probably play a huge part in her life. They will have some influence on her. If you’re going to make this relationship work, you will want to try to gain the approval of her close friends of either sex. Show interest in her friends. Ask them the same questions you asked her when you were getting acquainted. A great place to start is asking her friends how they met your girlfriend. Prove she’s in good hands. Show her friends that you genuinely care about her, but don’t push it too hard. Hold her hand, perhaps, but don't display affection to the point of embarrassing anyone.
Speak highly of her. Her friends don’t want to see you making fun of her or putting her down. While light jesting can be okay, save that for when you know her group a bit better. For the first few meetings, just be quietly but firmly complimentary.
If you can’t get along with her crew, minimize your contact with them. Just let her know that you approve of her spending time with them and that you won't feel jealous of them as a result.

, A surprise can be as big or as small as you want it to be. Something unexpected will make her feel loved and treasured. Here are some simple suggestions:


Leave her a note on her bathroom mirror. If you get up for work before she does, leave her a quick “I love you!” note somewhere she'll be sure to notice. This will undoubtedly make her smile, and she'll think about it all day.
Send her a card in the mail for no reason. It doesn’t have to be a holiday. Getting something in the mail will be a pleasant surprise.
Send her flowers. Use a website like www.proflowers.com to choose a bouquet that is perfect for her, and have them delivered to her home or work. You may not care about flowers, but she does.
Plan a surprise date. Text her: “See you at 7 at my house”, and have a candlelit home-cooked dinner waiting for her when she walks in the door. She will remember this for the rest of her life.

, This doesn’t mean you need to engage in periodic, public displays of affection, but it does mean you treat her in a way that you don’t treat any other woman. She enjoys feeling special to you.


Hold her hand when you go for a walk. This simple and sweet action will show her that you’re proud to call her yours.
Wrap your arm around her when it’s cold. This gesture will show her you care for her and want to take care of her.
Kiss her on the cheek. This is a tender move that shows her that you care.

, Whether she’s in an argument with a friend or having a problem with her boss, take her side. This doesn’t mean you need to find her faultless in every situation, but it does mean that you should be a source of support for her, even if later, when things have calmed down, you point out that she might not have been completely right.

, One of the best ways to surprise your girlfriend is to take her to an event or activity she’s previously expressed interest in. Not only will this show that you have been listening to her, it will show that you care enough to put effort into planning a date she will love. Here are some examples:


If you know she loves music, take her to enjoy a jazz concert in a garden, and pack your own picnic, complete with champagne. You can listen to the music together and cuddle up as the sun goes down.
If spaghetti is her favorite food, take her on a date to an Italian cooking class. You’ll learn to make pasta while also having a great time getting messy in the kitchen.
Does she like beer? Plan a tour at a local brewery that includes tasting the products they turn out. Not only will you get to try some tasty beverages, you’ll learn something, too.
Is France her favorite country? Plan a “French night” at your apartment. Buy French wine, have fresh croissants and cheese, try your hand at French cuisine, and put on a French playlist with Spotify. Light candles, and pull up a picture of the Eiffel tower on your laptop for effect. Voilà! A perfect evening in Paris.

, Have you always wanted to try wakeboarding but never had the chance? Having a girlfriend is reason enough for trying new activities. If your girlfriend feels like she is your “partner in crime,” she will realize she is an important part of your life. Having the courage to try something new shows her your adventurous side, a trait that many women find highly attractive.


Pick a unique activity: think whale watching, bouldering, brewing your own beer, or learning how to shear a sheep! The possibilities are endless.
Get out of your comfort zone: dress up for a night and schmooze with the elite at an art show or gallery opening.
Don’t be afraid to look silly. Even if you aren’t an ""all-star"" at the date activity you've chosen, showing your girlfriend that you have the confidence to try something different can be impressive.

, It will help build and maintain a happy, healthy relationship if you spend time together bonding as a couple without alienating those around you. Some couples practically disappear from their friends’ lives once they start dating. That's a mistake. Your girlfriend will appreciate a balance between spending time with you alone, spending time with mutual friends, and spending time with her friends without you. Don't be offended. It's healthy for both of you.


Make a dedicated “date night.” Setting aside one day a week as a day that you will spend together (even if it’s just an evening) is an important part of any relationship. It is important to show your girlfriend that she is one of your top priorities. Make this night extra special by trying a date idea suggested above.
Schedule time with friends. Getting groups of friends together can be challenging, but scheduling a get-together well in advance can help make it happen. Send a Facebook invite or a group text suggesting a meet-up at a favorite restaurant, a local park, or a new bar. Be sure to invite her friends as well as yours.
Double (or triple!) date. Planning a night out with another couple can be a fun way to maintain a social life while also spending important time with your girlfriend.
Host a party. This is a great way to get all your and your girlfriend’s favorite people together in one place at one time. The party can be for a holiday, a big sporting event, a birthday, or “just because.” This is a chance to spend time party-planning and practicing teamwork with your girlfriend.

Listen to your partner.,
Learn to make compromises.,
Support your partner.,
Set boundaries.",How to Act in a Relationship (Girls)1," One of the best ways to show your partner that you genuinely care for them is to listen to them when they talk. Listening is different from hearing. When you listen, it shows that you respect their opinions and feelings.When your partner is talking, set aside your phone and computer in order to give them your undivided attention.Look them in the eyes when they are talking.
Try to not interrupt them when they are talking. Hear them out, first.
Verbalize understanding of what they said. For example, you might say something like, “It sounds like you are saying ____. Is that right?”
Make sure to follow through with change when necessary. For example, if your partner asks you to call the next time you are going to be late for dinner, then make sure that you do so.;
, Both you and your partner should have a say in the kinds of activities you do together. It shouldn’t be one-sided all the time. If it is, it could turn into a power struggle with one person fighting to get his or her way all the time.For example, if you chose the last two movies, let your partner decide which movie you guys will see next time.
Show interest in your partner by trying things they like to do. For example, if they like going to the art museum, then offer to go to the museum the next time you guys are deciding what to do. Go with an open, positive mind and focus on trying to enjoy yourself. Do not punish your partner with negative words or attitude.

, You should be supportive of your partner in both good times and bad times. When your partner is going through a rough time, lend a shoulder to cry on. On the other hand, if your partner has a reason to celebrate, offer to take them out, and express how proud you are of them.For example, if your partner didn't get the job they applied for you can say, “Don't worry. There are plenty of jobs you can apply for. Try not to let one job get you down. I am here to help if you need it.”
On the other hand, if your partner did get the job you can say, “I am so proud of you. You worked really hard to get that job.”
Respond positively to your partner, but also avoid speaking ill of other people.

, Teach your partner how to respect you by setting boundaries. If your partner does not respect your boundaries, then this is a red flag. This is especially important in regards to sex.Does your partner understand and support your boundaries? If not, consider ending the relationship.
Does your partner stop right away when you say no, or when you’re not comfortable doing something? If not, you need to re-evaluate the person and your relationship with them.
For example, if your partner is ready to have sex, and you are not, do they pressure you by saying, ""Come on, it is just sex. If you don't have sex with me, then I will break up with you."" If they do, then they are not respecting your boundaries.

"
"
Admit when you are wrong.,
Give your partner space.,
Don’t lie.",How to Act in a Relationship (Girls)2," By admitting that you were wrong, it shows that you have integrity and courage. It also encourages your partner to do the same thing when they are wrong. Remember to take responsibility for your mistakes and be sincere when offering an apology.Admit that you were wrong by saying, “I made a mistake, and I am sorry. I want to apologize because it was me who misunderstood the situation. How can I make it up to you?”

, If you are secure in your relationship, you will not feel the need to be with your partner all the time. However, you may still want to have a discussion about what boundaries you think are appropriate in regard to other people. Try to remember that your partner had a life before you two got together. Encourage your partner to spend alone time with their friends and family.

You can say, “We have been hanging out a lot lately. We should try to spend more alone time with our friends.”
Remember to hang out with your friends and family, as well. Don’t ignore them just because you have a new boyfriend or girlfriend.

, The best way to lose your partner’s trust is to lie, which may include not telling the whole truth. Try to be open and honest with your partner all the time. If you feel like you have to lie to your partner, then you should reassess the relationship. Also, hold your partner to the same standards you hold yourself to.If your partner catches you in a lie, it will be hard for them to trust you again.
If you catch your partner in a lie, bring it up. You can say, “You told me that you were going to have dinner with your family Friday night, but someone told me that they saw you at the movies with your friends. I feel bad that you had to lie to me. Why did you feel like you needed to lie?”

Be open about your feelings.,
Ask questions if you don’t understand.,
Don’t be judgmental.",How to Act in a Relationship (Girls)3," Never keep a feeling bottled up because you’re afraid of your partner’s reaction, or because you’re afraid of sounding silly. If you need time to think about something before you are ready to talk, your partner should respect you and give you space.

If your partner asks if you are all right, don’t say, “No, nothings wrong,” if something is actually wrong. Tell them exactly what is bothering you, and how you feel.
You can say, “Actually, the other day when you were talking to Samantha, I was kind of jealous. Do you like her more than you like me?”

, Try to avoid miscommunication by asking clarifying questions. If you don’t understand what you’re partner is trying to say, don’t shrug it off, or assume that you know.You can say, for example, “I’m not really sure I understood what you meant when you said that you needed some space. Does that mean you want to break up, or does it mean that you want to spend more alone time with your friends and family?”

, If your partner expresses an opinion that you disagree with or don’t understand, try not to judge them in a negative way. Instead, try to understand their perspective. By seeing things from their perspective, you will be able to get to know them better. You might even learn something new, or change your mind about something.For example, if your partner says, ""I don't understand why people become vegetarian. It seems pointless to me."" Then, ask, ""Why do you think being a vegetarian is pointless? What is your perspective?""

"
"
Have fun.,
Spend quality time together.,
Be affectionate.",How to Act in a Relationship (Girls)4," Have fun with your partner by doing things that both of you have never done before, and by creating routines or traditions for the two of you. By exploring new experiences and making new memories together, you and your partner can strengthen your bond. New experiences will create memories that you and your partner can reminisce and laugh about in the future, as well.If you live near the beach, you can learn to surf or paddle board together. Or, have you ever bungee jumped off of a bridge? If not, this might be something that you and your partner find exciting.
It can also be something simple, too, like taking a photography class together.

, Quality time can also strengthen a relationship. These are activities where you and your partner can explore your feelings for each other.For example, plan a romantic getaway for you and your partner. You don't need to travel far for it to be romantic. Make a reservation at a bed and breakfast in the city you live in, or in a city or the countryside that is only a couple hours away.

, Be more affectionate with your partner by checking in during the work day to see how their day is going. Whether it's a text or email, sign your messages by saying, ""Thinking of you"" or ""Thanks sweetie.""You can also be more affectionate by kissing your partner more passionately. Instead of a peck kiss or a kiss on the check, let your lips linger and maintain eye contact after the kiss. You can even say something like, ""I missed you, today"" or ""I missed kissing you.""
Holding hands is also a simple, yet casual way of showing that you care for your partner.

Talk to your boyfriend about it.,
Don't try to ban it, but establish each other's boundaries to the relationship.,
Try not to be paranoid during your time together.,
Define what cheating means to you.,
Ask yourself if you have any objections to having porn in your relationship.,
Know if he has a real problem with pornography.,
Consider watching porn with him.,
Try to use the porn to discuss your boyfriend's sexual fantasies.,
Discuss your next steps.,
Seek a relationship counselor if it's necessary.",How to Accept Your Boyfriend's Interest in Pornography," Have an open and honest discussion about how his porn use makes you feel. Let him know what you're thinking and feeling, what doubts you have, and ask him some questions about his views on pornography. You'll feel better if you put your feelings out there and let him know what you're thinking and feeling. If he respects you, he'll respect your views and will take the time to listen to you. You can even ask him about his reasons for watching it, if you like, if you are concerned that he is aroused for the wrong reasons.


Just know that many men view their porn watching as a very private activity, just like masturbation, and your boyfriend may not want to discuss every little detail with you.
If you can both be open and understanding of one another, that is a good sign that you can grow together intimately with or without porn.;
, Unfortunately, if you know you are not okay with porn and you try to keep your significant other from watching it, you may fall into a pattern of being the ""porn police"". This behavior causes distrust in the relationship, and can cause him to keep his porn use hidden from you, or cause tension and discomfort while talking about the subject. If you feel okay with the porn, the concept of keeping him from watching it should not arise. If it is only certain genres of porn that upset you, make sure to talk about this with him and let him know why it makes you feel the ways you do. If you are unsure, try to imagine yourself watching porn, or maybe you do watch porn. If you can understand the reasons he may have for watching porn or the reasons you enjoy watching porn, you can mutually grow and include the porn into your sex life. Understand your feelings before you act. If you feel tempted to snoop, or pick through his search history, you may find at the end of that road even more distrust and dishonesty. If your boyfriend is okay with you watching porn, and he also thinks it is okay for him to watch porn then the two of you can have a better, open conversation on how you can incorporate it into your bedroom and fulfill each other's fantasies.


Porn is a substance that can be addictive, and if you believe that he may have an issue based off of how the porn effects your relationship, he also has to see that. If he agrees with you and would like to stop using porn not only for the relationship, but also for himself. You can grow together, although it will not be easy and the use of counseling, couples counseling, or online programs like No Fap, will help significantly. If your boyfriend does not see eye-to-eye with you and how you feel, he will most likely do nothing to change, and you cannot change him even if you try.
If he chooses to stop using porn, he will still masturbate and he'll still have fantasies. If you are thinking of banning porn to make your boyfriend only think of you sexually, that is not reasonable. Men and women both fantasize about people who are not their lover, it could be movie stars, people from real life, a cartoon, whatever it may be... It is hypocritical to believe that you can have freedom over your fantasies and he can not.

, When you and your boyfriend are hanging out watching TV, going for a run, or having a romantic dinner, understand that you may have thoughts about the porn and you may question if he is thinking about the porn while you spend time together. For men, usually their porn use is separate from the relationship and used as non-attachment and impersonal fulfillment of pleasure. Enjoy every moment you spend with your boyfriend, and know that he's enjoying every moment too.

, You do not think of porn as cheating or you do think of it as cheating. Some men and women are not okay with porn and know how they feel about it being in a relationship. If you are uncomfortable and feel like his excitement of watching other women engage in sexual acts is cheating, then that may mean you are not okay with the porn. Do not feel like you have to rationalize his porn use and discount your feelings. If you feel that it is not cheating, then you probably just think of it as a pleasurable movie, the videos do not pose a threat to your relationship and you may define cheating as being something you can only do with a real person. Your definition of cheating matters, and understanding what your partner's definition of cheating is will help you feel more secure in your relationship or find points where you both will need to find compromise.

, If you have values that don't align with the genre of porn he watches, communicate that. If you feel like the porn has a negative effect on your trust for him (if he was hiding it from you) then understand that the porn may not be the core issue, dishonesty could be the primary issue to deal with. It is essential to understand your own feelings and beliefs, and ask yourself if you can see yourself in a long term relationship with your partner and not having an issue with porn. It's important to be honest with yourself an d be clear with your partner.


If you are triggered by porn and have insecurity because it brings you to your past, you may want to explore yourself further and see if porn is the issue or if there is trauma you need to work through. If you have a hard time sorting through your feelings about the porn, seeking a friend who is understanding may help. If you feel that you can't consult a friend, there is professional help or advice online and in person available. It is okay to feel like you are okay with porn and then later feel not okay with it. People change everyday, and getting to know yourself while getting to know another person in a relationship can be difficult.
Identify your insecurities, if any of them root directly to porn and the nature of porn, then you may not be okay with porn itself. If the insecurities you have go back to dishonesty, trust, or intimacy, you should consider bypassing pornography as being an irritant to the initial, core problem.
If you have had cheating boyfriend in the past, or your boyfriend has cheated on you, you may feel like porn is a window for cheating, or that he may still be cheating on you.

, There's a difference between being a casual porn watcher and having a porn addiction. If your boyfriend is obsessed with watching porn and sneaks away to watch porn every chance he gets, then he may be having a real problem with a porn addiction and should seek help. Though most of the time this is not the case, it's important to know that it's a possibility.


Ask yourself if his porn habits are affecting your relationship, replacing the time he spends with you, and generally making it difficult to be romantically involved. If this is the case, then you may have a real problem on your hands and should discuss next steps.

, While this isn't for every couple, if you see nothing morally objectionable about porn though you have never watched it before, or if you've seen it before and are curious about what it's like to watch porn as a couple, then see if you and your boyfriend can have a kinky time watching porn together. Your boyfriend may not think this is a good idea, and if he doesn't, you shouldn't push him on it too much. And if you do watch it with him, watch it for the enjoyment of watching something sexy together, not to gauge his reaction to see how much he really likes it. This will make him self-conscious and unlikely to enjoy himself.

, Many men say that they watch porn as an escape, and that they'd never want to do the same things with their girlfriend that they see people doing on television. Yet, sometimes the stuff he watches on porn can make him yearn for something with you, even if it's just some harmless role playing or some time spent having sex in a new position or making out in a new location. Talk to him about it to see if the conversation may take your own relationship to a new level.


Your boyfriend may want something in the bedroom but may be too shy to ask unless you press him. Of course, this doesn't mean that you have to do anything that you're uncomfortable with. The fact of the matter is, a lot of porn does objectify women, and you don't have to do anything that makes you feel demeaned or worthless.
And hey, you can use this as a time to tell your boyfriend about any fantasies you may be having as well.
This doesn't mean that your boyfriend will jump for joy when you ask him about what he's watching during his porn solo sessions. It may make him uncomfortable, and that's only natural too.

, Once you've had an open and honest discussion about watching pornography, then you and your boyfriend can discuss what next steps you can take. Here are some options you may decide on:


Breaking up. Though breaking up over your boyfriend watching a regular amount of porn alone may not be that common, the porn watching can be indicative of larger issues that may have brought the relationship to a status of beyond repair.
Watching it together. If you don't find porn offensive and are curious about what turns your boyfriend on, then this may be an option for you. Just make sure he's comfortable with it.
Having your boyfriend try to watch porn less, or not when there's a chance you may walk in on him, if that's what you really want. Though you don't want to force your boyfriend to curb his desires or to become too secretive around you, this may be the best option you come up with.

, If your boyfriend is suffering from a porn addiction and you want to help him overcome it, then you may choose to see a counselor together, or to have him see a counsellor. Or your conversation about porn may lead to your realization of larger problems in the relationship, such as issues related to infidelity or insecurity. If this is the case, then you may need to seek outside help for your relationship.

Be compassionate.,
Tell stories of human goodness to other people you know, in order to inspire them to see the good in humanity too.,
Restore your faith in yourself.",How to Restore Your Faith in Humanity," If you don't have children in your life regularly, you're missing out on the wonders of seeing the world through new, inquisitive and creative eyes. Children are less prone to willful blindness or inability to see injustices and problems. Just by being around children more, and really listening to them and paying attention to what they do, you can start to uncurl from your crusty shell of cynicism and let yourself become more childlike, playful and creative.


Children can cut through the layers of obfuscation which adults use to excuse stupid decisions, procrastination and inaction. Children also don't mind displaying a sense of awe about the world around them, constantly delighting in new discoveries and in making amazing new connections – between ideas, people and the wider world.
Recognize in your time spent with children that we are born as blank slates, not for causing harm or trouble to others. Having a fixed view of human beings as cruel, mean-spirited and selfishly adhering only to what's best for each person is both unhelpful and generally untrue.;
, How often do you ask people to recall the happy memories and what makes them happy now? People love talking about what they care about, what motivates them and what makes them happy and yet it's not always an obvious topic for general conversation.


It's really important to provide the space for people to open up about their happy moments – it helps them to articulate in front of an audience what matters most to them (and may thereby inspire them even further) and it will help you to see the lighter, brighter and happier side of the people in your life.

, There is a plethora of positive, inspiring and uplifting stories about the good that people do each day. Yet, much of this positive news gets buried under the sensational, negative coverage that news media seems to prefer. All the same, it is possible to actively choose to increase your exposure to positive news. For example, you can subscribe to news feeds online that only focus on positive stories. And you can selectively follow social media network friends and fans who deliberately choose to share good news rather than bad and who are regularly sharing inspiring things.

Check out such sites as the Good News Network, Happy News, The Huffington Post Good News, or Daily Good.These sorts of sites focus on positive news stories and gather together many kind, caring and warm tales about the good things that human beings do.

, Whether it's the Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders, the local zoo trying to conserve animals or a faith-based charity, informing yourself about their activities will remind you that people are actively involved in helping others, conserving the environment, restoring the land, caring for animal welfare and lobbying government to make changes that will improve lives and livelihoods.


Browse your local bookstore or library shelves for amazing stories about people in the business world who are transforming society at the same time as running a business. Such businesses are changing the way we ""do business"" and see the world, including in such areas as sharing of information, making games that educate as well as bring enjoyment, selling fair trade or fairly sourced products, producing eco-friendly items and financial projects that help people to borrow for or invest in small projects that benefit many people in local communities. Social entrepreneurs focus heavily on ensuring that their business makes a positive difference in the world.

, A reality check can come in the form of looking at people who are experiencing things 10 times or 100 times worse than you are and yet manage to meet each day with passion and positivity, believing that being alive is its own reward. You can help them, but they can just as much help you.


Rather than simply reading about such people, get involved through volunteering so that you can see face-to-face the hardships experienced by others. For example, you might consider volunteering at a hospice, a hospital for children with terminal diseases or in a disaster relief community where people have lost homes and livelihoods.
However bad things may seem for you, seeing the pluck and determination of those undergoing severe hardships can help you to realize that human beings really are amazing, resilient and deeply profound. It can also help you to balance your own woes and keep them in perspective.

, If you begin looking for reasons to be grateful, there is a big chance that you'll find them in other people's actions every single day. For example, the driver who kindly lets you into the lane instead of speeding up, the shopper who waves you in front of their place in the queue because you have less items, the fellow applicant who helps you fill out a form you find really challenging or the stranger who notices your tears in public and gently asks you what's wrong. People are good; it's just easy to forget.


Then there are the occasions of incredible heroism, like when someone cuts you from a car wreck, dives in and rescues your drowning child or runs into your burning house and pulls out your pets. Whether the actions are small or grand, notice what others do and celebrate the milk of human kindness. Untold kindnesses happen every day that could be termed ""people just doing their job"" or truly be seen for the caring and connecting behaviors that they are.

, Reading about how other people find gratitude in everyday things can inspire you to feel more hopeful generally and to see that many, many people genuinely care for the beauty and awe of this world and its beings.


These are just a few common examples. Type ""gratitude journals"" or ""good news stories"" into Google to be bombarded with the wonderful things happening across our planet on the daily.

, Make a bookmark on your usual browser and start stockpiling people who inspire you through their actions. Check back regularly for updates they're making as they progress in their endeavors. And add people who are no longer with us too – past endeavors are just as valuable for they enabled human society to be as advanced as it is today.


Mahatma Gandhi summed it up well when he implored that: “You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty.” While cruel and nasty things do happen each day, so do many acts of kindness and joy.

, Try seeing the world in a more trusting, less demanding way. Implement Gandhi's famous line to ""be the change you wish to see in the world."" When you model the kind of change you want to see spread, you spark virtuous ripples that, even if they don't obviously benefit you personally move forth to benefit others, thereby continuously improving the community of which you are a part. Ultimately, faith in humanity isn't predicated on what you get back – it's about knowing that you're making life a little better, a little easier and a little more livable for everyone you connect with.

Trust more in others. For example, you may take a person at his or her word that he will pay you for a used item he or she has purchased off you. You might loan a neighbor or friend your tools or DVD series without specifying a return date, having faith that the things will return when they need to. Perhaps you have worried in the past as to where your charity donation ends up, or you're concerned that the homeless person will run off and buy beer rather than a place to rest his or her head for the night, causing you to not donate anything at all. Instead of imposing your will, just give. Have faith that that donation will do what it needs to do.
Sometimes people will do the wrong thing by you, but on the whole, it's much more likely that you'll be surprised by how people repay your faith in them positively, returning trust with trust – and gratitude. Implementing this extent of faith in others can be very scary at first, especially if you've been very attached to things/money but when you've reached this stage, you will have traveled far in restoring your faith in humanity.

, Try topping off your neighboring driver's parking meter when you see it's nearly empty, shouting a stranger an extra coffee while standing in line or wiping down the public shower at the pool after you've used it instead of leaving it all muddy. For more ideas, see How to Practice Random Acts of Kindness.



Pay it forward. Instead of asking that your good deed be repaid in any way, ask that the return favor be ""paid forward"" to someone else in need. For example, perhaps you can afford to help a student attend a course that he or she would otherwise be unable to afford. In turn, ask that student to do likewise in the future for another student he or she comes across unable to afford a course.

, While the inner goodness of every single human being you come across may not be evident all of the time, it is compassion that allows you to dig underneath the surface of the woes, injuries and ills of your fellow human beings. By looking deeper, you'll often discover what motivates or compels unkind, ruthless or thoughtless behavior. It is in the seeking to understand better why people behave as they do that you can empathize with them and learn tolerance. It is in forgiving people for their lesser self behavior that you learn to stop hurting and give them the gift of freedom to heal themselves from pain and fear and to become the best they can be.


Find as many ways as possible to collaborate and cooperate with your fellow humans. Reduce conflict and competition by encouraging and facilitating collaborative ways to get things done – at work, at home, in your school or college, in the local park, wherever you may be.
Make room for others, even though you don't know them. When the traffic is thick or the queue is long, let others in. They are human too, they feel as you do, and what a delightful shock to learn that someone else cares about them. Your thoughtfulness will reverberate as many of those you let in will feel the need to let someone else in some other time. And on it goes.

, Once you've cottoned on to finding positive stories about humanity, share your experience with others to help inspire their positive actions and thoughts. If you have your own blog or you update a social network stream with stories, share more stories that are positive and uplifting. What can you do right now, today, to pass on the stories that show people's goodwill, their acts of heroism and human virtues?


Celebrate those awe-inspiring moments when people do something incredible, such as forgoing a race win to help an injured fellow athlete, rescuing a pet caught in a burning home, shaking hands with an enemy during a détente in hostilities, etc. By celebrating and sharing the stories, images and creative works that spring up around heroic and altruistic acts of human care and love, you become a part of spreading the power and worthiness of decent, kind and caring actions.

, Remember that you too form part of humanity. Your preferred world won't come about by distancing yourself from your fellow humans or by constantly deploring them.If you feel that most of humanity is doomed or facile, perhaps the problem lies within. Henry Miller once said, ""The man who is forever disturbed about the condition of humanity either has no problems of his own or has refused to face them."" If you've had a hard life, stop being hard on yourself. Learn to forgive yourself and believe in yourself more. Step out of your comfort zone to learn new things and to push yourself to do things that you're worried you might fail at. Be bold––the world deserves your talents.


If you prefer despair over hope or complaining over action, then you will find negativity wherever you look. On the other hand, you can choose to have faith in humanity, in many of the ways described above. Moreover, you can choose to be kind as a form of taking a stand against the injustices, violence, wastage and hunger in the world.
You may feel powerless in the face of what seems terrible at times but you are not. Kindness is quiet, unobtrusive empowerment of every individual; by being kind, you affirm the kind of world you want to be a part of.

, Don't be gloomy and act bored. Try to always smile at people and have a cheerful expression to communicate your feelings. To lighten the mood play some music by the latest artists, people will think you know what music is current. If they don't like the song play a different one that matches their personality.

, However, the best way to be very social is to eliminate the art of technology or, at least, to a lesser degree. Being on your phone for the majority of the day takes away the opportunity to interact with the world. For example, when you are waiting in a checkout line, be more communicative. Start a conversation with the person next to you instead of having your face in an electronic device. In other words, interact with the world a bit more than usual.

, To give your friends, family, or whoever the idea that you are social, begin to document your life either through a social media site, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Take pictures of the party you attended and post them at a later time. When at the party, do not sit in a corner and be on your phone the whole time. Get into the mood of the party, take some selfies, videos, or group pics. Also, being social has more to it. Instead of only attending when invited, ask a couple of friends out for lunch or movie.

, Instead of pretending to be social, the best way for others to perceive this quality in you, is to actually become more social. If you are shy type of person, get out in the community. If you have trouble talking to people or a group, volunteer at a local museum, where you can interact with a diverse group of individuals. Preferably a museum with docent-lead tours. This will heighten your communication skills and make your sociable. That being said, always attempt to become a better you; not into someone you are not.

Remember intelligence is only one of your partner’s traits.,

Choose honest communication.,

Recognize that your partner cannot provide everything you need.,
Maintain your own self-worth.",How to Accept the Fact Your Partner Is Not Intelligent1," Evaluate the many reasons you and your partner are in a relationship. If a difference in intelligence has become a problem, it might be worth your time to think through your partner’s positive attributes., Trust is one of the many characteristics that make for happy, healthy relationships, and breach of trust is one of the most common reasons for breakups. If you’ve found a trustworthy partner, this may be more valuable than intelligence in the long run., Rather than focusing on the intellectual content of conversations with your partner, consider whether your partner communicates with you openly and honestly. The odds of finding a partner who shares your exact level of intelligence are slim. Finding a partner who understands the way you communicate and can effectively reciprocate this communication is much more likely., Remember intelligence based on educational background is just one of many types of intellect. Your relationship may be happier if you shift your focus to your partner’s emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and empathize with emotions and navigate emotional situations. Think through the following set of emotional intelligence compatibility questions.


Does your partner provide comfort when you’re sad?
Does your partner hear you out and validate you’re your feeling when you’re mad?
Does your partner know when you’re upset without you telling them?, One mistake couples make is assuming their significant other has to be their confidant, business partner, and whole world. This expectation is unrealistic. Every relationship we have with romantic partners, family members, and friends gives us something different. Maybe your partner can’t chat about Noam Chomsky, but they understand when you need to take a break or why you love comic books., If you believe you’re dating below yourself because your partner is less intelligent than you are or vice versa, it may become tempting to adjust your own self worth down. Remember your value and that of your partner are in no way interdependent. However, if you truly believe you’re not good enough for your partner or vice versa because of a difference in intelligence, the relationship may not be salvageable."

Support your partner’s desires to learn and engage.,
Accept that differing intelligence doesn’t have to impact happiness.,
Change the way you think about attraction.",How to Accept the Fact Your Partner Is Not Intelligent2," Being in love may not literally be like wearing rose colored glasses, but psychological research suggests it can be beneficial to put your metaphorical rose colored glasses back on and idealize your relationship and what attracted you to your partner in the first place. Couples who focus on the positive parts of their relationships and characteristics of their partners are happier and less likely to be divorced., Instead of viewing your partner’s lack of knowledge on a subject you’re passionate about as a negative, view this as an opportunity to share your knowledge. Encourage your partner’s interests, and take time to help them learn more., Even if your partner is less intelligent than you are, finding someone who respects and encourages you will lead to more happiness than selecting a partner who is equally intelligent. Research shows that differing levels of intelligence between partners has little impact on their long term happiness, especially compared with factors like trust and respect., We alter the way we think about things on an almost daily basis. If you have high blood pressure, you change your diet and exercise routines. If you can’t sleep at night, you take sleep aids and alter your schedule. When it comes to attraction, people have the mistaken belief they can’t change the way they feel, even if they continually end up in unhappy and unhealthy relationships.


If you repeatedly find yourself attracted to very smart or much less intelligent people, try to find a happy medium.
Look at other factors of attraction besides intelligence, and decide what matters to you most.
Shift your focus to finding a partner who is happy with or without you. These confident, content individuals will make better partners no matter what their IQ."

Think before you speak.,
Be realistic.,
Depersonalize other people's actions.,
Separate the individual from their actions.,
Focus on positives.",How to Stop Criticizing Others1," Before you dish out criticism, pause and consider whether you really need to say anything at all. If someone did something to get on your nerves, do you really need to point it out? Sometimes, it's best to let small indiscretions go. Try taking a few deep breaths and leaving the room instead of criticizing.It's best not to criticize someone's personality. People have very little control over personality quirks. If your friend Jane has a tendency to get caught up in her own interests, it might be best to just smile and nod while she's going on and on about a new TV show she loves. If this is just something she does, criticizing it will probably not result in the behavior changing.Avoid criticism that goes for someone's personality over his or her actions. For example, it may be a problem that your boyfriend forgets to pay his phone bill on time each month. However, saying something like ""Why are you so forgetful?"" isn't terribly productive. It may be best to be quiet for now and later, when you're calm, talk about finding productive ways to better manage bill payment, such as downloading a phone app that will provide a reminder when it is time to pay the phone bill every month.;
, Critical people often have very high expectations of those around them. It's possible your tendency to criticize stems from expecting too much from those around you. If you find yourself consistently annoyed or disappointed with others, it may be a good idea to adjust your expectations.Think about the last time you criticized someone. What lead to this criticism? Were your expectations in the situation realistic? For example, say you criticized your girlfriend for not answering your texts quickly enough when she was out with friends. You told her this made you feel uncared for and that she should have answered right away.
Pause and examine these expectations. Can you really expect your girlfriend to be on her phone when she's socializing? Isn't your girlfriend entitled to a social life outside of your relationship? You have probably occasionally missed texts or returned them late if you were busy. In this case, maybe you could adjust your expectations. It may not be reasonable to expect a text returned immediately if you know your girlfriend is hanging out with other people.

, Oftentimes, critical people have a tendency to personalize events that occur around them.This can bleed out into personalizing the actions of others. If someone gets on your nerves or makes your life difficult, you may feel the urge to criticize that person. However, remember other people have their own separate lives and struggles. If someone did something to bother you, the majority of the time their actions were not directed at you.


For example, say you have a friend who routinely cancels plans. You may take this as an act of disrespect and feel compelled to criticize that person for not valuing your relationship. However, realistically your friend's actions are probably not personal.
Look at the situation from an outside perspective. Is your friend very busy? Is she just generally a flaky person? Is your friend more introverted than others? A variety of factors may make a person cancel plans often. Chances are, it isn't about you personally. Criticizing may add more stress to someone whose life is already stressful.

, Critical people are often guilty of filtering. This means you only focus on the negative aspects of a situation or a person, failing to see good qualities alongside negative ones.This may lead to your criticizing others. If you find yourself making assumptions about a person's character, stop yourself. Try to separate a frustrating action from the person doing the action. We all behave poorly sometimes, but a single action is not a reflection of character.


If you see someone cut in line, do you immediately think that person is rude? If so, stop for a moment and reconsider. Maybe that person is in a hurry. Maybe he has a lot on his mind, and he did not realize he cut. You can be frustrated by the action. Getting cut in line is annoying. However, try not to judge a stranger's character based on the action.If you work on separating the person from the action, you may naturally want to criticize less. As you come to realize you cannot judge a person's character based on a single choice or decision, you will be unable to call someone out for being rude or disrespectful.

, Oftentimes, being critical results from how you're choosing to see a situation. Everyone has flaws and imperfections. However, the vast majority of people have good qualities that outweigh these flaws. Try to focus on a person's positive qualities over their negative ones.


Having a positive attitude can change the way you react to stress. Negative emotions activate the amygdala, which is a major trigger of feelings of stress an anxiety. If you're feeling keyed up yourself, this can lead to negative interactions with others. Working on developing a positive attitude can help you stop criticizing others.Believe everyone has some natural goodness in them. While you may be skeptical of this fact, try giving everyone the benefit of the doubt in this regard. Go out of the way to look for people doing good in the world. Focus on the person in the supermarket who told the cashier to have a nice day. Pay attention to the coworker who always smiles at you on your way to your desk.Oftentimes, people's flaws actually stem from other, positive qualities. For example, your boyfriend may take a long time to complete basic household tasks. This could be because he's more conscientious than others. Maybe he spends an extra 20 minutes doing the dishes because he makes the effort to get them extra clean.

Give feedback rather than criticism.,
Ask for what you want directly.,
Use ""I""-statements.,
Consider the other party's perspective.,
Look for a mutually beneficial solution to problems.",How to Stop Criticizing Others2," As stated, some people have issues that may need addressing. A friend who's chronically late on bill payments could use some guidance. A co-worker who's consistently late for meetings may need to work on time management. However, feedback is very different from criticism. When addressing an issue, focus on suggestions you can make to help another person improve. This is more effective than simply criticizing. People tend to respond better to productive statements, offering them feedback and encouragement, over flat-out criticism.Let's return to an earlier example. Your boyfriend always forgets to pay his phone bill on time each month. This leads to unnecessary stress and is starting to affect his credit rating. You may be inclined to say something like, ""Why can't you pay more attention to bills?"" or ""Why don't you just remember when it's due?"" This may not be helpful. Your boyfriend already knows he needs to be more conscientious but, for whatever reason, is struggling to do so.
Instead, provide feedback rooted in praise that works towards a solution. Say something like, ""I love that you're trying to be more responsible. Why don't we get you a big calendar from the Staples downtown? When you phone bill comes, you can write down when it's due."" You can also offer to help in any way you can. For example, ""I can remind you to write down when the bill's due each month.""

, Inefficient communication often results in heavy criticism. If you're not telling someone what you want, that person cannot be expected to know. Make sure to ask for what you want in a direct, respectful manner. This will eliminate the need for criticism down the road.Say your boyfriend always forgets to wash utensils after using them. Instead of letting your anger over this pile up, which could result in your criticizing later, address the problem right away.Be respectful when addressing the problem. Do not say, ""Stop putting dirty forks in the sink. It drives me crazy. Just wash them."" Instead, try something like, ""Can you please work on washing your forks after you use them? I notice our utensils pile up a lot."", Difficult situations do arise in any relationship. If someone hurt your feelings or upset you, this needs to be addressed. Instead of criticizing, express the problem using ""I""-statements. ""I""-statements are sentences structured in a way to emphasize your personal feelings over external judgement or blame.


An ""I""-statement has three parts. It begins with ""I feel,"" after which you immediately state your feeling. Then you explain the actions that lead to that feeling. Finally, you explain why you feel the way you do.
For example, say you're upset because your boyfriend has been spending the majority of his weekends with his friends. Do not say, ""It's very hurtful that you spend all your time with your friends and don't invite me. I'm left out all the time.""
Rephrase the above sentiment using an ""I""-statement. Say something like, ""I feel left out when you go out with your friends and don't invite me because I feel like you don't spend any downtime with me.""

, Judgment and criticism go hand-in-hand. If you criticize others too often, you may be shutting out the other person's point of view. Try to step in another's person's shoes before criticizing. Genuinely try to see things from that person's perspective.


Think about the criticism you're about to say. How would you feel to be on the receiving end of that criticism? Even if what you're saying has some truth, are you phrasing it in a way that will go over well? For example, if your boyfriend is consistently late, you may be inclined to say, ""You're being incredibly disrespectful to me by always showing up late."" Chances are, your boyfriend is not trying to disrespect you and he may feel attacked by criticism phrased in this way. How would you feel to have someone lash out at you like this?Also, try to consider outside factors that affect behavior. Say your best friend has been less social lately. She may not be returning your texts quickly or at all. Is there anything going on in her life that affects her behavior? For example, maybe you know she's stressed at work or school. Maybe she just went through a difficult breakup. This could be affecting her ability or her desire to socialize. Try to understand this and not jump to judgment.

, Finally, a good way to cut back on criticism is to look for a solution to issues you're having with others. Criticism should, ideally, be working towards an effective solution to a negative situation. Simply being critical in and of itself is not helpful.Tell someone what you want him or her to change. Let's return to the boyfriend example. Maybe you want your boyfriend to keep better track of time. Tell him ways he can get ready to go faster. Let him know what timeframes you're comfortable with. For example, maybe you strongly prefer to arrive at events slightly early. Let him know this so he makes an effort to be ready to go a little earlier.
You should also be willing to compromise. For example, getting to a party 30 minutes before it starts may be a bit much. Maybe you can agree to arrive 10 to 15 minutes early from now on instead.

Challenge your assumptions about others.,
Work on yourself.,
Educate yourself.,
Seek therapy, if necessary.",How to Stop Criticizing Others3," We make assumptions about other people all the time. Making too many assumptions too frequently can result in being overly critical. As you go through your day, challenge yourself when you find yourself being critical.


Maybe you assume someone who dresses well or wears a lot of make-up is materialistic. That person could actually be insecure. Dressing in a certain way might make that person feel better. Maybe you see someone who didn't graduate high school as lazy or unmotivated. However, that person could have had extenuating circumstances at home that disrupted his or her studies.Remember, everyone makes mistakes. When you see someone slipping up, remember a time when you did not behave or act your best. For example, if you're judging someone for cutting you off in an intersection, remind yourself of your own past driving mistakes., Is there an issue in your own life that you're taking out on those around you? If you're unhappy with your job, relationship, social life, or other aspects of yourself, try to address these issues. The stress of a negative attitude can affect your overall health and well-being, leading you to unable to handle stress.This can lead to poor social interactions. If you take steps to be a more positive person, you may be better at interacting with others. You'll be able to cope with conflict in a more effective manner.

, Many people have hidden disabilities. Before you judge or criticize a person, stop and consider the possibility that person is dealing with an issue you cannot see easily.


The co-worker who seems rude because she does not make small talk may have social anxiety issues. Your friend who constantly talks about cats may be on the autism spectrum. The student in your algebra class who continually asks the same questions may have a learning disability.
Spend some time browsing informational websites that discuss hidden disabilities. Before you make an assumption about someone's character, remind yourself many people struggle with ailments others cannot see., If you find your criticism stems from your own unhappiness, therapy may be necessary. Conditions like depression, for example, can cause you to have angry outbursts directed at others.Therapy can help you better manage your emotions and be less critical.


If you feel you need therapy, you can ask for a referral from your regular doctor. You can also find a list of providers through your insurance.
If you are a college student, you may be entitled to free counseling through your university.

See if you stop feeling like your goals or desires matter at all.",How to Know if You Are in a Parasitic Relationship," It's definitely possible to have almost everything in common, but it's still healthy to do some things separately and have some solitude.


If every single time you step out of the house, even if it's just to pick up a prescription from the pharmacy or to get coffee, you hear your partner say, ""I'll come, too!"" then he or she may be a parasite.
If you suddenly notice that your partner is always doing the things you used to love doing alone, from morning yoga to taking a walk after dinner, then he or she may be a parasite.
If your partner also cannot do anything by him or herself, whether it's to have a coffee date with a new acquaintance or to get an oil change, and is always asking you to come along, then you may be in a parasitic relationship.;
, Have you suddenly noticed that all of your friends have become your partner's friends? To some degree, this is normal, but if ever since you got serious, all of your partner's own friends have fallen off the radar in favor of yours, that's a red flag.


This may be your significant other's way of ensuring you stay together forever. After all, who wants to deal with the awkwardness of breaking up when you have the exact same friends?
If your significant other never had any other friends to begin with, this should also be another cause for concern. This is a sign that the person isn't capable of forming close bonds with people he or she isn't dating.

, Sure, everyone gets strapped for cash from time to time, but if you find that you're the one always paying for dinner, movies, trips, gas, and the big things, like the person's education, child support, rent and other bills, then it's worth examining if this is an arrangement you're comfortable with, and how your partner would respond if you, for example, lost your income. If the person you're dating takes it as a given that you will take care of him or her, sit down and have a talk pronto.


The person might even say, ""I'd love to go out to dinner, but you know I'm so broke this month."" This is a way of tricking you into paying while making you think it's your idea.
Even if you have tons of money to spare, this should still be a warning sign. If the person you're dating is so willing to take advantage of your money, he or she will also be just as willing to take advantage of your emotions.

, In a healthy relationship, partners take turns doing favors for each other whenever one person needs a little help. In a parasitic relationship, one partner is always doing favors for the other and getting nothing in return. If you find that you're giving your partner rides everywhere, cooking all the meals or picking them up, running errands for him, and basically taking care of all the little things he or she is too lazy to do, then you may be infected by a parasite.


Though it may hurt, write two lists: one, a list of all the favors you've done for your partner, and two, a list of all the favors he or she has done for you. They don't match up, do they?

, This is another major problem. If any time you and your partner are out in public together, he or she refuses to talk to other people, demands your attention constantly, and generally shows no regard for others, then you need to rethink your priorities. It's one thing if your partner is really shy, but another if he or she is rude to others or just flat-out acts like they don't exist. This is a sign that the person doesn't see a life outside of you.


If you find that when the two of you go out, you have to constantly spend all of your time by your partner's side or he or she gets hurt or jealous, then you have a problem.

, In any healthy relationship, both partners should feel comfortable doing their own thing. This can mean hanging out with your own friends, getting some quality family time, or just reading, running, or pursuing your own hobbies on your own time. If your partner truly loves and cares about you, then he or she should be happy when you pursue your own interests and grow as a person on your own.


If your partner is hurt, angry, jealous, or distant whenever you leave the house without him or her, even if you're just grabbing coffee with your cousin Sally, then he or she resents your individuality.
If your partner checks in on you and asks when you'll be home every five minutes when you're out, then he or she may be a parasite.

, When people voice concern about your relationship, it's natural to get defensive and to feel even more determined to prove everyone wrong by trying as hard as you can to make things work. But if you find that your friends, family members, and pretty much everyone in your orbit is worried that your significant other is taking advantage of you, then there may be some truth to what they're saying.


When you tell these people they're wrong, you end up driving them away. Then your partner gets exactly what he or she wants -- even more of your time and attention.

, If you can't even remember the last time you shared your deepest fears or doubts with your partner, then you're in hot water. If you feel like your significant other is always the one who is talking, upset, getting comfort, and seeking and getting your love and attention, then you have a problem. It's okay if your partner is having a bad month, but if you feel like there is always something wrong in his or her life, then you may be getting used for emotional support.


In a healthy relationship, both partners get to talk about their problems and concerns equally.
If you feel like your partner is doing at least 80% of the talking and you're not particularly shy, then you have a problem.
If any time you mention yourself, your partner tries to make your problems seem smaller by saying that he or she has it so much worse, then you have a problem.

, If you're afraid to share your feelings because you think your partner will get angry and misunderstand you, or if you don't share your thoughts and feelings because you know your partner won't really listen, then you have a problem. You should feel just as comfortable about sharing your thoughts, fears, and hopes as your partner does.


Both people should be able to share in a relationship, and if every time you try to talk about yourself, your partner says he or she is busy or tired, interrupts you and tries to make it all about him or herself, or just gets a glazed look that makes it clear he or she isn't listening, then you are getting used.

, You're in a parasitic relationship if you feel like, no matter what, your partner always ends up getting exactly what he or she wants. You may find yourself giving in just because it's easier than fighting, because your partner will be mad if he or she doesn't get what he or she is after, or simply because you've convinced yourself that he or she must want it more. In a healthy relationship, partners work together to find a decision that can make them both happy, and take turns ""giving in"" to each other.


Sure, it's not a big deal to give in on some of the small stuff, like about where to have dinner or what to watch on TV. But this habit can make it easier for you to give in on the big things, like deciding where to move together.

, When is the last time you heard your partner say how much you mean to him or her? If you can't even remember, then you may be getting used and taken for granted. Your partner may think it's a given that you know how much he or she loves you and how special you really are, but if your partner really cares about you, then he or she would tell you, not just assume that you know.


If you don't even get thanked for all of the favors you're doing, then you are definitely getting taken advantage of.
If your partner never compliments you or tells you how nice you look on date night, then you may be being used.

, That's right. Your partner almost never tells you how amazing you are, but you find yourself feeling like you have to say ""I love you"" twenty times a day so the person doesn't feel like you're neglecting him or not giving him enough love and affection. If you feel like you have to tell your partner how much you love him, how great he is, and how much you value him fifty times a day just to help him be less needy, then you have a problem.


In a healthy relationship, both partners should compliment each other and say ""I love you"" around the same amount -- and only when they actually mean it.

, This is an important one. Have you noticed that any time you say no or don't give your partner exactly what he or she wants, your partner gets deeply disappointed. You shouldn't give in to your partner just because they are sad that you didn't meet their request, just like you shouldn't give in to a child throwing a tantrum in public. You shouldn't feel bad about not giving in to your partner's ridiculous requests.


Guilt should not be the driving force in any healthy relationship. Do you find yourself constantly doing things for your partner where you sacrifice all your pleasures just to make them happy. If you do not fulfill their wishes, do they withdraw from you until you give in.
Are you are made to feel that your partner is nothing without you or can not survive without you. These are signs that you may be in a parasitic relationship.

, Do you often find yourself feeling drained out after spending time with your partner?


A parasite doesn't just drain your wallet and free time. But they can rip you off your energy levels—spiritually, emotionally and physically.
A parasitic partner can suck the life out of you. You are constantly giving him or her emotional, financial support, convincing him or her that everything is okay, and they can even drag you into their problems making you feel equally responsible for whatever miserable state they are in.
In a healthy relationship, partners empower each other and make each other feel like anything is possible. In a parasitic relationship, one partner drains the other partner's energy, making him feel incapable of doing anything.

, If you're in a parasitic relationship, then your significant other may be trying to make you feel like you're losing your sense of self; your partner will want this sense of self to be replaced by your sense of yourself as a part of a couple, as a being in a relationship. If you're forgetting who you really are and feel like you're losing track of all of the things that make you special and happy, then you may be in a parasitic relationship that is making you feel a loss of identity.


In a healthy relationship, two people gain a stronger sense of themselves as they bond together as a couple; in a parasitic relationship, one person tries to take on the qualities of the other person and doesn't give him any time to figure out who he really is.

, If you suspect that you're getting used, then it's likely that you probably are. If you get the sense that your significant other is only with you because of your apartment, your car, your money, or your ability to comfort him or her at all hours of the night, then you should get out of the relationship as soon as you can. If you feel like you're giving a ton of support and getting no support at all, even in the most basic things, like getting a ""good luck!"" note before a big exam, then you may be getting used by your partner.


Ask yourself, would your partner still be with you if it wasn't for your nice apartment/new car/big bank account/good looks? If you even hesitate a second before answering, then you're getting used.

, This is another way that a parasite can drain you of your own identity. If you're sacrificing everything so that your significant other can follow his dreams, finish school, move closer to his or her family, or pursue his favorite hobby for hours a day, then you may be in a parasitic relationship. In a healthy relationship, both partners have individual goals and work to get them to align; in a parasitic relationship, one person's goals become the focus of the relationship.


You may not even have noticed that you've stopped caring about becoming a nurse or a chef because you're too busy trying to help your partner find his or her way.
If your partner never even asks about what you want for your future or how you see your career five years down the line, then it may be because he or she is only interested in him or herself.

In interpersonal relationships, it’s especially important to tell the truth when you would benefit from a lie.If you have betrayed someone, coming clean at your own expense tells the other person that their well-being is more important than your own.Denial will only make the other party's distrust run deeper, especially if the truth is already clear.


Admit all of your mistakes. Even if there are parts that you can keep hidden without getting caught, you should still reveal them to the other person. Only in admitting all your mistakes can you be forgiven for all of them.;
, Admitting that you betrayed someone is not going to make things easier immediately. On the contrary, you can expect an emotional outburst—yelling, crying, and so on—from the other person when she hears you admit your betrayal. But remember, the best way to move on is by putting it all into the open.

, This one should be obvious, but unfortunately, sometimes it gets overlooked. How you approach saying your apology will influence whether or not the apology is accepted and you both can move on.When apologizing, avoid justifying your actions.Don’t claim that the offended person misunderstood you (“you read that wrong”). Don’t deny their hurt (“you didn’t even get hurt”). Don’t tell a sad tale (“I had a troubled childhood”).
The best way to accept responsibility is by recognizing the other person’s hurt, saying what you should have done instead, and doing that behavior in the future.Let the person you betrayed know why you are apologizing. If they know that you are apologizing out of guilt and shame, they are more likely to forgive you. If they think that you are apologizing out of pity, they are less likely to forgive you. Pity, unlike guilt and shame, does not show an element of personal responsibility of the offender. Pity also implies that the offender is superior to the offended., When you violate someone's trust, you may feel so regretful that you have a hard time forgiving yourself for the violation. While a repentant heart is an essential part of making up with the person you betrayed, you also need to accept and learn to forgive yourself after you put the effort into making amends.


Remember that no one is perfect. Whether your error in judgment was minor or major, it goes to show that you are only human. Accept your failure, and try to push forward into the future.
By clinging to thoughts of past failure, you risk devaluing yourself. Once you begin to have such thoughts, it could zap your motivation for self-improvement.

, Everybody wants to control personal information.But, for a little while, you may need to forfeit a portion of your privacy for the sake of the person trying to trust you again. By making your life transparent, the other person will be able to confirm with their own eyes that you are not in the midst of another betrayal.


This is especially important in romantic relationships broken apart by infidelity. Give your significant other complete, uncensored access to your texts, phone logs, emails, and appointment book for a few weeks to months after your betrayal. Let him or her know where you are and who you are with whenever possible.

, The person who feels betrayed will need to vent their emotions and thoughts to heal. It might be unpleasant for you, but it is essential for the other person.


One of the worst things you can do is attempt to get them to “shut up” while expressing their anger. This action shows that you are not taking this person’s feelings seriously.
Let the other person vent at their own pace. Everyone goes about things in a different way and in a different time period. Rushing the other person shows a lack of consideration.

, Actions speak louder than words. Trust between two people means that you have to be dependable and consistent over a long period of time.You should make a promise to do better, but a promise or apology alone with only restore trust short-term.If you can’t be honest in the future, or cannot do all that you promise to do, the person you betrayed will be unable to accept that you have changed or that you are worthy of being trusted again.


You should avoid making the same mistake at all costs.

, Understand that rebuilding trust takes time. Be patient with the other person, but be persistent in your own efforts.


Depending on the severity of your betrayal, building trust can take weeks, months, or years.
Never pressure the other person into showing you more trust.
Understand that things may never be quite the same after your betrayal, but if you show that you are a trustworthy person, some level of trust can usually be revived.

, Before you can rebuild trust in someone after they betrayed you, you should first ask yourself if the relationship is one you want to salvage. Ask yourself:


Is this the first time this person betrayed me?
Will I really be able to trust this person again, even if they do everything perfectly from now on?
Am I able to forgive?
Is the relationship I have with this person important enough to fight for?
Is this a one-time mistake or a pattern of behavior?

, Do they seem genuinely sorry for hurting you, or sorry that they got caught? Are they willing to listen to you and make an effort to do better next time? Are they willing to accept blame?


If they don't seem to truly regret hurting you, or aren't interested in making things better, then this relationship probably isn't worth your time.

, Continue to assess the situation as you progress. After a few weeks to months, you should be able to notice signs of trustworthiness in the person who betrayed you. Trying to determine whether someone is lying is tricky business, but the following clues might signal deception:People who are lying take longer to respond, and say less when they do.
A liar tells more far-fetched stories and use fewer details. They are also less direct, have more pauses, and use fewer gestures.
Liars are less likely than those telling the truth to correct themselves.
People who lie are more tense. This make their voices sound higher, and they are more likely to fidget.

, Let the person who betrayed you know just how deeply you were hurt by their actions. Most importantly, tell your betrayer exactly what it was that hurt you. Tell them what you need so that you will start trusting that person again.

, Once you let out your anger, let it go. After you have discussed the betrayal, you need to let it stay in the past. Even if you feel sad or angry now, you won’t feel this way forever. Don’t bring it up in future arguments, especially if the other person has shown an effort to make amends for the action.


If you still notice that you are holding onto your negative feelings, think about why you are having trouble letting go. Is it because your partner is still behaving in a way that betrays your trust? Or is it because of your personal issues related to your own past history?

, Even if someone never wants to hurt you, no one will be able to give you exactly what you need, 100 percent of the time. Once you understand that you should not expect perfection, you can get a better idea of how much trust you actually can put in the other person. The goal is to be realistic, not to let yourself get walked all over. Accept that everyone can slip up here and there. However, don’t ever let anyone get away with hurting you intentionally or with intentional neglect.

, You need to be willing to accept and love the person who betrayed you, and you also need to accept the love that person gives you in return. When your betrayer tries to express affection, accept that the acts of affection are the real thing. Try to accept an action that seems honest.

Recognize when to leave.,
Watch body language.,
Make plans to see each other again.,
Tell the truth.",How to Say Goodbye1," When you're at any kind of party or gathering, or even a one-on-one conversation, it can be difficult to get away. Learning to recognize good opportunities to leave will make a short-term goodbye much easier.


Notice if the crowd seems to be dwindling. If more than half the people have left, it might be a good time to leave. Find the host, or your friends, give a wave to the room, and leave. Try not to add too much emphasis to your leaving - this could make them feel as if you are desperate to get out.
Leave when you want. If you know you won't be able to stay until the end then you could perhaps speak to them beforehand or at the beginning of the party. You don't need to wait for any special signal. If you're ready to go home, or ready for the conversation to move along, say, ""Well, I'll be going. See you all later!"";
, Overstaying your welcome is rude, but it can often be difficult to distinguish. People don't like telling you that they'd like you to leave, so try to watch for signals. This may be some other family members starting to pack up or the fact that there is hardly anyone left.


If the host of a party starts cleaning up, or withdraws from the conversation, gather your friends or belongings and make your exit. If someone starts checking their watch, or seems otherwise restless, it's also time to leave.

, Even saying, ""See you at school tomorrow,"" or ""Can't wait to see you again at Christmas"" keeps the goodbye light and focused forward. If you haven't already made plans, use it as an opportunity to make them. Even saying, ""See you soon"" suggests just that.


Set up a coffee date or meet for lunch later in the week if it makes the goodbye easier, but don't commit to anything you don't want to. It's ok to just leave.

, It can be tempting to come up with a ""good excuse"" when you're ready to leave. You don't need to (lying could also make them feel hurt if they find out you didn't mean it). If you want to leave, just say, ""I'm going to go now, see you later."" It doesn't need to be any more complicated than that. If you want to extract from a conversation you're ready to end, ""I'll talk to you later,"" is likewise plenty.

"
"

Follow up.",How to Say Goodbye2," If someone you know is leaving for several years to go overseas, or leaving for college, it can be a stressful and hectic time while they're planning a trip. Set up a definitive time and place to meet and say goodbye. Likewise, prioritize your goodbyes if you're the one doing the leaving. Don't make plans with people you don't really care about saying goodbye to and forget to see your sister.


Choose an enjoyable location––maybe over dinner, or strolling your favorite neighborhood, or spending time together doing something both of you have always enjoyed, like watching a game.

, Recount your funniest stories, reminisce about happy things. Dig deep into your past: the things you've done together, the things that happened while you were friends, the time you have spent together, maybe even how you met.


Don't start the goodbye the second you get into the room. Gauge the person's attitude about leaving, or about your leaving. If it's a trip they're not looking forward to, don't spend the whole time asking them questions about their deployment. If they're excited, don't spend the whole time bumming them out by telling them how much everyone will miss them. If your friends are jealous of your job opportunity in France, don't spend the whole time bragging about it.

, It's important to establish the standing of the relationship. If you want to keep in contact, let them know. Exchange email, phone, and address information.


Asking for an e-mail address or phone number can be comforting, so that you can still talk with them, but also be honest. If you have no intentions of staying in touch, don't ask for contact details. It can leave a departing friend wondering about your sincerity.
Make sure your family members are all up to date with your location and status, and that you're up to date about them before either one leaves. It's important to not give anyone the impression that you're withdrawing or disappearing.

, Most people don't enjoy a long, drawn-out goodbye, but make your goodbye personal. If you need to express complicated feelings, consider writing them in a letter for the person to read later. In person, keep things light and fun. Hug, say your piece, and wish them luck in their journey. Don't overstay your welcome.


If you're leaving for a long time and can't take everything with you, giving stuff away can be a nice gesture and solidify a relationship. Let your band buddy hang onto your old guitar while you're gone, or give your sibling a meaningful book they'll remember you by.

, Stay in touch if you'd made plans to stay in touch. Talk on Skype or write funny postcards. If you gradually lose touch with a friend or loved one you sincerely would like to hear from, make an extra effort. If it seems as if your friend as become too busy, try not to get too upset. Let things drift back together naturally.


Keep your expectations for communication realistic. A friend going to college will make new friends and might not be able to keep up a weekly phone exchange.

Say goodbye now.,
Do what feels appropriate.,
Tell the truth, selectively.,
Keep talking.,
Be present.",How to Say Goodbye3," Putting off going to visit a loved one in the hospital is always a mistake, as is waiting until the last days before a friend leaves the country forever. Don't miss out on your chance to say goodbye and brighten their final moments. Alone in the hospital can be a terrible place to die. Be in the room and say what needs to be said. Spend as much time with your loved one as possible. Be with him or her and support them.


Often, the dying want and are very comforted by one of four very particular messages: ""I love you,"" ""I forgive you,"" ""Please forgive me,"" or ""Thank you."" If any of these seem appropriate, take care to include them in your goodbye., We often have the impression that death or other ""forever"" goodbyes are supposed to be a somber and joyless thing. But follow the lead of the person leaving. Your role is to be there for them and to comfort them in a time of need. If laughter is desired, or seems natural, then laugh.

, It can be hard to know how honest to be with the dying. If you're visiting an ex-spouse or an estranged sibling, there can be lots of tension burbling under the surface, and complicated emotions at work in their passing. The hospital doesn't seem like the best time to let loose and tell off your father for being absent.


If you feel like the truth will hurt the person dying, recognize this and change the subject. Say, ""You don't need to worry about me today"" and change the subject.
It can be tempting to want to be overly optimistic, saying ""No, there's still a chance. Don't give up"" if a loved one says, ""I'm dying."" There's no need to dwell on something neither of you know for sure. Change the subject to, ""How are you feeling today?"" or reassure them by saying, ""You look great today.""

, Always speak gently and identify yourself as the person speaking. Even if you're not sure you're being heard, say what needs to be said. The goodbye process in death works both ways--make sure you don't regret not saying ""I love you"" one last time. Even if you're unsure if the person can hear you, say it, and you'll know., Both physically and emotionally, be in the room. It can be difficult to avoid becoming hyperaware of the significance of the moment: ""Is that the last time he'll say, 'I love you'?"" Every moment can feel tense and electric. But get out of your own way and try, as much as possible, to experience the moments for what they are: time with a loved one.


Often, the dying have a great amount of control over the actual moment of their death and will wait until they're alone to save their loved ones the pain of experiencing it. Likewise, many family members are committed to being there, ""To the end."" Be aware of this and try not to put too much emphasis on the exact moment of death. Say goodbye when it seems appropriate.

See if the person can act naturally around you.,
Gauge if the person is happy to be around you.,
Notice if the person gives you googly eyes.,
See if the person is giddy around you.,
Ask yourself if the person is upset when you are.",How to Know if a Person Truly Loves You1," Part of being in love means being completely open to the other person. If you find yourself seeing a whole different side that the person doesn't show the public, then that may be love. For instance, if your partner is pretty serious or polite in public, but shows a more goofy and silly side when you're alone, then s/he is really opening up to you and loves you.


If the person shares his or her deepest emotions with you and is comfortable with it, then that is love.
If the person is comfortable not looking perfect, tripping, or having food stuck in his or her teeth around you, that means s/he is okay if you see every side of him or her.;
, This should be true even during a bad day. If your loved one has had a very bad day but lights up when s/he sees you, then that's a sign of love. If s/he is in love with you, then the sight of you or the sound of your voice is guaranteed to make him or her feel better — if only a little bit.


The next time s/he is grumpy or has a bad day, see how s/he reacts in your presence.

, Though this may be silly, check out your loved one's face the next time you see him or her. Does s/he look at you in a goofy, watery, silly and adorable way that can only be described as ""googly-eyed""? You will know it when you see it. You won't get this look all the time — you can spot it in the morning, or randomly across the dinner table.


You may also be able to catch the person staring at you with the same expression.

, Love makes people feel giddy, weightless, and like laughing for no reason at all. If you see the person acting this way in your presence, then this may be love. Does your loved one seem hyper, excited, and on the verge of laughing for almost no reason at all whenever s/he is around you? If so, then this may be love.


If you've said something barely funny and the person cracks up, then s/he may be lovesick.
If the person shows nervous energy or fidgets around a lot around you, then s/he may just be excited by your presence.

, If you are suffering unbelievable emotional pain or are just bummed because you have the flu, then this should rub off on the person who loves you. If s/he truly loves you, then s/he'll absorb some of your negative emotions and will be very upset because s/he'll want you to feel better as soon as you can.


Though s/he doesn't have to be as upset as you are, the person should clearly be affected by your mood because all s/he wants is for you to be happy.

Notice if the person talks positively about your future together.,
See if the person gives you meaningful compliments.,
Determine if the person means every ""I love you."",
See if the person really opens up to you.,
Expect to be missed when apart.,
Hope to have your mistakes corrected.,
See if the person truly values your opinion.",How to Know if a Person Truly Loves You2," If the person really loves you, then the idea of you being in his or her future is an absolute given, not something that he or she would ever have anxiety or uncertainty about. If the person routinely talks about what you're going to do in the future, about what your lives will look like one, two, or even ten years in the future together, then s/he is probably in love with you.


True commitment means seeing a forever with another person. If the person talks about the future and always includes you in it, then there is a good chance s/he truly loves you.
If the person talks about what your kids will look like, where you will retire together, or where you will go for your honeymoon, then s/he may really love you.

, There's a difference between saying, ""I like your new haircut"" and ""You have the ability to make me feel better no matter what."" If the person gives you compliments that show that s/he really appreciates the important aspects of your character and personality, then there's a good chance s/he really loves you.


Your loved one doesn't have to shower you with compliments all the time — it's the quality, not the quantity, that makes a difference.

, Remember that there is a big difference between ""Love ya!"" and ""I love you."" If your special someone really loves you and tells you this much while looking into your eyes, sounding earnest, and not wanting anything from you, then it's likely that s/he really means it.


If the person undeniably loves you, then s/he will say it for no reason at all, not just because s/he needs a favor or because it feels like the right thing to say.

, If your loved one really loves you, then they will really open up to you and tell you what they are thinking, feeling, fearing, and longing for. If the person really opens up about their childhood, greatest regrets, most painful moments, or most romantic dreams for the future, then it's likely that they like you because the person is so comfortable telling you about almost everything.


If the person tells you, ""I've never told anyone this before..."" then there's a good chance that s/he really loves and trusts you.

, If you and your loved one are apart, but s/he still texts you, calls you, or emails you to let you know how much s/he misses you, then it means s/he can't imagine his or her life without you. If you go on a three-week vacation and don't hear a word from him or her, then it may not be love.


S/he doesn't have to call you constantly to let you know if she/he misses you.

, If that person truly loves you, then s/he doesn't have an idealized picture of you in his or her mind. If it's truly love, then that person will be comfortable with telling you when you've made a mistake, said something illogical, or acted badly. Though the person shouldn't criticize you all the time, giving you a healthy amount of criticism just means that the person really knows you in and out and accepts your mistakes as well as your best qualities.


If the person never argues with you or never criticizes you, then you should be on the look out. Make sure that the person truly loves you instead of an ideal version of who you are.

, If the person truly loves you, then s/he'll care about what you think — whether it's about his or her new pair of shoes or the political situation in your country. If s/he really loves you, s/he will ask for your advice and opinions, whether it's on big or small matters. S/he may feel self-conscious about asking for your opinion, but s/he'll do it because s/he loves you.


S/he doesn't have to ask for your opinion on everything — only the things that really matter.

Hope to be listened to.,
See if the person is always there for you.,
Consider the nice things done for you.,
See if the person always wants to be around you.,
Let them give you space.,
Determine if the person truly understands you.,
See if the person wants the best for you.,
Look for support.",How to Know if a Person Truly Loves You3," If the person really loves you, then s/he'll not only open up to you, but s/he'll also listen to anything you have to say — even if s/he's heard it all before. Though s/he won't be your lapdog, s/he will be around to hear your thoughts. S/he will nod and respond thoughtfully and not interrupt instead of switching the subject to something s/he wants to talk about.


Part of being in love is just being able to listen. It's not all about being able to talk.

, This includes those times when it's inconvenient. Sure, if you want to grab a drink or a tasty meal, the person is always around, but what about when you need a ride from the airport or you need someone to walk your dog while you're sick? If the person truly loves you, then s/he'll be there for you during the fun times as well as the not-so-fun times.


If the person is only around when you're happy, lighthearted, or in a good mood, but flees the scene as soon as you are sad or cranky, then that is not love.
Love is about being there for a person, no matter what. Truly loving a person means accepting all the positive and negative qualities of that person, and being around during the good times and the bad.

, If the person truly loves you, then s/he'll do thoughtful things like put gas in your car when you're busy, do your food shopping for you, or bring you chicken soup when you're home sick. These favors don't have to be constant or over-the-top, but if the person truly loves you, then s/he'll want to do things to make you smile and to make your life easier.


True love isn't just about what you can take from the person, but what you can give as well.
If the person really loves you, then s/he will do nice things for you without you having to ask. It should be implied that you need a favor or help sometimes. If you have to ask for something nice every time, then that may not be true love.

, Part of being in love is always wanting to be around the person you love, even if it's impractical. If the person truly loves you, then he or she will want to be around you — a lot. This doesn't mean the person will want to be attached at the hip, but it does mean that the person will try to take as many opportunities as possible to see you.

, If the person truly loves you, then s/he'll not only want to be around you a lot, but s/he will also know when to give you space and let you do your own thing. If the person wants to be around you all the time, then that's not love — it's infatuation. As love matures, two people will realize that they still need to do things separate to maintain their own identities.


If the person wants to be around you every waking moment, then that may be more of a sign of that person's insecurities than true love.

, True love is true understanding. Though it sounds lame, the person should really ""get"" you in order to love you. If the person actually understands your moods, knows what you want and what you don't want, and has an idea of what will make you happy before you may know it yourself, then that may be true love.


It's okay if part of you remains mysterious to the person — you don't have to be understood 100%, but you do have to have the sense that the other person truly understands where you're coming from most of the time.

, This should be true even if it isn't the best for him or her. If a person truly loves you, then s/he will understand that there are some things that you have to do that may not be the best for him or her, or may mean that you will be spending some time apart. If s/he truly loves you, then s/he will understand that you have to spend a summer on a remote island to pursue your career in marine biology, or that you have to go home early to get enough sleep for a test instead of spending the night with him or her.


If the person only wants what's best for both of you at all times, then s/he is not really seeing you as a unique individual with your own needs and desires.

, If s/he really loves you, then s/he will not only be there for the fun times — s/he'll also be there to help you achieve your goals and move forward in your life. If s/he truly loves you, then s/he'll be there in the bleachers during your soccer game, s/he'll be there to see you defend your thesis, and s/he'll be there to give you a ride to your job interview. And s/he'll be there whenever you want to talk about something that means a lot to you.


If s/he really loves you, then s/he will support you to achieve your goals or pursue your interests, even if they have nothing to do with him or her.

Give your pet a gift.,
Play with your animal around the holidays.",How to Involve a Pet in Christmas," Take a photo of your pet then find a small frame with a hook so that you can hang it on the tree. During the holiday season craft stores will probably have small decorations that you could even glue to the frame- like foam stickers.;
, Just have a member in your family hold the animal or get the animal to stand next to someone in the picture. This will show that they are a part of your family.

, For example, you could have your dog wear a Christmas collar or put a red ribbon around your fish tank. This just adds decoration to them and the room.

, While everyone is opening presents, give your pet a gift, such as a bone for a dog or a toy for a cat. It is also fun to wrap your gift for a dog, sometimes they will even unwrap it themselves.

, If you live where it snows, then just take your dog outside to play with it. Or just spend a little time with your pet inside on Christmas giving it special attention, even if it's just a belly rub.

Identify and share your deal breakers.,
Assess whether you can fulfill one another’s needs.,
Recommit to the relationship.,
Leave the relationship.",How to Rebuild Mutually Lost Trust in a Relationship1," If you and your mate both betrayed one another’s trust, there’s a chance you haven’t had a discussion about your non-negotiables. These are behaviors that you find unacceptable when coming from your partner because they violate your values and ethics. Sit down with one another and figure out what yours are.


Get separate sheets of paper. Each of you should make a list of things that you will not tolerate in a relationship. Once you have compiled your lists, share them aloud with one another.
Non-negotiables can be trivial demands like preferring that your partner keep their space clean to more serious concerns like refusing to date someone who uses drugs.Disloyalty occurs in relationships when each partner isn’t aware of the other’s non-negotiables. Now that you are considering starting anew, this is a good time to lay everything out on the table. Being open and honest with each other is a great way to start correcting the issues that broke your trust in the first place.;
, After hearing your partner’s relationship deal breakers, ask yourself whether you are able to oblige their needs. You may even need to take time apart before moving forward with the relationship to truly consider this.


It’s understood that a person isn’t going to be willing to compromise on these non-negotiables. So, are you able to be the partner they desire?Let’s imagine your girlfriend says she absolutely will not tolerate a racist partner. As a result, you might consider whether you are able to suppress or overcome your bigoted viewpoints.

, If both partners acknowledge and accept the other’s non-negotiables, you now need to make a new commitment to the relationship. In a sense, you are vowing to set aside your differences and put in effort to make your relationship work.You may even make your recommitment ceremonial by going out on a nice date or buying a cake and blowing out candles. It may even feel meaningful to write each of your betrayals down on a sheet of paper. And, then tear the paper into tiny shreds or light it on fire.

, If, after discussing your deal breakers, one or both partners decide they cannot meet these needs, this is probably the best time to call it quits. Neither of you should give up your non-negotiables for the relationship. Doing so will only lead to unhappiness and resentment.


Sacrificing your values for the sake of the relationship will also jeopardize your ability to restore trust. If you can’t meet your partner’s needs, agree to go your separate ways.
Try to give each other some space first before you decide to leave. Giving each other space may provide a different perspective and help to clarify whether your non-negotiables can truly be negotiated.

"
"
Stop the trust-breaking behaviors immediately.,
Get everything out in the open.,
Forgive yourselves and one another.,
Agree to leave the past in the past.",How to Rebuild Mutually Lost Trust in a Relationship2," This seems obvious, but after you both reaffirm your commitment to the relationship, any and all betrayals should end. The only way you can rebuild trust is by reestablishing honesty. This means if one partner has been lying, they have to stop. If one partner has been cheating, the illicit relationship must end., In addition to stopping the trust-breaking behaviors, it can also help to completely clean the slate. Lying and betrayal can be a slippery slope; you tell one “white” lie that turns into a dozen larger ones. Create a foundation of trust by sharing anything you have withheld from your partner. This can be a hard step to take, but it demonstrates vulnerability on both sides. Each partner must trust their partner to confess any wrongdoing. In turn, the other partner must be grateful for the disclosure. This must be done in a non-threatening, non-judgmental way in order to be effective. Couples who can share their intimate thoughts without fear of retribution can enjoy healthy lasting relationships.For example, a wife might say to a husband: “Dear, I have been fantasizing about another man for the past several weeks. I have not acted on these thoughts. Still, I am deeply ashamed because I only want you. I hope you can come to forgive me.”
Be sure to have this conversation in a safe space, such as a therapist's office, because certain things may trigger you or your partner and this may lead to more conflict.

, Forgiveness is not excusing the betrayal or forgetting that it happened. Rather it is the act of absolving your partner of guilt so that you can move forward. Because both of you broke one another’s trust, you both need to be forgiven. However, you also need to forgive yourself for breaking your partner’s trust. The REACH method can help you achieve forgiveness.Recall the hurt. Allow yourself to acknowledge and accept the betrayal for what it is. Don’t avoid or try to repress the thoughts and feelings.

Empathize with the offender. Try to understand why your partner may have betrayed you. (e.g. “You may have lied because I am often very critical.”)

Altruistic gift of forgiveness. Reflect on a time when you hurt someone and they granted you the gift of forgiveness. View forgiveness as a gift that awards the giver with peace of mind.

Commit yourself. Announce your forgiveness to yourself, your partner, and any other loved ones for accountability.

Hold onto forgiveness. When memories of the betrayal resurface, remind yourself that you chose to forgive and let go of any thoughts of revenge.

, Once you each of you have agreed to forgive, avoid rehashing what happened. Think of today as the first day of your relationship. Whatever lies over the horizon is what you make it.


Hold each other accountable for not bringing up past betrayals in future arguments. Agree on a phrase like “Let’s stick to the present, sweetie” when the past pops up.

"
"
Strive to see the good in your partner.,
Practice non-defensive communication.,
Be realistic.,
Practice active listening.,
See a couples therapist.",How to Rebuild Mutually Lost Trust in a Relationship3," Oftentimes, relationships take a turn for the worst because you are only able to spot your partner’s faults. As you work to rebuild trust, attempt to clear up the fog that has been clouding your view. Recount all the wonderful reasons you chose this partner.


Challenge yourselves to see the good in each other. Each day for a week, share three things you admire about your partner. Or, express joy for something nice your partner did., Betrayal creeps into a relationship when one or both partners doesn’t feel empowered to communicate. You should be able to share your thoughts, feelings, and opinions without censorship. Improve your communication habits by speaking with “I’” statements.”I” statements decrease the chance of your partner getting offended by your words. They allow you to take ownership of any thoughts or feelings you have. These statements usually start with “I feel.
For example, you might come home from a party and say, “I felt ignored at the birthday party. I felt like you were talking to everyone but me.” This is much less accusatory than saying “You ignored me at the party!”

, Sometimes, it hurts when your partner brushes against a weak spot. Maybe you are sensitive about your family and your partner makes a tactless remark. You think “What a jerk!” or “Did she intentionally criticize me?” In order to rebuild your trust, you have to turn the volume down on this defensiveness and start giving your partner the benefit of the doubt.If you attack everything your partner says, they will start censoring their words around you. That’s the slippery slope before lying and betrayal reenter the picture.
Besides, your partner probably has your best interests at heart. Don’t expect everything that comes out of their mouth to be spun in gold. Hold yourself and your partner to realistic standards and your relationship will thrive.

, As you and your partner begin to communicate more openly and regularly, it can help to refine your listening skills. Listening to your partner when they speak is a great way to show that you respect them and gain their trust.When your partner is speaking, give them your full attention. Remove distractions like cellphones and TVs. Wait to have serious discussions when the kids are preoccupied or asleep. Make frequent eye contact. And, rest your arms and legs at your sides with a relaxed posture. Smile or nod as appropriate.
When your partner finishes speaking, paraphrase what they said to be sure you got it right. You might say, “It sounds like you are saying…” or something similar. This confirms that you were listening and makes your partner feel better validated than if you rushed to offer a response.

, Mutual betrayal can take a toll on a relationship. If you and your partner are struggling to restore trust, see a professional couples therapist. A therapist can help you clarify your relationship goals and devise practical strategies to improve honesty and communication."

Look to see if the animal reacts to another animal when they are stressed or in danger.,
Note if the animal responds to an injured animal or a dead animal in the area.,
Check if the animal works together with other animals.",How to Identify Empathy in Animals1," In a study on empathy in pigs, researchers looked at how pigs responded when their pen mates were placed in stressful or potentially harmful situations. When one group of pigs were in danger or experiencing a threat, the other group responded with stress signals like pushing their ears back and becoming more alert. This indicates that pigs have the ability to show emotional contagion, where they share the emotional response that another pig is having, which is a key part to having the capacity for empathy.While you may not want to conduct your own test on animals, you can observe if the animal reacts when another animal appears in danger or under stress. The animal may respond with stress related noises or actions, such as a more alert or rigid body movements, cries or howls, and moving towards the animal under stress.;
, In a study on empathy in elephants, a researcher observed an elephant mother who gave birth to a stillborn baby. The mother then guarded her dead calf for two days and tried several times to revive the dead calf’s body. When the researcher offered the elephant mother water, the elephant drank the water and then touched her chest as if in a sign of mourning.Though elephants have been one of the more studied animals in terms of empathy, an animal may display empathy by trying to protect an injured animal from a predator. The animal may also respond to a dead animal by displaying signs of mourning over their body or to others, such as the elephant mother touching her chest., Often, animals of the same species will protect each other and respond to the needs of their herd or pack. You may observe animals working together to build a habitat, such as a den, or you may observe animals working as a team to capture a prey or elude a predator. These group related activities can be a sign of empathy among the animals, as they must focus on how their fellow animals are thinking and feeling and respond to it in kind."

Watch if the animal yawns when you yawn.,
Note if the animal comforts you when you upset or in distress.,
Test the animal's empathy and self-awareness with a mirror.",How to Identify Empathy in Animals2," A new study done on empathy in dogs notes that dogs may yawn as a way to emotionally respond to someone that they are emotionally attached to, such as their owner. The researchers concluded that dogs will yawn in response to a real yawn from their owner to identify with their actions and express empathy.Test your dog’s ability to empathize with you by sitting in front of her and letting out a real yawn. Note if she yawns back at you, as this could be a sign of empathy.

, The next time you are upset, stressed out, or in a distressing situation, note how your household pet responds to you. Your dog may go over to you and lick you or nuzzle you as a sign of empathy or your cat may try to sit in your lap or rub against you to show that she is aware of your distress. These actions are indicators that your animal is able to identify and respond to your emotional state., Another key element of empathy is the ability to be self-aware, and researchers are currently testing the capacity for self-awareness in animals. You can do this on your own by placing your animal, such as a cat or dog, in front of a mirror and noting how they react to the mirror. If your cat or dog tries to paw or lick at their reflection, they may not be aware that they are looking at themselves in the mirror and may be believe they are seeing another cat or dog.You can test the animal’s capacity for self-awareness further by making a small mark in washable marker on the animal’s face. You can then note if the animal tries to rub off the mark on their face when they look in the mirror or if they ignore it completely. If they ignore it completely, this may be a sign that the animal is not self-aware and not able to respond to his own reflection.

Keep in mind empathy is a cognitive and emotional skill.,
Note the difference between empathy in humans and empathy in animals.,
Do not be alarmed if the animal displays no indicators of empathy.",How to Identify Empathy in Animals3," Empathy is considered a thinking response and an emotional response. This means that when you empathize with someone, you are demonstrating your ability to experience another person’s feelings in a certain circumstance. You also experience a negative response to someone’s difficult circumstances and their negative emotions. So, empathy requires to exercise your ability to process someone else’s circumstances and your ability to experience someone else’s circumstances.In the human world, empathy is seen as a way to demonstrate social competence. It is also a highly valued skill in people who are perceived as leaders and role models. When you are empathetic, you also display your ability to be self-aware of your responses and reactions. This can help you to better process your own emotional thoughts and feelings.

, While there is still debate around the presence of empathy in all animals, many researchers argue that empathy in humans operates differently than empathy in animals. Humans make moral judgements based on empathy that differs from the way animals make judgements, which is often based on the strength of survival and a “you scratch my back, I’ll scratch your back” mentality. We also use our empathy differently than animals, as we are conditioned by social codes to react to others. This means that animals and humans may not view empathy in the same way or use it in the same way.

, It is important to remember that studies on empathy in animals are ongoing and there are no definitive studies on the topic. If you observe an animal and interact with an animal but do not note any signs or empathy, this may not mean the animal does not have the capacity for empathy. This may just mean their empathy is not being triggered properly or they may be processing the situation differently than you might think they would."

Work backwards through the each group using inference.",How to Classify Animals," This system for classifying animals based on their characteristics was originally derived from the 18th-Century work of botanist Carl Linnaeus.However, generally, when biologists speak of taxonomic ranks, they refer to the seven ""main"" ranks, listed in the table below below from most inclusive to most exclusive. Note that the entries in the ""Examples"" column are color-coded to show the taxonomic ""path"" of classifying three example organisms.


The entries in red follow the path of Homo sapiens, or humans (an animal).
The entries in blue provide the example of Rubus rosifolius, or the West Indian Raspberry (a plant).
The entries in green are an example of Escherichia coli, commonly known as E. coli (a bacterium).;
, A variety of mnemonics, including this one, are useful for remembering the seven main taxonomic ranks - kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species - and their order. The first letter of each word in the mnemonic corresponds to the first letter of each taxonomic rank in order. In other words, ""King"" corresponds with ""kingdom"", ""Phillip"" corresponds with ""phylum"", and so on.

, For example, every animal can be classified under Kingdom Animalia, but only a very specific animal fits into the species ""sapiens"". As you move through each ranking from kingdom all the way down to species, any animal you classify will need to meet more and more requirements to be classified in a given category.

, One large part of classifying an animal is identifying its morphology. Morphology refers to the internal and external characteristics of an animal. For example, does it have fur or scales? What kind of stomach does it have? Knowing about the characteristics of the animal you want classify will help you do this correctly.

, All animals are, by definition, members of Kingdom Animalia (sometimes also called ""Metazoa"").All organisms within the kingdom are animals and all organisms outside of the kingdom are not animals. Thus, when classifying animals, you will always be working within this large ""umbrella"" category.


Besides Animalia, the other taxonomic kingdoms include Plantae (plants), Fungi (fungi), Protista (single-celled eukaryotes), and Monera (prokaryotes).
As a running example, let's try to classify anatomically modern humans according to the rules of taxonomic classification. Humans are living, breathing animals, so we'll start in kingdom Animalia, as directed above.

, Phylum (plural: phyla) is the rank directly beneath the umbrella category of the Kingdom Animalia. There are 35 different phyla in Kingdom Animalia. Very roughly speaking, each phyla groups its members according to general morphology. For instance, members of Phylum Chordata all have a stiff rodlike structure running along the length of its body (e.g. a backbone), with a hollow dorsal nerve cord above and a gut below, while members of Phylum Echinodermata all have five-pointed radial symmetry and a trademark ""spiny"" skin.


Be aware that taxonomic ranks were created before the advent of modern genetics technology. Therefore, incongruities between organisms grouped together in a phylum and their actual genetic similarities can exist. This means that certain phyla has given rise to others. For example, platyhelminthes (flatworms) giving rise to animal phyla with a through-gut.
In our example, we would classify humans in Phylum Chordata because we have a hollow dorsal nerve cord above a backbone.

, After the phylum ranking comes an animal's class ranking. Across all the phyla, there are 111 different classes in total. Generally, the members of a class are grouped together based on their genetic and/or morphological similarities. Below are a few examples of classes within Phylum Chordata:


Mammalia (Mammals) - warm-blooded, with hair, a four-chambered heart, and mammary glands for secreting milk. Usually (but not always) give live birth.Aves (Birds) - warm-blooded, egg-laying, with a four-chambered heart, feathers and wings.Reptilia (Reptiles) - cold-blooded, egg-laying, with scales or scutes and (usually) three-chambered hearts.Amphibia (Amphibians) - cold-blooded with three-chambered hearts and (usually) a water-bound larval life cycle, water-permeable eggs, and a skin that functions as a respiratory organ.In addition, within Phylum Chordata, a relatively large number of classes for fish and fish-like organisms exist. The fish are:

Osteichthyes - bony fish (ray-finned and fleshy-finned fishes)
Chondricthyes - cartilaginous fish (sharks, skates, dogfish, and rays)
Agnatha - jaw less fish (lampreys and hag fish)


In our example, we would group humans in Class Mammalia because we exhibit the characteristics listed above.

, After the class ranking comes an animal's order. Orders are used to group animals into easily-managed groups that are more specific than the inclusive blanket terms of phylum and class but less specific than genus, species, and so on. For example, the two orders within Class Reptilian are:Testudines - turtles, tortoises, etc.
Squamata - snakes and lizards
In our example, we would classify humans in Order Primates with monkeys, apes, and our extinct proto-human predecessors.

, After the order grouping, an animal's taxonomic classification begins to become fairly specific. For instance, a specific variety of animal's common name may be derived from the Latin root of its its family name - geckos (members of Family Gekkonidae) are named this way. Another few examples of families within Order Squamata are:


Chamaeleonidae - chameleons
Iguanidae - iguanas
Scincidae - skinks
In our example, we would classify humans in Family Hominidae with the great apes and early proto-humans.

, An animal's genus (plural: genera) is used to differentiate it from other types of animals which may be superficially similar or even share the same common name. For instance, the members of Family Gekkonidae are all geckos, but members of Genus Dixonius (leaf-toed geckos) are different from Genus Lepidodactylus (scaly-toed geckos), and so on for all 51 genera in Family Gekkonidae.


In our example, we would classify humans in Genus Homo, which includes modern humans and the types of early human ancestors that are familiar from popular culture - neanderthals, cro-magnons, and so on.

, An animal's species is usually the most specific taxonomic rank it can have. Species are often defined as, individuals that are similar in appearance, can breed amongst themselves, but are unable to breed with members of other species.In other words, only animals that are in the same species can mate with each other and produce viable offspring. Animals that aren't in the same species can sometimes produce offspring, but these offspring are almost always sterile and cannot produce offspring of their own (one common example is the mule, which is unable to reproduce and is produced by breeding a horse and a donkey).


Be aware that animals within the same species can appear to be different despite being closely related. For example, a chihuahua and a great Dane look quite different, but are the same species.
In our example, we would finally classify humans in Species sapiens. This category excludes all other forms of life except for humans. Note that modern humans of Genus Homo and Species sapiens can have a wide variety of morphological differences - different size, facial appearance, skin color, hair color, and so on. Still, any male-female pair of healthy humans can produce viable offspring, so all people are humans.

, As a general rule, an animal's species is the most specific classification it can receive. However, there are many exceptions to this rule in which scientists further classify a species of animals into two or more subspecies. A given species will always have two or more subspecies or none at all - never just one. A common situation in which subspecies classifications are assigned is if, within a species, certain groups of organisms are capable of producing viable offspring but do not do so in nature do to geographical separation, behavior patterns, or other reasons.


In our example, if we want to refer to anatomically modern humans (i.e., the type of humans that inhabit the world today), we can use the subspecies sapiens to further differentiate ourselves from Homo sapiens idaltu, another type of proto-human in the Homo sapiens species.

, The final two taxonomic ranks, genus and species, which are are the most specific of all the ranks, are used for an animal's scientific name. In other words, an animal's official name by which it is recognized by scientists worldwide is its Genus (capitalized) followed by its species (not capitalized). For example, the scientific name of modern humans is Homo sapiens because they belong to Genus Homo and Species sapiens. Note that an animal's scientific name is italicized.


Because an animal's genus and species are its most specific taxonomic classifications, often, this will be sufficient classification information for most purposes.
If you do not know the scientific name of the animal you are interested in classifying, try searching the internet. Search for the common name of the animal (e.g. ""dog"") along with ""scientific name"". You will be able to quickly find the scientific name this way.

, Because an animal's scientific name is its genus and species, if you know an animal's scientific name, you usually have enough information to find the rest of its taxonomic ranks by using these two as a starting point.

, Once you know an animal's scientific name, it's also possible to determine an animal's taxonomic classifications through inference, using your animal's morphology, evolutionary history, and genetic relationships to other animals to choose its family, order, and so on. Use information you know about the species to aid your search. If possible, double-check your inferences in a suitable biological resource or textbook.


For instance, in our Homo sapiens example, if we know that humans share a recent evolutionary ancestor with great apes, we can place them in Family homo-sapiens with the rest of the great apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans). Since great apes are primates, we can place Homo sapiens in Order Primates as well. From here, class and phylum are easy. Obviously, all primates are mammals, so we can say that humans are in Class Mammalian, and all mammals have backbones, so we can say that humans are in Phylum Chordata.
As mentioned at the beginning of the article, all animals will be in Kingdom Animalia regardless of their other taxonomic classifications.

Ask your vet for advice.,
Make sure your pet is healthy before you leave them alone.,
Follow up with your vet if there are issues.",How to Help Pets Cope with the Back‐to‐School Transition," Your pet thrives on routine and before you disrupt it completely, you should prepare them well in advance. Start by adding short periods of separation to your pet’s daily routine so they get used to your absence, and the absence of others, at home. You may do this over a period of a few weeks leading up to the back school season so your pet is prepared.For example, you may try to leave your pet alone for ten to fifteen minutes in the house while you go chat to a neighbor next door. Or you may leave your pet on their own for an hour while you go run errands in the area.;
, You should also get your pet used to playing alone, as it will be less strange to them once the time comes for you to leave. Give your pet toys that they can play with on their own or leave them alone with a toy so they can have a solo play session.For example, if you have a dog, you may give them a puzzle game that dispenses treats once they have solved a puzzle or figured out how to open a trapdoor in the game.
If you have a hamster, you may put a wheel in their cage so they can run on the wheel to occupy themselves when they are alone.
If you have a cat, you may provide a scratching post so your cat can play and scratch to their heart’s content while you are away.

, You should try to minimize the drama of you leaving and returning home so your pet does not get riled up when you come and go. You may try to simply open the door and exit quietly so your pet is not even aware that you are leaving. When you arrive home, you may remain quiet and calm so your pet does not become too excited by your return.Try to get others in your household in the habit of making a quiet entrance and a calm return to the home. This will allow your pet to see your leaving and entering as no big deal and become less stressed by the occurrence.

, It may help to wear out your pet a little before you leave so they are more docile when you are gone. Exercising your pet and spending time with them before you head out for the day can allow them to feel calm and relaxed during your absence.If you have a dog, you may take them for a walk before you head out. If you have a cat, you may have a play session with their favorite toy so they get to run around for a little before you leave.
If you have a bird or a rabbit, give them a petting session and some extra attention so they do not feel stressed when you leave.

, You should leave your pet with toys that they can interact with on their own. This will ensure they do not get too bored while you are gone. You may scatter these toys around the house for your pet to find while you are gone. You may also keep these toys hidden until it is time for you to leave so they feel like special toys that your pet gets access to when you are absent.If you have a dog, you may use interactive toys like a dog conch stuffed with treats or a puzzle game. You may leave catnip in your cat’s favorite toy if you have a cat, or put a new toy in your bird’s cage to keep them occupied.

, Your pet may take comfort in having an item of your clothing near them, such as a shirt or a sock. Your clothing will smell like you and your pet may appreciate having a reminder of their owner around when they are alone in the house.You may leave an unwashed item of clothing in your pet's bedding area or in their play area for them to find.

, Many pets find the noise of the television or the radio soothing. You may put on your pet’s favorite show or a calming channel that you think your pet might enjoy. You may also select calming music and leave it on for your pet to listen to.There are DVDs available that are made specifically for cats and dogs to listen to while their owners are away. You can look for these DVDs at your local pet store or online.

, You can make sure your pet is taken care of while you are at school by hiring a pet sitter to spend time with your pet. You may have a pet sitter that comes by once a day to check on your pet and spend some time playing with them. Or you may hire a full time pet sitter who stays at your home while you are at school to make sure your pet is well taken care of and does not get too lonely.If you have a dog, you may hire a dog walker to come by your house and walk your dog for you while you are at school.

, When you do get home after a day at school, you should reward your pet with attention and love. Give them a treat for being well-behaved while you are away and have an evening play session with them to make up for your time apart.If you have a dog, you may also schedule in an afterschool walk with your pet so they can feel rewarded and loved. You may also have an afterschool play session with your cat, bird, rabbit, or hamster so they feel acknowledged when you are back at home.

, If your pet seems to display intense symptoms of separation anxiety, you may ask your vet for advice on how you can ease your pet into the transition. Your pet may require certain training techniques to help them become more comfortable with being alone. Your vet can recommend certain tricks and tips to help your pet get used to being on their own while you are away.Most pets will adapt to your absence within 48 hours, as long as you prepare them and set up a good environment for them at home. If they do not adapt, there may be other medical issues that could be causing the anxiety., Your pet should have regular check ups with your vet to make sure they are in good health and are not at risk of injury if they are left alone. You do not want your pet to become sick or ill while you are away.

, If your dog still displays severe separation anxiety, where they urinate or defecate in inappropriate places, exhibit destructive behavior, or have intense vocalizations like whining, barking, meowing, or howling, you may follow up with your vet. Your vet may recommend making adjustments to your pet’s daily habits and training so you can both deal with the separation anxiety in a proactive way."

Exhibit proper care and control of your ESA.,
Get the exception in writing.",How to Keep an Emotional Support Animal in No‐Pet Housing," It's important to sit down with your landlord so you can discuss your situation face to face with minimal disruptions. You may want to have the meeting after business hours at a neutral location, such as a nearby café.Particularly if you have an anxiety disorder, try to schedule the meeting at a place where you feel comfortable.
If your landlord asks, ensure them that the meeting will be brief. You shouldn't need more than a half an hour of their time, although your landlord may want to go for longer.
If you schedule the meeting over the phone or in person, follow up with a brief letter that confirms the date and time of the meeting. You should include location information as well.
For example, you might write ""This letter confirms that we have scheduled a meeting at 4:00 p.m. on Saturday, July 21, at the Cornerstone Café, to discuss your pet policy."";
, Before your meeting, write down key points that you want to emphasize to your landlord so you don't forget anything important. A written outline can help decrease the anxiety you have about the meeting.Read through any written information you have about your landlord's pet policy. You want to be as informed as possible about their position.
Jot down references to key provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the federal law that permits ESAs in rental housing for qualified people with mental or emotional disabilities.
You may want to print up a copy of the law to take with you. Highlight the portions that apply to your situation.
You also may want to include a brief history of your mental or emotional disability, and how your ESA has helped you, if you feel comfortable talking about it.

, Since you're asking to keep an animal in your landlord's property, they probably want to meet the animal. If your ESA is clean and well-behaved, its presence may help convince a reluctant landlord to make an exception to their ""no pets"" rule.An otherwise reluctant landlord may have a different opinion once they meet your ESA, particularly if you have a relatively small and well-groomed animal.
Make sure that your animal is restrained at all times, such as in a carrier or on a leash.
Keep in mind that the purpose of bringing your ESA along is to convince the landlord that your animal won't be a problem. If you have an excitable or rambunctious animal, this strategy could backfire.

, After you've explained to your landlord what you want, give them time to respond to your request and pay attention to their statements or concerns. Encourage them to explain their policy so you can carve out an exception.Landlords often have legitimate reasons for creating a no-pet policy. Not allowing pets shields them from liability for damages and potential problems between tenants. It also means they don't have to worry about animal damage to their rental units.
Some landlords may be concerned that you are simply claiming that your pet is an ESA to circumvent their policy. They worry that if they allow you to have your ESA, suddenly every other tenant will need an ESA.
This fear is largely unfounded. In practice, it is very difficult to qualify for an ESA. This can be difficult to understand since mental and emotional injuries are largely invisible, but it isn't enough to simply claim that you need an animal for emotional support.
If your landlord expresses this or similar fears, reassure them that you are a legitimate exception and can provide them with documentation of your disability and your need for an ESA.

, Many landlords don't have adequate information about mental or emotional disabilities. They may consider your ESA ""just a pet."" You must be ready to explain what an emotional support animal is and why they are protected under federal law.Let your landlord know that ESAs are service animals just as a seeing-eye dog is. Even though the animal may not provide you with any concrete physical services or be trained to do specific things for you, it is still important to your health and well-being.
This is where an explanation of your background and the history of your disability can be helpful – again, only if you're comfortable talking about it.
If you don't feel comfortable discussing your disability but don't mind if your landlord knows, consider giving them the name and phone number of a trusted friend or family member with whom they can discuss your situation.

, Landlords are not permitted to require tenants with ESAs to pay additional security deposits or fees in advance to keep their animal in no-pet housing. However, this doesn't mean you can't voluntarily agree to such conditions.Landlords can refuse to provide an exception by showing that doing so would create an ""undue burden."" Typically this claim is raised as a defense after you've filed a lawsuit against your landlord.
This defense is a complex legal argument, and your landlord would have to meet a high burden of proof to prevail. Nevertheless, fighting a landlord who throws around these buzzwords may end up being more hassle than it's worth.
For this reason, if you have the ability to pay a security deposit, and doing so would help smooth the process, offer to do so.
You also should keep in mind that you are responsible for any damages to the rental unit caused by your ESA – regardless of whether you pay an extra deposit.

, Your landlord does have the right to demand proof that you have a disability and your ESA improves the symptoms of that disability. If you want to keep your ESA in no-pet housing, you may need a letter from your therapist or other healthcare provider.The letter from your healthcare provider must state specifically that you have been diagnosed with a mental or emotional disorder, and that your disorder causes you to be disabled.
The letter must make an additional finding that your ESA improves the symptoms of your disorder or otherwise helps you cope with your disability.
For the letter to be valid, both of these statements must be present. It is not enough, for example, for the healthcare provider to state that negative consequences would result if you weren't allowed to keep the animal.
Rather, your ESA must provide demonstrable assistance to you that eases the burden of your mental or emotional disability.

, Once you have a written letter from your healthcare provider, make a copy of it for your own records. Then, send it to your landlord. Include a written letter of your own requesting an exception to the landlord's ""no pet"" policy.Your letter doesn't need to include a lot of legalese or formal language – nor does it have to be very long.
You can simply state ""Enclosed please find a letter from my healthcare provider describing my disability and my need for an emotional support animal to help cope with that disability. This letter serves as my official request for accommodations under federal disability law. Please grant me an exception to your no-pets policy so that I may keep my emotional support animal.""
It can be helpful to personalize your letter. For example, you may include your animal's name, age, and breed.
If you're concerned about your landlord fighting you over the policy, mail your letters using certified mail with return receipt requested. That way you have a record of your request if you need to pursue other legal options.

, Sometimes a letter from your healthcare provider is not enough. You have the burden of proving to your landlord that your ESA is a necessary accommodation for your disability under federal law.Some courts have held that landlords also may require some kind of proof that your ESA has been certified or received special training to provide the service it does.
If your landlord requests such documentation, it's a good idea to talk to a disability law attorney to find out what the law in your state actually requires.
Keep in mind that it isn't necessary to prove that your particular animal is necessary. Some landlords may argue that you can have an ESA as long as it's a smaller animal, or of a different breed.
For example, your landlord may say you can have an ESA as long as it's a dog that weighs less than 20 pounds. This doesn't help you if your ESA is a St. Bernard.
The bond between you and your ESA is an important part of that animal's value to you in coping with your disability. Not just any animal will do, and with limited exceptions you have the right to keep the animal of your choosing.

, Getting an exception to a landlord's no-pet rule does not mean you also are exempted from state and local animal control laws. Your landlord has the right to request proof that your animal is in compliance with these laws.For example, most state and local laws require you to register companion animals and have them vaccinated for rabies.
Your landlord may request copies of your registration and vaccination certificates to keep on file.
Your city may have other animal control restrictions, which your landlord has the right to enforce on their property.

, If your landlord still refuses to allow your ESA even after you've provided written documentation, talk to an experienced disability law attorney. You may want to pursue other legal options such as suing your landlord.Disability attorneys typically provide a free initial consultation, so you can get advice on your situation and what legal options are available to you so you can keep your ESA in no-pet housing.
If you decide to hire an attorney, you typically want to make arrangements to meet with more than one so you can make an informed decision about the best attorney for you.
Certain anxiety disorders can make visiting law offices difficult. Disability attorneys understand this and may be willing to make alternate arrangements, such as visiting you at home or holding a consultation over the phone or using online video conferencing.
An attorney is essential if you get to the point where you have to sue your landlord for discrimination because they refuse to allow you to keep your emotional support animal. However, you should consider a lawsuit only as a last resort after all other options have failed.

, If your landlord refuses to allow you to keep your ESA in no-pet housing, this may constitute housing discrimination. Housing discrimination laws are enforced by state and federal government agencies.You can file a complaint with HUD, the federal housing agency, online. Your complaint will be evaluated by an agent, who may contact you for additional information.
Your state housing authority also may allow online complaints. If not, you may have to call or make a visit to the local housing office.
Government agencies investigate your complaint and talk to your landlord in an attempt to resolve the matter.
If your landlord refuses to comply with government authority, they may be on the hook for fines and other monetary damages.
Filing a complaint with a government agency generally is cheaper, and can be more efficient, than filing a lawsuit against your landlord in state or federal court.

, Unlike service animals that provide assistance to individuals with physical disabilities, ESAs don't have any particular training. This means you're responsible for making sure your ESA is not a nuisance or danger to others.Keep in mind that if your ESA hurts or threatens another tenant, either they or your landlord can sue you. Your landlord also would have the right at that point to forbid your ESA on their property.
Your landlord typically will have other regulations regarding animals, such as walking them only in designated areas and cleaning up after them. You still must abide by these regulations, or your landlord may have the power to evict you.

, If your landlord agrees to allow you to keep your ESA in no-pet housing, that exception should be outlined in a detailed written agreement. Have your landlord write up the exception as an addendum to your lease.The addendum should include all responsibilities you have regarding the care and control of your ESA, as well as the specific terms and conditions of the exception being granted.
If you paid additional security deposits or monthly fees, these amounts should be listed specifically along with the policy for refunding the deposit.
You and your unit should be identified specifically, as well as your animal. Include your animal's age, size, species, and breed. The addendum may even include your animal's name and a photo for reference.
Both you and your landlord should sign this addendum, and you should get a copy of the signed document. It should be kept with the rest of your lease.

Use an essential oil for two weeks at a time.",How to Calm Your Cat with Aromatherapy," Lavender is well known for its calming and sedative effects in humans. You can also use this oil to induce calm and relaxation in your cat. If your cat gets anxious before or during travel, for instance, you could treat the anxiety with some lavender essential oil.Geranium essential oil is a nice alternative to lavender for calming your cat during stressful events and situations, such as car rides.;
, If your cat is prone to nausea during long car rides, for instance, you could try cardamom. Cardamom is one of the few safe and effective essential oils for cats. Remember to reduce the concentration of cardamom essential oil by mixing it with a carrier oil, such as vegetable oil., If your cat is anxious or experiencing stress because of stomach problems, you might try spearmint. Dilute the spearmint oil in a carrier oil, such as vegetable oil, and give your cat the opportunity to smell it., Frankincense oil has a calming and centering effect. It is one of the few essential oils that are definitely safe to use with cats, alongside cedarwood, geranium, helichrysum, lavender, cardamom and spearmint. Like any essential oil, it must be properly diluted prior to application. You can use it to calm your cat during long car rides or other stressful situations., Since any pesticides on the plant used for the oil will end up being highly concentrated in a non-organic essential oil, it makes sense to find organic or unsprayed essential oil products. Look at the label to see if there is any organic certification. If you are unsure, ask the retailer about the purity of the oil and whether it is organic., Find a reputable dealer who knows the business and specializes in essential oils, since they are mostly likely to offer you good advice on the quality and purity of essential oil products. Unfortunately, there are no standards of quality or purity for essential oils. You need to do your research on the brand and find a reputable dealer.The terms ‘therapeutic’ or ‘clinical grade’ are unregulated in the essential oil business. You should be skeptical of marketing that contains these kinds of terms.

, Since your cat’s liver is unable to handle polyphenolic compounds or ‘phenols’, you should avoid essential oils with this substance. For instance, you should avoid giving your cat cinnamon, oregano, clove, wintergreen, thyme, savory and birch oils, which contain this substance and are nicknamed ‘hot’ oils.If you do not know whether an essential oil contains phenols, you could ask an aromatherapist or consult with your veterinarian.

, Although tea tree oil is safe to use on humans when applied topically and is often used in cleaning products, it is very dangerous for your cat. In fact, tea tree oil contains terpenes, a substance that is toxic to both humans and pets when ingested orally.Whereas humans can use tea trea oil topically, cats are very sensitive to the topical application of tea tree oil. You should avoid applying it topically to your cat’s skin or fur. If you use tea tree oil for health or cleaning, you should make sure it is inaccessible to your cat.In some cases, topical application of tea tree oil has resulted in cat fatalities.If your cat accidentally ingests tea tree oil, you should take them to the veterinarian. It may take up to 72 hours to treat poisoning from tea tree oil.
Symptoms of ingesting tea tree oil in toxic amounts may include vomiting, seizures and muscle tremors.

, Citrus-based oils should be avoided, since cats are often allergic or sensitive to these oils. You should neither apply citrus based oils directly to your cat’s body nor diffuse them in a room that is accessible to your cat.For instance, you should not leave a cat in a locked room with citrus based oils diffused in the air. Avoid the following essential oils, which are toxic for your cat:Lemon
Orange
Tangerine
Mandarin
Grapefruit
Lime
Bergamot
Pine
Spruce
Fir

, Since cats are very sensitive to essential oils, it is best to give them the choice of whether to interact with them. Give your cat the opportunity to experience an essential oil but do not force it on them. You want to give them plenty of autonomy, such as opportunities to smell the oil or walk away if they are uninterested., Apply the essential oil to your body and let your cat get used to the smell. For instance, if you want to use lavender to calm your cat, you could start using a lavender-based soap. You could also apply two drops to your neck or arm and let your cat smell you for a few days prior to administering it., Using a spray bottle or a small bottle of essential oil diffused in vegetable oil or another carrier oil, hold the essential oil mixture six inches from your cat’s nose. Wait and observe their behavior. If they show signs of interest in the oil, you should go ahead and begin administering the essential oil. Signs of interest include:Your cat licks their lips
Sniffing the spray bottle
Sniffing and then returning to the bottle

, If your cat does not respond well to essential oils, you might consider hydrosols which are very similar to essential oils but far less concentrated. Although little research has been done on the topic, hydrosols may be preferable for use with cats because they are more gentle and diluted.Hydrosols are collected from the steam that is released during the production of essential oils.

, Start by diluting the essential oil in a carrier oil. Given the strength of essential oils and your cat’s sensitivity to them, you will want to dilute the essential oil by 80-90% In a clean glass jar, pour 25 milliliters (0.85  fl oz) of carrier oil. Then, add one drop of essential oil. Mix the oils together. Finally, add a few drops of the mixture to the water in your essential oil diffuser.For the carrier oil, use a cold pressed vegetable oil.You could use three drops of essential oil and 75 ml of carrier oil.

, In a small water bowl or diffuser, you could leave out some diffused essential oil, such as lavender. Make sure you diffuse it by 80-90% in vegetable oil. Then, put one or two drops of the diffused oil mixture into the container. If your cat feels like it, they can smell the container of essential oil and experience its calming effects.You can find essential oil diffusers for under $40. Consider the size of the diffuser and try to find one that will not fall over easily, since your cat could knock it over.Remember to make sure your cat has access to fresh water.

, Using diffused essential oil, apply a few drops to their paws or to their fur. Since they will be stuck with the smell, you should make sure they actually like the smell of the essential oil.If you are sure they like the smell of the essential oil, you could put a few drops of the diffused oil on your hands and then pet your cat. Give them a relaxing massage with the oil and hopefully they will calm down., Never give your cat the feeling of being stuck with a certain oil or smell. If you are leaving the house, do not leave your cat in a closed room with an essential oil diffuser. They need the autonomy to be able to walk away from the source of the smell, in case it has adverse effects on them., If you are petting your cat with some essential oil, be careful not to let any fall into their eyes or ears. If you get oil in your cat’s eyes or ears, they may get an infection.If essential oil gets in their eyes, you should take them to the veterinarian.

, Essential oils are a short term solution that is useful for calming your cat once in a while, but should not be relied upon exclusively or for a very long time. If your cat has been very stressed out, you can use them for two weeks. If you want to use them for a longer period, you should consult with your veterinarian."

Compare different pet foods.,
Consider the company’s credentials.,
Read the ingredient list.,

Purchase your food.",How to Buy GMO Free Pet Food," If you want to switch your pet to a non-GMO diet, talk to your veterinarian first. The vet can give you tips on avoiding GMOs and making sure that your pet gets a balanced diet.


Ask the vet to recommend specific products that don’t contain GMOs. Your vet has a better sense of your pet’s health, needs, and what products are available that will promote overall wellbeing.;
, Many foods contain GMOs, but some are more likely to have them. The five most common GMO crops are corn, canola, soy, cotton, and sugar beets. It may be easy enough to avoid foods with these products, but they are also used as additives in pet foods. Any of the following products in pet food may also contain GMOs:Corn syrup
Oils such as corn, canola, and cottonseed
Sugars such as corn
Flavoring agents
Thickeners, including carrageenanFructoseGlucose
Soy flour
Soy milk
Xantham gum

, Many types of meat come from animals that eat common crops containing GMOs. Some pet foods may have meat from these animals. Look for products specifically labeled organic or non-GMO verified. This ensures that any meat by-products in your pet’s food are GMO-free., Just as there are common genetically modified crops, there are also foods that generally don’t contain GMOs. Most pet foods contain a combination of protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, fats, and preservatives. The following are generally present in pet foods and non-GMO:Grass or grain (non-corn) fed meat and animal-by products
Beans
Rice
Oats
Barley
Wheat
Vegetables
Vitamins such as B, C, and D
Minerals including sodium and calcium
Vegetable fats

, The easiest way to identify non-GMO pet foods is to look at the packaging. There are several different labels by government agencies or 3rd party verifiers that make it easy to find products with no GMOs. Anything labeled “organic” is also non-GMO. Check for any of the following on the front of pet food packaging:Organic
USDA Organic
Non GMO Project Verified
NSF Non-GMO True NorthCertified CCOF Organic, Once you’ve had a chance to acquaint yourself with non-GMO foods and certifications, it’s time to find the best choice for your pet. Compare different products and retailers to get the best foods and deals.Shop at large and reputable retailers, small independent stores that you know, or directly at pet food manufacturers’ website. You can find non-GMO pet foods on-site and online. Sites in countries such as the United States or Germany, for example, may offer safer products than places that don’t regulate safety or organic standards.
Check the range of products each retailer offers. Make sure the company guarantees its products as at least non-GMO. You should also have the option to return products if you’re not satisfied. Many sites, including Greenest Beans, offer easy online searches to find non-GMO products that meet your specific wishes.See if retailers offer frequent buyer clubs or free shipping. Non-GMO and organic food may be more expensive than other products and this could defray your costs.
Contact customer service or chat with online reps if you have any questions about the company or specific products.

, If you are buying directly from a pet food manufacturer or large retailer, check the company’s credentials. This can verify that you’re buying non-GMO or organic pet food from a reputable source.Check for reviews of the company by government authorities. For example, the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) establishes the guidelines on how pet food manufacturers can label their products. The Better Business Bureau also provides an exhaustive list of company reviews online. Search for the pet food manufacturer by name, website, phone number or email address.Look for any recalls of the pet food by the FDA. This may guide your product choice.See if there are any customer reviews. In addition to government sources, these can provide you insight on experiences buying food for your pet, whether the claims of non-GMO or organic were correct, or whether a pet enjoyed the food. You can often find reviews of the products from the retailer or manufacturer. You may also want to check sites such as Non-GMO Shopping Guide or Organic Pet Digest.

, Once you’ve found a couple of foods that you think your pet might enjoy, examine the ingredients. This minimizes the risk that you accidentally purchase food with GMO products.Read the entire list of ingredients. Pet food ingredients are listed by weight and many products that are high in moisture, such as meat, may appear at the top. Less heavy ingredients, such as wheat or barley, will be lower on the list.
Ask store clerks, online retailers, or manufacturers any questions you may have about specific ingredients.
Make sure the pet food also has the Guaranteed Analysis. This designation lists the minimum amount of protein and fat by percentage. It also lists the maximum amount of fiber and moisture by percentage as well.

, Look on the pet food label to locate the Nutritional Adequacy Statement. This paragraph ensures the food is complete and balanced for a specific stage of life, such as growth or reproduction.the statement will read, “This food is completed and balanced for,” followed by a life stage.Finding this label can minimize the risk that you buy a non-GMO or organic pet food that isn’t suitable for your pet.

, You should also see a designation on the pet food label that describes the feeding trials or tests on the product. It lets you know how the manufacturer proved the Nutritional Adequacy Statement.Consider only those products with the feeding trial information statement. This ensures that living animals ate the food as well as were willing not only to eat the food but stayed healthy while eating it., After you’ve reviewed several pet foods, whittle them down to a short list your pet may like. Then you’re ready to buy the product. Make sure to ask about guarantees and return policies in case your pet doesn’t like the food.

Groom your furry pet, if you have one, as often as it requires it.,
Feed them.,
Clean their food and water bowls at least once a day.,
Give your pets attention.,
Take dogs on walks as required for their breed.,
Physical contact is very important to the socialization of many animals and makes them much more friendly.,
Never treat a pet especially a dog, like a child.,
Do not do anything to hurt the pet.,
Make sure you take your pet to the vet regularly.,
You are the pet's boss.,
Do not become impatient with your pet.",How to Be Nice to Your Pets," Many pets love to be groomed, but if they do not like it, don't do it unless the pet needs it to stay healthy. Not all pets like to be groomed, but they made need to endure it once in a while if their fur or coat becomes tangled or contaminated. Grooming some dogs, cats, and other animals actually helps their skin by adding oils to it.;
, Make sure it's just the right amount. Too little food results in hunger, which may result in your new shoes getting chewed by dogs or other pets and malnutrition in your pet. Too much food can cause vomiting and stomach aches and all the conditions usually associated with obesity in animals. You have to distinguish between the times they're genuinely hungry and the times they're just trying to get food. This can be difficult with a horse which will graze out doors as it chooses or with a hamster that has learnt to beg despite having a full food bowl but try to distinguish between hungry and attention seeking where appropriate.

, It's the same as with us. You wouldn't eat out of the same plate for one whole week, and you wouldn't drink out of the same glass, cup, or mug for a month!

, Pets want as much of your attention as possible, dogs especially. However, this attention should be on your terms. In general, acknowledge your pet's existence; even saying ""Hi <pet name>, how are you doing?"" Clearly they won't understand what you're saying, but at least it shows that you see them.

, It's unhealthy for a dog not to exercise enough, physically and mentally. Many dogs don't like being stuck in a house, chained to a fence or locked in a kennel, or in the same backyard all day long; they like to get out and explore and get vital exercise. They can also meet other dogs this way, if appropriate. If you only saw other people when you went on walks, wouldn't you enjoy them too? Whilst other pets exist, walks is a common exercise for dogs only. If your pet isn't a dog, find an appropriate way to exercise it, this may be a walk, but it could be something else.

, Play with your pet, stroke them, or just sit on the grass and goof around.

, A dog is an animal and needs leadership. Don't pander to insecurity. Instead, be strong and lead by example.

, They are fragile and it will make them dislike you! If you accidentally bump into it or kick it, make sure you apologize by a treat of some sort or a reassuring pat on the head.

, Your pet may not like it, but in the end, it's better to cause a bit of discomfort now and then to find out later that it has a bad case of worms that could have been stopped awhile ago. Reward it once in a while.

, Don't terrorize it by tugging on its leash, slapping him/her as a punishment, etc. But make sure you don't let it get away with everything. Remember: You're in charge, not Fido.

, They can't necessarily understand you verbally. So don't rant off to them. They'll just see you as a crazy foreign master who likes to talk to himself a lot.

Create a safe space for your pet.",How to Be Friends with Your Pet," This one is pretty self-explanatory. Breathe regularly, make your movements smooth and slow (though not so slow that they look abnormal, as this will also freak some animals out), and speak in a calm, normal voice. Avoid being loud.


Just think how you would feel if someone seemed to be nervous around you, was fidgeting a lot and speaking loudly and nervously, and making quick, jerky movements. This would make most people feel at least a little nervous — it’s the same for animals.
Try to always be calm when dealing with your pets, no matter what they’ve done. If you’re very upset at them, take a moment to calm yourself down before dealing with them. You want them to respect you, not fear you.;
, Realize that it could take some time to build a lasting bond with your pet. Some animals, like puppies and kittens, might naturally be more easy around you than smaller mammals and reptiles, who might be more prone to defensive behaviour.


If your pet doesn’t warm up to you right away, give it time. With consistent, kind, respectful behaviour, you should be able to win it over.

, Be consistent in everything you do, from feeding to training, and everything in between. Pets are like children in that they need consistency and structure in order to feel safe and secure.


When they know what they can expect from you, your pets are more likely to feel comfortable around you (unless what they can expect from you is unpredictable, aggressive behaviour … which they won’t like).

, Set rules and boundaries, and stick to them. Set aside time to practise these rules and boundaries with your pet each day. If your pet breaks a rule, use body language and calm but firm words to let them know that what they have done is not okay. Once you’ve established that you’re the boss, it’s okay to be more soft and loving with them, while still consistently enforcing the rules.


With dogs they call this being the “alpha dog.” Dogs are happiest when they have confidence that you are their leader and can make decisions for them. They can then have freedom off lead and with people, other animals and in strange situations because they look to you for guidance and you pass on confidence. It’s okay for you to feel that you are “friends” with your dog, but your dog needs to know that you are his leader.
Cats can be less easy to control, as they often like being the alpha. If your cat bullies you (often attacking you or ignoring your rules), a good way to train it is to simply ignore it when it does bad things, and praise it when it does things that you approve of. Cats might not like being controlled, but they like being ignored even less.
Food is a good way to establish that you’re the boss. Most animals will notice that you’re the one that feeds them every day, which will make them look forward to seeing you. If you give them treats when they do something good, they’ll want to make you happy.

, If your pet does something you disapprove of, calmly and firmly let them know it’s not okay without physically hurting them or screaming at them. Hurting them will make them more likely to attack you, not obey you.

, Body language is vastly different depending on what sort of animal you have chosen for your pet. If you’re unsure of your pet’s body language, consider buying a book or reading some websites devoted to your specific animal. Understanding your pet’s body language will help you to be a better communicator, as you can even mimic some of their stances, expressions and sounds to send your message in a way they understand.


When dogs feel stressed out or threatened, their eyes will look larger than normal. If your dog is not feeling well, it might look as though it’s squinting. If your dog isn’t looking directly at you, but is looking out of the corners of its eyes so that you see a lot of the whites of the eyes (this is called “whale eyes”), he might be about to have an aggressive outburst. If your dog is feeling stressed or aggressive, its wide eyes will be accompanied by a rigid body.If your cat looks at you and blinks at you slowly, it’s likely communicating affection. You can do this back at your cat to show your love, too. For cats, closing one’s eyes in the presence of another is a way to show trust. If your cat feels threatened, its tail will likely be upright and poofy (looking like the end of a toilet brush); its back will likely be arched, too.Birds can be quite expressive through their eyes, feathers, and voices. If your bird’s pupils enlarge and shrink rapidly, this can be a sign that they’re excited or greatly interested, or scared or angry — context is important in telling which emotion it might be. Birds will ruffle their feathers while cleaning themselves; if their feathers remain ruffled, however, this could mean they’re unwell (in which case, take them to a vet for a checkup)., Animal experts give us general guidelines about what to expect from animals, but as with people, most animals will have their own quirks. It’s important that you respect your pet’s individuality; don’t try to make it do things that it clearly doesn’t like. Note that this isn’t the same as letting your pet run your house or bully you. You still need to consistently stand by your rules and boundaries.


Dogs are generally known to be affectionate and to want to be close to their owners at all times. Some dogs, though (and Shiba Inus are known for this), prefer not to be petted or cuddled. If your dog seems to dislike being petted, don’t force it. Maybe it likes to have an hour of alone time in another room of the house each night. As long as it’s not chewing on your furniture or digging a hole in the carpet, let it have its alone time.
It’s not a bad idea to think of cats as weird roommates instead of animals. One minute your cat might be all over you and very affectionate, and within seconds it might jump off of you and run away, not to be seen for several hours. As long as it isn’t hurting you or your home, accept the quirk and let it be its own “person.”

, Be empathetic when dealing with your pet. You don’t know what’s going on in its mind, so it’s best to try to read its body language and try to imagine what it must be going through so that you can treat it as well as possible.


A rescue dog may have been abused by its previous owner. It may have spent most of its life before meeting you living on the streets, starving and scared. There is a lot of evidence (countless rescue stories and videos online) that proves these dogs, who may lash out at first, come around to love and trust their humans, and vice versa. If your dog is behaving in ways that you dislike, calmly, gently, and consistently reinforce the rules, and they will come around.
If your pet is a small mammal (rat, gerbil, guinea pig, rabbit), don’t swoop down on them suddenly and pick them up, and then be surprised when they seem terrified. These are animals who are commonly preyed upon from above, so if you want to gain their trust and affection, it’s best not to behave like a predator.

,


This is may be easier to do with a cat or dog, as they both play in ways that are more familiar to human beings: throwing a ball around, chasing one another (playing tag), running and jumping.
Some snakes enjoy climbing. If you want to feel more of a bond with your pet snake, and you feel safe letting it out of its enclosure, consider getting it a large climbing post and allowing it to do that as you work out. That way, you can feel as though you’re being active together. If you do this regularly, it can begin to feel like a routine.
You can buy play gyms for birds. Put your bird on its play gym on your floor or table in the room with you while you work, read, exercise or watch TV, and allow the bird to play.

, Take your dog on a hike somewhere it’s never been; go for a walk with your iguana or snake on your shoulder or arm (if it’s social); bring home a new toy and play with your cat. Animals get bored too; introducing fun new things into their lives now and then will make them happy. Just be smart about what you introduce: most cats wouldn’t enjoy going to a dog park, for example.

, Many different animals enjoy learning tricks to earn rewards such as food or toys. Teach your dog or cat some new tricks, or sing a song and dance with your bird (it will likely learn to bob along with you if you bounce up and down in front of it). Set up an obstacle course for your pet rat and reward it for completing the course.

, Literally just be in the same room with them. Let them be near you while you make dinner, watch TV, or read a book. The more you’re around one another, the better chances you have of becoming friends.


Many snake owners say that their snakes enjoy wrapping around their arms or necks while they sit on the couch or go for walks (or even drive). Of course, if you’re not sure whether your snake is cuddling you or trying to strangle you, it’s probably better not to wear it around your neck.

, If your pet is receptive to physical affection, provide it. Cuddle up on the couch with your cat, dog, reptile, bird, etc.

, Sure, they probably won’t understand most of what you say, but if you’re talking to them in a calm and positive way, it will help them get used to your presence and your voice. When you come home, be sure to say hello to your pet. This will help it associate you coming in the door with saying “hello.”

, How long your pet can go without you will depend on the animal. Cats and reptiles can go longer without their humans than dogs can, for example.


If you know you’ll be away for 24 hours and you have a dog at home, arrange for someone to come and stay with your dog while you're gone. If you have a cat, it’s probably enough to leave some extra food and water out and, if your cat is particularly anxious, you might have someone the cat knows come in and spend an hour or two with them.
If you are going away on vacation and cannot bring your pet, ensure that you find them appropriate and reputable care before you go.
If you are regularly away from home for more than 5 hours a day, you might consider dropping your dog off at doggy daycare or seeing if you can bring him/her to work with you.

, A pet is only part of your life, but for them, you are their whole life. That’s why it’s important to acknowledge your pet when you’re in the same room. Don’t ignore them. Act happy to see them. How you show your pleasure in seeing them will depend on what type of pet it is.


A dog will generally enjoy a happy “Hello” and a pat when you walk past it.
A cat might only want a hello, or it might want you to bend down and give it a little pat too.
A guinea pig might squeak happily when you come near. If it enjoys being petted, say “Hello” and give it a little pet.
A reptile that likes to be touched will be happy for the attention; but one that does not like to be touched, might not really care what you do … still, if you want to build a friendship with this animal, you’ll want to give it some sort of attention, even if it’s just walking up to its enclosure and saying “Hello.”

, Animals are living, long-term responsibilities; it is imperative that you ensure you can afford to feed and care for them. Make a monthly budget that includes food, supplies, and regular vet visits, and add a contingency fund for possible vet visits should your animal become ill. You might also consider buying pet insurance.


Some things a dog needs: food, poop bags (if you live somewhere that requires you to pick up its waste), treats, a kennel, a good-quality leash and halter, a collar, an ID tag, a license (depending on where you live, you will likely need to license your dog with the city), toys, food and water bowls, and possibly a raincoat and booties (depending on the dog and where you live).
Things cats need: litter boxes, litter, toys, food, food and water bowls, beds, carrying cases should they need to go to the vet, scratch posts, and treats.
Things small mammals need: cages, cage filler, things to keep them busy in those cages (a wheel, some tubes and other toys), food and water supplies, and possibly a salt lick.

, Do this every day, at consistent times throughout the day (eg., morning and night). The key with all animals is to be consistent, as a lack of order in their lives can make them feel insecure and anxious, if not afraid.


How often you feed your pets will depend upon what sort of animal they are: cats and dogs need to be fed at least twice a day; young and small adult lizards need to be fed several times a day, while other lizards and snakes only need to eat every other day or so.

, Find out what the best-quality food for your type of animal is, and buy it. For cats and dogs, seek out foods that contain healthy, natural ingredients and as few preservatives as possible; for reptiles you’ll likely feed them whole foods such as plants, fish, or mice (depending on whether your pet is an omnivorous or carnivorous reptile).Generally you can find a good selection of high-quality food at your local pet store or vet. If you have any doubts about the best diet for your pet, read up on the species or ask your vet.

, Clean your dog’s kennel, your cat’s litter box, your rabbit’s cage, your snake’s enclosure etc. regularly. Avoid cleaning these spaces with harsh chemicals, as they can irritate your pet’s skin (or worse).


It’s also important to keep your house — particularly your floors — clean. Don’t leave dangerous things lying around your house that might hurt your pet. Things like chocolate and grapes on the floor can be fatal for your dog; wires might be enticing for chewing, and could electrocute your pet.

, Many pets groom themselves, but sometimes they might need some help. Dogs and cats can benefit from being brushed out regularly, particularly if they have long fur that’s prone to matting. If you have an outdoor pet and ticks are common in your area, regularly check for ticks and remove them.


While it’s common to bathe a dog, bathing a cat isn’t actually necessary; in fact, it can do more harm than good, as it removes the natural oils on your cat’s coat. If your cat is particularly filthy or seems to be having trouble reaching certain parts of its body, it’s okay to help it along with a bath.
If you do bathe your pet, ensure that you use something that is designed specifically for that animal. Never use human shampoo and conditioner for your dog or cat, or any other animal, as it can irritate their skin.

, Animals are quite good at hiding their illnesses; appearing healthy helps them survive in the wild, as sick animals are targets for predators. In addition, animals communicate differently than we do: instead of saying “I’m sick” your cat might stop eating, or it might start going to the bathroom outside of its litter box.For these reasons, it’s best practice to schedule regular checkups for your pet at least once per year, even if it seems totally healthy.


Your pet will benefit from regular checkups more often than once a year as it moves into its senior years. Aim for at least twice a year when your pet is a senior.

, Exactly how and how often you socialize your pet will depend upon what animal you have.


Dogs can be socialized every day with both people and other dogs; for a healthy dog, the opportunity to play with dog friends should be a source of happiness and relaxation. If your dog has anxiety about other dogs, however, you’ll need to be more careful about how you socialize him/her.
Cats are more likely to enjoy being socialized with people than other cats, as they can be quite territorial. That said, if your cat seems to enjoy the company of other cats, there’s not reason not to have kitty dates with friends. Generally this will apply more to indoor cats than outdoor ones.
Some small mammals and birds can benefit from the company of a friend — particularly if you’re away from home a lot.

, How often your pet needs exercise, and what sort of exercise it needs, will depend on the animal. There will even be variations within the same animals, depending on their type, general fitness, and age. If your pet doesn’t get enough exercise, it will be more likely to misbehave or be aggressive.


Walk and play with your dog every day. How long and strenuous your exercise with your dog is will depend on the breed: a husky will need much more exercise than a pug.
Play with your cat every day. Cats are generally quite active and good at making their own fun, but if you want to bond with your cat, you’ll need to become part of their daily activities. Pull a string around the house and let them chase it, or wave a peacock feather around and let them try to catch it.

, Your pet can go to its safe place when it feels scared or upset. Do not send your pet to this space when you’re upset with it, as doing so will make it a place of punishment rather than a safe place where your pet can go relax.


For a dog, a safe space could be a large kennel with some warm blankets and a toy inside, or a nice dog bed in the corner of the room.
For a cat, this might be a bed at the top of a scratch post, or a little covered soft cat house.
For a fish, a reptile, or a small mammal, this might be a tunnel-like or otherwise enclosed structure into which they can run and hide if they feel afraid.

Consider whether the problem is something you can deal with yourself or is something in need of professional attention.,

Decide which help is likely to be the most useful.,
Get a third and fourth opinion for any major diagnosis.,
Research your medical situation.,
Ask your doctor questions.,
Get a doctor you can confide in without judgment or poor reactions.",How to Be More Aware of Your Health," Whatever health issues you might currently have, it's important to acknowledge them. This might include that you're overweight, your head hurts, you have stomachache, your back hurts all the time, and so forth. Acknowledgement of what needs attending to is an important start.


Don't neglect mental health––it's as vital as bodily health and the two are intricately connected. Depression, anxiety, phobias, stress, and so forth, each have impacts on your daily functioning and the physical health of your body too.;
, It's always sending you signals. If it doesn't ""feel right"" then it's time to re-evaluate your options. Trust your internal voice.

, Through research, keeping notes on your own feelings and experiences, reading journals and books, and talking to different health professionals, you will begin to build up a bigger picture of your health issues and potentially find answers here and there that help you to properly address what's making you unhealthy.


For example, you may have a bad neck ache all the time. You may find it's a mild but annoying enough pain after sitting at the computer all day, only to get very painful when you try to relax or when you catch a virus. In this case, there are layers of issues, and it may be the lack of ergonomic seating and adequate breaks, coupled with workload stress and it only really gets painful when your body has to fight off a virus and cannot mask the real pain of the neck ache at the same time. Each issue needs to be addressed singly to add up to the whole.

, Do you need help or can you solve this yourself?

, If you feel you can solve the issue yourself, then ask what is the root cause of your problem. Could your stomach pain be related to too many crunches first thing in the morning, the acidic juice you just drank, a physical pain which needs to be discussed with your GP or is there a psychological or emotional matter being dealt with which is manifesting itself in your body?


Learning to address your internal issues is as much about good health as is eating the right diet.
Find ways to answer simple health problems at home through doing research in reputable books and websites.

, If you need help, decide on your first port of call. A doctor is always a good starting point if you feel you need help but in some cases, you may prefer to go to a specialist, such as a dietician, a dentist or an ear, nose and throat specialist. The choice will depend on the problem and whether or not you've accurately pinpointed it. In some cases, it may be best to see the doctor first, explain your concerns and confirm who the right person to see is.


Check that the doctor or health professional you'd like to use is covered adequately by your insurance or that you can afford their services.

, For example, your doctor tells you that you have cancer. Confirm with another physician.

, The internet is packed with information. Go to discussion groups about your medical issue. Go to websites. Print out journals. Dig deep. Why be in the dark about what's happening with your body? This is your life! Moreover, this isn't about self-care at home, it's about self-awareness that you can then bring to the attention of your health professionals caring for you––they're busy people and don't have the time to do deep internet research but you probably do. Print the items off and take them in to your doctor and others.

, This is why you pay the doctor. If he or she is worth anything, he or she will be happy to answer your questions and give you ways to find out more information.


Some doctors use a sliding-scale fee system. They will charge more if you ask more questions. Find out the cost before your consultation.

, If your doctor gets offended or displays a overly-negative reaction towards your questions, find another doctor. You need a doctor in whom you can place your confidence.

As it is rightly said ""Early to bed, early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise"", so make sure you go to sleep earlier or if there is any problem that you don't keep a perfect time for sleep, then you can use an alarm reminder (cell). No worries. Usually, it requires about 8-9 hours of sleep for an adult and 9-10 hours for all children mostly teenagers and below that level. The benefit of sleeping matters to a much extent in terms of your brain prototyping as it removes all that intoxicated toxins which distracts you, which may obstruct your happiness and perhaps prepares you to be a positive thinker, to start the day better than the previous day. Always be sure to settle down and relax an hour before you go to bed because it will help you drift off more easily; read a book, watch TV (preferably not something violent, aggressive, or even the news) but avoid doing things like homework or anything too stressful that requires you to think, especially if you are a parent or have an elderly relative you need to take care of or a very stressful job.;
, Avoid junk foods and prefer eating fruits and green leafy vegetables every day. This will leave you feeling generally more energetic and happy. Replace unhealthy snacks like a chocolate bar containing lots of calories, boasted with a piece of fruit or perhaps some nuts but do make sure to treat yourself once in a while which is okay. Also avoid too many processed foods altogether..Prefer eating apples, watermelons, papaya, grapes etc. the fruits which contain ultimate source of water. These fruits act as an enriched source for growing immune system, skin clarity/glow, and enhances your eye-vision, as opposed to your ear-hearing.

, Water is good for everything in your body, the benefits of water are too great to list them all but it's never ending. Water helps to give you clear skin which leaves you feeling happier about your appearance as well! Water is just simply an amazing source in itself for your overall health. So make sure to have it with you at all times whenever you are at work or at studies, or even during exercise sessions. So try to drink 8 glasses a day. Also if you do not really like the taste of water, try flavored or sparkling and maybe add some lemon slices; and of course you can always have Robinson's squash or anything like that.

, Whether it's a brisk walk, a quick jog, martial arts, cardiovascular exercises, aerobics, dancing in your room, playing Wii Fit, anything like that will keep you feeling strong, happy and increase immunity of course, even if you are HIV positive or have a weakened immune system, probably. Obviously you don't have to exercise daily because, lets face it, we don't always have the time, unless you are an athlete, gym instructor etc, but try to fit it in a little and there will surely be the major difference in yourself. You will notice that your immunity system has a certain big hand in bringing such a change.

, By this is meant, buying those shoes you always wanted, purchasing some inspirational books from the book store in which there is a great desire in you to love to read (genres depending on) like technologies, health, discovering strengths, developing leadership skills, fiction, novels, thriller stories and many more like that. You can also go to a park, a garden, or any place where you think you can spend some time thinking alone.

, Bond with true friends and compliment them and appreciate them. Always show them how much you love them and treat them how you would like to be treated.

, Don't get sad over small issues or take any joke seriously which hurts you. Instead if you feel so hurt, prefer to stay away from that friend, but don't show him that you don't like him/her.

Not only will you realize these people aren't worth it but it will keep you out of a lot of trouble at school or work and in general. If there is the most irritating rumor or rumors about you going round for maybe a year and it's just gone too far, just take a deep breath and think about the fact you know it's not true and that is all that matters; this is the most powerful thing. Ignore and avoid anybody who thinks otherwise because they are just trying to wind you up. Bad people - this can even be a whole bunch of boys and girls. Just ignore them and avoid them, don't associate with them, don't embarrass yourself around them and generally steer clear of these people and you will be happier and more relaxed in life.

, Remember popularity isn't everything and you would much rather choose true friends over that. Remember, sometimes you have to let a friend go and make another one. Remember that words can hurt.

, This keeps you healthy, definitely happy and keep you with light mind, especially during stressful times such as being made redundant, divorce, a family death etc. It was rightly and truly said by the world' renowned martial arts legend ""Bruce Lee"", that more you comfort yourself and if you are doing things in a relaxed position, then your mind will be more powerful and you may be accomplishing big tasks in small time"".

Read and write, keep a diary, listen to music to calm you down, sit on your windowsill and look at the beautiful sky.

, Give yourself a makeover, inside and out. Look in the mirror and see your beauty. Use a day and night wash to get rid of acne. Moisturize and replenish your body. Smile and embrace happiness. Know that we all come in different shapes and sizes and it's the inside as well as the outside. Wear that great perfume or aftershave. Strut your stuff. Stand up straight and keep your head held high. Learn to be confident and who you are because nobody's perfect. You are amazing!

, Failure comes in can't and success comes in cans. Always believe you can achieve. If you can dream it, you can achieve it; no matter what. Of course keep goals and dreams realistic. You can't become the Hulk or something but you can get As in all of your exams, if you work for it. Organization plays a very important role in achieving goals, so organize yourself.

, Get homework over and done with and hand it in on time. Revise for that test, get that promotion. Keep things neat and tidy. Have a workspace and a timetable. Store work in folders and make sure you know where everything is so you don't panic, and whatever you do, don't procrastinate. We have all been there but don't go there again.

, Go out with friends, go to a party, get together with the family, go on a bike ride, take a walk with your pet, and enjoy!

, Never change yourself for anyone and anything. Always stay true to your faith and beliefs. Always have your dignity, never have regrets, always be the best that you can be! Also surround yourself with the people and things that you love.

, It's unbelievable how much this can affect you and change your whole life. So get inspired and love it.

, It doesn't do anyone any favors. Better to be hated than loved for what you're not.

, You have to love your life! Be proud, and laugh lots! Dream and wish, be whoever you want to be. Take life and make it what you want. When life gives you lemons squirt life in the eye with the lemons! Explore, dream, discover. Be smart enough to hold on to and be brave enough to let go. Find and create yourself. Take risks. Reject the status quo. Stick up for yourself. Take chances, you never know where they can lead you to. Life goes on. Follow your gut. Love yourself. If you are doing your best, you won't have time to worry about failure. Don't give up. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Life is music, love are the lyrics. Stay strong. Failure is the door to success. You must make a choice to take a chance or your life will never change. You don't forgive people because your weak, you forgive people because you are strong enough to know people make mistakes. When you want something you have never had, you have to do something you have never done. And lastly, you are beautiful!

Get over your nervousness.,
Request a nurse be present.,
Don't be embarrassed about disrobing.,
Go to the bathroom before the exam.,
Keep yourself warm.,
Rub or pinch your skin while being examined.,
Ask your doctor to communicate their intentions clearly.,
Request that your doctor take their time.,
Ask your doctor to keep their hands warm and dry.,
Place your hands underneath the doctor's while palpating.",How to Be Less Ticklish During Medical Exams," Being ticklish is determined by your brain, not your skin's touch receptors, and nervousness is a significant factor in triggering your brain to think that a person's touch is ticklish.As such, try to control your nervousness before a medical exam. Convince yourself that medical exams are not painful and they will help the doctor find your problem and make you feel better.


Deep breathing, meditation, positive visualizing and listening to calming music within an hour of a medical exam can help reduce your nervousness and anxiety.
Caffeine can make people more jittery and cause their minds to race, which tends to make nervousness worse. As such, refrain from drinking coffee, black tea, colas and energy drinks at least 6 hours before medical exams.;
, In addition to nervousness, feeling uncomfortable being confined with your doctor in a small exam room can also make your muscles tense and more susceptible to being ticklish.Request that a third person be present in the room during your medical exam, such as a nurse or assistant of some sort.


Having a third person of the same gender in the exam room with you can greatly ease your issues with having to wear a gown and expose some of your body.
This strategy might be particularly important if you have a history of sexual abuse or trauma.
If a nurse or assistant is the same gender as you, it can help diffuse any sexual tension that may exist between the doctor and you.

, In addition to potentially making patients shiver, examination gowns also make some patients embarrassed or feel vulnerable about exposing too much of their body. Like nervousness and anxiety, embarrassment and vulnerability can increase a person's level of ticklishness.Either come to terms with your embarrassment or ask if there's any way not to wear a gown or robe for the exam — not all exams require gowning.


Make sure to choose a larger-sized gown in order to cover as much of your body as possible to reduce your embarrassment.
Some people prefer to cover their faces during exams to reduce their embarrassment, but then they won't be able to anticipate the doctor's touch, which can reduce ticklishness.

, One of the symptoms of a full bladder (and bowels) is lower abdominal pressure and tightness, which can feel uncomfortable or ticklish if touched, palpated or probed by a doctor during a medical exam.Having to go to the bathroom urgently can also make you very anxious or nervous, which can heighten ticklishness. Therefore, empty your bladder (and bowels) before heading to your scheduled medical exam.


Avoiding caffeine, a diuretic that triggers frequent urination, for a few hours prior to the exam is also beneficial in this regard.
Going to the bathroom prior to a gynecological exam is especially important because the bladder and urethra may be pressed upon directly.

, Being too cold causes shivering, which is your body's method of warming itself up.However, while you're chilly and shivering, your muscles are either contracting or at least under more tension, which can trigger ticklishness when touched, poked or prodded more easily. Thus, dress appropriately for your medical exam and plan for the office being a little too cool.


If the office is exceptionally cool, ask the doctor or nurse if the temperature can be turned up for your exam.
If you have to wear an examination gown or robe, ask the doctor what you can leave on to remain warm — such as your socks, underwear, undershirt, etc.

, While your doctor is palpating various parts of your body to figure out what's wrong with you, distract your brain a little by rubbing or lightly pinching another part of your body, such as your hand. Distracting your brain by giving it different sensations to process is an effective tool to help reduce pain, sensitivities and even ticklishness.While your brain is focused on processing the rubbing or pinching sensation that you're creating, it will have trouble registering the doctor's touch (palpation) as ticklish.
Even just rubbing your fingers together might be helpful, or scratching the side of your leg. Apply enough pressure to your skin that it's not lightly ticklish, but not too much to cause pain.

, Probably the most important thing a doctor can do to reduce ticklishness in patients during physical exams is clearly communicating their intentions before they do anything.Tell your doctor about your self-perceived level of ticklishness before getting touched. Ask if they use lighter or deeper palpation (touches) while conducting exams so you can prepare yourself for it.


Ask your doctor to tell you where and when they're going to touch you before they do. Removing anticipation often eliminates ticklishness.
Ask your doctor to be particularly careful of your highly ticklish areas, such as your underarms, lower abdomen, groin and/or feet.
Always maintain professionalism in order to prevent any sexual or flirtatious undertones, which can cause nervousness / anxiety / arousal and trigger ticklishness.

, Although most doctors are busy and don't always have the luxury of taking lots of time for physical exams, it's helpful for making patients feel more comfortable and potentially less ticklish. An unrushed purposeful touch is usually better received than a hurried and clumsy touch. It's also best for your doctor to start your medical exam by feeling less sensitive areas and then concluding with the more sensitive spots.The back (spine) is typically one of the least ticklish areas for touching, examining, massaging, etc, whereas the abdomen and feet are often the most sensitive.
With thoughtful and purposeful sequencing during a physical exam, your doctor can make it easier for you to develop a level of comfort and confidence before having to endure being touched in your more sensitive body parts.
A ticklish / jumpy patient can waste a lot of valuable time, so your doctor shouldn't mind spending a little more time initially making you feel more comfortable in order to save time in the long run.

, Another cause of ticklish and jumpy behavior in patients is being touched by cold or wet hands. As such, it's important that doctors keep their hands warm and dry during physical exams, regardless of the time of year or temperature inside the clinic. They can rub their hands together or blow on them to warm them up prior to touching you. Clapping them together a few times or shaking them for a few seconds can also improve circulation.


Using hand sanitizer is great for cleaning hands prior to touching patients, but make sure your doctor's hands are dry before starting the exam.
Chronic smoking and caffeine consumption often leads to poor circulation to the hands, which tends to make them feel cold., An effective technique to use on ticklish or hypersensitive patients is called the ""hand sandwich,"" which involves placing the doctors hand over top of your hands while they're palpating sensitive parts of your body.In effect, the doctor is feeling your body through your hands or fingertips. This is most effective for palpating / percussing your abdominal organs, but not really appropriate for finer work such as feeling your skin.


This technique seems to work because people can predict the movements of the doctor's hand as they apply pressure to the skin, which makes them feel like they are in control more.
Because it's not possible for people to tickle themselves (the brain doesn't allow it), the ""hand sandwich"" technique fools your brain into thinking the pressure is coming from your own hand, thus reducing your ticklishness."

Make an appointment with your doctor.,
Set goals for yourself.,
Write down realistic lifestyle changes.,
Assign a timeline for your lifestyle changes.,
Find support.",How to Be Healthier Without a Dramatic Lifestyle Change1," If you feel there are some small changes that you need or want to make in your life to be healthier, it wouldn't hurt to see your doctor prior to making any changes.


They can review your medical history, weight and let you know what changes might be the most beneficial to you.;
, Small goals are often the most appealing as they are the easiest to reach. If your goals are too high and you are unable to reach them in a timely manner, you may become discouraged. Set small goals that ultimately lead up to your larger goal. It will help provide you with the motivation to make and keep lifestyle changes.


When setting your goals make sure they are realistic, timely, and specific. These qualities make goals that are easier to meet in the long-term. For example, instead of a goal of ""I want to boost my endurance,"" make your goal ""I want to be able to swim five laps in my pool without needing to stop.""
Also consider whether you need smaller goals to meet a larger, more long-term goal. For example, if you want to run five miles, you might make a goal to run a 5k (which is 3.1 miles) as an intermediary goal.

, Remember that too many lifestyle changes at once is a recipe for failure. It is important that you only try to implement so many changes at once. Think about what lifestyle changes you need to make in order to achieve your goals. If you don't think you'll be willing to make the lifestyle changes needed to meet your goal, revisit your goals and change them as needed.


Lifestyle changes are small changes in behavior that may result in improved health or well-being. Studies show that small lifestyle changes over long periods of time are more sustainable.Examples of lifestyle changes include: replacing desserts with fruit or taking the stairs instead of the elevator.
The lifestyle changes you want to make may also help you make, change, or come up with additional goals. For example, you might want to eat healthier. A goal could be to eat a fruit or vegetable every day.

, Even with small lifestyle changes, trying to accomplish multiple items at one time can be difficult and hard to keep up with.Assigning your lifestyle changes to an ordered timeline can help you be more successful. Try to note which changes you'll make first, second, third, etc.


After you've come up with your goals and the lifestyle changes to help you meet them, assign an order to your list. For example: Week 1: Give up soda; Week 2: Take the stairs instead of the elevator; Week 3: Go to bed earlier.
Continuously reevaluate your progress. If you notice one lifestyle change in particular is giving you trouble, rework your timeline to account for that. Give yourself time to make these changes a habit. Again, if you try to work on multiple items at one time, you may be less successful.

, It is much easier to stick to a plan when others know you're doing it. Get a support system and lean on them when necessary. Telling family, friends or coworkers about your new lifestyle changes may help keep you motivated.It's also helpful to surround yourself with people who are also on the same path as you making small lifestyle changes to help improve their health. You can bounce ideas off each other or work on similar goals at the same time.

Drink more water.,
Drink water before a meal.,
Eat a fruit and vegetable every day.,
Choose whole grains most of the time.,
Eat healthy snacks.,
Pack your lunch.",How to Be Healthier Without a Dramatic Lifestyle Change2," A common goal to improve your overall health is to ditch the sugary drinks and increase water intake. This is a great goal as water is essential to your hydration and health.Increasing water consumption is a virtually free and painless way to instantly make a positive change for yourself.


Your long-term goal should be to drink about 64 oz or 2 L of clear, sugar-free fluids every day.Ditch sweetened beverages. Drinking more water is great, but skipping the sweetened beverages will help reduce your overall calorie intake and promote weight loss.If you're not drinking a lot of water now, start slowly. Add in one glass or one bottle of water every day. Or, swap out one soda or one energy drink for an equivalent amount of water. Slowly increase the amount of water you drink and decrease a number of sweetened beverages you drink.
Don't drink your fruits. Give up drinking fruit juice and get all those wonderful nutrients from real, whole fruit. You'll get the added benefit of having the fiber from the fruit in addition to missing out on the liquid calories of fruit juice.

, While you are increasing the amount of water you drink, you can also be strategic about when you drink it. Drinking a big glass of water (about eight oz) right before a meal or snack can help decrease your overall portion size and how many calories you consume.Try to make it a habit to drink water right before you eat. When you're stomach is more full on water, it can help decrease your hunger. This may lead to or help support your weight loss.
You can also consume other no-calorie beverages including: sugar-free, flavored waters, coffee, tea, no-calorie sports drinks, and even low sodium broth.

, Eating enough fruits and vegetables is key for a healthy lifestyle and diet since these foods are essential sources of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. However, eating the recommended seven to nine servings of fruits and vegetables everyday may be daunting or difficult.If you're not a big fruit or vegetable eater, make a list of your top five favorite fruits and vegetables. Start by adding in just one serving of fruit or vegetables a day. As you get comfortable with this goal, add two servings a day.
If you dislike a variety of fruits and vegetables, go to the grocery and pick out something new or unfamiliar to you. Or try an item that you haven't had in a while.
Keep fresh fruit on the counter and vegetables cut, washed, and ready to eat in the fridge. The less preparation needed, the more likely you'll include them in your diet.
If you enjoy a sweet after dinner, try having fruit with your dessert.

, Whole grains are minimally processed grains that are higher in fiber, protein, and other nutrients compared to refined grains (like white bread or plain pasta).They also have a more nutty flavor and chewy texture which may not be enjoyable by all people.


If you typically eat mostly refined grains, start with making about half of your grain choices whole grains. As you get more comfortable with this goal, you can work up to making most or all of your grain choices whole grains.
Whole grain foods to try include: 100% whole wheat pasta, oatmeal, quinoa, brown rice or 100% whole wheat bread.
Try a variety of whole grains and a variety of brands of whole grains. For example, try 100% whole wheat pasta. If you don't like it, try another brand of 100% whole wheat pasta as each brand has a slightly different flavor.

, Making lifestyle changes to be healthier doesn't mean you can't enjoy a snack. In fact, having a snack can help manage and control hunger and support weight loss.Healthy snacks should contain some lean protein and a fruit or a vegetable. However, start slowly changing your snacks for a lasting change. For example, if you normally have a small bag of chips in the afternoon try swapping to a small bag of whole grain chips with salsa.

, Studies show that packing your lunch can help cut down on your overall calorie intake (and food costs).Brown-bagging your lunch will give you more control over what foods you eat and how they're prepared.


If you typically eat lunch out everyday, start by packing your lunch just one to two days a week.
Also pack an afternoon snack if you typically stop by the vending machine to grab an afternoon pick-me-up.

Walk more throughout the day.,
Add in planned cardio.,
Add in some resistance training.,
Look for social, fun exercise opportunities.,
Move while you watch TV.",How to Be Healthier Without a Dramatic Lifestyle Change3," Finding time to exercise can be difficult, especially with busy schedules or long commutes. Start adding in physical activity by increasing how many steps or how much you walk during the day.


Increasing physical activity is a great change to make to help improve your overall health. Exercise has been shown to help improve mood, increase energy, and decrease your risk of heart disease and high blood pressure.Even without planned exercise each day, adding extra steps can be beneficial to your health. Try: taking the stairs instead of the elevator, parking father away, delivering messages in person instead of email at work, walking while you talk on the phone, or take a walk on your lunch break.
You can also consider purchasing a pedometer to help see how many steps you take and monitor your progress of increasing your total steps.
Try the ""one mile rule."" This means that you can walk to the store, school, work or other locations if they are less than one mile away (and it's a safe walk). Skip taking the bus or driving!

, Additional exercise outside of lifestyle activity (like taking the stairs), greatly adds to the health benefits provided by exercise. Plan cardio so that you're getting targeted exercise that benefits your heart and overall health. You'll see additional improvements in weight, mood and overall health.The USDA states that you should aim for 150 minutes or about 2 1/2 hours of moderate-intensity physical activity each week.Moderate intensity activity is any exercise that increases your heart rate and makes you breathe harder and work up a slight sweat.
If this recommendation is too much, start with half of that amount. Or break up that time in small bits. For example, a brisk 10-minute walk at breakfast, lunch and dinner five days a week meets your 150-minute goal.
Also, if you cannot do moderate intensity at first, do 150 minutes of lower intensity exercises. For example, walking counts as a lower intensity exercise. Any activity is better than none.

, Not all strength training exercises require you to spend time at the gym. There are plenty of easy to do exercises at home that require little to no equipment.


It's recommended to include 20 minutes of strength training two days a week. Including strength training helps build lean muscle mass which can increase your metabolism and how many calories your body burns at rest.Easy, no equipment required exercises include: lunges, push-ups, sit-ups, squats, or wall sits.

, Go to the pool with your little brother, take a walk with your best friend, chase your daughter around the playground, or play backyard sports with your family.

, If you aren't ready for the gym or more intense exercise, try moving while you watch your favorite TV programs. Get up during the commercial breaks and fit in a few minutes of activity.


Try running or walking in place, or some strength training exercises. Since commercial breaks are about two minutes, you can burn about 270 calories during two hours of TV time.Sit on an exercise ball in front of your desk or TV.

Ditch your car.,
Make a workout schedule.,
Incorporate strength training.,
Start doing high-intensity interval training (HIIT).,
Work out at home.,
Find a workout buddy.",How to Be Healthier in 14 Days1," This can be tricky depending on where you live, but spending less time in the car and more time on foot will help you lose weight, decrease stress, and elevate mood. If you have the option, walk to work or the grocery store instead of driving. Otherwise, carve out thirty minutes a day to go for a walk.


Call up a friend to go walking with you. This will give you a dose of healthy exercise and social activity.;
, Figure out how much time you have each day to work out. Be realistic in your expectations and make a plan you can stick to.


The recommended amount of exercise for healthy adults is 2 1/2 hours (150 minutes) each week of moderate aerobic activity and strength training two or more times weekly. This can be broken up to fit your lifestyle.If you can, try committing to doing cardio 30 minutes five days a week, which meets the recommend 150 minutes. Or maybe a one-hour cardio class (like Zumba dancing) three times a week works better for your schedule. Or maybe you need to break it up even more, with 20 minutes in the morning before work and another 20 minute walk on your lunch break.
Writing yourself a realistic workout schedule will help you plan workouts that can be accomplished within your timeframe and make you more likely to accomplish your goals., Building strength creates lean muscle mass and makes you look and feel healthy and toned. The best way to strength train efficiently is through compound movements (movements that work more than one muscle group) such as squats, deadlifts, and bench press.


Talk to a trainer or knowledgable friend to learn how to safely execute compound movements with weight.
You can also use hand held weights to focus in on specific areas of the arms. When using hand held weights or doing bodyweight exercises, aim for 10 – 15 reps, three times each.

, When it comes to losing weight and getting in shape, doing cardio activities for short bursts of time at very high intensity is the best bet. While running a few miles a day or going for a long walk are great activities to support a healthy lifestyle, it’s been proven that the body responds best to being worked at its max for shorter intervals.Keep in mind HIIT is not appropriate for everyone. Talk to your doctor before trying this workout.
Pick a cardio activity that you enjoy. Walking, running, swimming, and elliptical are all good options.
Start with a warmup of about five minutes. Then choose a shorter interval length, such as 30 seconds. Then do 30 seconds of high intensity effort of your chosen activity, followed by a longer period of recovery, such as one to three minutes. Repeat the exercise ten times. For example, if you’re a runner, try all-out sprinting for 30 seconds straight, resting for a minute, and repeating 10 times. Increase time interval as you get in better shape.
Only do this two to three times a week to avoid injury or burnout. Supplement with a few longer, slower paced cardio workouts for distance throughout the week., Working out at home is cheap, time efficient, and effective. Pick up a few pieces of equipment such as push up bars, hand-held weights, fit balls, exercise bands, or kettle bells. Make sure to work each major muscle group through cardio, strength training, and body weight exercises. When planning an at-home workout, give yourself enough time to complete a warm up, cardio or strength routine, and a cool down.
Aim for doing 30 minutes of cardio three times a week and 20 to 30 minutes of strength three times a week, followed by stretching.

, Working out with someone else not only keeps you on track, but makes fitness more fun! Find someone with a similar schedule to yours who will keep you motivated. "

Eat more fruits and vegetables.,
Dump your fridge.,
Eliminate highly processed food and refined sugars.,
Stop mindlessly snacking.",How to Be Healthier in 14 Days2," Eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables is essential to weight loss. It also provides your body with essential nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Eat at least five servings of fruit and vegetables a day, and try to vary up the color as much as you can. Add some fruit and veggies to every meal to get your servings in. Breakfast: add spinach, tomatoes, or mushrooms to your morning eggs in place of cheese. If you eat cereal or oatmeal, add fresh fruit such as a banana, blueberries, or strawberries.
Lunch: Try making a big, filling salad with leafy greens, a lean protein, nuts, dried fruit, and some carrots, peppers, onions, or broccoli. Or, add some greens, tomato, onion, or cucumber to a sandwich or wrap.
Dinner: Instead of canned tomato sauce, sauté up some broccoli, garlic, tomatoes, and peppers in some olive oil and eat with whole wheat pasta., If you’re really going to start taking your health seriously, it’s best to start from scratch. Get rid of all unhealthy foods and staples that you have in your fridge and pantry. This will eliminate any temptation to go back to your old ways. Donate what you can to a local food bank. , Processed foods and sugars are linked to diseases such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease and stroke. They fill you up without actually providing any nutrients. Fill your pantry with natural foods like whole grains (oats, quinoa, whole wheat breads and pastas), fruits and vegetables, legumes, nuts, meat, and protein or probiotic rich dairy products (kefir, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese).Stick to food author Michael Pollan’s rule of thumb: don’t eat anything your great grandmother wouldn’t recognize as food. If you can’t pronounce an ingredient or the product has more than five ingredients, stick to something more natural.Get all-natural sweeteners. For those with a sweet tooth, use honey or agave instead of sugar in your coffee, tea, and baked goods.

, Eating when you’re not hungry is one of the easiest ways to gain unwanted weight. Only snack when you’re hungry, and when you do, try to eat snacks high in protein, as this will keep you feeling full longer.


A piece of whole wheat toast with nut butter, a mozzarella cheese stick, a hard boiled egg, or hummus with veggies are great options for beating the mid afternoon crash."
"
Get enough sleep.,
Practice yoga.,
Start meditating.,
Keep your mind stimulated.,
Make time to socialize.",How to Be Healthier in 14 Days3," Getting seven to nine hours of sleep a night is extremely important to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Getting a good night’s sleep improves your ability to learn, make good decisions, and cope with change. Lack of sleep is also linked to depression, heart disease, and obesity.Everybody requires a different amount of sleep. Some will feel good and rested after six hours, others after 10. Experiment with sleeping a different amount of hours per night and see which quantity makes you feel best.Create a good bedtime ritual. Relax with a book for 30 minutes before bed, or stretch and drink herbal tea. It’s also important to stick to a sleep schedule, even on the weekends, so that your body can stay consistent., Yoga is a great activity for creating strength, flexibility, and mind-body awareness. It strengthens the core, back, arms, and legs, and allows you to focus on simply breathing and being present in your body.Invest in a few classes to learn the proper technique. After, you can either continue classes or practice on your own.

, Meditation helps you to become more connected with yourself and the world around you. It helps you to diminish ego and recognize your thoughts as simply thoughts, patterns that encourage mindfulness, joy, and contentment.


Start slow. Give yourself seven to 10 minutes a morning to sit and concentrate on your breathing., People who are open minded and curious about the world around them tend to have better mental health. Learning leads to creativity and higher self-esteem. Try to learn something new everyday!

Read a book that interests you for at least 15 – 20 minutes a day.
Learn a new language. Learning another language keeps your brain active. It broadens your perspective of the world and opens you up to new travel opportunities. Download the app Duolingo on your smartphone for an easy and accessible language learning tool. , Giving yourself time to spend with loved ones leads to increased happiness. Even if you’re busy at work, taking just 30 minutes a day to grab a meal or talk on the phone with somebody you care about will improve your feelings of connectedness and self-worth."

Show empathy.",How to Be an Encouragement to Someone Who Is Sick or Ill," If your loved one or close friend is sick in the hospital or confined to their home, the most important way to encourage them is by being present. You can help to take their mind off of their illness and to maintain a semblance of normalcy during this hard time.


Think about what you might do on your visit. If your friend likes to play card or board games, you might bring something along. If you have children, you might want to leave them at home, but you could ask them to draw a picture for your friend to help cheer her up.
Be sure to call first and make sure it’s a good time, or schedule your visit in advance. Sometimes illnesses require extra care in planning for visits to schedule them around appointments, timing for medications, naps and early bedtime, and other contingencies.;
, Someone with chronic or terminal illness lives with daily reminders that she is sick. What she needs is reminders that she is still the same person that you love and care about. Treat her the same as you would if she was not sick.Maintain regular contact. A chronic illness can be a true test of a friendship, and for your friendship to withstand the emotional and logistical challenges of the illness you must make a point to prioritize staying in touch. Someone who is undergoing treatment or confined to a hospital or their bed is often ""out of sight, out of mind,"" so be sure that you put a note on your calendar to remember to reach out on a regular basis.
Help her do the things that she normally enjoys. If your friend is living with chronic or terminal illness, its important that she still finds pleasure and joy in life. You can help by offering to take her out for their favorite activities.Don't be afraid to joke around or make plans for the future! This is still the same person that you know and love.

, If your friend has a family or even pets, this illness is probably even more stressful because not only does she have to worry about her own recovery or prognosis, but she has to worry about those who are depending on her. There are practical ways you can help to support her family through this time:


Cook for them. This is a classic, tried-and-true way to support someone who is ill. Whether or not the ill person will be able to partake, cooking a home-cooked meal for her family will ease her burdens by letting her rest easy knowing her children, husband, or other dependents are well taken care of.
Help her plan for their care. If your friend has small children, elderly parents, or others who depend on her, ask how you can be proactive in their care during her illness. For instance, she may need someone to visit and check up on her father, someone to walk the dog, or someone who can take the kids to and from school or pick them up from soccer practice. Sometimes planning for small logistical errands can be difficult for people suffering from illness, but having a trusted friend to help carry the burden can make a difference.
Clean her house. Some people may be uncomfortable with this kind of support, so be sure to ask your friend first; but if your friend is open to it, ask her to let you commit to one day a week (or more, or less, whatever you are capable of offering) that you can come by and take care of chores. You can offer a specific chore that you know you are good at (mowing the lawn, doing the laundry, cleaning the kitchen, grocery shopping) or you can just let her tell you what will be most helpful.
Ask her what she needs, and follow through. People often say ""Let me know if you need help,"" but most people are too timid to ever reach out and take them up on that offer. Instead of making her get in touch with you when she needs something, call her and ask her what she needs. Tell her you're headed to the grocery store and wanted to know if you can pick something up for her, or ask her if there is a night this week that she needs any help around the house. Be specific, and be sincere in your willingness to help. Then follow through and do it- that's the most important part!

, If you can't be present, at least send a token of your affection so that your friend will know she is in your thoughts.


Keep in mind if the illness might make your friend more susceptible to strong scents (some cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, for instance, may not like a bouquet) and instead think of other things that might work like their favorite chocolate, a teddy bear, or balloons.
Many hospitals offer a delivery service from the gift shop, so if your friend is an in-patient, consider purchasing a bouquet or balloon arrangement directly from there. Most hospitals list the phone number for their gift shops on their website, or try calling the hospital operator.
Consider going in with mutual friends or co-workers to buy a nicer gift or flower arrangement.

, You are unique, and you don't need to pretend to be Mr. or Mrs. Fix It, or Do it all or Got the answer for everything. Just be yourself.


Don't pretend to know the answers. Sometimes, even if you do, its best to let them figure some things out on their own. Also being yourself can involve your sense of humor; it can feel like treading on eggshells being with a sick person but if you're nervous or acting as though you don't know what to say you could make them feel uncomfortable so be your laughing, joking self (if that's the way you usually are).

Be pleasant. You want to be as supportive and as comforting as possible. You want to lift their spirits up, not bog them down with gossip or negative opinions. Even wearing cheerfully colored clothes could brighten their day!

, Sometimes asking advice or asking small favors can help someone with a chronic or terminal illness feel needed, which can give them some motivation to stay engaged.


In many health conditions people's brains are as sharp as they ever were and thinking about other people's lives and problems can take their minds off their own for a while.
Think about your friend's area of expertise, and ask any questions you have that might be relevant. For instance, if your friend is an avid gardener, and you've been meaning to put in your Spring beds, ask her advice on when to get started and what kind of mulch to use.

, Learn how to be a good listener and let your friend know that you are there for them if they want to vent about their condition or if they'd rather talk about something else. Either way, having someone to talk to can be a huge relief to someone who is ill.


Be honest with your friend if you don't know what to say. Illness often makes people uncomfortable, and that's ok. What is important is for you to be present for your friend and offer your support. Tell your friend that you are there for her no matter what.

, If you can't be physically present with your friend, send a card or make a phone call. It's easy to send a text or make a Facebook post, but mail and phone calls feel more personal and will feel more thoughtful to the recipient.


Consider writing a thoughtful letter. This can be easier if you are someone who doesn't know what to say around people who are in difficult situations. You can write a letter, and then take time to edit it and rewrite it if you feel like you haven't conveyed your feelings well. Focus on kind wishes, prayers for recovery, and good news that is unrelated to their illness.

, While its important to respect your friend's privacy, if your friend is open to questions they can be a great way to learn more about her condition and to find out more ways that you can support her.You can research her illness online, but asking her questions is the only way to know how her condition affects her as an individual, and just as importantly, how she feels about what she is experiencing.

, If your friend has kids, they are probably feeling isolated, lonely, and confused. Depending on the severity of her illness, they may also be feeling scared, angry, and worried. They need someone to talk to, and if they know and trust you, you can serve as a mentor and friend to them during this time.


Take them out for ice cream and let them talk to you. Don't force them to say more than they seem comfortable. Some children just need you there as a reassuring force in their lives, while others may want to pour out all their feelings to you. Be open to their lead, and follow up with them every few days or weeks, depending on how close you are.

, There are a lot of cliches that people use when other people are going through hard times, and more often than not these common responses just feel insincere or painful to the recipient. Examples of what not to say include:


""God will never give you more than you can handle,"" or its even-worse variation, ""This is God's will.""Sometimes well meaning people of faith say this phrase, and they may truly believe it, but it can feel very harsh to the recipient, especially if she is experiencing something that is very difficult or overwhelming. Also, the person may not believe in God.
""I know how you feel.""Sometimes people say this phrase to others who are going through hard times, and while its true that everyone has experienced trials in life, it's impossible to know how someone else is feeling. This phrase is even worse if its accompanied by personal anecdotes that really don't match the intensity of what the sufferer is experiencing. For example, if someone is facing the loss of a limb, don't equate it to the time that you broke your arm. It's not the same thing. However, if you have truly had an experience that is on par with the experience the sufferer is going through, it's ok to talk about and say ""I've been through something similar.""
You'll be ok.""This is a common phrase when people don't know what to say, and we often say it more as a wish than a statement of fact. In fact, you don't know if someone will be ok, and in many cases of chronic or terminal illness, the person will NOT be ok. They may die, or be condemned to a life of physical suffering. Saying they will be ok minimizes the experience they are having.
""At least...""Don't minimize the person's suffering by suggesting they should be thankful that their situation isn't worse.

, In particular, avoid discussing minor health issues such as a headache or a cold.


This can vary depending on your relationship with the person and the length of their illness. If they are chronically ill, or a very close confidant, it is more likely to be appropriate to discuss things that you're going through.

, While its true that its important to be sensitive to the feelings of someone who is sick, sometimes we overcompensate for our fear of doing the wrong thing by doing nothing at all. Its better to stick your foot in your mouth and apologize than it is to just ignore your sick friend altogether.


If you do mess up and say something insensitive, just say, ""I don't know why I said that. I really don't know what to say. This situation is just very hard."" Your friend will understand.

, Try to pay attention to your friend's cues so that you don't visit too frequently or overstay your welcome. When someone is extremely sick especially, it can be very difficult to carry on a conversation and they won't want to offend you so may over-tax themselves by trying to please you.


If your friend seems distracted by television or her phone, or seems like she is struggling to fall asleep, those might be signs that she is growing tired of the visit. Don't take it personally! Just remember she is dealing with lot, both physically and emotionally, and it can be taxing.
Be mindful of the time, and be sure that you don't extend your stay into mealtimes or other times that your friend may need to be alone. Ask if your friend would like you to pick up some food for them or cook them a meal if you plan to visit during mealtime.

, Educate yourself about their condition and treatment plan so that you are prepared for side effects, changes to their personality, or limits on their energy or stamina.


Ask your friend about their condition, if they want to share, or take time to read about it online.
Watch your friend's body language to understand how she is feeling and how her illness affects her ability to participate in activities, stay alert, and remain emotionally predictable. Be gentle and understanding if she does not act like her old self, and remember that she is carrying many heavy burdens.

, Dealing with debilitating, chronic, or terminal illnesses very frequently results in depression and other problems, and sometimes the medications to treat illnesses also have side effects that can affect the mood.If your friend struggles with depressive thoughts, remind her that this illness is not her fault and that you will be there to support her no matter what happens., Try to place yourself in that person's situation. One day you might have a similar illness and you'll want people to be kind and sympathetic to you. Remember the golden rule: Do unto others as you would have others to do unto you.


If you were ill with a similar condition, what types of daily activities would be a struggle? How might you feel emotionally? What type of support would you hope you friends would offer?
Imagining yourself in their place can help you best determine how to help them.

Do some background research.,
Collect the patient's medical documents.,
Take notes.",How to Be a Hospital Advocate1," The more familiar you are with the health care system, the insurance system, and the specific medical condition your loved one is grappling with, the more effective you can be as an advocate.For example, take some time to learn how the hospital bureaucracy works. What is the ""chain of command?"" Who does your loved-one's doctor or medical team report to?
Learn about the patient's health insurance policy and/or Medicare aid. Look into the process of appealing when aid is denied.;
, Gather all relevant documents related to your loved-one's hospitalization and treatment.This might include test results, explanations of benefits, bills, and prescriptions.


Keep all these records in one place and organized in such a way that you can find whatever you might need to reference later. Keep the same types of documents together, and organize them by date.

, Keep a journal or notepad handy at all times. Make notes every time you talk to the doctor or other health care professionals.These sessions can be very brief, but contain a lot of information, so keeping track of it all for later later reference can be helpful.


Make note of who you've spoken to and what everyone says.Your loved one may be seen by several different doctors and nurses. Record all their names. This will make it much easier to have conversations later about the recommendations or information provided by each physician.
Make sure to note the date of every conversation as well.Then if you have a question about something you've been told, you can be specific, i.e. ""Last Wednesday you told me X, but now you're telling me Y instead. What has changed since last time we spoke?""

Help keep the patient grounded.,
Present information and options to the patient.,
Find out what the patient wants.,
Look into advance directives.,
Communicate the patient's questions and concerns to the doctor.,
Speak assertively on the patient's behalf.",How to Be a Hospital Advocate2," Long hospital stays can be disorienting and confusing, especially for the elderly. Talk and read to the patient in calm, soothing tones. Answer their questions in a clear but reassuring manner.Long hospital stays can promote the onset of delirium, a severe state of disorientation or confusion that can make it difficult for someone to think, rest, or follow directions.This condition may be made more likely by certain drugs that may be used to relieve pain, such as narcotics (analgesics) and sedative hypnotics (benzodiazepines). If you suspect the onset of delirium, contact hospital staff and ask what assistance they can provide.

, One job of the advocate is to act as an intermediary between the doctor and the patient. Chances are, you will end up collecting a lot of very complex information about the patient's condition and treatment options. Help clarify the information and treatment options.Keep in mind that this situation may be very overwhelming for the patient, and there is a lot to keep track of. Don't talk down to the patient, but do present things in as straightforward a manner as possible.
Avoid medical jargon and other technical language when possible.

, Make sure you know what the patient wants, both from you and in terms of treatment. You can only be an effective advocate if you have a clear understanding of your loved one's desires. This conversation is best had before the person is severely ill. It is everyone's best interest to invest time and energy into living wills, assigning power of attorney, and advance directives so family and loved ones do not have to grasp at straws when faced with a health tragedy.


Depending on the severity of the health issue, the patient may or may not feel up to communicating their desires to doctors and other medical staff.
Part of this process may involve helping the patient weigh their options to make the best decision for treatment.Being familiar with the patient's values and belief systems can be important, especially if his or her condition is life-threatening.

, It is a good idea to find out if the patient has an advance directive. This is a document that provides the hospital with instructions as to what should be done if they become incapable of expressing their desires.


This might include specific instructions, such as a desire not be put on life support if brain death occurs. Or, it may include instructions to designate a certain person as responsible for making decisions on the patient's behalf (a proxy directive, also called ""durable power of attorney"").Ideally, if there is a proxy directive, it should designate you, the advocate, as the patient's proxy.
If the patient does not have an advance directive, it may be a good idea to encourage them to complete one, and to help the patient through this process. The paperwork for an advance directive varies from one state to the next. You can find this paperwork here: http://www.caringinfo.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3289


, It is your responsibility to ensure that any questions or concerns the patient has are conveyed to the doctor. This is especially true if they feel incapable of or reluctant about asking questions.Ask for clarification when necessary. Doctors and hospitals, for example, use a lot of acronyms. If a doctor is talking in jargon you don't understand, ask them to explain things in simpler language.If you are a non-family member, the patient will need to sign some paperwork so that healthcare workers can share information with you. Ask about release of information paperwork so that you can legally be informed about the patient's treatment.

, Your most important role as advocate is to make sure the doctor and other hospital staff understand and follow the patient's wishes. This will require you to be clear and politely assertive.Use plain language to tell the doctor what the patient's desires are.
Ask questions about follow up treatments, next steps, and what will happen as a result of different test outcomes. For example: ""if this test is positive, what are our options?""Get a second opinion if necessary. If your loved one wants a second opinion, or what the doctor is telling you doesn't seem right based on the information you've gathered, be direct about asking for and seeking a second opinion."

Help with medication regimens.,
Do the paperwork.,
Watch for errors.,
Provide other services as needed.",How to Be a Hospital Advocate3," For serious health conditions, the number of medications a patient must sometimes take can be overwhelming. As an advocate, you can help your loved one by keeping a list of which medications they are taking.


Make note of which medications should be taken at what time. Provide reminders or any other assistance the patient may ask for to ensure medications are taken on schedule.Use a medication planner with time slots designated for dosing schedules. There are daily medication planners and multi-time slot medication planners to make this more successful if the patient has multiple doses of medication throughout the day. You can also look into different medication reminder apps for your smartphone.

, You can also help your loved one by taking care of necessary paperwork for them. This will be one less thing weighing on their mind during this stressful time.


This could include forms and paperwork from the hospital itself, as well as insurance documents and applications for employer-provided benefits., Hospitals can be chaotic places, and errors by doctors, nurses and other staff are common. This problem is especially pronounced in the administration of medication.Make sure your loved one is receiving the correct medication in the correct dose, and that they do not have an allergy to anything the doctor has prescribed.The nurse should verify the medication, allergies and time of dose with the patient to avoid and mistakes. Nursing staff observe the five rights of medication administration — right patient, right dose, right drug, right time, and right route.
Take special note of any new medications, and ask questions about how long and when the medication should be taken, as well as what side effects it might cause., An advocate is often asked to take on a variety of other tasks. This could be anything from transportation to caring for pets.Take on any task that the patient asks you to and that you are comfortable and capable of carrying out. Ask regularly what you can do to help. There may be many ways you can provide help that you haven't thought of yet.

It also might help to do it with a family member or friend (or even your whole family). Having someone there to commiserate with and keep you on track can be extremely helpful., Shoot for 7-9 servings per day. Eat the ones you know you like and take this opportunity to find tasty new fruits and vegetables. Look for new recipes and preparations to help guide you. And for fruit, if in doubt, throw it in a smoothie. For vegetables, most can be roasted successfully in the oven at high heats to cook, if you aren’t planning to eat them raw. Some of the most health fruits and vegetables are:Dark, leafy greens (spinach, kale, chard, beet greens)
Beets
Red peppers
Sweet potatoes
Berries
Apples

, These are grains that include the bran, germ, and endosperm. Some common ones are barley, oats, quinoa, brown and colored rices, wheat varieties like spelt, farro, and kamut, along with many others. These are going to provide carbohydrates, but in their healthiest form. Keep in mind there are many whole-grain pastas now available, and an array of whole-grain breads that are often delicious., This is determined by the amount of fat in a 3 oz piece of meat -- it has to have less than 10 grams of total fat. Turkey and chicken are lean, but some red meats are as well. Look for cuts with “top” or “loin” in the title. Fish and lean meats are a great source of protein. These are important to eat as part of a balanced diet, but they should not be the elements you eat the most. You need to eat more vegetables and fruits than lean meats., It is the healthiest beverage around, and provides many benefits to your health. Try for 6-8 8 oz. glasses per day. Black coffee and tea are extremely low in calories, and can be part of your daily beverage rotation if you know it won’t be possible to stop drinking caffeine., These foods are often overly sweet or salty and tend to not contain much nutritional value. This means staying away from foods that contain the following ingredients:High fructose corn syrup
Anything with artificial flavors or colors
MSG (Monosodium glutamate, a flavor enhancer)

, Many health nuts believe that both meat and dairy in large quantities are harmful to people's health. They believe that your diet should be an essentially vegan (no dairy, no meat) diet that includes plenty of whole grains in addition to fruits and vegetables. Adding in some meat and dairy at times is fine, but they should not be the basis of your diet., If you eat out a lot, think about how you can cook at home to have more control over what you eat. Look through cookbooks and online to find new recipes that sound appealing. Part of becoming healthier is changing your way of eating, and new foods and dishes will be part of that. Cooking the same things you always make and just eating less can be more difficult than preparing something new with fewer calories in the same size portion., Take packed lunches to work or school. For some people, just this simple step can go a long way toward helping them eat healthier and more mindfully. Home-cooked food is going to be healthier than the vast majority of restaurant food, and will not have the same kinds of preservatives or high sodium levels., Buy the foods you need to make your new healthy dishes at home. Buy ingredients, not prepared or processed foods -- these are typically going to have the same sodium and preservative levels as restaurant food. Even though it might take time getting used to cooking at home, your food is going to be both healthier and better.

, Identify the foods that you want to eliminate from your diet in both your refrigerator and your cupboards. Pay particular attention to prepackaged and processed foods -- they often have unhealthy preservatives and additives, and can be very high in sodium.Toss all trans fats. If an ingredient is ""partially hydrogenated oil"" this is another name for trans fats, and are a major cause of heart attacks and strokes. You will want to eventually, if not immediately, throw out all foods you have with this ingredient listed on the package.

, Take stock of your current exercise regimen. If you are exercising little, you have a lot of options to explore as you become more healthy. If you are already exercising, think about how you might want to add to the activities you already do. You might want to start a new exercise class to inspire you to exercise more., A half hour of moderate exercise six days a week is all it takes to start making a difference if you’re exercising little. Keep in mind that you also don’t have to do it all at once -- ten minutes here and twenty there will work just as well., Don’t do the same thing every day (unless you love it). Walk one day, take a yoga class another, and try new activities. Check with your local gym or YMCA for their schedules and amenities. If you try and do a new activity every week or so, you might find your new favorite exercise routine., If you want to be a health nut, you need to be doing serious exercise, and moderate walks are not going to be enough. Think about what sports or kinds of training you might enjoy. You will need to do these activities most days and at a rate that allows your heart rate to stay elevated for 20-30 minutes at a time. You should also mix them up with some weight training. Some good options for cardiovascular exercise might be:


Swimming
Tennis
Cross-training in a gym
Boot-camp style exercise course

Wear broad-spectrum sunscreen.,
Put on protective clothing.,
Use UV-blocking sunglasses.,
Seek out shade.,
Check the Ultraviolet (UV) Index.The UV index was developed by the Environmental Protection Agency in collaboration with the National Weather Service.,
Stay out of the sun during peak UV radiation times.,
Exercise caution around reflective environments.,
Limit UV exposure at higher altitudes.,
Use UV-protective film for your windows.,
Avoid artificial radiation sources.,
Protect against both forms of UV radiation.,
Understand how radiation affects the skin.,
Minimize damage to your eyes from UV exposure.",How to Avoid UV Exposure," It's not enough to wear sunscreen. You need to wear the right kind of sunscreen and keep reapplying it regularly throughout the day in order to ensure that you are adequately protected in the sun. Broad-spectrum sunscreen protects against both types of radiation, meaning you'll get the best protection you can against UV exposure.By law, broad-spectrum sunscreen must pass rigorous testing procedures to ensure that it protects against both UVA and UVB radiation.
In addition to selecting broad-spectrum sunscreen, make sure your sunscreen has an SPF (sun protection factor) of at least 15, though you may want to go with an even higher SPF to reduce the risk of sunburn and UV exposure.
Make sure your sunscreen is still effective by checking the expiration date printed on the bottle. Even if it's still good, you may need to vigorously shake the container to mix the ingredients back together.
Use about one palmful of sunscreen to completely cover your face, neck, arms, and legs. Reapply at least every two hours, or more frequently if you'll be swimming or sweating.
Waterproof sunscreen only protects you for 40 to 80 minutes of swimming or sweating. After that, you'll need to reapply more sunscreen.;
, Protective clothing can help shield your body from direct UV exposure. If you're planning on being outdoors for a day of hiking, a picnic, yard work, or just lounging in the sun, make sure you wear appropriately protective clothing in addition to sunscreen.Wear a hat with a brim that extends at least two to three inches on all sides.
Long-sleeved shirts and long pants provide the most protection.
Some articles of clothing come with a built-in UV protection factor. Check the labels and tags on an article of clothing to determine if that item provides UV protection.
Darker fabrics may make you feel warmer in the sun, but they are also believed to protect your skin from UV radiation better than light-colored fabric.
Dry fabric may be more protective than wet fabric, but wet fabric is better than no clothing at all.
Opt for tightly-woven articles of clothing, which block out more UV radiation than loosely-woven fabrics.
As a quick test, try holding up your hand under a single layer of clothing in direct light. If your hand is visible through the fabric, it's not tightly-woven enough to provide any real protection., Even when you wear broad-spectrum sunscreen, your eyes are still at risk of being damaged by the sun, which may cause cataracts, cancer, or growths on the eye. The skin directly around your eyes is susceptible to sunburn and possible skin cancer, and your eyes themselves may be permanently damaged after a lifetime of UV exposure.Make sure your sunglasses block both UVA and UVB rays. Look for full-spectrum coverage to ensure your eyes and skin are safe in the sun.
Choose sunglasses with large frames/lenses or wraparound frames to protect your eyes from multiple angles of light exposure.
Check the label on sunglasses to verify that they provide UV protection. Labels that read either, ""UV absorption up to 400 nm,"" or, ""Meets ANSI UV Requirements"" block 99% to 100% of UV radiation.
Cosmetic sunglasses only block up to 70% of UV radiation, with some performing much lower. If the label doesn't offer UV or ANSI specifications, they can't be trusted to provide UV protection.

, Shade can help reduce your exposure to UV radiation, especially when you combine shade with other protective measures. Even if you're in the shade, though, you should still wear sunscreen and proper clothing to protect yourself against UV exposure.Staying under an umbrella, a tree, or a man-made shelter can reduce the direct impact of UV radiation.
Be aware, though, that shade isn't perfect at protecting you. You can still get up to 50% of the sun's radiation while remaining in the shade., These agencies examine weather trends and daily weather forecasts to predict how high the levels of UV radiation will be on a given day.You can check the index by visiting the National Weather Service website, or by downloading an app directly to your smartphone or tablet.


The UV Index rates the risk of UV radiation exposure for a given day on a scale from 0 to 10+.
A UV Index of 0 to 2 means that the risk of UV exposure is minimal.
A 3 to 4 on the UV Index means that there is a low (but present) risk of UV exposure.
A 5 to 6 on the UV Index increases the risk of UV exposure to moderate.
7 to 9 is considered a high risk for UV exposure.
A 10+ is considered a very high risk for UV exposure.
It's best to stay out of the sun altogether (if possible) on days with high UV Index numbers.

, Regardless of the UV Index forecast for a given day, there are peak times of day when UV radiation is at its highest. Being in the sun during these hours will dramatically increase your exposure to UV radiation, even if you take other protective measures.Peak hours for UV radiation are typically from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM, though this may vary slightly, depending on your location.Remember the shadow rule: if your shadow is short, you need to seek shade. A short shadow indicates that the sun is almost directly overhead in the sky, which means there is a high risk of radiation exposure.
Try to avoid any exposure to sunlight during peak UV hours by staying indoors or under adequate shade.

, No matter how many precautions you take, you may still be exposed to additional UV radiation depending on your immediate environment. Settings that are highly reflective tend to bounce more UV radiation at your body from all angles, so it's important to take extra precautions in those environments.Sand and water can both be highly reflective. Sand alone can reflect up to 25% of the sun's radiation, and water is highly reflective.
You may not think of snowy environments as a place to catch a tan, but snow can reflect sunlight and radiation just as much as a beach can. In fact, up to 80% of the sun's radiation can be reflected by fresh snow.
Even if you lounge in the shade, you're still exposed to upwards of 50% of the ambient UV radiation around you.
If the UV Index is high on a given day, or if you're planning to be outdoors while UV radiation is highest for the day, it's best to limit or entirely avoid exposure to the sun.

, Your level of UV radiation exposure increases dramatically as you increase your altitude. That's because you're literally putting yourself closer to the sun, which can make a big difference if you're at very high elevations.UV radiation increases by a rate of 4% for every 300 meters (984 feet) you ascend vertically from sea level.
Exercise great caution while hiking or climbing mountains.
Even living at a higher elevation may increase the risk of UV exposure. If you live in a high-elevation city like Denver, CO, you should take extra precautions in the sun.

, Working and living indoors greatly reduces your UV exposure; however, it does not completely eliminate it. For this reason, you may want to consider UV-protective film for your windows to improve your protection against UV radiation.UVA radiation penetrates glass quite easily.
Even when you work indoors, you're still exposed to about 10% to 20% of the UV radiation that an outdoor worker receives.Putting up a tinted UV-protective film on the windows of your home or business, as well as on the side and rear windows of your vehicle, can block out exposure to 99.9% of UV radiation while still letting in around 80% of the sun's visible light.

, Artificial sources of radiation are just as dangerous as being directly exposed to the sun's UV radiation. If you want to reduce your risk of UV exposure, it's best to avoid tanning facilities altogether.Lying under a tanning lamp puts your body in direct contact with UV radiation, which can be very dangerous.
Tanning booths and sun lamps are known to cause skin damage and increase the risk of skin cancer.

, There are two known forms of ultraviolet light from the sun: ultraviolet A, which is a long-wave form of radiation, and ultraviolet B, which is a shortwave radiation. All types of ultraviolet radiation are invisible to the unaided eye but can do great damage to your skin and eyes over the course of a lifetime.Both UVA and UVB are equally dangerous to humans.
UVA radiation is more prevalent, but UVB radiation causes greater damage in smaller quantities.
When you choose sunscreen or clothing with UV protection, it's important to make sure those products protect against both UVA and UVB (usually designated as ""broad-spectrum"" protection).

, Your skin shows the most direct effects of UV exposure over the course of a lifetime. If you spend a lot of time in the sun, there's a good chance that your skin will experience negative effects unless you take precautions to protect yourself against UV radiation.Dry skin, blemishes, a loss of elasticity, and premature signs of aging are all common effects caused by UV exposure over long periods of time.
Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) includes squamous and basal cell carcinomas. NMSC is a serious form of cancer that is usually not fatal but can cause serious scars, damage, and disfigurement.
NMSCs most commonly occur on parts of the body with high exposure to the sun, specifically the head, neck, and hands/arms.
Melanoma is the most severe form of skin cancer, with up to 25% of cases that are diagnosed ending fatally. Melanoma can occur anywhere on the body, including less-exposed regions like the lower legs and back.
A history of intense (yet often infrequent) sunburns, especially during childhood, is believed to be a leading cause of developing melanoma later in life.

, Your skin isn't the only body part that can be damaged by the sun. Many people experience moderate to severe eye complications because of UV exposure. That's why it's important to wear sunglasses with UV protection any time you plan to be outdoors in the sun.Exposure to UV radiation can cause photokeratitis, a temporary but painful affliction of the cornea that reduces your capacity to see. Photokeratitis is most prevalent in environments that reflect a lot of UV radiation, and the symptoms usually reduce and go away within two days.
UV exposure over time can cause malignant melanoma of the eyeball and basal cell carcinoma on the eyelids. In severe cases of eye cancer, your entire eye may need to be surgically removed.
UV exposure over the course of your lifetime is one of the leading causes of cataracts. Cataracts cause the lenses in your eyes to lose transparency, reducing vision until a surgical correction can be made.
Exposure to UV radiation can also cause irreversible retinal damage, including macular degeneration. Over time, macular degeneration causes a loss of reading vision and may lead to total blindness.

Aim for moderation rather than perfection.,
Consider whether your diet is negatively impacting your social life.,
Check whether you are routinely cancelling social events to exercise.,
Reflect on whether you view exercise as a form of compensation for poor eating.,
Get medical help if you are unsure about your health goals.",How to Avoid Unhealthy Health Goals1," Being a perfectionist in your health goals may end up impeding your progress. If you try to be perfect in your new diet and eating habits, you may end up being so hard on yourself that you give up on the diet entirely. Instead, aim for moderate or small improvements in your diet and try to stick to them.;
, You may want to re-evaluate your new diet if it is stopping you from living the kind of life you want to lead. If your new diet is stopping you from attending social events with friends and family, perhaps you should modify your dietary goals so that you can still have a social life., Cancelling a lot of social events with friends and family to get to the gym may be a sign of unhealthy exercise goals. The strength of social connections with friends and family is an important factor in your health. Make sure you aren’t sacrificing a healthy social life to get to the gym, since you need both social ties and an active lifestyle to be healthy., You should not aim to exercise so you can eat more brownies, chips or other junk food. An exercise plan built around compensating for poor eating habits will not make you healthier. Instead, you should focus on a well-rounded, healthy diet and a regular exercise routine., Ask your family doctor for advice on specific health goals that would be healthy for you.In conversation with your doctor, set specific and measurable health goals that are meaningful to you.


Ask your doctor: “I see a lot of people doing the vegetarian diet. Do you think this would work for me?”
Inquire: “How much should I exercise each week if I want to lose weight by the summer?”
For instance, if you want to be able to swim a certain distance by the summer, use this as a starting point for setting your goals. The goals you set should be specific and you should be able to measure your progress over time."

Focus more on your bad eating habits and less on a strict diet.,
Aim to eat until your feel full instead of losing a certain amount of weight.,
Give yourself one cheat meal a week if you are on a new diet.,
Notice if you are using your “cheat day” as an excuse to binge.,
Reflect on whether you are just following a fad diet.",How to Avoid Unhealthy Health Goals2," If you want to lose weight, you may be tempted to start a completely new diet from scratch. However, moving to a whole new diet often results in failure. Instead, focus on improving specific eating behaviours that can add up to significant weight loss:


Instead of eating in front of the television, try mindful eating. You may be consuming too much food because you are eating while “spaced out” instead of focusing on your food. Try to just eat and pay attention to the food, which may help you to eat less.Stop eating late at night. Eating a lot right before bed tends to lead to weight gain. If you want to lose weight, this is an important habit to change.Avoid skipping breakfast. If you skip breakfast, you may end up overeating at lunch, which tends to lead to weight gain. More importantly, you need to eat breakfast because your blood sugar levels are low in the morning, and blood sugar is necessary for your brain and muscles to function properly. Give yourself time to enjoy a relaxed and fulfilling breakfast, which should help you lose weight in the long run.Keep your fridge stocked with healthy fruits, vegetables and whole grains. If you surround yourself with healthy foods, you will be less likely to reach for unhealthy options.

, Try to train your body to recognize when it is full. This will help you lose more weight than trying to lose a certain number of pounds, which can often be a poor diet goal because it focuses too much on the outcome and not enough on the necessary behavior changes.You can train yourself to notice when you are full by serving smaller portions and integrating a “check in” moment at each meal. Serve yourself a small portion. After eating your small portion, check in with your tummy and ask yourself whether you feel full. Give yourself five minutes for the check in before deciding whether or not to eat more food. If you feel full after the five minute wait, you don’t need to eat more.

, Instead of eating every meal according to your new diet plan, give yourself a break. By allowing yourself at least one meal where you can eat anything you desire, you will eliminate the feeling that there is no way out. It is better to aim for improvement, as opposed to perfection, so just try to stick to your diet generally and give yourself a break once a week., If you are following a strict diet with one day of the week where you allow yourself to eat anything, it is not an excuse to binge on unhealthy food choices. Your diet may be unhealthy if it makes you feel like you need to binge eat on certain days and deprive yourself on other days. Instead, try to eat a healthy diet every day of the week and give yourself a break if you slip up once in a while. If you have a “cheat day,” avoid using it as an excuse to eat as much junk food as possible., Your new diet may be unhealthy if you are simply following a new fad diet such as, but not limited to, the Paleo diet or Atkins diet. Although all of these diets can work great for many people and for a variety of reasons, you should not follow a diet simply because it is new and exciting. You should find a diet that works for you and adapt it to your body type, health and fitness goals."
"
Avoid setting goals based on external sources of information.,
Break down your big goal into smaller goals.,
Change your exercise routine and pay less attention to outcomes.,
Avoid expecting instant payback.,
Give yourself enough time to train.",How to Avoid Unhealthy Health Goals3," Instead of focusing on goals like losing weight or looking trim, find an activity that you truly enjoy. Build your fitness goals around an activity that you really like, as opposed to focusing on abstract goals that you don’t feel connected to.


Instead of focusing on getting ripped abdominal muscles, find a sport you like and join the local recreation league.
Connect fitness to a hobby you enjoy. If you are a photographer, go for a walk with your camera and take pictures along the way.
Instead of focusing on losing a certain amount of weight, find an activity you enjoy that involves losing calories and devote time to this activity. If you enjoy walking in the park, spend more time walking in the park and worry less about the amount of weight you need to lose., Instead of focusing on one huge goal such as losing fifty pounds, focus on small and measurable goals. Your goals should be measurable on a weekly basis.


If your big goal is to lose fifty pounds, focus on the small goal of losing one pound per week.
If your big goal is to squat three hundred pounds, focus on the small goal of increasing your squat lift by five pounds every couple weeks.
If your big goal is to lose fifty pounds, focus on the small goal of going for a run every other day and avoid checking your weight more frequently than once a month.

, Instead of focusing on how much you want to squat at the gym or the distance you want to run, focus on your training process. If you make time to practice squatting a few times a week, you should be able to gradually achieve your desired outcome. Pay more attention to your fitness process., You should avoid the expectation to see instant results from your new fitness routine. Going to the gym three or four times a week should improve your overall condition, if that is your goal, but you are unlikely to notice immediate results such as a six pack or vast amounts of weight loss., You should allocate a proper amount of time for achieving your fitness goals. If you skimp on time, you may get hurt in the training process. Avoid injuries by giving yourself the proper time to train.If you want to run a marathon and you are a beginner level runner, you will need around twenty two weeks. If you don’t give yourself the proper training time, you may hurt yourself.

Take all prescribed medication.,
Avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).,
Be wary of antacids.",How to Avoid Irritating an Ulcer1," If your health care provider has determined your peptic ulcer was caused by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), antibiotics are necessary to eradicate the bacteria. The H. pylori is a bacteria that weakens the stomach's protective coating enabling damage to the sensitive layers below. If you have H. pylori you will probably be prescribed what is known as ""Triple Therapy."" This involves you taking three kinds of medication for a certain period of time.


You will need to take two antibiotics, as well as a proton pump inhibitor. The inhibitor will work to reduce acid production.;
, Some NSAIDs can exacerbate your ulcer and cause pain and irritation. Common drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen can make the stomach more vulnerable to acid and pepsin. These drugs are frequently found in nonprescription medications that you might take to treat a headache or muscle pain. Keep this in mind, check the ingredients and speak with your doctor about whether or not you can take NSAIDs., Many antacids are available over the counter which can relieve irritation and pain of heartburn and indigestion. While they might ease discomfort, they will not treat or cure an ulcer. If you want to take antacids be sure to speak to your doctor about it first as they can block the absorption of your prescribed medication, and consequently lower it's effectiveness.


In general doctors suggest taking antacids at least an hour before, or two hours after, you take your prescribed medication.
Easily accessible antacids include magnesium hydroxide, aluminium hydroxide, calcium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate."
"
Avoid food that increases the production of stomach acid.,
Steer clear of food that may irritant your ulcer.,
Eat plenty of fiber.,
Eat meals according to a regular schedule.",How to Avoid Irritating an Ulcer2," The foods which may irritate ulcers vary from person to person. Some people can eat whatever they like without any increased irritation, but this is not true for everyone. You will have to learn over time which foods cause you problems and cut them out or limit them in your diet. A good place to start is with foods which increase your stomach acid production.Patients with peptic ulcers should avoid diets rich in red meat, fried or fatty foods, and refined foods, such as flour or sugar.
Be cautious of dairy foods with whole milk or cream.
Spearmint, peppermint and other minty foods seem to increase the production of stomach acid.Diets heavy in these foods can lead to further ulcer irritation and an increase in stomach acid.

, As well as foods that can provoke increased production of stomach acid, some other foods can irritate your ulcer more directly. In practice this will vary from person to person, but there are some general recommendations for those with an ulcer. The first of these is to try to avoid eating spicy food. The sting you feel from spicy food if you have a cut on your finger or mouth can be replicated in your stomach or intestine if you have an ulcer.


The second recommendation is to avoid citrus and acidic foods and drinks. Highly acidic orange or lemon juice could irritate the ulcer and cause you pain.You should also be wary of tomato products, onions and garlic and heavily seasoned food in general., Diets rich in whole grains and fiber rich foods, with limited dairy, help control the production of stomach acid. Ensure you get plenty of fibrous vegetables as part of your healthy balanced diet. If you are not consuming enough vitamin-rich foods your body may find it harder to heal your ulcer.Good sources of fiber are whole-wheat bread, pasta and brown rice.
Opt for limited amounts of lean meat, and limited low fat dairy products.There is no single recommended diet for those with an ulcer, so you should think about what food causes you irritation and discuss this with your doctor.Eating foods rich in antioxidants (blueberries, cherries, tomatoes, squash, and bell peppers), flavonoids (apples, celery, cranberries, onions, garlic, and tea), B vitamins and calcium (almonds, beans, whole grains, spinach, kale, and sea vegetables) may also help to reduce your symptoms.Continue to drink 6-8 glasses of water each day as part of your healthy diet., A peptic ulcer sufferer is not advised to eat sporadic meals that vary in size. Doing so may cause disruption in the normal production of stomach acid, and end up irritating an ulcer. Keeping meals small and regular can help level out stomach acid. Your stomach may deal better with small regular meals than large irregular ones.


Avoid eating anything at least two hours before you go to bed."
"
Reduce consumption of alcohol.,
Cut down on caffeine.,
Avoid nicotine.,
Reduce stress.",How to Avoid Irritating an Ulcer3," Heavy consumption of alcohol is a risk factor in the development of peptic ulcers.If you have been diagnosed with an ulcer, continued consumption of alcohol can contribute to irritation of ulcers and you should avoid it if you have an ulcer. This is especially true for strong alcohol and liquors.Alcohol can also lead gastritis, an inflammation of the stomach, that can severely impact the amount of time it will take for an ulcer to heal., Much like certain foods, caffeine can contribute to an increase in the secretion of stomach acid, which in turn increases the likelihood of your ulcer becoming irritated. Many stimulants have this effect and are best avoided when you have an ulcer. Caffeine is found in a wide variety of drinks such as coffee, tea, energy drinks and soda, so be sure to check the label if you're uncertain.It is thought that even decaffeinated coffee can increase stomach acid production. So it may be best to avoid even decaffeinated coffee., Quit smoking and avoid second-hand smoke. The chemicals in cigarette smoke can weaken the stomach lining, which irritates current ulcers or may even cause new ulcers to develop. Similar to other stimulants, nicotine may contribute to an increase in the production of stomach acid, which can irritate an ulcer. Nicotine can also lead to inflammation which hampers the healing process., Although there is an uncertain correlation between stress and ulcer pain, some ulcer sufferers find that when emotional stress in their life rises, so does the ulcer irritation. A program that reduces stress may have beneficial consequences and help you avoid irritating your ulcer. Try regularly practicing relaxation techniques such as yoga, meditation or tai chi.


Some research suggests that a formal stress reduction program with a class might be more effective for those with an ulcer than doing it at home alone."

Keep a bottle of hand sanitizer with you.,
Take extra precautions if you're sick or have a sick person with you.,
Wash and clean all produce.,
Cook meats to the appropriate temperature.,
Stick to bottled or purified water.,
Talk to your doctor.,
Separate yourself from others.,
Drink adequate fluids.,
Take medications are instructed.",How to Avoid Elizabethkingia Infection," One of the biggest sites of infection that has been identified are hospitals and healthcare facilities. This is most likely due to the fact there are large quantities of people who are already sick.If you work in a hospital, are visiting someone in the hospital, or are admitted yourself, take extra precautions to protect yourself from getting sick. There are many, many germs and bacteria in these facilities and you need to ensure you take care to protect yourself.
When you go into a health care facility, immediately wash your hands or use some hand sanitizer. Also repeat this same process when you leave the facility as well.
If you are uncomfortable in these facilities, ask for a face or mouth mask to help protect yourself from an infection like the Elizabethkingia infection.
Do not go to a hospital or other healthcare facility that has had an outbreak of the Elizabethkingia infection if you are pregnant, have a young child, are over the age of 65, or have a compromised immune system.;
, Regular and proper hand washing is the best defense from any type of cold, flu or infection. Make sure that you're washing your hands often and are following the proper technique.


You should wash your hands before and after eating, before and after visiting a healthcare facility, before and after using the bathroom, and after you sneeze or cough.To wash your hands, start by turning a faucet on and let warm water run over your hands.
Squirt a bit of soap into your hands and work it into a foamy lather. Scrub your fingers, wrists, and tops of your hands well. Even get underneath your fingernails. Scrub for at least 20 seconds.
Wash the soap and lather from your hands until they are completely clean and soap-free.
Dry with a hand dryer or paper towel. Be careful not to re-contaminate your hands by touching the faucet or door handle. Use a paper towel to help you.

, If you feel like you're more susceptible to getting an infection or are in an area with those who already have the Elizabethkingia infection, it might be wise to keep a bottle of hand sanitizer with you.


If you do not have access to a sink or want something on you at all, times an alcohol-based sanitizer can help get rid of germs.The CDC recommends that you have a sanitizer that is at least 60% alcohol. This does a decent job at killing germs on your hands. Note that it's not as effective as hot water and soap.
To use hand sanitizer properly, start by squirting a small drop of sanitizer on the palm of your hands.
Rub the sanitizer all over your hands (making sure to get the back of your hands and wrists). Rub thoroughly until the product dries and there's none left on your hands. There's no need to rinse hands after this.

, If you are currently sick (or are high risk) or have a sick person in your immediate family, make sure you take extra precautions. Being sick means your immune system is compromised and you are more susceptible to the Elizabethkingia infection.If you are currently sick or are at high risk (like being pregnant or being over 65), stay away from healthcare facilities if you can. Also always carry around hand sanitizer.
Wear a face mask if you need to as well. Whether you're sick or going to visit someone in the hospital, protect yourself by wearing a simple face mask.

, The Elizabethkingia bacteria is found worldwide in the soil, water and reservoirs.Since many items of our food systems come into contact with water and soil, its important to make sure you practice safe food handling techniques like washing fruits and vegetables.


Wash all of your produce before your eat or cook them. Even if there is no visible dirt or if you bought organic products, it's important to wash every fruit and vegetable.Rinse fruits and vegetables under cool running water. You can use a produce cleaner if you'd like, however running water works fine alone. Do not use dish soap, bleach, or hand soap on fruits and vegetables.
If your fruits or vegetables have a tough or firm outer skin, use a scrub brush to help clean and remove all dirt and debris.
Dry off all your produce after washing and store appropriately. Also finish this process by washing all your utensils that were used and your hands.

, In addition to washing fruits and vegetables, make sure you keep your proteins safe. Also, cook them to the appropriate temperature.


Store all protein in a resealable plastic bag on the bottom of the refrigerator. Do not allow them to be over any fresh fruits and vegetables.Cook whole pieces of meat (like a pork tenderloin) to 145F, cook poultry to 165F and cook ground meat to 160F.
Also, make sure to keep foods either above the 140F or under 40F as bacteria, even the Elizabethkingia bacteria can survive in-between those temperatures.

, The Elizabethkingia has been associated with fluids and water as the source of contamination. If you are sick, have a compromised immune system or are over the age of 65, consider using only bottled water for drinking.The Elizabethkinigia infection can be spread through fluids and water. If you are an at risk individual, try not to use tap water, drink water from unknown sources, or drink tap water in other countries.
Only use bottle watered, boiled and sanitized water or purified water that has gone through a water purifying system for drinking.
If you are unsure about the quality of the water, it's best to avoid drinking it until you can find a purified water source.

, If you think you're experiencing symptoms that correlate with the signs and symptoms of the Elizabethkingia infection, make sure you contact your doctor immediately.


Symptoms of this infection include shortness of breath, fever, chills, and red or swollen skin. If you notice these symptoms, call your doctor or visit an urgent care facility to be treated.
It will be helpful to track how long you've had symptoms for your physician. Talk about when they first started, if they worsened, and how many days you've been experiencing them.
If you do test positive for this infection, help the CDC and your doctor figure out the cause by letting them know if you were around other people that were sick or ate food that was unusual.

, Although health care professionals don't think this particular bacteria is overly virulent, it is important to separate yourself from others. You can make other people sick.Regardless of whether or not you've had a positive blood test for the Elizabethkingia infection, if you are experiencing any type of symptoms, separate yourself from others.
Take care to make sure others do not use the same utensils, plates, cups, pens and pencils as you are.
In particular, stay away from infants and small children, those who are sick, those who have a compromised immune system, pregnant women and elderly adults.

, Whenever you are sick, it's important to keep your body as healthy as possible. Bacteria, like the Elizabethkingia infection, can make you feel horrible and discourage you from drinking a normal amount of fluids.


Anytime your body has a fever, it's a sign of an infection, but also a sign that you need to keep up with all your clear, hydrating fluids.Staying hydrated when you're sick helps your body defend itself more effectively against whatever virus or bacteria you've contracted.
Health professionals recommend consuming at least 8-10 glasses of water while you are sick. Make sure to stick with hydrating fluids and stay away from drinks like alcohol, sodas, or caffeinated coffee.

, Although there's not conclusive evidence of where the Elizabethkingia infection is coming from, there is an effective treatment for it. As long as you take your antibiotic medication correctly, you will recover from this infection.


Your doctor will give you a course of antibiotics to take to help defeat the bacteria in your body. Follow your doctors orders accurately. If you do not, you may not get rid of the infection.One common mistake people make is that when they feel better, they think they can stop their antibiotics. This is not true and can lead to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Continue with all of the pills prescribed until they are gone.
Make sure to take antibiotics with food if it's directed. Sometimes, these medications can be harsh on your stomach and cause stomach pain or cramping. Mixed with food, these antibiotics are generally less irritating.

Understand how people get infected with Naegleria fowleri.,
Understand which bodies of water contain Naegleria fowleri.,
Avoid swimming in potentially unsafe bodies of water.,
Use safe water when rinsing your sinuses.,
Use safe water for any rituals involving nose-rinsing.,Avoid allowing water to get into your nose when showering, washing your hands, or washing your face.,
Look out for symptoms of the infection.,
If you have any such symptoms, seek medical care immediately.,
Keep an eye open for new medical developments.",How to Avoid a Naegleria Fowleri Infection," Naegleria fowleri can enter the brain and cause the normally fatal disease primary amebic meningoencephalitis when contaminated water gets into your nose. Drinking water contaminated with the ameba doesn't cause brain infection.
, Naegleria fowleri can be found in freshwater bodies like lakes and rivers, water heaters, poorly chlorinated swimming pools, the soil, and water that is geothermally warmed. Warm water from industrial plants can also contain Naegleria fowleri. In general, any warm body of fresh water can be contaminated; saltwater is free of Naegleria fowleri. This includes the tap water in some Southern States in the United States; even First World taps may pump out contaminated water., Many freshwater lakes and rivers in the Southern United States could be contaminated. Contamination in freshwater lakes further North is less likely, but still possible. Swimming pools that haven't been properly chlorinated could also contain the ameba.

Swim only in swimming pools that are properly sanitized and chlorinated.
The CDC states that using a nose clip might reduce the likelihood of infection because it helps prevent water from getting up your nose, but also states that it is best to not swim in possibly unsafe water bodies altogether.
Follow CDC instructions on how to properly chlorinate pools you own yourself.

, Clean your neti pot properly by rinsing it with safe water and let it air dry every time after use. Only use safe water to rinse your sinuses; boil the water used to rinse your nose for at least one minute (three minutes at elevations above 6,500 feet, since water boils at lower temperatures the higher you go), filter your water using a filter labeled ""NSF 53"" or ""NSF 58"", and/or buy sterile water from a store., Some religions require their adherents to rinse their noses as a part of a religious ritual. Use the same precautions that apply to neti pot or sinus rinsing: use safe water that has been boiled for at least one minute (three minutes at elevations above 6,500 feet), filter your water using a ""NSF 53"" or ""NSF 58"" filter, and/or buy sterile water from a store.

If unsure, ask your religious leader about which one of the methods is religiously acceptable.

,, This is especially important if you have recently had water go up your nose, if you have recently swum in warm bodies of freshwater, or if you live in subtropical or tropical regions where tap water comes from warm water sources.

The incubation period is usually around 5 days.
The illness, primary amebic meningoencephalitis, starts off by causing headaches, fever, nausea, and/or vomiting.
As the illness progresses, it starts to cause brain damage. Later on, symptoms could include a stiff neck, confusion, hallucinations, an inability to balance yourself, inattention, and seizures.
The illness is almost always fatal, with death occurring usually 5 days after the first symptoms show up.

,

Some of these symptoms can also be caused by bacterial meningitis, which isn't always fatal but still requires medical attention. Remember that even though you have these symptoms, you aren't necessarily going to die.
Tell the doctor that you are experiencing these symptoms and that you have recently had water go up your nose.

, Currently, the disease is almost always fatal. However, there might be hope; from 1962 to 2015, 3 out of 138 survived the illness in the United States. New drugs like miltefosine appear promising to researchers; two people out of the three survivors survived after being given miltefosine along with other drugs."

Know your risk.,
Ask your doctor about anticoagulant medication.,
Get compression stockings.,
Book an aisle seat.,
Avoid long, uninterrupted flights.",How to Avoid Blood Clots on Long Flights1," Certain people are at higher risk of blood clots or DVT than others. If you fall into one of the following categories, you may want to talk to your doctor about taking special precautions when traveling. Risk factors include:Being older than 40
Being overweight
Not taking anticoagulant medication as prescribed
A genetic blood clotting condition
Having cancer or receiving cancer treatment
Being pregnant or a recent delivery or c-section
Taking hormone therapy or birth control pills
Smoking
A recent major surgery
A broken bone in a lower body extremity (ankle, foot, leg, etc.);
, Consider an injection of anticoagulant medication if you have cancer, had a recent surgery or have thrombophilia. Depending on your medical history and condition, one of the steps that could help is to take an anticoagulant medication such as heparin. An injection of heparin can thin your blood and make it less likely to clot during the long flight. Ask your doctor whether this is a good option for you., Doctor-recommended compression stockings are a good lifestyle change if you are at risk of blood clots or have an upcoming flight.You should ask your doctor or pharmacist about the appropriate type of stocking, which may be a graduated compression stocking. They should go all the way up to your knee and can help improve circulation when used alongside regular exercise., An aisle seat will allow you to move your legs a little bit more during the flight, which will help improve circulation and reduce the risk of blood clots. Book your flight early so you can be sure to get an aisle seat.You may also be able to pay a little more for a row with extra leg room. If you can afford it, this may be another option to give yourself more space to stretch out.

, People who travel on flights longer than four hours are at an increased risk of blood clots. If you can take a vacation or attend an event a little bit closer to home, you will reduce your risk. See if you can meet friends, family or colleagues somewhere a little closer, perhaps less than a four-hour flight away.If a long trip is absolutely necessary, consider breaking it up with stops in between and give yourself time to rest, relax and walk about for a day or two between the legs of your trip. If it is not possible, you should at least give yourself a few hours of rest between flights. In this time, you should walk around and stretch.

Ask to be reseated if they give you a window seat.,
Store your luggage overhead.,
Avoid drinking alcohol.,
Avoid sleeping pills on long flights.,
Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water.,
Take off your shoes during the flight.,
Don’t cross your legs during the flight.",How to Avoid Blood Clots on Long Flights2," If you have been seated at a window seat and are at risk of blood clots, you should tell the flight attendants. Ask one of the flight attendants if they would be able to move you to an aisle seat., If you have carry on baggage, you should place it in the overhead container. Avoid putting anything at your feet, since it will reduce the amount of room that you have for stretching your legs., You should avoid alcohol both prior to your flight and during the actual flight, since it could put you to sleep and cause you to be immobile for a long period of time. A blood clot could form while you are sleeping in an uncomfortable position., If you take a sleeping pill, you could fall asleep and get a blood clot. As such, avoid the temptation of taking a sleeping pill. Instead, you could try taking very short, ten-minute naps., Bring a water bottle with you. When you finish it, ask the flight attendant to refill it for you. If you rely on the small cups of water they give you during the flight, you will not get adequate hydration.

, To improve circulation, it can help to take off your shoes. It will be easier to stretch your feet and toes without shoes.

, If you have a habit of crossing your legs, you should avoid it during a long flight. Crossing your legs will reduce circulation to parts of your legs, which will increase the risk of a blood clot."

Do foot stretches.,
Stretch your toes.,
Pull your knees to your chest.,
Press the balls of your feet to the ground periodically.,
Roll your ankles.,
Lift your legs.,
Walk up and down the aisle.",How to Avoid Blood Clots on Long Flights3," Flex your toes back towards your chest. Then, point them towards the ground. Repeat this exercise six to eight times for one set of foot stretches. Every once in awhile, say every half hour, you should perform this foot stretch.

, Every so often, you should do a simple toe stretch by pressing your toes to the ground and then raising them up to the ceiling. Complete five to eight repetitions. You can do the toe stretch after doing your foot stretch., Grab your knee and pull your leg up to your chest. Hold it for 15 seconds. Then, let it back down to the floor. Repeat the movement on your other side for one complete repetition. Complete 10 repetitions during your flight., Every once in awhile, you should press the balls of your feet to the ground. Press down to the floor to increase the circulation to your lower legs and feet., Roll your right ankle in a clock-wise direction. Then, roll it in a counter-clockwise direction. Once you have rolled it in each direction, you have completed one repetition. Complete six repetitions per foot., Engage your core and lift your legs off the ground. Try lifting them 6 inches off the ground. Hold them up for 30 seconds or as long possible. Relax, and place your feet back on the ground. Repeat this exercise six times., Whenever you see the seat belt sign go off, you should take the opportunity to walk up and down the aisles. Walk slowly to ensure safety. Take your time and just stretch your legs by walking up and down the aisles. Every 20 minutes, walk up and down the aisles for a couple minutes (this is another reason why it's a good idea to get an aisle seat)."

Go for a walk right after the trip.,
Seek medical attention for deep vein thrombosis.,
See a doctor if you experience symptoms of a pulmonary embolism.",How to Avoid Blood Clots on Long Flights4," To improve your circulation after a long flight, it is important to take a nice walk. You will likely have to walk to pick up your luggage, which will help a little bit. In addition, you could take a walk outside when you get to your destination., If you feel pain or swelling in either of your feet or legs, you should seek immediate medical attention.


If there is some minor puffiness in your ankles or legs but no pain or any other unusual symptoms, you don’t need to worry. Slight puffiness is not due to blood clotting and is normal with long flights., A pulmonary embolism occurs when a blood clot blocks an artery in your lungs. This blood clot often originates in a person's legs and travels to their lungs. You should seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of the symptoms of a pulmonary embolism such as chest pain or shortness of breath. Likewise, see a doctor if you feel dizzy, start coughing up blood or have difficulty breathing.Pulmonary embolism can be a fatal complication of blood clots."

Make your case about the benefits of unbridled Internet access.,
Consider what benefits might occur if there were more freedom to browse online at your workplace, especially personal-type browsing.,
Pick your battles.,
Explore any negative aspects of introducing free and loose online activity.,
Review your company’s official policy on Internet surfing.",How to Convince Your Boss That Browsing Online Can Boost Productivity1," Do some research on productivity levels and online browsing––the best way to convince your boss that online freedom for all is a good thing is to provide him or her with cold hard facts! You'll need tangible reasons and facts as to how unrestrained browsing will benefit employee productivity and corporate growth:


Use reputable studies, such as The National University of Singapore study, Impact of Cyberloafing on Psychological Engagement, by Don J.Q. Chen and Vivien K.G Lim. Print out the The Wall Street Journal article that discusses the results of this study:

""The researchers found that the Web-surfers were significantly more productive and effective at the tasks than those in the other two groups and reported lower levels of mental exhaustion, boredom and higher levels of engagement.""
""Because Web-surfing can aid productivity, the researchers caution employers against over-restricting workers' Web access. They recommend that managers allow time for limited personal Web browsing 'since it has a salubrious impact on employees' productivity,' while limiting access to personal emails.""


Search for studies that pertain to your specific industry. For more credibility, search for studies that address your particular situation. For example, if you work in a bank, identify studies that have demonstrated increased marketability or employee productivity amongst banks when employees have been allowed to surf the net during their break or in order to research the competition. An easy way to dig up this kind of info is to go to http://scholar.google.com and search for ""internet surfing employees bank"" (replacing ""bank"" with your industry).;
,


What area of your job (and other positions at the company) could be enhanced by more online freedom? No doubt areas such as research, sales and marketing, clarification of legal and financial issues, etc., could be enhanced by unrestrained online browsing but so too can simply knowing what's happening out there with competitors and customers. Go through each department and determine if online browsing would be beneficial company-wide or in certain departments. Also, take into consideration any repercussions if the company were to allow online browsing for some departments and not others.
Look at social media as a way of keeping up. Social media has fast grown as a source of immediate information that can provide feedback on the type of work your company is doing, what competitors are up to, and perhaps even things being said about your company itself. Having a finger on the pulse of what is happening in social media circles can be beneficial for some workplaces.
Use a combination of common sense and studies when trying to convince your boss of the benefit of allowing free time to surf online at work. Some of the benefits will be relevant only to your workplace, while others will be broader for most people in office situations. Some reasons might include:

Employees will feel a greater sense of freedom and work and will therefore not get resentful about only using the internet for work reasons.
Employees will have a ""mental break"" and return to working refreshed and more lively.
Employees won't feel the need to sneak online to check their auction bids or to check the shopping specials. Openness is a good thing in the workplace and has a spill-on effect.
Zoning out can restore intense concentration, which is better than forcing employees to work on relentlessly on the same items.



, Identify which kind of online browsing is acceptable based on your research. For example, perhaps browsing news websites may be acceptable and helpful, whereas allowing employees to play popular social media online games may be detrimental. Maybe doing crosswords is okay, while multi-player shootouts is not.

, Every story has its flip-side and you need to know what the boss might be thinking in response to your feel-good proposal. Honestly consider any negatives that could crop up as a result of having unbridled online surfing such as becoming addicted to online gaming, neglecting work or possibly viewing inappropriate sites. Another concern of many employers is leaving negative messages online in company time, or spats starting up online between employees or competitors. Make a list and compare and contrast positives and negatives. At the end of this list, add solutions that you think will work to help deal with the negatives.

, Has a policy been established? Is it actually banned? It's important to know what you're up against before launching your persuasive techniques on the boss. If Internet use is banned, try to find out how long ago that rule was made, who made it, and why.

Ask for coworker input.,
Create a blind survey surrounding employee productivity and online surfing.,
Keep coworkers real.",How to Convince Your Boss That Browsing Online Can Boost Productivity2," Find out if your coworkers think that online browsing will enhance their productivity. Take a poll and use their input to back your independent research.


Before approaching coworkers, select a handful of peers who work in a variety of departments to provide input. Identify specific employees who are fully engaged in their job and care about the company.

, Compile a short list of questions (10 or less) that will allow you to gauge whether employees share your enthusiasm.


Refer to your studies, independent research and be direct and to the point with each question. For example, word questions such as, “List three reasons why you would be in favor or against online browsing during office hours.”

, Most coworkers will jump with glee at the idea of unlimited online access. While you need them onside, be careful not to oversell the possibilities––stay realistic! You do need to point out limitations and expectations that would probably attach to unlimited online browsing rights (such as their responsibilities and sites they'd probably not be able to use at work). Also take into account relevant security protocols in your workplace––if you don't, someone will point this out.

Allow your boss to ask questions.",How to Convince Your Boss That Browsing Online Can Boost Productivity4," Go directly to the source if you're comfortable, or ask his or her assistant to identify a time that would provide you with about an hour to discuss your proposal.


Suggest an on-site or a lunch meeting, depending upon the type of relationship you have with your boss. If you think your boss may be more receptive to your ideas in a casual environment, opt for a location off-site.
Schedule your appointment during a time when your boss isn’t in the middle of a major project.

, It's important to present a healthy picture of a company doing well, one that values its employees and seeks ways to promote the well-being of employees, as well as focusing on better productivity outcomes. Compare other programs that benefit employees, so that you can liken the open browsing idea to other well-being initiatives in the firm that have all increased employee productivity. Then, relate the desire to open up internet surfing to continuing improving employee productivity.


Where relevant, identify any specific area you know your boss watches every day that has direct links to internet usage and discuss how this is one example of improved productivity through internet usage.

, Transition from company success facts to your plan to improve overall productivity––online browsing.


Refer to your synopsis point-by-point, punctuating why employee online browsing could be beneficial. Don’t go through the entire proposal but instead refer to the synopsis, which provides an overview of your plan.
Identify specific studies that demonstrated how employee online browsing boosts productivity. Point to important studies contained in the synopsis and compare and contrast how the study could be applied to your company.
Explain how online browsing could be implemented specifically at your company. Be sensible about time requests. Treat the free surfing time as you would a tea or coffee break. Perhaps you'd like to suggest that free surfing time should only be during such times or the lunch break rather than during productive work hours––this would depend on the type of workplace you're in. Also clarify that there should be clear parameters put into place as to what can't be viewed––not just the obvious ones like pornography, gambling and hate sites––but also certain game sites, anything that chews up bandwidth or slows down the work system, anything that is considered to be offensive or poor taste, etc.Go into detail about when, where and how employees could spend free downtime on the Internet.

, Be sure you open the floor to questions. Before your meeting, try to anticipate what he or she may ask so that you can be prepared to answer any questions, especially the curly ones.


Inquire if there is any aspect of your proposal that he or she would like to see covered more extensively. Let your boss know that you could conduct additional or more in-depth research on any aspect of the proposal if it will help him or her make a decision.
Have your answers ready to as many negatives as possible, couched in terms of solutions where possible.
