Arrange for a follow up meeting to further discuss your idea.,
Have a concrete implementation plan ready for your follow up meeting.",How to Convince Your Boss That Browsing Online Can Boost Productivity5," Before concluding your initial meeting, request a follow up meeting to re-discuss your proposal. Hopefully your boss will want to study and think about what has just been presented.


Ask your boss when would be the best time to meet. Allow him or her to set the meeting based on his or her schedule. Also, ask if the same time and place works well for him or her.
Provide any additional information or news articles for your boss to consider in between meetings. If your boss seems somewhat dubious about the idea, have several additional news articles or information on hand to give to your boss before you leave the meeting.
Leave the door open to questions from your boss in between meetings. Let your boss know that you are available for questions or discussion at any time.

, Have a specific step-by-step plan surrounding how online office browsing could be implemented at your office.


Include very specific instructions how online browsing will be executed. Identify when, where, how and who will be able to browse freely online. Not only should you identify those areas, back up your assertions with why. For example, based on your research, your corporate mission and goals, explain why the accounting department should be able to freely browse the Internet mid-morning and mid-afternoon for 30 minutes at a time and what the consequences of this will likely be.
Consider a trial period if he or she is still on the fence. If you think your boss is still leery or more unlikely to adopt your plan, ask if he or she would consider a trial period of a few weeks or months? Let your boss know that there is nothing to lose and possibly something to gain as a result.
Offer to track and monitor employee productivity levels. Tracking will be key to making your program a success. Consult with your information technology department to inquire about how you could track online time, sites visited and any other statistics. Then talk to operations about tracking productivity levels so you can compare and contrast the impact of online playing on productivity.

Strive to avoid emotional reactions.,
Listen carefully to what’s being said.,

Report problems.",How to Accept Criticism While at Work," Receiving criticism can be really upsetting, but try not to respond while you're upset. Take some time to understand the circumstances of the criticism and collect yourself before responding.

If you are expected to respond immediately in an upsetting situation, try saying something like, ""May I have some time to process what you've said? I promise to get back to you shortly."";
, Criticism of any kind can be hard to take, but it’s important to listen to exactly what’s being said, so that you understand the problems and can improve your work.If confrontation makes you nervous or upset, it’s okay to ask for criticism to be sent to you in writing (as an email or revision request report) so that you can better process the information.
Just make sure that you take the time to absorb what is being communicated to you.

, Even if you disagree with what’s being said, it’s still important to consider other perspectives and opinions, especially if you’re working in a subjective field, like art or politics.

, It can be hard to receive criticism, but it’s even harder to receive the same criticism twice, so be sure to take careful notes of what’s being said. Record any specific points of reference.

For example, if you’ve just given a presentation and your project leader specifically criticizes the way you constructed your conclusion, be sure to write that down so you can avoid the same problem next time.

, Make sure you understand what the criticism entails. You won’t be able to improve if you don’t understand what’s wrong, so be sure to request clarifications or ask questions if you have any. Asking questions also shows that you want to improve and get the task right next time.Make sure to ask questions in a positive and specific way.
For example, “When you mentioned that my data tables were too busy, would it be better to separate the information into sub-tables or do I just need to adjust the presentation style, in terms of font type and size?

, As hard as it can be to accept criticism, it’s still important to be gracious and thank people for the time they are taking to help improve your work. Even if you don’t feel thankful in the moment, you’ll be glad you said it when you see your skill level improve., Don’t waste time being upset or down about criticism. Instead, get to work right away. Do your best to incorporate the criticism into your revised work, so that you don’t forget what was advised., Once your revisions are complete or you have done your best to incorporate feedback, ask your boss or manager to quickly look over your work to check that you properly addressed the criticism.

Not only does this show respect and a desire to improve, but it is also gives you time to develop and refine your skills without the pressure of a formal performance or subsequent confrontation about it.

, Criticism is easier to take when you assume that the people who are offering it to you are just trying to help you and make your work better.If you assume that people are using their criticism to try to cut you down or make you feel bad, you will emit negative emotions and responses, which is not helpful to them or you.

, Learning and mastering an art or trade is a lifetime process. There is always something everyone can do to make their work even better, so try to embrace criticism. It’s part of the path to success., You may be correct in your result but wrong in the way you got there. Different people prefer different ways of doing things and there is usually more than one way to accomplish a task. Be open to alternative ways of achievement. It’s the best way to learn!

, This might seem counter-intuitive – especially if you hate criticism – but by asking for it, you are putting yourself in an empowerment position. Instead of people coming to you to tell you what’s wrong, you can go to them first and ask, even if everyone seems happy with your work.


Consider asking questions like, “How can I make this project even better?” “What can I do better next time?” “Is there anything I can do to improve my performance?”
Asking for criticism helps you improve at a faster rate, which means you may be promoted, given a raise, or given more responsibility at a faster rate, too.

, If you continually make the same mistake, criticism will never go away. It’s better to make new mistakes with new improvement than have your personal growth stunted because you haven’t fixed old mistakes.


To avoid making the same mistakes, always tackle new tasks with old criticism in mind.

, Everyone gets tired and loses focus, especially after a long day or at the end of the week. It’s easy to make silly mistakes when you feel worn out, so be sure to double check your work at least twice before submitting it.

, Don’t wait for others to tell you what’s wrong. Take the time to regularly assess your own work. Being your own toughest critic can be a good thing. If you fix the problem before it becomes a habit, others won’t need to criticize you for it., If you find it increasingly hard to accept criticism from someone, politely talk to him or her about it. Explain your perspective and how their criticism makes you feel.For example, if your manager is constantly giving you extra work but complaining that you’re late in turning it in, try saying something like, “I’m aware of my late submissions and I am sorry for them, but I have trouble meeting deadlines when I am assigned extra work I don’t always have time to complete. Could we work together to sort this out?”

, If you’ve tried hard to be open and adaptable, yet the criticism keeps coming or feels unfair or uncalled for, you might need to report it to someone higher up. Avoid sounding like a “tattle-tail,” however, and try to maintain a professional, objective, willing attitude.


For example, you could request a meeting with your boss and say, “I’ve mentioned that the reason my work is late is because I am being given extra work on top of my normal assignments. I don’t like disappointing my team, but I can’t turn work in before the deadline if I am not given enough time to complete it. Do you have any suggestions for resolving this issue?”

Every occupational therapy program has different requirements, but most will require you to have previous coursework in biology and/or physiology in order to apply.,
Complete an accredited occupational therapy program.,
Pass the National Board for Certification of Occupational Therapists exam.,
Apply for a license in your state and pay any necessary fees.,
Work through a government agency.,
Work through a non-profit.,
Work for an agency, hospital, or clinic.,
Set up your own private practice.,
Know how often you need to renew your license.,
Continue your education.,
Pay the necessary fee.",How to Become an Occupational Therapist,"


Biology, psychology, and sociology are among the most common undergraduate majors to have for those planning to enter an occupational therapy program.
Verify the requirements for your occupational therapy program of choice before you finish your undergraduate work. That way, you can be sure to complete all the preliminaries you need by the time you earn your bachelor's degree.;
, Most programs are two years in length and result in a master's degree, but longer, more extensive doctoral programs are also available. All require both Level I and Level II Fieldwork to obtain clinical experience. Fieldwork is supervised and usually lasts for roughly 24 weeks.


The American Occupational Therapy Association, Inc., has a complete list of accredited occupational therapy programs. This list is available on their website.Note that some schools offer dual programs that result in the simultaneous completion of a bachelor's and master's degree. These programs usually take five years to complete. Additionally, there are online programs available through some schools.

, All states require occupational therapists to have a license, and prospective therapists must have certification from the NBCOT in order to obtain a license.

, Specific requirements and fees vary by state and may change from year to year, so you should look up the requirements from the occupational therapy licensure board for the state you plan to work in.


Some states only require prospective occupational therapists to pay a fee and complete the NBCOT exam, as well as the prerequisites necessary to take the exam. For instance, in New York, you must have completed an accredited Occupational Therapist Program earning an entry-level master's degree or post-baccalaureate certificate, finished at least six months of supervised field work, and passed the NBCOT with a score of 450 or higher.Other states require prospective occupational therapists to pay a fee, complete the NBCOT exam, and pass a state-specific written exam or questionnaire. First-time license applicants in Texas, for example, take an online, open-book Jurisprudence Exam that covers rules and regulations specific to the state.A few states also grant leeway to applicants who were previously licensed in another state. Occupational therapists must still apply for a new state license before working in a different state, but some states permit previously licensed applicants to work under limited conditions while the application process progresses. In California, applicants can work in association with a California-licensed therapist up to 60 days after applying for a state license.In New York, applicants can work under the same conditions up to one year.
Fees vary by state, but first-time applicants usually end up paying a couple hundred dollars. In Texas, the fee as of 2012 was $140, but in New York, the fee was $294.

, Occupational therapy jobs can be found in the public sector at the federal, state, and local levels, but these jobs are most common at the state and local levels.


Use an online database of government positions. Do a search for ""occupational therapist"" positions and browse through the results until you find one located in a state that you can practice in or wish to practice in.
Contact local and state agencies directly. If there is a specific agency you wish to work at, call your local branch and inquire about current or future positions.
The most common government agencies and offices in need of occupational therapists are state hospitals, state nursing homes, branches of the military, offices of veterans' affairs, and public schools.

, Most therapy-oriented non-profits are charities run for those who cannot otherwise afford proper care. These charities usually work with patients to relieve pain and evaluate future needs.


Search in the phone book or online for charitable occupational therapy opportunities in your area. You can find job openings using most major job search websites or by searching through the Yellow Pages for existing occupational therapist offices or charities.
Consider a career with children. Most non-profit occupational therapy jobs involve working with children, especially when those children have chronic and costly medical conditions or come from low-income families.
Prepare to make home visits. While many non-profits work from a centralized location, some also offer home visitation services for patients who must struggle in order to leave the house.

,

As the population ages there's an increased need for occupational therapists to help older adults age safely in their homes, by managing chronic disease, and adapting to low vision, cognitive issues, and other changes associated with aging.

, Occupational therapists often operate as doctors do, working in their own private practices through private hospitals or from an independent medical office.


Take business courses. You do not need a business degree, but having one wouldn't hurt, either. At the very least, you should take a few entrepreneurial courses and business finance or accounting classes to gain an understanding of the business side of things. Essentially, you'll be running your own business, so you need to have a thorough understanding of what that entails.
Find out about state and local regulations. Aside from needing to be licensed as an occupational therapist, you will also need to meet zoning regulations, building codes, and various health and safety codes.
Determine your field of specialty. A general occupational therapist will work with patients of all ages and backgrounds, but you can also specialize in pediatric or geriatric care.
Get the word out. Once you start your practice, you will need to attract patients. One of the best ways to do so is by forming professional relationships with area doctors who may be willing to refer in-need patients to your office.

, Regulations vary by state, but most states will require occupational therapists to renew their licenses every two years.


In Texas, therapists must renew their licenses every two years after the year the license was first issued.
In California, a license must be renewed every two years based on the holder's year of birth. Someone born in an even year will always renew in an even year, but someone born in an odd year will always renew in an odd year.
In Pennsylvania, licenses always expire in odd-numbered years.Similarly, in Virginia, licenses always expire in even-numbered years.States will usually send out notifications to let you know that your license needs to be renewed, but you will be responsible for renewing it even if the notice does not arrive.

, Each state has its own requirements for continuing education. Usually, renewal of a license requires a therapist to complete a certain number of Professional Development Units (PDUs).


In California, practitioners must complete 24 PDUs. These PDUs usually involve things like performing professional services, attending workshops and classes, making presentations, doing fieldwork supervision, and publishing academically.
In Texas, continued education must include 30 credit hours of courses and practical experience that goes beyond standard practice. Practitioners must also retake to Jurisprudence Exam.

, Renewal fees vary by state. You can look up the renewal fees for your state online or by contacting the division of professional licensing for your state via telephone.


In Texas, renewal fees total $242. In California, the fee is only $150. Some fees are even lower, however. For instance, Pennsylvania only charges a $55 fee for renewal.

Manage the pain.",How to Exercise," You will want to wear clothes that will not restrict your movements or blood flow. Don’t wear clothes which are too tight, especially around your joints. You will also want to wear clothing which is made of a material which breathes well, since you will sweat when doing many forms of exercise. Clothes specifically designed for exercise can easily be found.;
, Just because we call them tennis shoes does not mean they are great athletic shoes. Shoes like Converse have little shock absorbency and can be terrible for your feet and bones. Get shoes which fit comfortably and are designed for the type of activity that you intend to do.

, Drink lots of water before you exercise. Your body will need the water to help your muscles work and also to help you sweat. If you’re dehydrated before you start, just think about how you’ll feel afterwards!

, Don’t stretch before exercising. Contrary to popular belief, studies have shown that this is not helpful and will not allow you to perform any better. If anything, stretching before exercising will make you worse off: it’s a great way to pull or strain a muscle and hurt yourself!

, Though researchers cannot agree definitively on whether or not warm ups help you to perform better in exercises, they all agree that warming up certainly won’t hurt.Warm up before exercising by doing a less intense version of your intended workout for 5-10 minutes. If you plan to run, jog first. If you intend to swim, swim slowly.

, Certain conditions may make it a good idea to check with your doctor before starting an exercise regimen. There are exercises for every health condition, but it’s a good idea to know what to avoid. Exercising should make you feel healthy and good in your own body: not hurt you!


If you have diseases or conditions like asthma or lung problems, arthritis, diabetes or liver and kidney problems, or heart disease, definitely talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise regimen.If you notice certain problems, you will also want to talk to a doctor. These include things like pain or dizziness following physical exertion, shortness of breath after very mild exertion or when at rest, or swelling in the ankles.
You may also want to talk to a doctor simply to find out what kind of exercise they recommend for your particular goals and health conditions. You can also consult with a nutritionist and a trainer for more information on exercising and how you can best meet your goals.

, Aerobic exercise is often called a “cardio” workout, since it is designed to increase and improve blood flow. These types of exercises are of a lower intensity but last for longer periods of time.

, Climbing stairs is a great way to get your heart rate up. You can climb actual stairs or you can use a stair machine at a gym. Climbing stairs improves your leg muscles as well as your butt. Be careful if using actual stairs, however, as you do not want to fall and get seriously injured. 

, This is not just a fun game for children but also an excellent workout. Working the arms, legs and core muscles, this is an exercise that you can easily do at home. It is also well known for improving balance and is excellent for people who intend to play sports.

, Jumping jacks are an exercise performed by standing with the legs together, arms at your side, and then jumping to move the legs outward and raising the arm together above your head. Jump again to return to the starting position. These are great for getting your heart rate up and burning calories.

, Walking and jogging are wonderful ways to get your heart rate up. Though jogging may be difficult on the knees for some people, walking is certainly an accessible exercise and should be done by those at every level. Studies have shown that walking an hour a day can help you maintain your weight over time and reduce your likelihood of certain conditions, like hypertension and obesity. , Swimming is great exercise and is fun to boot. This will work different muscles depending on the style of swimming you do. Swimming is frequently recommended for people with joint problems or those that are significantly overweight, as it can take a great deal of strain off of the skeleton while still raising the heart rate.

, Riding your bike is an accessible, environmentally friendly, and very effective way to get exercise. Working muscles in most areas of the body, bike riding will get your heart rate up while it gets you somewhere! You can bike outside or you can get a stationary bike and stay at home.

, Anaerobic exercises are those done at a higher intensity for shorter periods of time. These build strength and help your body to become accommodated to working hard. Paired with a healthy diet, these exercises can also help you to lose weight, as your body’s caloric use will increase. These types of exercise are actually arguably better for burning fat than aerobic exercises. , Running is tough on the knees and bone structure but is still an excellent form of exercise. You can run locally around your neighborhood or around a track at a gym. Remember that running is different than jogging: it’s much faster and much harder to do!

, There are many different types of weights you can lift and ways to lift them, but doing this type of exercise will help you build a variety of muscles and increase your strength. Be sure to start small and work your way up, since trying to lift something which is too heavy is a common way to injure yourself.

, Push ups are done by placing yourself with your stomach on the ground. Place your feet so that your toes are flat on the ground, then place your hands flat on the ground at face level, a shoulder’s width apart. Then, keeping the line of your back and legs completely straight, lift your body with your arms by pushing against the ground so that your whole body is supported on your toes and hands. Lower yourself back down so that your nose is nearly touching the ground and then raise yourself back up. Repeat.

, Squats are done by standing with your feet a shoulder’s width apart, back straight, arms crossed in front of you, and slowly lowering yourself down as if to sit in a chair. Once in the sitting position, slowly raise yourself back up. These are a great exercise for your core and leg muscles.

, Burpees (a common military exercise) are done starting in a standing position, then drop to a crouch, jump the legs back into push-up position, do one push-up (if you want), hop your legs back to the crouch position, and then jump straight upwards with hands raised to return to the standing position. This is a great workout as it exercises all areas of the body.

, Core workouts develop the muscles around your abdomen. This has many benefits. With a stronger core, you will be less prone to back pain and injury and you will also be able to improve bad posture. Paired with weight loss, strong core muscles will also give you defined abs.

, Planks are probably the most efficient core exercise. You can greatly improve your core strength with just a few minutes of this exercise every day. Planks are done by taking a position similar to a push up, but supporting the upper half of your body on your forearms and holding the position for as long as possible. It will surprise you how difficult it is if you’ve never tried it but the exercise is extremely effective.

, Crunches are another great core exercise, done by lying face up, knees bent, arms crossed at your chest, and lifting just the head and shoulder up towards the pelvis. Lower yourself back down and repeat.

, Sit ups are similar to crunches and are done by lying face up, knees bent only slightly, and rolling your upper body into a sitting position. You can cross your arms in front of you or run your palms up and down your thighs as you move to guide your movement.

, Bridges are a great core exercise because they also work on your bottom and lower back muscles. These are done by lying on your back, with your knees bent and your arms flat on the ground at your sides. Slowly roll your back and lift your hips until a straight line is created between your shoulders and knees, your back and thighs parallel, and then slowly lower it back into starting position.

, T’ai chi is a Chinese martial art, the forms of which are done in sequences of slow movements. Doing t’ai chi will allow you to build better balance but it can also be very relaxing. Find a local group to practice with or take a class from a local gym or community center. You can also find lessons online or DVDs which will allow you to practice at home.

, Weight shifts are a great starting balancing exercise. These are done by standing with both feet on the ground, hip width apart. Next, shift all of your weight onto one leg and lift the other slightly off of the floor. Hold the position, trying to maintain good form, for 30 seconds. Do the other leg. Repeat as much as you want. , These are done same as the above, with the exception that the lifted leg is bent backwards at the knee. This will work on your front-to-back balance, whereas the previous one focuses more on side-to-side. Both should be used in conjunction.

, Pilates is a series of forms and movements which occasionally makes use of tools like exercise balls, weights, and resistance bands. This form of exercise helps train muscles with the correct movement patterns which can improve balance, core strength, posture and flexibility. Find a local group to practice with or take a class from a local gym or community center. You can also find lessons online or DVDs which will allow you to practice at home.

, Yoga is an Indian meditation technique and exercise which has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety (in turn aiding weight loss) and is excellent for building better balance and flexibility. Find a local group to practice with or take a class from a local gym or community center. You can also find lessons online or DVDs which will allow you to practice at home.

, Various forms of dance, such as ballet, are actually fairly rigorous exercise and can significantly improve your flexibility, as well as your coordination. Find a local group to practice with or take a class from a local gym or community center.

, Stretches should be done after warming up or exercising, as this will help prevent muscle strain and injury. Stretching your muscles will help provide much greater flexibility and can reduce the likelihood of injury due to strain during other exercises later on.A basic stretch to try is a hamstring stretch. This is done by sitting, splaying your legs apart, and reaching forward to touch one foot at a time. You can bend the leg which is not being reached across.
Another basic stretch is a butterfly groin stretch. This is done by sitting on the floor and pulling both ankles in towards your crotch, getting as close as you can. Try to press your knees to the floor as you do this.
Try a simple shoulder stretch. This is done by pulling your elbow across the front of your body towards the opposite shoulder. Press against your arm as you do this.
This wall stretch aids mobility in the chest, shoulders, abs, hip flexors, quads and calves. Face a wall standing about a foot away from it, then reach your hands up as high as you can flat against the wall, leaning forward into it with your chest and hips while keeping your feet in position flat on the floor.

, You don’t have to dedicate hours of your day to exercising. Anything helps, so find ways to fit exercise into the smaller “in between” moments of your day. You can do squats while you wait for food to cook or microwave or fit in a minute of planks when you first wake up. Look and you will find moments in your day to get a little more active.

, If you spend most of your day sitting in a desk chair, you will find you have a lot to gain from finding an alternative. Using a standing desk or a standing desk in combination with a treadmill will get you burning calories while you work (it doesn’t even have to be fast paced, though the harder it is the more you’ll get out of it). If that’s not for you, try an exercise ball instead of a desk chair. Some research has found that using these methods can help you lose over 40 lbs a year if you’re overweight. , When getting to your apartment or office, skip the elevator and take the stairs instead. This is great because you can add a floor at a time as it becomes easier for you to get up the stairs. Eventually you can also run up the stairs for some added exercise.

, Whenever you can, stop using your car if it is possible for you to get yourself where you’re going on foot or on a bike. Turn grocery shopping into a workout by walking to the store a few times a week to pick up a smaller number of items. Take a bus to work and get off a few stops early to walk. Ride your bike to work if you can. If you have to take your car, park really far away from your building. This is a great way to introduce physical activity into your day. , This can be broken up into three 10 minute sets.

, If you can, do these in one set. However, they can be broken up into 2-3 sets.

, This will obviously need to be broken up. Simply keep the position for as long as you can, rest for a few seconds, and then return.

, If you can, do these in one set. However, they can be broken up into 2-3 sets.

, Sit in a chair, stand up and repeat. You can try doing these squats without the chair if you have the strength and balance to do so., This can be broken up into two half-hour sets.

, If you can, do these in one set. However, they can be broken up into 2-3 sets.

, This will obviously need to be broken up. Simply keep the position for as long as you can, rest for 30 seconds, and then return.

, If you can, do these in one set. However, they can be broken up into 2-3 sets., This can be broken up into three 5 minute sets.

, This can be broken up into two half-hour sets.

, If you can, do these in one set. However, they can be broken up into 2-3 sets.

, At this point you need to work in variations like the side plank and reverse plank as well. Simply keep the position for as long as you can, rest for a minute, and then return., You will want to choose weights and positions based on the muscle groups you wish to focus on. Break up the hour into three 20 minute sets and try to work different muscle groups in each set., This can be broken up into three 10 minute sets.

, Interval training is any exercise done at a very high intensity for only a few brief minutes (2-3 at most) and alternated with either no activity or a slow paced activity. Interval training is widely regarded to be one of the most effective exercise regimens, since it is less time consuming but appears to produce identical effects., The most basic interval training routine would be to sprint for 2-3 blocks (or the equivalent of 400 meters) and then walk back to the starting point, beginning the process over again.


An alternative would be to combine this with an aerobic workout. Warm up by walking slowly for five minutes, quickly for ten minutes, sprint for three blocks, walk back two block, sprint for three blocks, walk back two blocks (and so on, lasting 15 minutes), and then walking back quickly to your origin point to cool down.

, You can apply interval training to almost any exercise activity. Try cycling, swimming, many core exercises, and so on. Try to alternate between exercise activities on different days to ensure that all of your muscle groups get attention.

, You will want to set your goal for exercising at least ½ an hour a day. Slowly, over time, you should draw this out to 1 hour. This time period, however, can be broken up into sections and spread over the course of the day, however, those sections should be no less than 10 minutes. When you begin, exercise at least 2 days a week. Over time you should increase your frequency up to 5 days a week., Walking is the best thing you can do for improving your health. As discussed above, a study found that a mixture of intense and relaxed walking in senior citizens decreased the likelihood of certain diseases by 20%. You can walk with your friends, family members, or by yourself. If you want to walk in the comfort of indoors, you can walk around the inside of your apartment building or you can walk the inner corridor of the local mall. You can also walk outside if you prefer.


Try to walk for at least half an hour a day and go at a pace that gets your heart rate up. If you do not push your body at least a little, you will not gain nearly as much from the exercise.

, As we age, we tend to lose a lot of our balance. This is normal. However, you will want to work on your balance to help ensure that you can move around without hurting yourself. Do balance exercises to protect yourself and prevent injury.A good, basic balance exercise is to try standing on one leg. Make sure to do both legs in turn and to also have a chair nearby to hold on to if necessary to prevent falling.

, Muscles lose their elasticity over time, which can make it difficult for you to move around or get up if you fall. Do flexibility exercises like stretches to maintain your muscles and keep you safe and independent. , Lift small, 2lb weights (more if you can). This will help you maintain the strength in your hands and arms, allowing you greater independence for longer.

, Cool down exercises, like warm up exercises, are a gentler exercise, meant to ease your body between working hard and being at rest. Cool down by walking for 5-10 minutes and (preferably) stretching. Stretching before exercising is likely to cause injury but stretching after exercise, when the muscles are warm and active, will help improve their tone and flexibility., When you exercise, your muscles use up and your body sweats out a number of essential nutrients. You need to replace these nutrients or you can hurt yourself or become sick. These nutrients, water, sodium, potassium, and sugar, can be consumed in a number of ways. You could try drinking water and eating a banana or drinking water and eating a protein bar, among a variety of other options. If you choose to drink a sports drink, it is best to dilute the drink at a ration of 6 to 1 (that is 6 parts water for each part drink) since these drink's sugar content is unnecessarily high.

, Exercising, especially the kind that pushes your body beyond its comfort level (the good kind!), can cause muscle pain and discomfort. This is normal and a healthy sign of your body getting into shape and becoming stronger. You may want to manage the pain though. This can be done by taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen or using an ice pack.Intense pain with a fast onset is an indication that you have injured yourself. Consult with a doctor or nurse, especially if it is very severe or lasts for more than a few days.
Prevent muscle pain to begin with by slowly easing into exercise, both in an individual routine but also over the course of time. Don’t leap straight into a high intensity program but rather build yourself up to that level over the course of several months.

Invite everyone you'd like to come.,
Decorate the room where the party is held.,
Make the largest screen in your home the focal point for the party.,
Serve a buffet.,
Include drinks.,
Consider having a mini Olympic Games in the backyard to keep the kids entertained.,
Hold an Olympics trivia quiz.",How to Hold an Olympics Closing Ceremony Party," It's best to keep a party like this informal, and perhaps even a drop-in occasion to let people come and go as they please. Send out email and text invitations or simply call people and ask them over.


Encourage everyone to wear their favorite sporting gear, to add to the sporty theme of the party. If anyone is coming back from playing sport that day, ask them to stay in that mode!;
, Look for Olympic themed decorations and use the five Olympic colors (blue, yellow, black, green and red) for color themes. Print out the Olympic mascot to pin up here and there, add some balloons and streamers and perhaps add a few print-outs of a few fun Olympics achievements statistics for people to read as they're seated. If any Olympic athlete that you have been following devotedly has achieved something amazing in the Olympics, why not print out his or her photo and display it proudly as well.

, Everyone will want to watch the ceremony at various points during the party, if not the entire time, so have plenty of room for all guests in front of the screen. Set out extra chairs, cushions, and other seats to make it comfortable for everyone.


Does the TV's sound travel well? If not, you might need to get some additional speakers to make sure the sound can reach everyone.
Include small areas to rest drinks and snacks, such as coffee tables, small tables, boxes, etc. It can be awkward if guests can't set down drinks and plates.
If you have too many guests and not enough space in one area, consider using other areas that have TVs or borrow a friend's extra TV to set up another room. This might be a good way to keep noisier kids happy in one room while the adults watch more peacefully in another.

, The easiest style for a sports party is usually buffet style, with occasional snacks being handed around as well. While you could go to the trouble of making food with a theme, such as your country's national colors, the shapes of various sporting gear, etc., you don't have to. Party food of all sorts will work well. Suggestions include:


Dips and chips, finger food, cheese and crackers, bowls of nibbles, spiced nuts, etc. If you don't have any of the other food suggestions below, at least have snack foods available.
Sliced meats, savory pies, buffalo wings, pizza, curries, etc. for savory foods. Include plates and cutlery for serving and eating with.
Cupcakes, doughnuts/churros, whoopie pies, dessert pies, cookies, cheesecake, candies, etc. for sweet foods.
Healthy foods like salads, fruit kebabs, sugar- or gluten-free options, etc.
If you want to make Olympic themed food, try such approaches as using the Olympic colors, turning items like bagels, pizzas or cookies into the Olympic rings, decorating cakes and pies with sporting themes, etc.

, The usual drinks from lemonade and sodas to beer and wine are good choices. If you want something fancier, consider making Jell-O shots, cocktails/mocktails, mixed drinks and alcohol-pops.

, Hold small races (running, sack races, egg and spoon races, etc.), set up a mini obstacle course or hurdles, have target throwing practice for prizes, play ball games, throw paper planes or other paper objects over distances, and if you have a pool, perhaps include supervised swimming races or even synchronized swimming! If adults get involved, simply make the games harder or challenge them to a tug of war, which was once an actual Olympic event.


Encourage teams if there are lots of kids, or if the adults would like to join in. Have each team develop its own mascot (give them paper, stuffed toys, markers, etc. to do this with).
Set out an area with soft mats for anyone who is good at gymnastics or who simply wants to try out some cartwheels and handstands.
Award the children with medals for their wins. These could be made from cardboard, paper, etc. attached to ribbon, or you could use chocolate coins attached to a ribbon.

, Some of the party guests might enjoy testing their wits about all things Olympic. There are several possible approaches to this:


Run a pub-style quiz that only uses the Olympics for the subject-matter.
Play Trivial Pursuit but replace the cards with your own Olympic themed ones. This would be a lot of effort though!
Make a pass-the-parcel that can only have each layer opened upon answering an Olympic-related question.
Simply ask Olympic-related questions for on-the-spot prizes throughout the party.

Add a little gloss or balm.",How to Apply Makeup for a Professional Setting," Are you someone who wears makeup regularly? Or are you just getting started? Do you want to wear makeup in a professional setting or do you feel you have to? Even though there is research showing that women who wear makeup at work are often perceived as more competent and likable, this isn't a hard and fast rule. Lots of high-powered women don't wear makeup in a professional setting and have not been taken less seriously. So do what feels best to you and what you feel comfortable doing., Foundation? Concealer? Mascara? Eyeshadow? Lipstick? Blush? The world of makeup is a big one, so think about what exactly you want to highlight, as you may not want to be putting on a full face every day. Ask yourself which features you want to accentuate and enhance.


Remember that look needs to stand the test of time; you don’t want to have to keep retouching your look when you have to dash from meeting to meeting.Consider how much of a luminance contrast you would like. Luminance contrast refers to how much the eyes and lips stand out compared with skin. Recall the old fairytale of how Snow White’s lips were as red as blood, and her skin was as white as snow? That's the luminance contrast in action! This concept is still popular today; recent research has shown that makeup makes women appear younger by increasing the contrast between facial features (like eyes and lips) and skin tone., A CEO might wear different makeup to work than a bar owner, and it's important to stay setting-appropriate.


Decide whether your professional environment is conservative (very formal, a suits-and-pantyhose kind of setting), business casual (less conservative but still buttoned up and professional), or casual (no dress code or standard). If you're in the last category, then you don't really have to worry - you can do your makeup however you want! Nevertheless, the suggestions below may give you some fun things to consider or try.Look at respected individuals around you in your field, and see what kind of makeup they wear on a daily basis.

, Once you've decided what you want to wear, you'll need to see what you already have and what you need. The average person will most likely need some sort of foundation, neutral eyeshadow, mascara, and lipstick. If you are more experienced with makeup, you may use a few more products.


If you're a newbie to makeup, you might want to visit a makeup store or counter in department store and get some one-on-one help. Makeup artists and consultants will help you choose the right color products for your skin tone and facial features. Getting the right shades and complementary colors for your skin and feature is what makes makeup enhance your natural beauty, rather than turn you into a frightening weekday clown!

, Prep your weekday looks on Sunday evenings, so that you don't have to spend time planning what to wear and how to match your makeup. This will also save time during those busy morning rushes to get out the door.Pull out a couple of eye shadows, lipsticks, your blush, base, and mascara, and put them in a makeup bag by the sink in your bathroom. That way you won't have to rummage through your drawers to find a particular color right when you're trying to make it to work on time.

, Using your fingers, a small makeup sponge or a foundation brush, apply an even layer of product all over your face. When applying foundation, less is more.









If the foundation does not match your skin tone, there will be a harsh line around your jawline. Either find a foundation that suits you better, or blend the foundation down your neck for a better result that looks more put together.
Make sure your base isn't too thick. It is better to apply light coverage than to look like you have caked on way too much product, especially if you want the look to last throughout the day.The ""dewy skin"" look can be beautiful, but it does tend to get shiny over the course of the day. Matte foundation is the best choice for this reason., Lightly dusting a face powder over your face will create a smooth, matte look. Most importantly, face powder helps to control shine and sets the foundation in place.









If you're worried that your face will get oily and/or shiny throughout the day, carry some blotting papers and your face powder with you so you can do some touchups at lunch if need be., Using a blush brush, sweep the blush of your choice on the upper cheekbones.









While you might love the rosy, ""fresh out of the cold"" glow that blush gives, you might consider being a bit more conservative with blush for professional settings. Too much blush can overwhelm the face and create a slightly garish and overdone look.
Think of blush as a way to add a touch of color to the smooth and even base you just created. Be careful about using anything too shimmery; that said, a touch of shimmer looks nice under the fluorescent lights of an office. For once you can use the light to your benefit, as it will bounce off and accentuate your cheekbones.Use something sheer in which color can be built upon., A primer will keep the eye shadow from caking into the creases of your eyelids as the day goes by. This is key for your eye makeup to last all day without you having to retreat to the bathroom to re-do it.







, Using a clean brush, apply a light sweep of the eye shadow of your choice across the lip (the part under the curve where your eyeball meets the socket). Blend it so that the color brushes evenly across your lid, without streaks or naked patches.









You will probably want to go for subtlety, rather than show off your blending skills. Save those for after work!
Earth toned eye shadows are universally flattering. They're also a lot more than ""boring browns."" For example, they can be rich red-browns, brilliant bronzes, light washes of golds, delicate taupes and silky greys. There are truly a ton of options when it comes to subtle shades.
Glittery colors should be avoided. Save your bright, neon, and sparkly shades for the weekend!, You can use an eyeliner pencil or a gel or cream and a small, angled eyeliner brush. Start from the outer corner and draw right along your lashline. Continue this line all the way to the inner corner of your eye and then stop.








A thin, even line all across your lashes will make them look thicker and more lovely.
Try brown or grey eyeliner if you want something less bold than black for an everyday look., Roll the wand from the base to the end of your lashes to help separate and lengthen lashes.A light brush of mascara is sufficient for a professional setting.









Don't skip the mascara! Of all the eye products, it's probably the most important. Mascara defines and lengthens your lashes and is necessary to create that much sought-after luminance contrast because it makes your eyes look larger and pop.
Make sure that eyelashes stay separated after application. Don't let the mascara clump the lashes together.
If your eyelashes tend to stick straight out rather than curl slightly, use an eyelash curler to build the curl before applying mascara.

, Your eyebrows do more than protect your eyes; they're also a focal feature on your face and can be very expressive. Keeping them neat and tidy is well worthwhile.








Keep them plucked (but not overly) to create a nice strong brow. If you don't feel comfortable or able to pluck yourself, visit a salon for a wax. Waxing lasts longer and you can consult with the stylist about the shape you'd like and what suits your face.
Enhance your natural brows by filling them in with powder or a tinted brow gel. Remember to fill in, rather than draw on. This is what separates the professional woman from the cartoon character.

, Unlike with eye colors, you can feel comfortable experimenting a little more with lip colors. That said, tones that are light to moderate in color saturation are the most recommended.Most skin tones suit soft pinks or nude-browns. Matte, pinky nudes are currently very popular and create a polished, sophisticated and natural look by highlighting and not simply covering your lips.Remember that if you choose a brighter color, it will likely fade as the day goes, so you'll want to remember to check and reapply as needed.

, Using a brush can help create a fuller look across the entire lips. Make sure not to overdraw your lips, which can look fake and unappealing.









A lip brush is good to use especially if you're going for a brighter color. With the brush, apply lipstick starting at the center of the upper lip and moving outward towards each corner.Remember to check that you didn't get any on your teeth - there are few things more embarrassing than showing up to a meeting in a professional setting than having lipstick on your teeth and not realizing it until later,

, Glosses can add a bit of a sheen to a matte lipstick and catch the light nicely. If you're someone who frequently rubs your lips together, gloss or balm can also help protect the integrity of the lipstick underneath.









Glosses or balms are especially good for anyone hesitant to the idea of wearing lipstick. A a sheer finish with a tinted balm or gloss can enhance your overall appearance, even if you forgo lip gloss.A flavored gloss or balm can also be a good idea if you don't like the taste or smell of your lipstick.

Be sincere.,
Ditch personal glory.,
Stay emotionally strong.,
Expect their best performance.,
Acknowledge problems.,
Make those problems seem smaller.,
Draw on cultural examples.,
Give them hope.",How to Inspire People1," If you seem fake or insincere, no one will be inspired. They would never be impressed with you if you are trying to be someone. They have to think that you believe what you're saying and you have your own concept in life which you believe in living it. If you don't believe, if you're just peddling snake oil as it were, then why should they believe you? The best way to be real, and show that this matters to you to is to make it actually matter to you. Be enthusiastic and throw yourself into what you do. After all its your life.;
, Try not to use yourself as an example when inspiring people. This tends to make it seem like you're making things all about how cool you are. Instead, leave it at a simple ""I know where you're coming from"" or ""I've done this before"" and then turn it immediately back around to them. Only share your experiences if they ask.

, Never let the people you're trying to inspire see you get really angry or really upset. Stay strong. People get nervous when undertaking difficult tasks, and they need to know that someone is in control of the situation. If you can't handle the pressure then how can they?

, Don't set the bar low. Don't disrespect them by acting like you think they can't accomplish anything. Expect and show them that you expect that they can do great (but not impossible) things.


It is important to only ask for things that they can achieve, and the bar is usually best set right above goals they have previously accomplished.

, If there are hurdles, acknowledge them. Identify what they are. But you should also identify how those hurdles can be handled. Emphasize that they are surmountable. This will give your audience confidence that you are prepared.

, Once you've acknowledged the problems that you may face, make those problems seem not only insurmountable but small. Compare them to other problems that have been faced or talk about why they may not even be problems at all.

, Examples from popular culture or history are a great way to inspire people for all sorts of purposes. You can use inspirational movies, historical figures, quotes, or even hurdles that they themselves have overcome in the past.

, Hope is the most important thing for inspiring people. You have to give them hope. They need to think that there is a goal, a light at the end of the tunnel, a reward for the struggles that they'll face. How you do this will depend on your situation, just make sure not to end on a down note.

Ask yourself: Who am I?,
Ask a friend who knows you well to help you.,
Look up the meanings of words that you've designated as your weaknesses and strengths.,
Look at your list of weaknesses.,
Learn to be humble.,
Keep it real.,
Stop telling yourself negative stuff.,
Speak to yourself as if you were your friend.,
Never put yourself down.,
Make peace with yourself.,
Keep learning and allowing yourself to change.",How to Love Yourself First," This simple sounding question is actually very hard to answer. It is a question that goes directly to the root of your values, beliefs, doubts, sense of reality and even the external perceptions imposed upon you by others, whether or not true. When asking yourself this question, try the following:


Make a list of the traits, talents, skills and thoughts that you feel make up the person you are right now.
Ensure that you have a reasonable amount of both virtues and vices––everyone has at least eight good traits and eight less desirable ones. Don't beat yourself up––it's a whole bundle and you get to work on the parts you don't like. What matters is recognition at this point, acknowledging which traits you feel let you down in some way and finding good traits that you have probably never even thought about.
Take your time answering this question. It isn't likely to be something you'll answer over a cup of coffee. Start the ball rolling by giving yourself this question as a task for at least the next week, maybe even longer. Recall it when going about your daily duties. Then set a time to come back to writing down all the things you've decided make up who you are. Take the time to appreciate yourself. Find out what makes you unique and different from everyone else.
If you can, try to answer these as well: Who am I, what am I, where am I, why am I me, when was I, and how am I?;
, If you feel confronted by having someone else point out your good and bad points, remember that if you do not agree with their evaluation you don’t have to accept it––it's their external perception of you and they can't really know you deep down. But it is recommended that you consider their analysis of you carefully and remember it as you taking a hard look at yourself. Some of the things that your friend says about you might strike a chord and might even help you to realize what needs changing or improving in your life.


Even if that friend is a person you barely talk to, or even if that friend has been with you ever since you were in kindergarten, still talk to them. It's basically great to talk to anyone you know in your life.

, You need to have a really deep understanding of the words. For instance, if you are told you are kind, what does being kind really mean? It encompasses generosity to others, compassion, thoughtfulness, giving of yourself and much more––which aspects of this trait resonate most with you?


Some other examples are these: If you are confidential, what does that ""confidentiality"" mean in your life? Think about the definition(s) very closely as you read them.

, It's important to acknowledge the things about yourself that aren't helping you to feel more fulfilled or successful in life. But don't be too hard on yourself––remember that this is your list and it's all going to be worked on, with clarity of perspective. For example, if you're bad tempered, this is clearly an area that is worth working on, to enhance your relationships with others and to stop using frustration and anger as an excuse for not getting the things you really want out of life. Focusing on what isn't working for you is a way of acknowledging that this behavior or attitude has outlived its usefulness (if it ever had any in the first place) and allows you to make a decision to turn weaknesses into strengths, or to focus more on your strengths so that you can leave the weaknesses alone altogether.


If you want to avoid your weaknesses for a while, try the things that make you more stronger more often. For example, if one of your abilities is singing, try to sing more often than trying to do more of your weaknesses, like for example, studying for a science test.
Be aware that in many cases people like us for our weaknesses because that is what makes us seem most human. Think about the high achievers in life who seem like super-human beings until something trips them up and reminds the rest of us mere mortals that they too, are only human. Faults in others reminds us that we're fallible humans and we can relate to it since we all have weaknesses. Perfection is really hard to relate to, especially when it is always at the forefront of a person's behavior and attitude.

, By accepting that you don’t know everything, you become more likable and able to learn from others. Who likes a know it all? More to the point though, having to maintain a facade  of always being the expert, all-knowing person in the room can set you up for fear of failure and a worry that you carry everyone else's burdens. Life is a shared journey during which we all have a role to play and no one person can do the job of every person. You can't be expert at everything and in trying to be so, you risk shutting off learning from the perspectives and ideas of other people that you can always keep building on to make yourself a better person and to understand the world more fully. By being humble, you let others know that their story and ideas matter as much as your own.

, Honesty is really a great trait to have; it lets other people know that you can be relied on and that your word is your bond. Honesty isn't about being blunt or rude though––it's about telling things candidly with a view to respecting other people's intelligence, feelings and needs too. Moreover, honesty is about the everyday things in life, like not taking stationery home from work without permission or not taking the tomatoes from the farmer's stand without leaving change. Honesty is a way of letting you continue to feel good about yourself inside, knowing that even if other people haven't done the right thing, you have and will continue to do as an example of the most fulfilling way to live. Honest people can live with themselves, a fact which makes it so much easier to love yourself.

, Things such as ""I am so fat"" or ""I am so stupid"", do not help you. They are bad stories that you choose to tell yourself and they do not let you off scott free from having to continue to work on yourself, which is often a compelling reason for maintaining a negative view of yourself. Instead, choose to tell yourself a different, more self-respectful story whenever the negative voice raises its noise level. Tell yourself helpful things, such as ""I need to work on my schoolwork harder"", ""I will get that promotion if I spend more time reviewing my management skills"" or ""I may be short but I am the fastest and most agile person on this field"".

, Do you speak to yourself in a way that you would never dare speak to a friend? If so, this is extremely telling about how much you're undervaluing yourself while giving everyone else but yourself the benefit of the doubt. Instead of berating yourself as an angry parent might berate a child all the time (and perhaps this is precisely how your mind has taken to viewing yourself), start to talk to yourself as you would do to a friend you care about. Use kind words toward yourself, such as ""You look good today. Your hair looks great."" and ""I have made great progress."" These words will help you, encourage you and allow you to treat and see yourself in a valued and caring way.

, Along with negative words, sometimes it is easy to put yourself down so much that you won't allow yourself to enjoy life. This will never do. Life is short and it behooves each human being to make the most of each day given. Give yourself the opportunity to let down your hair, to have fun and to get away from a life of ""all chores, no play"" by scheduling in self-time that won't be interrupted by chores, other people or stinking thinking. Some of the things you might tell yourself include: ""I will sit at the park today and read a book"", ""I will take a bubble bath"", ""I will eat something I love"" or ""I will pamper myself today"". Remember, you deserve it.

, If you dropped the ball and let someone down, try to not do that in the future; use the experience as a lesson to build on, a lesson that will now let you become the better person you're always striving to be. Instead of telling yourself that you're always a bad person, remind yourself that you would have done better if you knew how and that the experience in itself has taught you that ""how"" for future reference. Give yourself a break and make peace with that part of you that can sometimes be too rough on yourself.

, Growing throughout life is something every person needs to do. Anais Nin once made the comment that ""life is a process of becoming, a combination of states we have to go through. Where people fail is that they wish to elect a state and remain in it. That is a kind of death."" In other words, don't die before your time––in accepting that you change over time and renew yourself, you allow yourself to grow freely into the person you are fully meant to be at that point in time. Loving yourself is a journey, not an end.

Lead by example.,
Be their advocate.,
Make them proud.,
Deliver on your promises.",How to Inspire People2," The best way to inspire your staff to work harder or push through a rough period is to lead by example. Take on more work than you have to and help them with their own work when you can. An active manager who works right alongside them is more inspiring than one who just sits behind a desk.

, Make sure that their needs are met. Show them that you care about their personal well-being. When they do something that's worthy of recognizing, recognize it. Promote them when they deserve it. All of this makes them want to do more for you because they know that you're going to fight for them.

, Get them invested in the work that they do. Make them proud of the product they make or the service they offer. If they take pride in what they do, they'll be much more likely to work hard and strive for perfection.

, When you promise them something or give them an incentive, you have to make good on that promise. Failing to meet expectations will only make them wary of your future promises and they'll be unlikely to take incentives seriously any more.

"
"
Create a story.,
Appeal to their ego.,
Feed their empathy.,
Show the rewards.",How to Inspire People3," Give them a legend, a fairy tale, where the problem that needs to be overcome (homelessness, hunger, poverty, etc) is a dragon to be slain. Create an epic feel around the task that needs to be completed.

, Next, make them the hero of the story you've created. Tell them that they are the only ones who can overcome this terrible obstacle. Make them feel not just necessary but vital. And, here's the key, make them feel like they're the only one/s who can help. People frequently won't help if they think that someone else will step in to be the hero.

, Use their emotions to show them why their help is so necessary. Put them in the emotional place of the person that needs help. Be as descriptive as possible: the easier it is for them to imagine, the more likely they are to want to help.

, Let them feel like helping results in good things for them as well. Outline for them not only the good feeling they'll have but also the physical rewards they'll see (good resume content, business incentives, marketing opportunities, etc).

"
"
Listen to them.,
Sympathize with them.,
Build their sense of worth.,
Help them embrace faults.",How to Inspire People4," If someone is having serious problems, whether they show it or not they're probably already judging themselves really harshly. Everything you could say to them they've probably already thought about. This means that one of the most productive ways to help them is to just listen to them. Be their sounding board. They may just talk themselves into whatever you were trying to get them to do!

, Show them that you care. Don't judge or shame them. Sympathize and let them know that you understand that the mistakes they made were only human. They need to see that you are on their side, even if that side turns out to be doing the opposite of what they want to do.

, People who make continuously bad decisions tend to think very little of themselves. Generally, if you've made some really poor decisions, you know it, right? Sometimes their poor opinion of themselves even causes them to do bad things to begin with. Build their sense of self-worth by showing them all the incredible things they can do and you'll find that they may start fixing their own problems.

, Some people think that they can't overcome obstacles because they have too many faults. Help them to understand that everyone has faults and that we all have to work around them or overcome them. Show them that perfection isn't necessary but that effort counts for everything."
"
Create a self-love routine.,
Eat healthy foods.,
Compliment yourself.",How to Have Fun Being Naked1," Establish a routine that helps you feel good about yourself. This can be anything -- doing your hair, nails, or wearing something that compliments your body. These tasks do not have to be body related. They simply need to be tasks that help you feel better about yourself. Any task that makes you appreciate yourself is beneficial. Any grooming tasks will be helpful.
Wearing clothes that make you feel good helps to boost your confidence. If you don’t feel good in your clothes, then it will be difficult to feel good without them.
Do the routine often. In order to build confidence, repeat your routine at least once a week to establish a regular day or time that you dote on yourself.
If you want your routine to have a walk in the park or go swimming, go for it. Go anywhere that makes you feel confident and/or comfortable.;
, Nothing can make you appreciate your body and dote on yourself like eating well. Eating well makes you remember to feed your body “good fuel” so that it functions properly and looks good. It is difficult to appreciate your body if you’re thinking about the extra donuts you ate, or if you’re counting all of the wasted calories that you’ve taken in. It will make you feel insecure or guilty, which is counter to the confidence you’ll need to have fun naked.
Don’t feel guilty about what you eat. If you’re going to eat it, don’t waste time counting all of the calories or thinking about it over and over again. This too is a confidence buster.
Eat healthy foods as a reminder to appreciate the skin you’re in. The food itself is a reminder that your body deserves to be fed and treated well.
If you're already on a healthy diet or meal plan, you don't have to overdo it. Take an evening snack once every other day or so if you feel like you're stressed over eating too healthy. Even though you want to be healthy, remember there is a thing that's called, ""being too healthy.""

, Instead of putting yourself down constantly, compliment yourself. The confidence to have fun naked begins with not judging your body or putting yourself down. With the process of complimenting yourself comes the responsibility of not doing certain things such as criticizing yourself. Don’t stand in front of the mirror and point out everything you don’t like.
Point out a few things about yourself that you like. Write them down if necessary. Use these qualities to counter the negative judgements that you might make about yourself and your body. For instance, if you think something negative about yourself, counter it with one of the positive comments that you’ve already identified. So, counter “I hate my arms” with “I have great legs.” "

Move your body.,
Pamper your body.,
Get naked at home.,
Start doing things naked that you would normally do with clothes on.,
Make a sandwich naked.,
Watch TV naked.,
Walk around the house naked.,
Sleep naked.",How to Have Fun Being Naked2," Any kind of physical exercise whether it is running, dancing or yoga helps to build body confidence.


Choose an activity that you enjoy. Kickball, walking, karate, swimming and dancing, for instance, all are activities that can help you begin to associate having fun with moving your body.
Physical activity sculpts and molds the body. Whichever activity you choose serves of dual purpose of body sculpting and enjoyment.
Exercise or physical activity slowly helps you feel more confident about your body, which is helpful when you’re nude. The point is not to lose weight but to gain confidence through movement of the body. Stay hydrated if you want to do a regular or an extreme workout. If you're not hydrated, you'll be tired the rest of the day and also be out of breath as well for the people that have asthma.

, Get a massage or facial. The act of pampering yourself pays homage to your body. It helps you appreciate your body and love it, which makes it easier to incorporate several of the previous steps such as moving the body and eating healthily.


Pampering yourself could be as simple as taking a long bath instead of a shower. Add some sea salt or flower petals to the water.
Grooming activities such as shaving, combing the hair, and rubbing lotion on the body all are elements of pampering and self-appreciation. These tasks build an appreciation for the body that are independent from material adornments such as clothes, shoes and jewelry.

Go to a Finnish, Turkish or Korean spa.,
Get naked in front of a supportive person.",How to Have Fun Being Naked3," Most Korean spas have gender-specific nude areas, which means you are free to go nude within the confines of specified areas. So, in the male area, men are free to go nude, and it’s the same in the female area. Within these areas there are saunas, bathing areas and grooming areas. So, you can slowly get accustomed to being nude in the company of others.
If you’re still not completely comfortable, use a small towel to partially cover yourself. Typically uniforms are available to wear as well.
Come with a friend so that you have someone to talk to, if that makes you feel more comfortable. Some people may prefer to start with just strangers.
Give yourself something to do. Bathe yourself or groom yourself while at the spa, and you won’t be totally focused on your nakedness.
Also, while you're there, try to get a massage too. It'll help sooth your nakedness, and it will also sooth your back!

, If you have a significant other or have a supportive friend or family member, get naked around them only if the other person is comfortable with it.


If you’re comfortable around your significant other, then you’ll be more comfortable during sex or other forms of sexual activity.
Being naked around a supportive person also helps you gain confidence and set aside any fears. No one is going to gawk at you, point or laugh, which is some people’s greatest fears.
Nude massages, for instance, are a way of acclimating yourself to being nude around others. Typically, the parts that are not being massaged are covered up with a towel, so you will have some sense of being covered.

Go skinny dipping with a friend or supportive partner.,
Go to a nude beach.,
Do naked yoga.,
Run naked.,
Join a nudist group or colony.",How to Have Fun Being Naked4," The water will partially obscure your naked body, which allows you to slowly get used to being naked and having fun while you do it.

Create and share content.,
Get into social media.,
Start searching.,
Learn HTML or programming.,
Invest in new breakthrough technologies.,
Start a company using information technology.,
Change your career or start a new one.",How to Contribute to the Information Age,";
, There are so many ways that you can become involved in the information age, that there is bound to be something that works for you. It might be any one of the following, or something that hasn't even yet been thought up (perhaps you will?!):



Wikis While a search engine can bring you information from any website, it is sometimes better to have fewer websites with more information in them. Wikis do that, so they are among the only websites people really need - wikiHow for instructions, Wikipedia for encyclopedia-style articles and word definitions, wikiTravel for traveling, and Wikileaks for exposing the underworld activities of those who should know better. Wikis are also good because they make things less complicated for you while even as they are constantly getting more information.

Twitter - Get tweeting and share 140 words of wisdom with many others of a like mind!

MySpace or Facebook - Leave messages, join groups, start a fad, share your stories and photos - there are so ways to use these sites to extend your reach beyond your own patch of soil

Flickr and other photo sites - Share your images and the way you see the world with many others, join image groups, have a competition - there are lots of possibilities

Online auctions - Yes, remarkably this is also getting involved in the information age (no more standing in drafty and dusty auction rooms). People sell all kinds of things, from what's tangible and collecting dust in their house, to e-books about all sorts of ideas, and even to single recipes and spells! Bright ideas can sell, especially when targeted to gaps, packaged well, or even for raising money for charity, so put on your thinking cap.

, Use search engines for everything you used to use a book for. Even the Yellow Pages are online. So are cafes, restaurants, libraries, car sales, tailors, caterers, organizers, you name it. You can even learn a language online now, with all the pronunciation provided for you!

, Why let others do all the work and only give you WYSIWYG? How about investing some time in learning the code behind the fancy stuff so that you too can recreate it and make something special out of your information knowledge? HTML is not as hard as a foreign language but it does take repeated practice, as with learning a language. Programming is more difficult but if it interests you and you're attuned to it, give it a go.

, Buy the stocks and products of companies working on new things that will help shape the future.

, If you're good at information production, consider starting up a company in the field of your information expertise. Anyone able to see the information needs and trends and act on them effectively can run a very enjoyable and profitable business in the information age. Be sure to do your homework on the competitors out there but be inspired by people who have started networking and auction sites - pretty incredible achievements for small ideas that these people acted on.

, Alternately, if you're not keen on being your own boss just yet, research existing careers in information technology and knowledge management to find what fits you best. The beauty of learning broad basics in information technology is that if you're not yet sure what you want to do in the information age, nor what your niche will be, by the time you've completed your studies, there will be a whole new range of jobs available for you to consider! Just be prepared, and ready to go with the information flow.

Identify the person being investigated.,
See what's been written about the person.,
Gather information through public records.,
Look up the individual's employment history.,
Verify any licenses.,
Reach out to people associated with the individual.",How to Compile a Dossier on a Person1," If you work in journalism, you might be asked to compile a dossier on a person of interest in an ongoing investigation. The first step to the process is identifying the individual.


Make sure you have the correct spelling of the person's first, middle, and last time. Small spelling errors can make a big difference when seeking out information.Try to find a date of birth, or at least a range of time in which the person was likely born. This makes finding certain documents easier down the road.;
, If you're writing an article about an individual, you do not want to rehash information that's already out there. Search online and through newspapers, magazines, and tabloids for existing stories about the individual. Not only does this prevent you from publishing a redundant piece, it adds to the array of information you have on the individual., Use public records to your advantage to build your profile. Using a variety of outlets, scan public records for important information.


Local records are a good start, even if the individual isn't originally from your location. Go to city hall, the county clerk's office, and any local branch of state and federal offices. Look through permits, power of attorney, liens, building permits, deeds, licenses, driving records, and anything else that turns up.Look through court records. Any history of court appearances can be found online, but you might have to go to the court house to actually view the records.Check with local police and sheriff's offices for any past criminal activity. Also check local, state, and county jail records. Some information may be hard to find, depending on your state's open record laws., You should look into the individual's employment history to check for any surprises or inconsistencies.


Make direct phone calls to past and current employers. Ask for employment verification and if they ask why you're calling, simply tell them the truth. Usually, whoever you're speaking to will comply.You can see if you can get a copy of the individual's resume through past and current employers., Oftentimes, the person you're investigating will be in a professional field that requires a license. He might be a dentist or a psychiatrist, for example. Try to verify that license to check for fraud. Also, investigate every claim on his resume, such as where he went to school, grants and awards he claims to have received, and any certificates he lists., Compile a list of friends, enemies, neighbors, spouses, family members, former lovers, and other people who've had contact with the individual. Contact them and ask questions relevant to your investigation."

Learn the fundamentals of a teaching dossier.,
Set a timeline for yourself.,
Collect dossier material.,
Prepare a statement of teaching philosophy.,
Select documents for evidence.,
Choose items to include in the appendix.,
Get feedback on your dossier.,
Avoid common pitfalls.",How to Compile a Dossier on a Person2," A teaching dossier is important if you teach at the university level. Oftentimes, a dossier is required to move up for promotion or tenure. It is a portfolio of papers, documents, and other materials designed the illustrate the scope of your teaching career. A teaching dossier should do the following:


It should describe your approach to teaching, as well as your philosophy as an educator.It should provide evidence that your teaching outcomes have been successful.It should also document that you have made efforts to improve as a teacher over the years., Compiling a dossier takes time. In order to create a successful dossier, you need to establish a timeline.


A minimum of two months should be spent on your teaching dossier. You won't be working on the dossier this entire time, but should be spending 4 or 5 nights a week working on compiling, writing, and organizing your materials.Be proactive while teaching. Always be on the lookout for potential materials to add to your dossier. If an assignment works very well to illustrate a point, save a copy of the assignment sheet and make copies of exemplary student work. If a class activity goes over well, have a colleague sit in during class and write a brief assessment for you., Each semester you teach, you should be working on collecting relevant dossier material. Relevant material is anything that speaks to your skill as an educator.


Have a folder or box in your office where you save important documents that you may want to use when compiling your dossier. Try to have some system of organization. For example, student papers can be filed in one section while assignment sheets are filed in another. This will make materials easy to sort when the time comes to compile your dossier.While the semester is in progress, you should be gathering all course materials, such as syllabi and handouts, feedback you've provided for student work, any TA training material, student work that shows students have met your teaching goals, mid-semester evaluations, emails from students or colleagues regarding your teaching, and any of your own notes or journal entries in regards to your course.After the semester ends, add raw data from course evaluations, students' final grades, and any notes you made about altering the course.You should also be continually gathering information unrelated to your specific course. Save materials from any teaching workshops you attended, information about student outcomes and activities (e.g., a student of yours being accepted into a graduate program, publications of former students, internships, professional jobs, etc.), any evidence you've been involved in professional organizations related to your field, and information from any non-university teaching experiences, such as public lectures., In addition to including compiled materials, you will need to write a statement of teaching philosophy. This is a 1 to 2-page document that outlines your goals and values as an educator.


The content of a teaching philosophy can be laid out in a variety of ways. There is no specific format that needs to be followed. However, all teaching philosophies should convey your idea of good teaching, what you hope to achieve teaching, examples of your teaching strategy that demonstrate its effectiveness, and reflections on how you can further develop as a teacher.The tone should be relatively informal although mentioning scholars who've been particularly helpful to you as a teacher can help. The document should be typed in a legible font with space between paragraphs., A dossier needs to provide evidence that your teaching methods are effective. The evidence sections are broken down into three parts.


Evidence of Teaching Effectiveness shows your approach to teaching is beneficial to students. You should include a summary of your course evaluations and an accompanying narrative, written by you. The narrative can explain any inconsistencies and help contextualize your scores in regards to your teaching. In addition to evaluations and your narrative, you might also want to include peer evaluations, student outcomes, and examples of student work.Evidence in Leadership of Teaching should speak to your ability to improve the quality of teaching beyond your own classroom. This is material that demonstrates you've made an effort to be involved in the teaching community and have collaborated with peers. Documents to include are materials from workshops and presentations, teaching materials you've shared with others, information regarding your participation in mentorship programs, any funding or grants you've received, publications on scholarly research regarding teaching, and evidence of any leadership positions you've held for teaching organizations.Evidence of Professional Development shows you're committed to improving and adapting your teaching throughout your career. You should include a list of any workshops, seminars, or courses on teaching you've participated in, and information regarding any mentorship or advice you've sought from peers and colleagues. You might also want to include your own narrative description of your career and goals, and how you've sought self improvement over the years., Items included in your dossier's appendix should compliment the claims you've made in your teaching philosophy and evidence section. A wide array of information and documentation can be included.


Some possible materials to include are student papers, course materials, feedback on teaching from students and colleagues, certificates of completion for professional development seminars and teaching courses, and any teaching research or scholarship you've participated in.These documents should not speak on their own. You should provide a brief, 1-2 paragraph statement that explains how said documents relate to your earlier claims., Once you've completed a draft of your dossier, have a colleague in your department review it. If possible, find someone who has reviewed dossier materials for professors up for promotion or tenure before. Feedback is invaluable. Not only can your colleague provide you with information on what to keep and what to cut, many academics get ""typo-blind"" when working long hours. A colleague can assure your teaching philosophy and narrative statements are free of grammatical and spelling errors as well as dropped words., There are a variety of common mistakes people make when compiling a dossier. As you work, know what to avoid.


Dossiers sometimes lack coherence. You may be asking those reviewing the documents to make too many connections themselves in regards to how the materials are related. Make sure your teaching philosophy, evidence, and appendix materials all speak to your central goals as an educator.Do not include too much information. A dossier should be expansive but it should not be exhaustive. Be selective in what you include and only include information that speaks to a few central goals and values."

Understand documents in an adoption dossier need further review.,
Know what documents you need.,
Decide whether to compile the dossier yourself or hire someone.",How to Compile a Dossier on a Person3," Before completing your adoption dossier, you'll have already compiled a variety of documents for other parts of the adoption process. Most of these documents will go into your dossier. However, these documents cannot simply be thrown in an adoption dossier. They all need to be notarized, certified, apostilled, and authenticated.


To get a document notarized and then certified, you need a Notary Public. Notary Publics are officials appointed by the state to serve as impartial witnesses to a variety of acts in order to prevent fraud. You can contact a Notary Public through the state department and have them notarize your documents and certify they are not fraudulent. Make sure you know when their term expires. You need someone whose term lasts at least a year.You will then need your documents reviewed by the governmental body that registered the Notary. An apostille is a seal said government body puts on a document to confirm that your Notary's signature and license are valid.Once a government official has looked at the Notary's signature and the apostille seal, they will attach a piece of paper to your document with their authorization and signature. This means your documents are notarized, certified, apostilled, and authenticated. They are ready to go into your dossier., Dossier requirements vary from agency to agency and state to sate. However, most dossiers should include the following:


Health information about the adoptive parents
Financial information
Adoption petition and post placement agreement from your adoption agency
Copies of birth certificates and marriage licenses (single parents only need their birth certificates)
Any forms related to confirming your citizenship
Employment verification
Certificates regarding a completed home study
Criminal background check results
Copy of your most recent Federal Tax Return
Copies of your passport
Photographs of your family, friends, pets, and house, Compiling an adoption dossier is a stressful process. Small mistakes can result in the delay of an adoption, and many parents would prefer to hire a professional.


Hiring someone to complete a dossier for you can cost $800 to $1,000. Many companies specialize in compiling dossiers for prospective adoptive parents. Your adoption agency should be able to recommend a company for you.While you can compile a dossier yourself, many parents feel overwhelmed by the prospect of assuring they have proper documentation and authorization. Easily overlooked mistakes can translate to major issues in regards to successfully completing the adoption process. However, if you feel confident in your organizational skills you might want to save your money as adoption fees are already expensive."

Get the person’s attention.,
Position yourself carefully.,
Find out how the person prefers to communicate.",How to Communicate With a Deaf Person1," You can do this by moving into the person’s field of vision and waving from a polite distance, or by tapping the person gently on the shoulder. If it’s a real emergency, you can also flick the lights off and on quickly. , Make sure that the light in the room is shining directly onto your face, and that you’re not standing with your back to a light. Stand directly in front of the person (as opposed to standing off to one side or behind the person), at a normal distance. Make sure the person is looking at you. Wait until the person finishes what they’re doing before you try to talk to them. If you’re showing a deaf person how to use something, for example, you can’t talk at the same time as they’re looking at the object. Try not to fidget or move around a lot as you speak. This is distracting and makes it harder for the deaf person to watch what you’re saying. , Some deaf people are better lip readers than other. Some deaf people may prefer to write back and forth or to use an interpreter. Many interactions between the deaf and the hearing require a combination of these methods. The best way to know which methods are most effective is to ask. If you know ahead of time that you’re going to be communicating with a deaf person, try to learn some basic sign language. Greetings and simple phrases like “please,” “thank you,” and “how are you?” are useful and will make the person feel comfortable. It’s also really helpful to learn the sign language alphabet.
If the deaf person uses an interpreter, always make sure to look at the deaf person while you talk, not the interpreter. If you are looking at the interpreter, the deaf person will feel like they’re not really part of the conversation.

Keep your mouth clear.,
Speak at a normal volume.,
Speak clearly and at a normal pace.,
Keep your sentences simple and use plain language.,
Make sure only one person talks at a time.",How to Communicate With a Deaf Person2," Don’t smoke, eat, or chew gum while you’re talking. This will make it hard for the deaf person to read your lips. Never cover your mouth while you’re talking. , Yelling or talking loudly to a deaf or mostly-deaf person will not help them to hear you any better. In addition, yelling looks aggressive to the person you’re talking to and makes others nearby feel uncomfortable. , Most deaf people can only understand about a third of what you say while lip reading, so it’s important not talk too quickly. Try to speak clearly (don’t mumble or stutter, if possible), but don’t exaggerate your speech, either. It’s fine to start off speaking at your normal pace. You can always slow down if you need to. Don’t over-enunciate. Exaggerating lip movements will make it harder for the deaf person to read your lips, not easier. , Try not to get too complicated with your wording in the beginning. The more complex your phrasing and vocabulary, the more likely your deaf companion is to miss something. Try to avoid using slang or jargon that isn’t widely known. , If multiple people are speaking at once, the deaf person won’t know who to look at to follow the conversation. This means that they’ll miss parts of the conversation. When someone else is speaking, don’t turn away from the deaf person in your group. This will make them feel left out of the conversation. You don’t have to look at the deaf person while someone else is talking, but try to make sure your face is visible. "
"
State the topic of conversation.,
Use gestures and body language to clarify.,
Show your emotions.,
Ask questions to make sure the person understands.,
Write down key information, names, or dates.,
Be patient—if the person doesn’t understand you, try again.",How to Communicate With a Deaf Person3," If the topic is clear, the deaf person will have an easier time following what’s being said. If the conversation shifts into a new topic, state the new topic for the deaf person. , While too much movement can make it hard for a deaf person to follow what you’re saying, using gestures or facial expressions can be useful for filling in gaps. If the person’s having trouble figuring out what you’re saying, try acting it out. , While you don’t want to exaggerate your facial expressions, don’t try to hide your emotions as you speak. Facial expressions and emotional cues help deaf people to understand the tone of the conversation. , Don’t assume just because a deaf person is nodding that they understand what you’re saying. Just like anyone else, deaf people don’t always like to ask people to repeat themselves or admit they don’t understand what’s going on. You can ask your deaf companion open-ended questions to check that they’ve understood everything that’s been said without embarrassing them or calling them out. , This will ensure that the person understands important points. You can also offer to summarize what’s been said. , Lip reading is useful, but it’s not perfect, and often important details get missed. If your deaf companion doesn’t understand what’s been said, try to say it in a different way. Ask what the deaf person understood, so you can figure out what they missed.
Re-word phrases and sentences whose message didn’t come across the first time. Don’t just say the same thing over and over in the same way.
Monosyllabic words can be harder to read than longer words, to try using a longer word. Slow down your speech.
Break what you want to say into shorter, simpler parts. If you’re still having trouble, write it down.
Never tell a deaf person “never mind” or “it’s not important.” This will make your deaf companion feel left out, and may hurt their feelings. If you keep trying, the message will come through eventually and the deaf person will appreciate your efforts. "
"
Keep sentences short and simple.,
Write legibly.,
Use visual aids.,
Take advantage of available technology.",How to Communicate With a Deaf Person4," Remember that, just like other people, some deaf people are better readers and writers than others. Start off using simple language and short sentences. If the deaf person is using more complex language, you can follow their cue and do the same. , The deaf person will have lots of trouble understanding you if they can’t read your handwriting. If you know you have bad handwriting, try slowing down. It might take longer, but it won’t take as long as it would to rewrite the same sentence multiple times because the deaf person can’t read what you wrote.

, You may find it useful to show your deaf companion any available images or documents in order to clarify your meaning. You might also point to objects or people in your environment; pointing is not considered rude in the deaf community. , You can use a smart phone or computer to Google search images that might help clarify what you want to say. You can also use instant messaging, email, or text messaging to communicate through writing. "
"
Listen closely.,
Tell your deaf companion if you don’t understand something.,
Don’t be surprised by bluntness.",How to Communicate With a Deaf Person5," You will notice that your deaf companion has an accent when they talk. Sometimes this accent may make it hard to understand them. It’s important that you pay close attention when they talk until you get used to the accent.


It may be useful to minimize the noise in the room, if possible. This will help you to hear better.

, Deaf people know that they have an accent when they talk. Just like anyone else, they want to be understood, and they will repeat or restate so that you can understand.


If you’re really having trouble understanding, ask your deaf companion to switch communication methods—to written communication, for example.

, Deaf culture values straightforwardness. Many hearing people are surprised or taken aback by deaf bluntness. Be aware that in the deaf community, this is not seen as rude, just efficient.

Ask yourself why you need to see the teacher.,
If you consider the meeting is still needed, canvass the following:


Will talking with my child's teacher embarrass my child or make them feel insecure?,
Think about how your child would react to you telling them.,
Establish communication with your child's teacher.,
Choose a mutually convenient time to meet.,
Share your concerns with your spouse.,
Have some idea of what you're going to be talking about with the teacher by now.,
Be prepared to listen as well as talk.,
Stay in touch for follow-ups.",How to Communicate with a Child's Middle School Teacher," Is your student not doing their homework? Maybe he or she is cheating on their schoolwork? Decide the reason for the talk. Once you have a basic idea of why you need to see your child's teacher, you need to ask yourself these questions:


Have I met with my child's middle school teacher before? When and why did this meeting occur?
Do the reasons I came up with earlier really elicit a meeting with a teacher? Can my family try to handle this matter?
What's my child's teacher like?;
,
Should I tell my child that I'm going to have a talk with his or her teacher(s)?

, Sometimes it's better if they don't know, as it might upset them or discourage them. If you do plan on telling your child about the meeting, make sure that they know that you aren't mad at them and that you are just trying to help.

, This should not be too hard. Start off by doing the following:


Contact the school guidance counselor, principal, or the teacher directly. This can usually be done by email or the school phone number.
Make sure you know how many teachers you plan on keeping in touch with. Sometimes in middle school, students have a whole team of teachers. It depends on how many you plan to meet with. If you plan on meeting with more than one, you might want to contact the person in charge of the team of teachers. (Most likely a teacher is the leader of a team.)
Send a note along. If you did tell your son or daughter about it and they seem to be okay with it, you might consider writing a note for your child to give to the teacher requesting some form of conference.

, Once you have contacted someone at the school and have talked with whoever you plan on meeting with, set a date. Keep in mind that teachers are as busy as you and might not be able to meet with you right away.

, When the date has been decided upon, you and your spouse should try to think about some concerns you would like to share with your child's teacher. Maybe even write them down so you don't forget. Be sure not to waste time. Be ready!

, If you don't here are some ideas:


How is my child doing in your subject?
Is my child participating in class?
Is my child kind to the other children?
Is my child ever late to his or her classes?
What are your teaching methods? Do you use technology or paper and pencil?

, When you meet with your child's teacher(s), they are probably going to have some idea as to what they might want to talk about as well. Keep that in mind. Remember that this meeting isn't all about bad, your child's teachers will most likely have some lovely things to say about your child.

, After the meeting is over, you might want to consider getting the teacher's email(s) so you can keep in touch with them easier if your child seems to be having some larger problems in class.

Keep your attitude right.,
Make yourself comfortable.,
Be the first to approach.,
Carefully listen to what others say.,
Be helpful.,
Stay in touch after leaving.",How to Communicate Freely with People," Your first impression is not the last impression. When you enter a new place, say, your school or college, or even your workplace, its obvious to feel nervous. Don't worry so are the others. you just need to show that you're scared too. They have seen you for the first time so try not to flaunt yourself, instead; be yourself. Think them as already your friends.;
, Relations are not sent by God, so try to adjust in whichever seat you get. Making access to other's choices is also important to show you care. You need not argue with someone for the best seat. If you want a particular place for yourself like the front seat or the middle one then just be sure to come a little early the next day. Making tantrums the very first day isn't a good idea to present yourself.

, The person beside you or in front of you is seeing you for the first time. Just act normal and introduce yourself, like ""Hi, I'm Sasha and you?"" or focus on his/her notebook or mobile phone and say, ""Good choice, its very trendy."" You could just simply comment on his/her dress or shoes or even hairstyle. show that you like him/her. Sometimes there are certain common things that initiate conversation, like the classroom you are in or the boss you are working for. Either way, feel free to voice your opinion.

, Rushing with your rambling is always not a good idea; you should also pause and listen his/her response. Try to engage more in their topics and views. When they find you reliable and easier to talk, you will too, find them interesting. Don't think for any topics beforehand. Let the conversation lead you. you will see one topic leads to another. It often becomes smooth when you act natural. Pretence is not necessary unless you didn't enroll for an acting course.

, Make sure to offer help when they need one. It's up to them to trust you or not, but you could show concern and interest in them. Who knows, you might get help in return. When you're alone in a new place, you won't know what you need and when. So instead of regretting later, you could just ask for some help too unless its very personal. A helping hand once in a while saves from embarrassment.

, It's very rude to not ask for the contact number, especially after the other person has helped you. Even if you do not intend for further communication, just an occasional 'Hi!' or 'Hello! How you're doing?' sums it up. Remember the first person you met saved you from boredom and has at least been a friend to you. Just for the sake of that, drop a message sometimes to show that you remembered. Always be thankful.

, An online search for the studio or teacher's name may reveal performance videos and comments from happy students. Try joining Facebook Groups or Meetup Groups and ask members whether anyone has taken classes with your potential instructor.  Now with that said, there some group members may be biased, and steer you towards one school over another, just because they are close friends with that other person. Don't sweat it! Now you have two teachers to look into. 

,


What's the cost? Is it within your budget?
How big is the class? Will you be 1 out of 15 students or 1 out of 6?
How frequently are classes offered? If the school offers a series like a 4 week workshop, are you really going to be able to attend each class?
Is there a performance opportunity? Is the performance mandatory or optional? If you decide part way through the process that you are not interested in performing burlesque and are more comfortable watching it, then you don't want to be admonished by your teacher for not wanting to participate in a student showcase.
Is there any course material required? Some teachers will help students figure out costuming for the student showcase and you may have to invest into your costume. This is not unreasonable (as long as you are not required to buy costumes from your teacher). Some classes may also require students to purchase a handbook that is used in class for class, and students would need the handbook in order to complete the class

, Make a quick phone call or email to a studio and ask if they permit auditing a class. An audit is a great way to test whether you like an instructor's teaching style.

, Searching online for reviews from other students can also be helpful.

, Does that teacher have a student showcase coming up? Seeing their students in action is a great way to determine if you like the end result of the teacher's work. Can you see yourself performing on that same stage 1 month or 2 months from now?

, Have fun and happy twirling.

Try blind writing.,
Make a mind map.,
Attempt ""rolestorming"".,
Try meditation.,
Remove limitations.,
Discuss things in a group.",How to Come up With a Good Idea1," When trying to get past a writing block or a brainstorming lag, take at least ten minutes to sit down and write. Force yourself to write for the full ten minutes, no matter what comes of it. The act of putting pen to paper will stimulate the part of your mind that generates ideas., Mind mapping is a brainstorming strategy that allows you to map out different tangents of thought to stimulate new ideas. Get a piece of paper, poster board, or whiteboard and write your goal in the center. Write subtopics and related thoughts around the goal, and continue branching out from them to develop your train of thought.For example, a mind map about the environmental goal ""Going Green"" could branch into subtopics such as ""Reducing Waste"", ""Eco-travel"", and ""Global Warming"".

, For a fresh perspective on a topic, attempt ""rolestorming"". Picture yourself as someone else (e.g. a parent, friend, colleague, or partner) and imagine how you would approach a scenario as them. You can extend this brainstorming technique to famous people or historical figures (e.g. Albert Einstein, Bill Gates)., To open your mind to new ideas, try meditation. Find a peaceful place to sit quietly and focus on the question at hand (e.g. ""How can I promote my new business on my limited budget?""). Bring a pen and paper to jot down ideas, and meditate for about 30 minutes, or until a good idea comes to you.To avoid worrying about the time, set an alarm on your phone to signal the 30 minute mark).

, Remove the limitations that may be hindering your brainstorming progress by approaching the subject as if there were no obstacles. While this process may not yield feasible solutions right away, it will open your mind to possibilities you would not look at otherwise. For instance, when planning a surprise party, you might overlook certain venues because of financial constraints, such as an expensive french restaurant that your friend would love to try. By allowing your mind to go there during brainstorming, you might get the idea to simulate the restaurant and meal for a house party., Group brainstorming sessions can allow you to develop your thoughts by feeding off of the ideas of others. If you are working on a group project or collaboration, schedule brainstorming time in a quiet location with few distractions. If you are working on your own project, ask friends or colleagues if you can bounce ideas off of them and get their input."
"
Do something out of the ordinary.,
Watch lectures.,
Experience music.",How to Come up With a Good Idea2," A new experience can offer exactly the change of perspective you need to stimulate new ideas. Do something out of the ordinary to get out of your routine and provide inspiration. For instance, if you live in the city, plan a camping weekend for a change of pace., For inspiration, look to motivational speakers by attending lectures or watching TED talks. Check the websites for local universities to see listing of scheduled lectures that might provide you with the proper inspiration. Visit www.TED.com/talks to browse a large library of motivational talks by topic., Music can complement your brainstorming sessions, or be the inspiration for your ideas in and of itself. Try to listen to a wide range of music to vary your musical experience (e.g. if you're a fan of classic rock, make an effort to listen to jazz or R&B music for a new experience). Look online or in local newspapers for concerts or smaller performances near you. "
"
Exercise on a regular basis.,
Maintain a healthy sleep schedule.,
Eat healthy.",How to Come up With a Good Idea3," Exercising can raise your focus for 2-3 hours, upping your brainstorming power. It can also boost your mood by raising serotonin levels in the brain, and increase your overall productivity. To keep your mind in top shape, get at least thirty minutes of exercise a day (e.g. walking, running, bicycling), preferably before you sit down to work out ideas. , Make sure to get adequate sleep to reach your full creative and intellectual potential. Lack of sleep can cause loss of focus, lapses in memory, and may contribute to depression. The required amount of sleep for optimal functioning is:9-11 hours a day for children
8.5-9.5 hours a day for teenagers
7-9 hours a day for adults

, Eating a well-balanced, healthy diet is integral to improving brain function. Try to infuse your diet with ""smart” foods that aid with cognitive function and improve concentration. These foods include:Fish
Whole grains
Nuts
Dark chocolate
Blueberries

Create a sentence for a citation.,
Make an in-text citation.,
Make an end reference.,
Add the website if you prefer.",How to Cite the Universal Declaration of Human Rights1," The first step you take is to create a sentence that quotes or paraphrases the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). Otherwise, you have no need to cite the document.


For example, you could write, ""As the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states, 'All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.'"";
, The in-text citation goes at the end of the sentence. Start with the organization. In most cases with a citation, you start with the author. In this case, you don't have a single author but, rather, an organization (an assembly) that collectively wrote and approved the document, the UN General Assembly.Therefore, that's what you begin the citation with.After that, you'll add a comma and the date.


In the above example, you'd write: As the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states, ""All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights"" (UN General Assembly, 1948).
The citation goes in parentheses, after the quotation mark and before the period.
You can also include the citation at the beginning of the sentence, such as in the following sentence: As the UN General Assembly (1948) determined over 60 years ago, all people have certain inalienable rights at birth.

, The end reference provides more information for the reader, helping them to find the document. Since this document is fairly common, it's not as essential to include all the information you would in a normal citation. Still, it's best to include as much information as you can.The citation should look like the following: UN General Assembly. (1948). Universal declaration of human rights (217 A). Paris.
The designation 217 (III) A refers to the document number. Also, the General Assembly was convened in Paris, so you add that as the location.

, Since the the UDHR is fairly commonplace, you don't strictly need a web address. However, adding it certainly doesn't hurt, as it points your reader in the right direction.As an example, the completed citation would look this way: UN General Assembly. (1948). ""Universal declaration of human rights"" (217 A). Paris. Retrieved from http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/


"
"
Start with a sentence that needs citation.,
Add an in-text citation.,
Build an end reference.",How to Cite the Universal Declaration of Human Rights2," Once again, you need to have a sentence that either paraphrases or directly quotes the UDHR in it. That is the only way you'll need an in-text citation for your sentence.


Use the same example form above: ""As the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states, 'All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.'""

, Like APA style, you need an in-text citation in parenthesis. Unlike APA, the citation usually goes at the end of the sentence (the exception being if you cite two different sources in the same sentence). You'll need the author's name (again, the organization, the UN General Assembly). However, instead of the date, you'll use the article number that you're quoting from.For example, in this sentence, the citation would look this way: As the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states, ""All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights"" (UN General Assembly art. 1).

, The MLA has recently updated their style guidelines, making them looser. In other words, the main point is to get the information in there, based on the nine basic elements of author, title of source (such as the book name), the title of container (such as a larger work or website the smaller work is contained in), additional contributors, version, number, publisher, publication date, and location. Obviously, not every source will have all of this information, so you just include as much as you can find.Therefore, the end reference will look like the following example: UN General Assembly. ""Universal Declaration of Human Rights."" United Nations, 217 (III) A, 1948, Paris, art. 1, http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/. Accessed 6 Sept. 2016.

"
Begin with a sentence that needs a citation.,
Use a footnote.,
Put the information in the footnote.,
Create an end reference.",How to Cite the Universal Declaration of Human Rights3," You must always start with a sentence that requires a citation. Generally, that means you need a sentence that either quotes or paraphrases the UDHR. Also, the information should contribute something to your essay.


You can use the same example: ""As the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states, 'All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.'""

, Like APA and MLA, you need to add information to your sentence to tell your reader where you found it. However, unlike APA and MLA, Chicago style requires you to use a footnote. A footnote places a small number at the end of your sentence (after the period), and then a corresponding number at the bottom of the page, where you add your information.Go to the end of your sentence, and add a footnote. To add a footnote, first place the cursor at the end of the sentence after the period or quotation mark (whichever comes last). Go to ""References"" in your word processing software, and choose ""insert a footnote."" It should place a number at the end of the sentence and down at the bottom of the page.
It should look like this example: As the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states, ""All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.""1


, Go to the corresponding footnote at the bottom of the page. Add your footnote citation. Unlike APA and MLA, you generally include all of the information for the citation in the footnote.Start with the organization, followed by a comma, and the title. Then add an open parenthesis, a phrase that identifies the type of source, the place of publication, and the year, followed by a close parenthesis. At the end, include the location you found the information (such as the page or article number).
For instance, your footnote would look like this example: 1. UN General Assembly, ""Universal Declaration of Human Rights,"" 217 (III) A (Paris, 1948), http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/ (accessed September 6, 2016).
In the citation, ""217 (III) A"" is the document reference, while ""Paris"" is the location and ""1948"" is the date. The website is where you found the document.

, Your end reference in Chicago style will be very similar to your footnote. Basically, you'll just change some of the punctuation and capitalization to make it an end reference, and put it at the end of your paper.The end citation would look this way: UN General Assembly. ""Universal Declaration of Human Rights."" 217 (III) A. Paris, 1948. http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/ (accessed September 6, 2016).
Just change most of the commas to periods, and capitalize what comes after the period.

Get the test scores.,
Know that test scores don't tell the whole story.,
Visit the website of the school.,
Ensure the school offers the classes your child wants.,
Talk to others.,
Get a tour of the school.,
Ask about teacher credentials, experience, and turnover rate.,
Know if there are any accommodations for any special needs your child may have.,
Some parents seek out particular programs for their children.,
Make sure your child will be safe at school.,
Walk around the school.,
Check transportation options.,
Once you have decided on a school, you can attempt to enroll.,
Find if the school you want has space available for new students.",How to Choose a School," Test scores are not the whole picture, but many parents will start out there.


Determine the online source for school rankings. It is different in different states and countries, but you will find it if you search online for ""school rankings for your location.""
For example, in California, USA, every school has its ranking by test score listed on California Department of Education website.. In the UK, you can find these rankings at Ofsted.You can also find more subjective ratings on other websites like GreatSchools and many others.;
, There are many factors that influence test scores, and not all of these truly indicate the quality of the overall learning experience or the experience your child will have.


Wealthier areas have parents that can afford coaches and tutors, so if you find a school in a poorer area that is above average for its income level, you may have a real winner.
Note that test scores are typically reported by school. There will be test score variation by teacher, and by set of students.
Getting a teacher at a school is sort of like getting a lawyer from a law firm. It doesn't matter if the law firm is the top one if they give you their worst lawyer.

, If their school has won awards for excellence, you can bet those will be listed.

, Larger schools are more likely to have a diversity of classes offered.


Also ask about other electives/extracurriculars. Find out if the school offers the non academic things you might be looking for, such as band, sports, debate, theater. Ask students who study in that school about its role in their lives i.e. are they motivated in other activities besides studies.

, Find parents and children that are currently at the school and talk with them about their experiences. You should be able to find people to talk to you in most cases, by friends of friends or just online.


If you are far away, you can ask the school for references. If they did not want to help you, that is probably a bad sign.

, Simply visit the school's website to inquire about tours. Almost any school will allow prospective parents and students to visit, if they simply ask.


Tours can be for both parents and children. Most times, parents would want the child to see the school as well.
Many schools will also have the opportunity for a child to visit an actual classroom, which is very helpful.
Make sure you see lunch and recess time. Ensure non classroom time has adequate supervision and the kids look happy. Non supervised time on a playground is a big stress factor for many children.

, These factors are not necessarily good or bad, but can inform your decision.


Credentials are not always important; many of the best teachers at private schools do not have them. Experience in class management matters even more than qualification.
A high turnover rate of teachers is rarely a good thing.
Experience in teachers is usually good, but some experienced tenured teachers are not engaged. Similarly, a lot of young teachers is not necessarily good or bad; some are very enthusiastic and energetic, others inexperienced and not good at classroom management.

, Special needs parent groups - online or offline - can be useful.


Most places require schools to accommodate special needs. But not all are eager or willing.
Gifted children also can require special accommodations.

, Parents may look for STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) focused schools, language immersion schools, and others.

, You can rule schools out by neighborhood. A great school may not be great for your child, if the school is dangerous. Others may be too far from your house, or not have good transportation.

, Try to get a feel for the overall campus environment. Is it clean? Well maintained? Does it feel safe?


Stop by the school office to get a pass to come on campus, or arrange a tour.
Many schools do not allow people to come onto school property unannounced while school is in session, for security reasons. This does not mean they have something to hide.

, Make sure transportation to and from school is convenient and safe.


If transport to the school is by bus, take the bus to school during commute time. Buses can be dangerous, or just very rowdy. By experiencing, you will feel and know what it will be like.
If transport by car, go by the school during drop off hours to ensure it is doable for you.
If transport is by foot or bicycle, ensure there are good safety precautions, such as walkways or bicycle paths.

, Most schools offer both online registration and in person registration.


See the instructions for the things you will need to enroll. Many local schools will require proof that you live in the area of the school. Elite schools, may require more detailed applications and/or aptitude tests.
In the USA, publicly funded schools are not allowed to choose which students they can accept, but they instead have regulations for how they choose when they have limited space.
If you do not live in the area of the school, you may have different or special instructions.

, Some schools will take new students any time. Others do not have space.


If the school has limited space available, read up on when enrollment starts. You will want to be first in line, or first online during the registration period for best chances.
If your child has any special needs, consider if you want to discuss them with the school when applying. In some cases, you want to ensure the special needs will be met before applying. In other cases, you may not want to disclose; the school may be required to provide services that are expensive.

Divide the subtraction figure you just completed by the standard deviation.",How to Calculate Z Scores," You will need certain key pieces of information to calculate the mean or mathematical average from your sample. Know how many numbers are in your sample. In the case of the sample of palm trees, there are 5 in this sample.






Know what the numbers represent. In our example, these numbers represent measurements of trees.






Look at the variation in the numbers. Does the data vary across a large range, or a small range?





;
, You will need all the numbers in your sample to start your calculations. The mean is the average of all the numbers in your sample.
To calculate this you will add all the numbers in your sample together, then divide by the sample size.
In mathematical notation, n represents the sample size. In the case of our sample of tree heights, n = 5 since there are 5 numbers in this sample.

, This is the first part of calculating the mathematical average or mean.For example, using the sample of 5 palm trees, our sample consists of 7, 8, 8, 7.5, and 9.
7 + 8 + 8 + 7.5 + 9 = 39.5. This is the sum of all the numbers in your sample.
Check your answer to make sure you did your addition correctly.

, This will provide the average or mean of the data. For example, use our sample of tree heights: 7, 8, 8, 7.5, and 9. There are 5 number in our sample so n = 5.
The sum of tree heights in our sample was 39.5. You would then divide this figure by 5 to figure out the mean.
39.5/5 = 7.9.
The mean tree height is 7.9 feet. The population mean is often represented by the symbol μ, therefore μ = 7.9

, The variance is a figure that represents how far your data in your sample is clustered about the mean. This calculation will give you an idea about how far your data is spread out.
Samples with low variance have data that is clustered closely about the mean.
Samples with high variance have data that is spread far from the mean.
Variance is often used to compare the distributions between two data sets or samples.

, This will give you an idea of how much each number in your sample differs from the mean.In our sample of tree heights (7, 8, 8, 7.5, and 9 feet) the mean was 7.9.
7 - 7.9 = -0.9, 8 - 7.9 = 0.1, 8 - 7.9 = 0.1, 7.5 - 7.9 = -0.4, and 9 - 7.9 = 1.1.
Do these calculations again to check your math. It is extremely important that you have the right figures for this step.

, You will need each of these figures to figure out the variance in your sample.Remember, in our sample we subtracted the mean of 7.9 from each of our data points (7, 8, 8, 7.5, and 9) and came up with the following: -0.9, 0.1, 0.1, -0.4, and 1.1.
Square all of these figures: (-0.9)^2 = 0.81, (0.1)^2 = 0.01, (0.1)^2 = 0.01, (-0.4)^2 = 0.16, and (1.1)^2 = 1.21.
The squares from this calculation are: 0.81, 0.01, 0.01, 0.16, and 1.21.
Check your answers before proceeding to the next step.

, This calculation is call the sum of squares. In our sample of tree heights, the squares were as follows: 0.81, 0.01, 0.01, 0.16, and 1.21.
0.81 + 0.01 + 0.01 + 0.16 + 1.21 = 2.2
For our example of tree heights, the sum of squares is 2.2.
Check your addition to make sure that you have the right figure before moving on.

, Remember, n is your sample size (how many numbers there are in your sample). Doing this step will provide the variance. In our sample of tree heights (7, 8, 8, 7.5, and 9 feet), the sum of squares was 2.2.
There are 5 numbers in this sample. Therefore n = 5.
n - 1 = 4
Remember the sum of squares is 2.2. To find the variance, calculate the following: 2.2 / 4.
2.2 / 4 = 0.55
Therefore the variance for this sample of tree heights is 0.55.

, You will need this to find the standard deviation for your sample. Variance is how spread out your data is from the mean or mathematical average.
Standard deviation is a figure that represents how spread out your data is in your sample.
In our sample of tree heights, the variance was 0.55.

, This figure is the standard deviation. In our sample of tree heights, the variance was 0.55.
√0.55 = 0.741619848709566. You will often get a very large decimal figure when you calculate this step. It is ok to round to the second or third decimal place for your standard deviation figure. In this case, you could use 0.74.
Using a rounded figure, the standard deviation in our sample of tree heights is 0.74

, This will allow you to make sure you have the correct figure for standard deviation.


Write down all the steps you took when you did your calculations.
This will allow you to see where you made a mistake, if any.
If you come up with different figures for mean, variance, and standard deviation during your check, repeat the calculations looking at your process carefully.

, This formula allows you to calculate a z-score for any data point in your sample. Remember, a z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations a data point is away from the mean.
In the formula X represents the figure you want to examine. For example, if you wanted to find out how many standard deviations 7.5 was from the mean in our example of tree heights, you would plug in 7.5 for X in the equation.
In the formula, μ stands for the mean. In our sample of tree heights the mean was 7.9.
In the formula, σ stands for the standard deviation. In our sample of tree heights the standard deviation was 0.74.

, This will start out the calculations for a z-score. For example, in our sample of tree heights we want to find out how many standard deviations 7.5 is from the mean of 7.9.
Therefore, you would perform the following: 7.5 - 7.9.
7.5 - 7.9 = -0.4.
Double check that you have the correct mean and subtraction figure before you proceed.

, This calculation will provide you with your z-score. In our sample of tree heights, we want the z-score for the data point 7.5.
We already subtracted the mean from 7.5, and came up with a figure of -0.4.
Remember, the standard deviation from our sample of tree heights was 0.74.
- 0.4 / 0.74 = - 0.54
Therefore the z-score in this case is -0.54.
This z-score means that 7.5 is -0.54 standard deviations away from the mean in our sample of tree heights.
Z-scores can be both positive and negative numbers.
A negative z-score indicates that the data point is less than the mean, and a positive z-score indicates the data point in question is larger than the mean.

Define your ideal school.,
Keep an open mind to multiple options.,
Know the numbers.,
Visit your possible choices.,
Ask the right questions.,
Ask around for school recommendations.,
Know the details of application and enrollment.,
Have a backup plan.",How to Choose a Good School (for Parents)1," Before you even start looking, it's important to decide what is most important to you for your child. You can use criteria like foreign language opportunities, strength in arts and sciences, or a variety of other factors you find important to narrow down your choices. Once you decide what is important use the school's website, information available in pamphlets, or in-person visits to make sure the prospective school has proper offerings.A great way to understand how important something is to a school is to look at their available faculty and resources. Schools that have a lot of teachers and a demonstrated willingness to invest will be more likely to be strong in an area.
Also keep in mind things like travel time. If it is a public school, find out whether where you live has available bussing. If you are going to need to drive your child to school every morning, make sure the distance and start-times work with your own schedule.;
, If your area has a variety of school types ranging from public, private, or charter schools, don't limit yourself. How a school receives its funding, whether government or privately funded, does not necessarily correlate to quality of education. Look around online, go to a school district office, or attend a information fair to get a closer look. , Schools should have statistics available to prospective parents that demonstrate performance on tests, student-teacher ratio and how many of the students continue on to college or employment, depending what you find important. Contact the school's main office and request this information. For public programs, states will make available school district performances. , No amount of research, reading, or calling can substitute for an in person examination. When you go to the school, make sure you talk to the principal, teachers, and if possible other parents. This is a great time to get an overall feel for what sorts of people run and attend the school to decide whether it's a good fit. Look at the classrooms, the artwork on the walls, and if possible watch a teacher in action so you can see what sorts of interaction and activities your student will get. If a school doesn't encourage pre-enrollment visits, this may be a red flag to inquire about. This may mean that they are not transparent about their teaching methods and it could be predictive of how responsive they will be in the future to any concerns you may have. Choose a school that is transparent and tries to assuage your concerns. Ask why they do not allow pre-enrollment visits.

, Once you're at the school, it's important to ask the right questions. Make sure you know about the school's hours for your own schedule, what sorts of lunches they serve, their foreign language offerings and sports teams. If you want to get even more in depth you can ask how their teachers are trained, details on homework and how they handle poor behavior. , You may have friends who already have children in a particular school. Find out from them. You may want to consider enrolling your child into the same school.

, There can be a lot details that help dictate your decision. If it is a private school, find out about financial aid offerings, whether your child will need to be interviewed or whether admission is lottery based, and whether you'll need to secure recommendations on your child's behalf. Make sure you are able to financially afford tuition prices. If you want to move forward, you may need to secure paperwork verifying your child's age, identity, vaccinations and residency. If you are unable to do any of this, you'll want to know to avoid any unexpected surprises. , Even if you have a dream school, sometimes there are waiting lists, a rigorous application process, or even financial obstacles. Make sure you have other options waiting so that you are not shut out of all your options and forced to send your child to a less than ideal school.

Decide the environment you want for your child.,
Decide on the educational structure you want.,
Decide on the educational philosophy important to you.,
Investigate the staff and administration.",How to Choose a Good School (for Parents)2," For preschool there are a lot of different options and approaches. You may want something that is more childcare centered versus something that is educational. You may also have an opinion about whether you want your child in a busy environment with lots of activity and classmates or more individual oriented environments that focus on developing particular skills., There are many approaches to young child education.Play based programs are activities aim to use play to develop skills. This is also known as ""child-centered."" Many times these classrooms are broken up into different sections such as home or kitchen, science area, water table, reading space, and a space with blocks and toys. This encourages students to gain skills through play.
Academic focused programs are typically teacher led and provide more structure. This is similar to a kindergarten setting and aimed at preparing a child for their next steps in school. This is also for parents who want more structure and fear the chaotic environment of play-based programs.

, There are different philosophies for how to best teach children and prepare them for success. Montessori. This is a method that was developed in Rome. This focuses on letting children learn at their own pace and allows them to work at whatever educational level they are at. It has less emphasis on teacher directing the children and lets children explore puzzles and toys on their own, being rewarded by the successful completion of a task and not verbal reinforcements from an adult. This is great for parents who want their children to develop leadership skills and independence.Waldorf. This is a method emphasizes reading, creative learning, reading, singing and acting. There is also a great emphasis on cooperation amongst students. One thing that is unique about this method is the exclusion of media such as computers, videos, electronics and no focus on academic tasks like tests, homework or even desks. This method is great for parents who want their child to develop individualism. Reggio Emilia. This is a style that encourages students to explore and engage in project based learning. Lessons are based on the interest of the students. Instead of the teacher directing questions, it might ask the student to explore outside and to ask questions and pursue education through their own encounters and interests. The projects are then framed by the student to encourage this., This is important because they will be the ones directing the curriculum, instilling values, and disciplining your child. Meet with them and find out their methods and views on things of importance.

Take into account social and emotional factors.,
Take elective offerings into consideration.,
Ask about their post-graduate planning program.,
See what extra-curricular activities they offer.,
Decide whether you want a private or public school.",How to Choose a Good School (for Parents)3," Whereas a younger child may not have built up a lot of friends, older children looking for a middle or high school will have important social and emotional factors that affect their well-being. If your child already has a group of friends that have a positive impact on their life, you may want to not break this arrangement up. Also, things like bullying can become more prominent in older children. Find a school that has a strong anti-bullying policy and helps your child build up solid social skills. Finding out what sort of guidance counselor availability a school has can be one important factor in limiting bullying.

, Around this age your children will start to be developing interests and schools will have offerings beyond the basics of education like math, english, and writing. Technology courses, foreign languages, and other special offerings can really distinguish one school from the next. Ask to see what electives the school has and sit down to talk to your kid and see how they may align with their interests. It is also a good idea to ask the school specifics about their programs, such as student-to-faculty ration, faculty training, and funding available to support students.

, In high school your child may be starting to consider whether they want to continue on to college or pursue a trade. Schools that offer AP classes for college credit, a guidance program for navigating the application process, and even internship options are great for someone looking to continue on to college. If your child is interested in a trade, see if the school has an option to receive hands-on or technical training in various fields.
Ask for statistics about where graduate go to college and what sorts of schools they get into. This can give you a general idea how well prepared students are for continuing on to college.
See if they have options for students who are advances or excel at subjects. A high school with flexibility and a willingness to challenge students who go above and beyond can be great preparation for academic excellence down the road.

, By the time your children reach middle or high school, they may have interests in a particular sport, playing a musical instrument, or perhaps as a budding thespian. Schools that are able to financially support your child's interests outside the classroom can provide a more edifying educational experience and help make them into more rounded maturing adolescents.

, While where a school receives its funding does not necessarily make it better or worse than another school, there are differences between public and private schools worth paying attention to. Perhaps you want the structure of a religious education, in which case a private religious based school may be a good option. You'll also want to take into consideration other factors, like whether your child has friends in the community already, how far you are able to drive, and what you are able to financially afford.The main difference between public and private school options is funding. This can play a role in deciding the type of education your child will get. Public schools are funded by the government and thus typically have to follow set curriculums. This will mean it will be largely standardized and have to adhere to certain standards. Private schools do not have to adhere to these and their independence can be a strength. If your child has special needs, public schools are mandated by law to accommodate, whereas private schools will vary from one institution to another."

Sign an agreement to use the chef, but don't commit to a long-term contract without careful research.",How to Hire a Personal Chef," Set up a few interviews. If you know people who use personal chefs, speak with them about setting up an interview with their personal chefs.;
, Not all personal chefs belong to a professional chef organization, but that doesn't mean they aren't reputable cooks. A certified or professionally affiliated chef has met certain standards and undergone training in safe food handling and preparation.

, Have the chef show you sample menus and explain how they operate. This is also the time to discuss what the chef charges and how you'll be expected to pay.

, Some people want a chef that has professional training, while others are perfectly fine working with a chef who is self-trained.

, A number of accidents can happen in the kitchen, so you need to make sure that your personal chef carries liability insurance in case of an accident.

, Personal chefs have a number of clients and usually only visit once a week to prepare meals. Private chefs usually live with the client or visit every day and prepare meals as needed.

, Ask the other clients their opinions about the chef's food, ability to follow dietary guidelines and their overall personality.

, This means they will prepare one meal for you so that you can see their cooking style and ability to clean your kitchen to your standards. Not every chef advertises this option, but it doesn't hurt to ask.

, A long-term contract means you'll have trouble firing the chef should you find that he or she doesn't meet your needs.

Almost all public schools follow the same curriculum because they’re bound by federal law, but private schools are not.


Public schools tend to emphasize core subjects, like math, science, English, and social studies. This well-rounded education is good preparation for your child’s college career.
Private schools are not bound by the same curriculum requirements that public schools are, so they may emphasize different subjects, or specialize in a particular type of curriculum, like the arts.;
, If your child has a learning or physical disability, knowing what accommodations or help your child requires to succeed in the classroom can help you decide on a school, private or public.


All schools that receive government funding are required to abide by the Americans with Disability Act, whether they are private or public.
Private schools run by religious institutions are not subject to the ADA, but some states have passed laws that regulate those schools in other ways.Although private schools can have admission requirements, they cannot refuse a student based solely on a disability. Private schools also must amend any policies or procedures that deny access to students with disabilities., When deciding what matters to you about the school your child attends, you might want to consider the diversity of the student population. Do you want a school that reflects your child’s own background or one with more diversity?


Most studies show that private schools are more accepting of a diverse student body and tend to mount more stringent anti-bullying campaigns. However, while private schools are more accepting of a diverse student body, public schools tend to actually have more diversity among their students., Whether you send your child to a single-gender or co-educational school is a personal decision, but make sure you know the pros and cons of both types of education before you choose a school.


Some studies show that girls do better in single-gender educational settings, particularly in math and science courses, because they are free from the gender stereotyping that might convince them that boys are better at those subjects.
However, some studies show that co-ed classrooms and schools more adequately prepare students for life after school; the world is, after all, co-ed. Additionally, there isn’t a lot of research to support the idea that single-gender schools always result in higher test scores or less gender stereotyping., Because public and private schools are governed by different federals laws and regulations, the quality of teachers can vary. Knowing how important teacher quality is to you and your child can help you weigh the difference between public and private schools.


Public schools are required by law to employ certified teachers. This means that every teacher your child has will have a teaching certificate.
Private schools are not required to employ certified teachers. This can be great for your student if, for example, their history teacher has a PhD in history (but no teaching certificate). But, depending on the school, the teachers might not be as good as those you would find in some public schools.Because private schools are not required to accept students with special needs – although some do – they might not have a special education teacher on staff.Keep in mind that this is a very general view on public vs. private school teachers – there are fantastic and not-so-great teachers in both systems.

, Although you shouldn't put too much stock in a school's online ratings, you should still ask about individual schools' testing scores. Students at private schools tend to outscore public school students on standardized tests, which can affect your child's ability to get into college.


However, there is some debate about this general assessment - researchers have used the same data to come to conflicting conclusions, and other factors - like socioeconomic status, can influence of student's scores, regardless of where they are educated., The number of extra curricular activities, including sports, offered by public and private schools can vary greatly. Knowing how important a variety of activities and sports is to you can help when assessing the differences between schools.


Public schools tend to have a greater variety of activities, clubs, and sports teams than private schools because they get a certain amount of funding for this. Public schools are also required to abide by Title IX, which requires equity in activity and sport funding, so whether you have a son or daughter, they’ll have a good chance of having a number of teams to choose from for tryouts.Private schools will sometimes offer sports and activities that public schools don’t, which is important if the sport your child plays is not very common in public schools.

, In general, public schools tend to have larger class sizes than private schools. If you need a school that can give more attention to individual students, you might consider a private school or a smaller public school., Before you start searching for schools, make a list of the things you’re looking for in a school. This list will help you keep your priorities front and center as you choose a school.


Find out what district you’re in. The most basic place to start when choosing a school is knowing which district you live in. This will greatly narrow down the schools you can choose from for your child.
Some school districts have what’s called “school of choice,” which means your child can choose which school in the district to attend, regardless of its geographic proximity to your home.
Other districts have agreements with neighboring districts that let you choose a school outside of the district you live in.
Find out if your district allows either of these options. If they don’t, your student will attend the public school associated with your neighborhood., If you decide ahead of time that you’re not willing to drive more than 20 minutes to take your children to school, you can narrow down your search for a new school – public or private – right away.

, Before you even begin to choose between public or private, you’ll need to know how much money you can spend on your child’s education. Public schools are taxpayer-funded, so you won’t pay tuition at a public school. Private schools are privately funded, and the main way they raise that money is through charging tuition. Working out how much you have to spend on your child’s education can really help you when you make your decision., Your child might need a program that specializes in teaching students with certain disabilities, or one that focuses on a particular area of their education (like an art school). Knowing what sort of program your child needs can help narrow down the list, too., Tuition rates at private schools vary widely from state to state, from $3,600 to over $20,000 per year. Make sure you know what the average is in your state before you begin looking. Private School Review is a website that can be helpful in finding this information for your state.You might not necessarily have to pay full tuition for a private school if your child gets a scholarship. Some private schools offer internal scholarships, and there are a variety of national scholarships that are awarded based on everything from religious affiliation to socio-economic status.
Some states also offer vouchers to defray the cost of private education. You’ll need to find out whether your state does so and how to apply for them. Again, Private School Review can direct you to that information., Before you decide on which public school you’ll send your child to, talk to other parents and ask for their honest opinion about the school. Most parents will be honest about their and their child’s experiences. If you don't know anyone who currently attends the school, you can ask for contact information for the school's Parent Teacher Association (PTA)., Consider chatting with the principal of the school you’re interested in for your child. The principals are in charge of the school and you can get a good idea of how the school runs, and what they prioritize, by talking to the person in charge., It’s easy to assume that higher tuition rates mean a better education when it comes to private schools. Be sure you find out how the tuition money you pay is allocated. Does it get spent on the buildings or on your child’s education? A clean, inviting, cheerful learning environment is important, but you child probably doesn’t need to study somewhere that looks like a castle to get a good education., Because teacher quality can vary so much from school to school, ask to meet some of the faculty at the schools you’re considering. This can give you a much better idea of the general quality of the school’s faculty than just reading online bios or CVs can give you.

, Schedule a tour of the private schools you’re interested in – you can learn a lot from these tours. Do the students look happy and engaged? Are the learning spaces bright and clean? You can learn a lot about a school based on your gut reaction when you visit. Taking your children along gives them the chance to see the school and decide if it feels like a comfortable environment to them.

, Schools in lower-income neighborhoods might have a lower rating on online rating websites, but they could also have fantastic teachers and principals. Talking to other parents will help you figure out if this is true, so don’t write a school off just because its ratings are a little low."

It gives you the chance to gain additional skills and knowledge.It can help prevent the restlessness and stagnation that sometimes accompanies too much time spent in the same work environment. There are many benefits to a lateral move.


A lateral move might pair you with a good boss or mentor. This is especially appealing if your current job doesn’t have either.
Moving to a different part of the company that’s more vibrant will lead to more visibility for you.Moving from one organization or department to another will mean that you’re meeting more people, making more contacts, establishing a bigger network of resources.Changing to a different department could lead to more advancement opportunities, especially if you’re stagnant in your current department., Make a budget that can absorb the unexpected. A budget is a work in progress. Your financial situation will constantly change and if your budget has the flexibility to accommodate plenty of variables you can save, pay off debt and invest to make your money grow.Track your expenses. Log all of your expenses for a month so that you’ll know where your money is going. You can use an App or pen and paper but account for everything.Allocate about 10% of your income for savings. Better to do a direct deposit so that you won’t be tempted to spend. Be patient and consistent. Depositing $100 per month means you've saved $48,000 after 40 years. Assuming a seven percent annualized rate of return, your $100 per month deposit would equal more than $260,000.Long-term savings should go toward a 401(k). Aim for maximizing your 401(k) deposits. Apply about 35% of your savings to housing and utilities. Put aside another 10% if you have specific goals in mind, such as buying a new car or paying for you child’s college education. Cut back on unnecessary spending. Rent a movie instead of going to the theater. Drop your land phone line. Don’t sign up for cable TV services you don’t need..Use the remainder of your income in whatever way you see fit. Food, entertainment, vacations etc. , Credit cards place you at one remove from your purchases. The process insulates you from your spending because you’re using a card (and not money) and don't have concrete ""proof"" that you're actually spending money. Credit card debt can accumulate quickly.


Implement a plan to pay off credit card debt using your budget. Know exactly how much you can afford to direct toward your credit card debt.
Pay off the card with the highest interest rate first, while meeting the minimum payment requirements for other cards. Be consistent in your payments. Many people reduce the amount they're paying toward a credit card debt when they see the balance going down. Pay with cash to avoid accumulating more credit card debt. Use cash for groceries, clothes, vacations and non-essentials. , You can use your budget surplus to invest. Invest regularly over time in a diversity of places.Apply 10% of your income to investments. Alternately, the money you’ve budgeted for savings can be split between savings and your investment needs.Invest in stocks using an investment firm if you’re not stock-savy. Over the past 70 years stocks have gained an average of 10% per year in value.Mutual funds are a good choice for the average investor. Offset the potential volatility of stocks by also investing in bonds and CDs. You’re loaning your money out at interest so the balance is growing although usually not at the same rate as stocks.Consider using an automated investment service. Their fees are low. They match your time horizon and goals with your investment. Try regular monthly direct debit investing. It guarantees you’ll be putting money aside for investments, taking the decision about where the money goes out of your hands. , What will you remember when you grow older? Will it be nailing the Krimsley account? Or will it be seeing Ben ride a bicycle for the first time? Make a conscious effort to separate work and family time and be “all in” with your family when you’re together.


Discuss your work hours and expectations with your boss so that you can set some boundaries to prevent work from leeching away at family time.Spend time with your spouse and children even if it means getting everyone together in the morning to exercise or stretch for fifteen minutes before leaving the house.
Institute a ""no electronics"" rule at the dinner table so that the family will pay attention to each other, rather than to their screens.
Take regular family vacations. This is a good way to focus solely on family without the worries of the workplace that follow you home.
Discuss childcare with your spouse. If you’re both working you’ll want to come up with a firm and fair plan with specific responsibilities for both parents.

, Lifetime friendships enrich your life. Friendships add texture to your connection with the world because you're sharing experiences, reliving good moments, making bonds with people upon who you can rely.


Make a list of people in your life who you feel close to. Invite them to your home for dinner or tea or to watch a movie

, Strong friendships are more easily made when you work together on areas of mutual concern and interest.Use your current contacts to make friends. If there are people who you've met briefly through friends and liked, try getting in touch with them through your mutual friend. Join a book reading circle. These circles usually meet regularly. Many of them last for years. Lifetime friendships are formed over a shared interest.

, What is it that you like to do? What activities are you drawn to that seem the most authentic and richest in terms of the experiences they provide? Make a list.


Take a class that focuses on an area of interest. Cooking, coding, painting, archery . . . there are numerous classes available.
Sign up for a hiking or nature club if you like the outdoors.
Volunteer to be a big brother or big sister.

, The physical state in which you arrive at your future can be like a payoff from a good investment. Take care of yourself so that you'll benefit in later years.


Maintain a healthy diet that includes fresh produce, lean protein sources, dairy products, and whole grains.Eat wholesome meals three times a day. When you don’t depend on one big meal daily, your body will reach a level of nourishment that diminishes cravings and helps you to naturally eat less.
Make regular visits to your doctor. Think in terms of “preventive maintenance.” Vaccinations, screenings and regular check-ups can prevent serious illness that adversely affect your future., Exercising has countless benefits including reducing the risk of heart disease and prolonging life.Exercising will help you to maintain normal weight. It will tone your body, strengthen muscles, keep bones strong and improve mood and sleep.Try for 150 minutes per week of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise.Begin by walking 15 minutes or so every other day and gradually increase the time and pace until you're jogging 30 minutes every other day.
Alternately, try aerobic exercise, 25 minutes of vigorous activity three days per week.Build muscle and maintain bone density through strength or resistance training. You can join a gym or work with weights at home., When your state of mind is good, you make good decisions about all aspects of your life. You feel better about your life.


Get enough sleep. Try for a regular sleep schedule. Choose calming activities before bed. No electronics in bed. Being sleepy makes concentration more difficult, raises stress levels and increases mood swings.Steer clear of drugs and alcohol. Keep your mind sharp."

Get it reviewed.",How to Build a Resume when Still in School," Being in school teaches you transferable skills to the workplace without you even knowing it. You have to spend time looking for them because teachers don't have time in each class to point out the skills. For example - full time students are often adept at organisation because you are doing sometimes up to six subjects with multiple assignment and you fit them all in and on time. Presto a transferable skill in organisation.;
, This is an excellent supplement to a resume and helps build more transferable skills into the workplace. It demonstrates a well-rounded and grounded individual to a potential employer as well as a hard-worker. There are many opportunities for school students to give back to the community.

, When it comes time to draft the resume and you have completed the opening lines of your personal contact details open the resume with the strongest asset you have. If this is your academic performance in school open with this, if your grades are not so sharp but you have volunteer experience open with this. If you have neither open with a list of skills you can offer. Remember what you put on your resume has to the punch line in your advertisement of yourself. This is no place to leave the best to last.

, A Resume has certain set sections they all contain, and an employer will look for them, such as education, work history, skills, hobbies etc. What do you have that is the most appealing to a potential employer and open with that and then work your way down to the least appealing to close. But ensure you cover them all.

, Make sure you contact these referees first and let them know you are using them. There is nothing worse than a referee caught off guard to ruin your chances. If your still working on sourcing referees or there are privacy concerns initially close with referees available on request. But make sure you have these issues sorted out before any interview.

, Always get a 2nd opinion on a resume before you send it out to business. Ensure spelling and grammar are correct and that you are putting yourself in the best light you can for a potential employer.

Try to incorporate aspects which have the most long term benefit to you and your family.,
Try to consider ways to avoid how a philosophy could be a disadvantage as well as how you can avoid these disadvantages.,
Look into social groups that may be of a similar philosophy.",How to Have a Food Philosophy," Its mostly a cuisine influenced by certain ideals. There is a lot of different types as well as philosophies which incorporate a lot of ideals, so these may often include:


Vegetarian or ethical influences.
Medicinal or health focused balance of ingredients.

Such as low fat, gluten free, low carbohydrate etc, some are also cultural, like imperial Chinese cuisine focused on the health needs of the patron etc, many international cuisines have a health cuisine. This can also be expanded to balance of spices and herbs with a health focus.


Production influences.

Such as organic, sustainability issues, low carbon, a seasonal cuisine or supporting local producers etc.


Quality and freshness of food and ingredients.
Communal food.

This can be cooking and preparing as well as eating with family and friends, whether this expands to food communally produced or not, or getting involved in community cooking such as holding food stalls, cultural festivals, volunteer cooking for your local church or social group etc.


Comfort food or ""feel good"" focus.
""Knowing"" food.

This preference wishes to know about the food, where it comes from, who produces it down to the dynamics of production such as soil types, seasonal influences and harvest methods.


DIY food.

This mostly focuses more on cooking from scratch and making various things (such as breads, preserves etc) by hand.


Nostalgia food.

This can be an interest in older fashioned recipes and methods which are now rare, or recipes from your childhood.


Slow food movement.

The slow food movement celebrates many things such as more gentle cooking and a more relaxed dining method.


Aesthetics of the food

Such as how it is presented as well as what it is served on (dishware and cutlery etc), and considerations such as art (art nouveau cuisine is a good example), structure and garnish, a ""wow factor"" or colours etc.


Elitist movement.

This can be selecting certain types of meals due to class focuses (such as not eating the more older peasant style dishes, or everyday dishes eaten by the ordinary person), it can be expanded to buying foods endorsed by ""experts"".


There are however many more.;
, You may already be operating under a food philosophy of type, aside from your personal food tastes and preferences.

,


Some advantages are that it can expand your horizons in cooking and dining methods as well as as gain an insight into different cultures. It can introduce you to new ideas and methods that could introduce more interest, fun and enjoyment into your cooking as well as meet new friends.
The disadvantage is it can work exactly the opposite way, such as isolating you from people who do not have a food philosophy, or creating prejudice for those who don't have a philosophy.

, It might be to reduce meat for ethical or health reasons, it might be to occasionally visit a farming town to learn how food is produced as well as try some locally made food. It might be to encourage a sense of community by inviting your neighbours around for a meal or expand your knowledge of other cultures etc.

,


A common trap is a case where a person buys ""the best"" simply because it is said to be the best, without actually knowing why it is good or what makes the other inferior. There can be quite a degree of ignorance and influence easily by celebrity chefs so this person might easily be taken advantage of (as they might not know the difference), or pay more for something they could easily make themselves, or pay more for a same quality product just because of the endorsement, or miss out on many good cuisines that are not ""endorsed""
Another trap is a person who focuses too much of one just type of cuisine - such as solely comfort food may compromise their health, or live in a very small range of dishes and repertoire.

, Many of these operate social groups be they trips to producers, or a nice place in the country to visit for a meal, or cooking classes etc.

Dispose of the unused remains wisely.",How to Gut a Turkey," Turkeys come in various sizes, so you will want to pick a turkey whose size can feed the number of people you plan to serve.


The rule of thumb is to buy 1 pound of turkey for every person you plan to serve. However, this does not allow for leftovers. If you would like to have leftovers, then you should plan to buy 1 ½ pounds of turkey per person.For example, if you want to serve eight people without leftovers, then you should buy an 8-pound turkey. However, if you want to have leftovers after serving those eight people, then you should buy a 12-pound turkey.;
, It is important to avoid contaminating the turkey, so before beginning to gut it, you should be sure to thoroughly clean your work space.


Use an antibacterial cleaning agent to wipe down the counter, and be sure that any other tools you plan to use, such as a cutting board and knives, are also cleaned with antibacterial dish washing liquid. Alternatively, you can wash down these surfaces and tools with hot, soapy water.Wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds prior to handling the turkey. Also be sure to wash under your fingernails, if necessary.

, Make sure that you have all necessary materials that you will need for gutting the turkey either on your person or within reach.


Cutting board
Knife or knives
Bowls
Gloves (note: latex-free gloves would be a good option, due to latex allergies in some people)
Apron

,


This step is only necessary if your turkey still has the neck. If it does not, you can skip this step and move onto the next.

, Do this carefully, since you have already made one cut in the turkey. Flipping the turkey over prepares you to make the cuts that will enable you to pull out all of the innards safely.

,


Take care while making this cut so that you do not puncture any of the innards.,


Some organs will be able to be kept and cooked as offal, which is highly nutritious. These include the heart, liver, and gizzard.Other organs will have to be disposed of in a proper way.

, This loosens the intestine so that you can pull it out, along with the other digestive organs.You need to take care while doing making this cut because the digestive juices inside these organs will break down any meat on the turkey if they touch it.
These are not organs that can be kept to cook, so set them aside in their own bowl to await proper disposal after you finish gutting the turkey.

, Again, this step is only necessary if your turkey has a neck.


You can pull out these parts through the pelvis, since they are loosened from the neck.Alternatively, you can pull these parts directly from the neck after you have made a slit., The crop refers to the sac in the turkey's breast that stores the food it was eating.A store-bought turkey likely no longer has its crop, but it would be worthwhile to verify.


Cut a slit in the turkey where the neck meets the chest and carefully pull it apart. Inside, you should see the crop. Clean it out completely., Be sure to use strong water pressure to rinse the turkey well, inside and out.


It is important to remove any remaining blood and lung tissue before preparing the turkey for cooking.Use cool water in order to avoid bacteria growth, which will happen with heat.

,, Seal your turkey in a turkey roasting bag or a shrink wrap bag in order to store it.Only keep it in the refrigerator for a day or two before cooking; if it will be weeks or months before you plan to cook it, it should be stored in the freezer until you are ready.

, You must again use antibacterial cleaning agents or hot, soapy water to clean all of your work space and tools, such as the knives and bowls. Wash your hands with warm, soapy water again to rid them of any bacteria.

, When you gutted the turkey, you set aside its innards in different bowls based on whether they could be cooked later or needed to be disposed of.


Gizzard
Heart
Liver
Neck, if you have it on your turkey, can also be cooked and served., Depending on how quickly you plan to cook and serve the giblets, the freezer is likely the better option.If you plan to cook the giblets within a day or two, then wrap them securely in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and store them in the refrigerator until you cook them.
If you want to save them longer term, wrap them in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and store them in the freezer. It is also a good idea to put them inside a freezer-safe bag for extra protection, up to four months.
Be sure to get these items into the freezer before the “best by” date on the turkey's wrapping.

, If you have a cat or dog all parts of the turkey that you won't use can be fed to them, or you can give them to your pet owning neighbor.


Otherwise, place the remaining innards in a trash bag for disposal. It would be best to double-bag these parts in order to prevent leakage if the first bag rips. You should include all of the innards that you are not keeping to cook later, such as the lungs, intestines, and gallbladder.
If your community has a green bin program, put them in one of the disposable bags and keep it in the freezer until trash collection day, and then put it in the green bin or if not available dispose of the innards in a dumpster or outdoor trash can. The innards will likely start to smell foul, so it is best to take them directly to a dumpster, if possible, or to throw them away in an outdoor trash can that has a lid.
Note that wild animals, like raccoons or bears, might try to get into the trash if they can smell the innards and other waste. Secure your outdoor trash can, if possible, so that they do not make a mess by spilling it.

Account for formal parties.",How to Entertain," Start by getting the area organized for a party. You’ll probably want to rearrange the furniture to allow for the most amount of space and to ensure that people can sit and stand in such a way that’s it’s easy to talk to each other. You also might want to consider having a quiet conversation area that’s slightly away from everything else, so that people that need a moment of quiet time can get it.


Try to split large areas into smaller sections, to facilitate the small conversation groups that normally form at gatherings.
If the space is small, move as much of the furniture as you can to the outer edge, or place some excess furniture in another room that will not be used, in order to create more space.;
, Once you’ve arranged the space to look how you want, start cleaning up. You’ll want to make a good impression on your guests. What needs to be cleaned will depend on where you’re entertaining but some good places to start include:


Taking out trash and any other pungent items
Mopping and vacuuming floors
Cleaning glass and windows
Picking up clutter
Thoroughly cleaning the kitchen and bathroom

, There are lots of places that we often forget to clean and a party is a perfect excuse to make sure that those spots aren’t neglected. Try to be thorough when you clean, picking up items that you usually leave alone and being sure to get all the spaces that were covered by the furniture you remove.


For example, many people forget to clean under the toilet seat for a party. Female guests might not notice, but male guests can’t miss a bunch of caked on gunk!
Another neglected spot is your front yard. This is where guests will get their first impression, so you’ll want to be sure it looks nice, clean, and organized.
Don’t forget the inside of the fridge, either. People will be opening it looking for drinks and they don’t want to see dried meat juice from those steaks caked to the shelf.

, Once everything is clean, you might want to make a mental checklist and decide if any items need to be removed from the area. There are lots of items that you might not want around your guests for many different reasons. This includes breakables, valuables, and items that might be sensitive. Store these items away until you are done entertaining.


For example, your great grandfather's pocket watch might be in a case in your living room. If you don’t know the people that are coming over, it might be a good idea to put it somewhere less obvious.

, With a solid base for your party environment, you'll want to put on some finishing touches to really wow your guests. This is where decorations can be really helpful. You're probably used to ribbons for birthdays and spider webs for Halloween, but don't feel like that's all you can do for decorations. There are lots of options to choose from.


For example, let's say that you're having a going away party for a friend. Theme the decorations to the place where they will be going so that they know you'll all be with them there in spirit.

, With everything else ready to go, you're ready to put together your playlist. Music can make or break a party, so you'll want to consider setting up those background sounds. Make sure that you don't turn the music up too loud. You want people to be able to hear each other.


Try to theme your music to your party or to the tastes of your guests. However, if you're unsure, try to choose music which is widely liked. Bob Marley or the Jackson 5 make great listening for a summer party, while Sinatra era music is great for winter gatherings, for example.
You can use websites, like Pandora, to act as a DJ for you. This can save a lot of trouble and ensure that the music is a good mix. You can set online radio stations like this to play music for any theme or taste, so this is a great party option.

Here's the basics on connecting speakers to your computer, if you don't know how to set up music for a party.

, Snacks, appetizers, and finger foods are crucial for a party. This is because they are easy to graze on in between activities and conversations. Eating a meal tends to fill your mouth for too long, making it hard to interact with people. You don't even need to have ""real"" food as long as you have plenty of great snacks.


Great options include crackers and cheese, individual small cups of layered dips, and stuffed wraps or rolls. Don't forget the gold standards either, like chips and veggies with dip.

, If your party coincides with a mealtime, you'll want to be sure to offer foods that are a little more substantial too. Someone that's too hungry can cruise through snacks, leaving other guests without something to eat. You'll want to plan ahead and make something that's easy and fast to prepare and that doesn't cost too much.


For example, a burrito bar is quick to throw together and very cheap. It's also easy to cater it to lots of different tastes and food restrictions.

, Everyone loves dessert. Even if your other food was lacking, having a really great dessert can make sure people leave with a great impression of your gathering. Of course, you can just buy a dessert from a local store (splurge and get something fancy) but you can also make your own.


Did you know you can make a pretty impressive cheesecake in your blender with just milk, sugar, cream cheese and Biscuits?Pour it into a store-bought crust and top with fresh berries to wow your guests with minimal effort.

, As you're planning your food, try to think about how you're going to prepare it all. You'll want to leave yourself plenty of time to make the food so that you're not left in the kitchen while your guests are out. Try to choose foods that you can make the night before or that can be prepped a day or two before and then thrown in the oven when guests arrive.


For example, let's say you're throwing a formal dinner party. You can start marinading a roast overnight, setting it to soak in juices and stuffing it with garlic. Prep mashed potatoes the night before that only need to be reheated when guests arrive. Supplement all of this with a salad that's easy to toss together. This way, all you have to do on the night of the party is toss together the salad and put the roast in the over about two hours before guests are ready to eat.

, You'll want to be sure to have plenty of drinks for all your guests. Assume that every person at the party will have at least two or three drinks over the course of the party. Allowing for more can be better, if possible. You'll also want to have lots of different drinks available, since people will have differing tastes. Do take the theme and type of party into account when you choose, though.


Good party drinks include daiquiris (virgin or otherwise), spiced wine, and ginger ale.
You can display your drinks in a unique way if you want to. For example, you can make a bowl out of ice for displaying fruit punch.

, Once everything is prepared, you can start setting out your food. For formal parties, everyone might be sitting down around a large table. For less formal parties, it's better to have food on a table somewhere slightly out of the way. Just be sure that you're not setting out food that can spoil too early. Cold or hot foods should wait until guests arrive to be displayed.


Putting food on multiple levels or tiers can make it easier to reach all of the food items. Just don't put things toward the back which are easy to drop. You don't want cocktail sauce too fall into the fruit salad!
If your guests will not be sitting to eat, try to choose foods which are easy to eat while standing up. Some foods, like soup, can pose too much of a challenge.

, When people come in, you'll want to start by welcoming them to your home. Don't just ignore them or rush off to talk to someone else, even if the party is informal. This can leave your guest feeling unwelcome and neglected.


Even just saying something simple like ""Aw, I'm so happy you came. Make yourself at home."" can be enough.

, If you have the time to, show them around the areas where the party is happening. They don't need a tour of your knickknacks but pointing out where the bathroom is and where they can find the food is useful.


You also might want to tell them where they can put things, what some of the basic house rules are (such as if shoes aren't allowed in a room), and so on.

, A good host will introduce people that don't know each other and try to help them communicate with each other. You want to get a conversation started before you move on to talk to other people.


For example, if you know two people both like the same musician, you can say something like ""Oh, Becca, you'll appreciate this: Julie just got back from a Macklemore show in Seattle. Julie, Becca is just obsessed with Macklemore.""

, As the party goes on, try to talk to and interact with everyone. You probably will have a few people that you're closer with than others and you might be tempted to just talk to them all night, but that can leave other guests feeling left out. Try to at least check on everyone every now and again, even if it's just to offer them more to drink.


Try to ask at least one question of each guest over the course of the party. This shows them that you take an interest in them and that you care about their presence.

, Once the party wraps up, say goodbye to people as they leave and thank them for coming. This makes people feel appreciated and respected. Neglecting to say goodbye can hurt people's feelings and ruin their perception of your party (even if they had an otherwise good time).

, Of course, it’s a party so you’ll want to be sure to set up activities to keep people talking and interacting. You’ll want to tailor those activities, however, to the number of guests you’ll have as well as the interests and personalities of your guests.


Create large group activities. If you have lots of people, you’ll want to have at least one activity that lots of people can do together. Try a cheesy dance competition, rent a karaoke machine, and hire someone to come and give your group dance lessons. Of course, the activity you choose should take your guests into account. If they’re quiet ladies, for example, someone to give a lesson on decoupage might be better appreciated than a dance instructor.
Create small group activities. If you have a more intimate group, you’ll have a few more options for activities you can all do together. Set up a game of sackhole or pull out some board games. Don’t feel limited to Monopoly, either. Newer games, like Apples to Apples, are great for small party groups (around 10 players).

, Remember that not all of your guests will be extroverted, just because they’re at a party. By giving introverts a quiet place to escape for a few minutes, you can make sure that everyone enjoys your party. But of course, you also want to give them the tools they need be social comfortably. Try:


Creating conversation starter cards. These cards have a couple of questions or conversation topics written out on them. Place these cards at their place setting or on a table in the middle of the room, so people can use them when they want to.

, If your party will outside, you'll need outdoor activities. If your party is indoors, you'll need indoor activities. Having both available might be a good idea too. Just remember that if you're planning an outdoor party and environmental factors might ruin your plans (like rain), you'll want to have indoor activities available as a backup plan.


For outdoor activities, you can set up carnival games, a s'mores station, or an outdoor movie theater.
For indoor activities, you can set up a photo booth (all you need is a camera, a stand, a backdrop, and props), white elephant gift exchange, or a station for temporary tattoos., Choosing a theme for your party can also help you in planning activities. For certain occasions, a theme might lend itself (such as a party for a particular holiday). Otherwise, you'll have to come up with a theme and themed activities that you think will appeal to your guests.


For a Roaring 20's themed party, screen a silent movie and set up some casino games. You can even make alcohol free cocktails if there will be too many younger people at the party for real ones.
For a manly party, hire a cigar roller. Get a custom blend made up just for the occasion and then get someone to roll cigars for any guest that wants one.

, If you're having a formal gathering, you'll probably need to take a slightly different approach to entertaining. Make sure you account for this when you plan your event. Often, formal parties are more challenging, since people are less inclined to be social and friendly. This means that you might want to make sure that people have cues that can get them talking and interacting.


You can have guests play the ""Who am I?"" game. This is where you write down the name of a well known person on a card and tape it to the back of each guest. The guest then has to ask questions of other guests to find out what person they've been assigned.
Favors that get people doing an activity are also a great option for formal parties.

Select a large, clean jar.,
Pour in 1/2 cup (120 mL) dechlorinated water.,
Mix in 3/4 cup (180 mL) flour thoroughly.,
Add organic, unwashed grapes (optional).,
Cover but do not seal it.,
Keep in a warm place for two days.,
Add 1/2 cup (120 mL) water and 3/4 cup (180 mL) flour.,
Replace part of the starter each day with new flour and water.,
Keep an eye on its progress.,
Move to the refrigerator and feed less often.,
Use it in bread recipes.",How to Grow Yeast1," Ideally, use a glass jar that can hold at least two quarts (two liters), as the starter will grow rapidly and force you to throw away more of it if the jar is too small. Plastic, earthenware, or stoneware containers are also usable, but glass may be easiest to clean, and makes it easy to view your bread starter.Sterilizing the jar in boiling water is recommended if your container is heat-safe. Washing the jar in hot, soapy water, then rinsing may be sufficient, however.;
, If your tap water is treated with chlorine, you can purchase de-chlorination tablets to remove it, or let it sit out for 24 hours. The minerals found in ""hard"" water may help the yeast culture develop, so using distilled water is not recommended.


If you do not have access to water with ideal characteristics, use any water that is safe to drink., Use unbleached all-purpose flour if you will be using your starter to make white bread, or whole wheat flour to make brown bread. Flour naturally contains wild yeast, a micro-organism which produces the carbon dioxide and other substances which cause bread to rise and add additional flavors.


Stir vigorously, adding air into the mixture.
Many other types of flour can be used to make different flavors of starter, including brown rice flour and spelt flour., If you are using white flour instead of whole grain flour, your starter may not have certain types of yeast that produce a tangy, sourdough flavor. Optionally, you can attempt to correct this by adding a little fruit, most commonly a handful of grapes, to the mixture. Use organic grapes that have not been treated with pesticides or wax, so you can add them unwashed to the mixture.


While grapes definitely contain yeast strains, how well they thrive in a bread starter is disputed. Some bakers recommend this step, while other question how much effect it has., Avoid using an airtight lid, as a successful starter will produce gas that could break the lid, and may need additional oxygen to thrive. Instead, cover it with a cheesecloth, paper towel, or clean dishcloth tied on with a rubber band, or use a loose fitting lid not fully tightened.

, In order to encourage yeast activity, keep the new bread starter in a warm environment, at least 70ºF (21ºC). After two days, the mixture may look bubbly or foamy, and take on a noticeable smell. Some starters will take longer to get off the ground, however, so don't worry if you don't notice any changes yet.


If your house is cold, store the yeast near the stove or heater, but not so close that it cooks or becomes hot or steaming. Yeast thrives in warm environments, but dies if it gets too hot.

, Stir in the same type of water and flour in smaller quantities, until it is mixed thoroughly. Cover and leave an additional 24 hours while the yeast eats its new food.

, Each day, remove part of the starter, leaving at least 1/2 cup (120 mL) in the jar. The starter is not yet safe and effective to use in recipes, so throw out the removed portion. Add in more water and flour to replace it – the exact amount you use isn't important, as long as you use 3 parts flour to 2 parts water. Don't try to add more than triple the current size of the mixture.

, At first, the starter may produce a yellowish liquid at the top, or smell like alcohol. Hopefully, this should disappear within a week, as the yeast colony grows and produces a more bread-like smell. Once the yeast is established, the mixture should consistently expand to double its size between each feeding. Continue to feed until this is accomplished, and at least for a full week to minimize the chance of competing micro-organisms taking over.Some starters may not be ready for a month or longer.


If the mixture produces a dark brown liquid instead, this is a sign that it is running out of food. Pour off the liquid and feed more often, or with larger amounts of flour and water per feeding., Once the mixture doubles in size every day for at least three days, and does not produce any unpleasant (non-bread-like) aromas or liquids, cover it tightly and move it to the refrigerator. The yeast will go dormant, or at least slow down, and you will only need to feed it once a week with flour and water, discarding part of it if necessary to avoid overflow. As long as you remember to feed it, the starter can be kept in the refrigerator indefinitely, producing yeast-filled bread starter for months or even years.


Brown rice flour starters need to be fed every few days even in the refrigerator., Before using a portion of the starter in a bread dough recipe (in place of baker's yeast), make it active again by moving it to room temperature, covering loosely with a paper towel or cheesecloth, and feeding it at least three times at 8–12 hour intervals. Knead the bread dough thoroughly until the gluten is activated, which will create a dough that can be stretched thin enough for light to shine through without the dough breaking. Because wild yeast tends to act slower than commercial yeast strains, allow the bread dough to rise for anywhere from 4 – 12 hours, or even 24 for a more sour bread.Make sure not to overheat the bread dough, which can kill the yeast. Touch the bread dough occasionally if kneading in a mixer, as these can overheat the dough.
You may also use sourdough starter in other recipes that involve flour, but be aware that it will add a tangy sourdough taste. Many people make sourdough pancakes to use up extra starter that would otherwise be thrown away during feeding.

Sheltered from winds and fierce sun
Spacious so that a large group of people can be accommodated where possible (not always necessary but a nice touch)
Comfortable and pleasant - try to avoid facing blank, dull features such as a concrete wall. If you have problem walls, etc., try to enhance these or cover them with plants, decorative items, etc.
Near the kitchen for ease of bringing out the food, or at least accessible easily via a pathway, etc.;
, The table and chairs should be capable of resisting weather elements such as rain and sun.

, A tablecloth, some flowers, a lantern, etc. are the types of items suitable for decorating an outdoor table. Remember that you will have to cart all these items from the inside to outdoors and vice versa, so minimise this by being smart about your decoration choices. Even grabbing a pot plant from outside and placing it on a clean saucer for a feature piece can work well and it's easier to restore to its place after the meal.

, Cold food is often an easier choice than hot food, unless you have a barbecue or warming pad near to the table. A mixture of barbecued food with salads, sliced vegetables/fruit, pasta, cheeses, pâtés, etc., works well for al fresco dining.

, Place insect repellent herbs near the dining area (e.g., lavender, tansy, pyrethrum, etc.) and burn citronella candles or oil to keep the insects at bay.

, This step comes naturally. Take a moment to make a mental note of the flavor, the smell and the texture of what you're eating. That memory will stay with you and remind you of how good the meal was.

, Eating too much will give you that sick, bloated feeling you get when you are full. Keep this good meal, by eating just enough and no more.

, If something extra is on your dish, such as a condiment/side order that you don't normally eat, or a different dish altogether you haven't tried yet is available, go for it! Often a meal won't feel complete if you haven't tried a little of everything on your plate.

, From the very beginning, recipes were made to be altered and tampered with, to make new and exciting ones. Picture this––an ancient Chinese man eating some bland and dry chicken with rice adds a little sauce with some pineapple and tomato, and what does he get? Sweet and sour chicken: a delicious Chinese dish. Even now, that dish is still being modified. Try to alter your meal with some different sauces, and aim to get the ratio of flavor varieties right. Eventually you'll end up with your own personal meal that you fine-tuned to your own taste buds.

Boil 1 cup (240 mL) water and 1/4 cup (60 mL) dried malt extract.,
Turn down heat and stir in 1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) agar powder until dissolved.,
Bring to boil again.,
Remove from heat.,
Fill each container with a small layer of the mixture.,
Cover the containers and wait.,
Sterilize the inoculation loop.,
Draw the loop lightly over the liquid yeast sediment.,
Add the yeast to the surface of the wort, following this step carefully.,
Repeat the sterilization before adding yeast to each container.,
Check on the yeast cultures for the next few days.,
Move successful cultures to the fridge.",How to Grow Yeast2," While you can begin a yeast culture using store-bought liquid brewer's yeast, the process of growing it is usually too difficult and time consuming if you are only starting with a commonly available strain. Typically, home brewers grow yeast cultures starting with yeast sediment from a particularly successful homebrew, a favorite brewpub, or another rare or expensive strain they wish to grow for repeated use.


Growing your own yeast cultures long-term can take a lot of time and effort. It is not required to brew beer at home, only to maintain certain favored yeast strains.
Note that the yeast sediment in a beer bottle may not be the same as the yeast used in primary (initial) fermentation, so your results may not be what you expect.

, Airborne contaminants can ruin the yeast cultures, as can bacteria. Avoid damp areas or places where food is prepared, such as kitchens and basements. Close windows to your yeast growing room, especially in warm weather.Always wash your hands with antibacterial soap before handling the yeast cultures.

, Wash a workbench or table as thoroughly as possible. Kill most remaining micro-organisms with a sanitizing product such as rubbing alcohol. Allow to dry.

, The easiest way to acquire the necessary equipment may be purchasing a brewer's kit, which may or may not come with starter yeast and instructions. If you are acquiring the equipment piece by piece, or checking whether the kit contains everything, see the Things You'll Need section for a full list. Try pharmacies, or look for laboratory equipment suppliers in the yellow pages or online.


Ordering laboratory supplies in the United States may be delayed or involve questioning by government agencies.Agar powder is available at many Asian grocery stores. If you cannot find any, use unflavored gelatin powder, but be aware that gelatin-base cultures needs to be kept in cooler locations to avoid melting., Steam heat-safe, glass containers and their lids in a pressure cooker for at least 10 minutes to kill sources of contamination. Petri dishes, or ""plates,"" are often used but you may use any small, glass container. ""Starter tubes"" are sometimes included in brewer's kits for this purpose.


If you don't have a pressure cooker, immerse the containers in water and boil for 30 minutes. However, this is not nearly as effective at killing contaminants, which will likely result in a larger number of yeast cultures failing to grow or being ruined by mold.
If you have sterilized plastic bags to store the containers in, you may prepare the containers in advance.

, Because sterilization is so important for brewer's yeast cultures to prevent other micro-organisms from taking over, this step is recommended in addition to the above. Using a propane torch or other high-temperature, portable flame source (not an ordinary cigarette lighter), run the end of the flame across the lips of the container.

, If the tap water in your area is ""hard,"" meaning it contains a high quantity of chalky, carbonate minerals, it may cause bacterial growth in your yeast culture. Use distilled water to be safe, or measure the pH of your water and use it only if the result is 5.3 or below., Heat the water in a pressure cooker if possible to avoid boiling over, or use a clean Pyrex flask or saucepan. Add in the dried malt extract and stir to dissolve. Bring to a boil for 15 minutes, taking care to turn down the heat if it is in danger of boiling over.


This is called a ""starter wort.""

, The starter wort already contains the nutrients brewer's yeast cultures need to thrive, but the agar powder will eventually thicken the mixture into a gelatinous base for the yeast to rest on. Note that the thickening will not occur during this step.


Use unflavored gelatin powder only if you cannot acquire agar powder, since cooked gelatin may melt in a warm room.

, Boil for an additional 15 minutes. Once again, keep a careful eye on it to stop it from boiling over.

, Allow the mixture to cool to 122ºF (50ºC) or below, or a bit cooler if using gelatin instead of agar. The mixture should thicken, but not solidify completely.

, Take your sterilized containers and fill each one with a little of the boiled mixture, called starter wort. Petri dishes should be filled approximately 1/4 of the way full; larger containers do not require a thicker layer.

, Put lids on the containers or cover with plastic wrap. Let them cool for about half an hour, and watch as the wort solidifies due to the agar powder. Once the containers can be tilted without the mixture running, they are ready.

, The inoculation loop, available from laboratory supply stores, is a tiny wire loop at the end of a wand, used for transferring micro-organisms such as yeast. Sterilize the loop end by heating it in a flame until the entire loop grows orange or red.Cool the loop to room temperature or slightly warmer by placing it in a shallow dish of isopropyl alcohol, or wiping it with a cotton ball soaked in alcohol.


If you do not cool the loop, the heat could kill the yeast.
Cooling it in water or air increases the chance of micro-organism contamination, which should be killed by the alcohol.

, Do not try to pick up a visible amount of yeast. All you need to do is barely draw the loop through the sediment gathered on the top of the liquid., Leaving the lid off for as short a time as possible, move the inoculation loop lightly over the surface of the starter wort in one of your containers. This transfers yeast onto the hopefully germ-free and nutrient-rich wort. To minimize the chance of contamination, immediately attach the lid again. Turn petri dishes upside down, or cap starter tubes to about 3/4 tightness.The process of adding a micro-organism to the plate is called ""streaking"" by microbiologists.

, Use the same process to add yeast to each container, but remember to heat the inoculation loop to sterilize it between each transfer, then cool it in alcohol. Yeast cultures grown at home have a relatively high chance of contamination, so using multiple, separately-grown cultures increases the odds that some of your cultures end up usable.

, Store the containers at 70–80ºF (21–26ºC), the ideal temperature range for active yeast growth. Discard any cultures that grow fuzz or balls of mold, or fail to grow any visible yeast after several days. Successful yeast cultures will produce a milky layer over the surface, and you may see individual yeast colonies forming trails of dots over the surface., Now that the successful cultures have been activated, wrap the containers completely in electrical tape or another light-blocking material, since light can destroy or damage yeast colonies. Store these in the fridge, ideally at 34–36ºF (1–2ºF) or slightly warmer, to slow their growth and prevent them running out of nutrients.When you wish to use one in a brew, remove it from the fridge in advance to bring it up to room temperature before adding (pitching) into the wort.

Fill the right shaker with the right seasoning.",How to Fill Salt and Pepper Shakers2," This may seem basic but it's actually subject to considerable controversy and depends on your preferences:


Some say that salt needs the container with less holes but larger ones, because it's the bigger grain to get through the holes. Others prefer the salt to have more holes but smaller because it allows for more of the seasoning to flavor the dish.
Some say that pepper needs to container with larger and more holes because it's a bigger grain that is harder to shake through.
The answer probably falls into a gray area––it depends on the size of the grains (really finely ground or chunkier), family/restaurant preference and the tradition you've been raised with. Complicating the answer is the fact that there seem to be different standards in different countries. Go with the flow that works best for you!

Tape over the base holes of shakers designed for pre-ground salt and pepper.,
Turn the shaker upside down.

,
Fill the shaker with ground salt or pepper.,
Fill the shaker just to the top.,
Pull the tape off the holes.",How to Fill Salt and Pepper Shakers3," The fine grains will easily slip through when you tip the shaker upside down to fill and the tape will prevent this from happening.

,, To make this easier, use a small funnel to transfer from the original container to the shaker. A funnel can be purchased from the store or one can be made simply from paper (see How to make a cone or funnel from paper).

, Leave enough space for movement of the grains through the holes.

, Tip the shakers back up the right way. Done!

Ease the side of a strong, blunt knife against one side of the stopper or plug.,
Ask a stronger person to open it.,
Try softening the stopper by washing the shaker in warm water.",How to Fill Salt and Pepper Shakers4," Gently lift the knife up and ease open the stopper. This method is best for hard plastic stoppers; the knife may mark or cut into softer stoppers.

, In some cases, there is nothing for it but brute force. Get someone who has a strong grip to place their fingers and thumb around the edges of the stopper and to pull really hard a few times. Eventually the stopper will begin to loosen and can be pulled out.

, This will only work if you're happy to let existing contents get washed away. Also, the container needs to be washable, so it's not ideal for untreated wooden shakers.

Let the shaker soak for 10 minutes or so in warm water. See if it will ease out while in the water still. If not, proceed to the next step.






Remove from the water and let dry or hand dry with a soft tea towel. Try removing the stopper again; hopefully the warmer water has softened it a little.

Listen to word of mouth recommendations.,
Schedule a tasting.,
Consider the caterer's specialty.,
Consider what services you need.,
Ask for references.,
Inquire about food freshness.,
Call the local health department.,
Ask for a quotation.,
Read the contract.",How to Choose a Good Caterer,"


No amount of advertising can replace a good recommendation from somebody you know and trust. If a friend or acquaintance had a great caterer for their wedding, then this is a caterer you should talk to for your next big event. Conversely, bad reviews should also be heeded.;
,


Caterers who provide food for large events should offer to provide you with a tasting, in order to gain your business for a large contract. Keep in mind, however, that this tasting will be the very best product the caterers can produce. There's also often a huge difference in quality between preparing a meal for 2 compared to 500.

,


Some caterers specialize in larger scale events and have the equipment and expertise to professionally handle larger numbers of guests. Other caterers specialize in smaller intimate events, cocktail parties, or even just delivery of catered food. Be wary of the caterer who claims to be able to do it all, chances are that they don't excel at any of it.

,


Some caterers will only prepare and deliver you the food you ordered, and may even go so far as to set it up. Others can provide fully trained wait staff and support personnel. If you're having a formal event requiring plated service then you want a catering company large enough to handle your needs. Feel free to ask the caterer if their staff comes from a temporary agency or if they are employees of the catering company. Wait staff that comes from a temp agency can imply that the catering company doesn't often handle large, staffed events.

,


When entrusting a single company to handle the food for your event it is essential that you ask for references. Don't just ask them to hand over names; instead ask for referrals of several recent events they catered.

,


Many caterers cut corners in food preparation by using frozen products. Fresh is always best and they're charging you as though it were made fresh. Insist on only using a caterer that uses fresh food, not frozen.

,


Most catering companies are subject to licensing and regulation by their local health department, and there will be records on any prior complaints, issues and inspections. This is usually considered public information. If the catering company you're considering hiring has had violations or complaints it's time to look elsewhere.

,


Too often, asking to see the bottom line price is the first step in hiring a caterer when in fact it should be the last. The food for a wedding can be more than 50 percent of the entire wedding cost; you're going to get what you pay for. If your caterer is dropping their price you can be assured they're dropping their quality as well.

,


Never hire a contractor without a firm contract in place. This protects your interests in case the caterer doesn't follow through. Once you've decided on your caterer and agreed upon a price, sign the contract after reading it through carefully.

Buy fresh or dried fruits.,
Snack on vegetables and gluten-free dips.,
Shop for nuts and rice cakes.,
Find jerky or other meat-based snacks.",How to Buy Gluten Free Snacks1," Fruits never contain gluten (since they are free of wheat products), and make great snacks.If you’re not in a hurry, buy a selection: apples, peaches, plums, nectarines, and grapes can be eaten in any situation, and provide plenty of healthy vitamins. You can also purchase dried versions of most popular fruits, which are well suited for eating in a car or at work.

Most supermarkets will stock dried apricots, raisins, and dried mango, among other dried fruits.;
, Like fruits, vegetables will never contain gluten, and so are a reliable snacking option. Carrot sticks, celery, sliced bell peppers, and broccoli are a few popular vegetable snacks.If you’d rather not eat your vegetables plain, you can easily find a gluten-free dip to eat them with.

Pairing vegetables with hummus, nut butters, flavored cream dips, salad dressing, or chunks of cheese can offer healthy gluten-free snack options.
Whole fruits, nuts, rice cakes, and salads are healthy, filling, and often gluten-free.

, These products are typically gluten free, since they do not contain wheat or any grain products or byproducts. Nuts can be found in either salted or non-salted variety; either makes for a tasty snack.If you have access to a large grocery store, you should be able to find plenty of varieties of nuts: peanuts, cashews, macadamia nuts, walnuts, pecans, and almonds are a few popular varieties of nut.

Rice cakes are generally light and low on calories, and can be found in a variety of flavors.

, Meat does not contain gluten, so look for snacks that contain meat and minimal added ingredients.Jerky is by far the most popular meat-based snack (followed by the “slim jim” style of long, thin sticks of processed meat). Beef and turkey jerky are the two most common types of jerky, and can typically be found in the snack aisle of a grocery store. These products are gluten free, as long as they have not had a flavoring added which contains gluten (e.g. soy sauce or teriyaki).

Specialty stores or natural-foods supermarkets may carry an even larger variety of jerky, including animals like buffalo, bison, or ostrich. These are likely to cost more, though.

You wouldn’t want to spend the time making a delicate peanut butter pie for dessert only to remember that your partner is allergic to peanuts. Make a list of the food allergies your partner has, if any, and cross check any recipe you are considering with that list.


You should also consider your partner’s dietary preferences. Cooking a steak dinner might not go over very well with a vegan girlfriend. You could also consider foods that you know your partner loves and try to work these foods into your menu.;
, When considering what to cook, stick to dishes that you have tried before. Testing out a new souffle recipe on your loved one may result in a disastrous (but potentially memorable) meal. Choosing a simple meal can make the whole process a bit less stressful; there is nothing wrong with breaking out your family’s favorite fettuccine alfredo recipe for this special occasion.


Consider meals that you have cooked in the past that are simple to make but look fancy. Or, think about making a variation of a meal that you have not tried that you feel confident you can prepare well.
You could also browse the internet or search wikiHow for recipes that are rated well and that seem to be in accordance with your skill level.
Some recipes you may like to try include: Filet mignon, risotto, shrimp scampi, salad nicoise and French macarons (for dessert)


, If you are planning on serving several courses, try to pick out courses the compliment each other. Once you have picked out your main dish, consider selecting an appetizer(s) and dessert to accompany the main course. Consider the ingredients that you will be using in your main dish, and then try to find appetizers and desserts that pair well.


In general, you may want to try to stick to one type of cuisine. For example, if you are thinking about preparing fettuccine alfredo with chicken and vegetables for your main course, you may want to browse Italian appetizers and desserts. You could consider starting out the meal with a caprese salad, or melon wrapped in prosciutto (both of which are easy to prepare even if you have not made them before), and ending the night with Italian gelato and fresh fruit for dessert.

, Once you have selected your dishes, consider creating a pretty menu that you can put on the table for your partner to look at when they sit down. Write down each course and consider writing the main ingredients of each dish below the name of the course, like you often see in restaurants.

, If you are deciding between a couple of dishes, or are thinking about trying a recipe you have never tried before, you may want to try cooking them before your romantic evening if you have the time. Doing a test run can help you to figure out whether the dish will go over well.


Practicing the preparation of your meal will also help you to resolve any challenges you face during while cooking, such as overcooking or undercooking the meat, or leaving the noodles in the pot too long.

, To create a romantic evening, try to avoid dishes that smell heavily of things that are not terribly romantic, like intense fish or fiery garlic. Leaning in for a kiss from your loved one could end up less than romantic if you both wreak of boiled broccoli.

, Like smelly foods, foods that could upset your stomach should also be avoided if possible. Burping or passing gas in the middle of dinner could quickly kill the romantic mood if your partner is offended by that sort of thing. Of course, everyone reacts differently to different kinds of food, but in general the foods that cause the most gas include:


Beans and lentils.
Vegetables like broccoli, peas, asparagus, and cauliflower.
Fruits like peaches, apricots, raw apples, and pears.
Milk and rich dairy products.

, If you are the legal drinking age, consider pairing your meal with a nice bottle of wine. The wine you choose will depend on the kind of food you are eating. If you don’t like wine, or cannot legally buy it, consider making a fancy non-alcoholic beverage, like a Shirley Temple.


If you are considering wine, click here.

, Once you have picked out the dishes you will be preparing, go shopping for supplies. The ingredients you select should be good quality and fresh. For example, if you are planning on cooking beef, select a nice cut. If possible, go shopping a day or two before your romantic meal.


Remember that the freshness of your ingredients could change the flavor of your meal, so always try to pick out the freshest items.

, Your goal is to have everything ready at the same time. Try to aim for everything being ready to be put on the table about five minutes before you plan to eat. For example, if the rice needs to cook for an hour but the chicken only bakes for fifteen minutes, you'll need to start them at different times. To help plan out your cooking schedule:


Write down how long everything takes to cook and then begin cooking them in the order from longest time to shortest time.
If you need to boil something, don’t forget to factor in the time it will take for the water to heat up to a boil (generally around 10 minutes). The same goes for heating up the oven (this will depend on your oven and the temperature you are heating it to).

, If your timing is slightly off and one dish is done before the rest, try to keep it warm by placing the food in a covered container. You can also keep things warm by sticking them in the oven on a low temperature, but do not keep dishes in the oven for too long or they could dry out. You can also keep items you cooked on the stovetop warm by turning the heat to low.


Try to avoid relying on the microwave to warm things up if you can help it.

, Everyone has a different opinion about how much salt is too much salt. Try to err on the side of too little salt, as this can always be remedied by adding more. Place a salt shaker on the table so that your partner can choose to add salt if he or she feels like it.

, If you the food you are cooking is hot, consider putting it in serving dishes that will keep it warm until you are ready to eat. On the other hand, if your appetizers, or even your main dish, are cold, consider arranging them so that they look beautiful on the plate.


You could even put a flower on the plate next to the food to give the arrangement an extra touch.

, Once you have finished cooking and everything is being kept warm or is already plated, try to wash up the dishes and kitchen as much as possible.


If you don’t have time, fill the sink with hot water after the scraping the plates and put the dishes in so that they will be easy to clean the next day.

, Generally, you will want to try to do this before you begin cooking. Lay out a nice tablecloth and consider adding placemats where you will both be sitting. Try to match the plates and bowls, and lay out the necessary cutlery.


For example, if you are eating steak, make sure that each place setting has a steak knife to make cutting the meat easy.

, Candles are a lovely touch that you can add to heighten the romantic feel of your dinner. Dim the lights and place candles in accent spots around the room and on your table.


Keep in mind, however, to try to use candles that do not have too strong of a scent. Candles that are heavily scented can interfere with the taste of your dinner. Stick to neutral, light smells, or unscented candles.

, For an extra special dinner, place freshly cut flowers in a vase and put it on the table. However, try to keep the vase and flowers short so that they do not block your view of your loved one while you eat.


You can also get rose petals that you can sprinkle on the table, or place on your partner’s plate.

, Play music that you both like, but put it on a low setting so that it does not interfere or distract from your conversation. Consider putting on music that does not rely heavily on lyrics, such as jazz, classical music, or spanish guitar.

Use fresh, local fruit that is in season.,
Avoid adding table sugar to fruit dishes.,
Don’t forget juices and dried fruits.,
Use fruit purees in place of fat when baking.",How to Cook Healthily1," Cook with citrus in the spring, berries in summer and apples and pumpkin in the fall. Food prepared at the peak of its freshness has unbeatable flavor and nutritional value.;
, Instead, choose healthy ways to enhance the flavor of fruit in your cooking. For example, serve baked apples with frozen yogurt, cinnamon, walnuts and dried cranberries; or add balsamic vinegar to strawberries to bring out their natural sweetness.

, Fruit juice and dried fruit, when used in moderation, is a healthy addition to many meals. Cook a dish like Moroccan chicken with dried plums to boost the fiber content of the dish, or use freshly squeezed orange juice to give a citrus kick to a salad dressing.

, Applesauce is a great substitute for vegetable oil in muffin and bread recipes. You’ll have to do some research to calculate just how much fat you can replace with fruit in your recipes, but the fruit can add the same moisture to your dishes without making your fingers greasy, so it’s worth it.

When you're at home, you'll have easy access to cookbooks and other resources that will let you find out for sure what it is you need to make spaghetti carbonara, or chicken sandwiches, without wandering around the aisles aimlessly and trying to figure out what to make for dinner, buy for an eight week camping expedition, cater for guests, re-stock your pantry or whatever else.


Write out each meal you want to cook for the period you are shopping food, if applicable. Separate your shopping lists by ingredients. Try to plan it out so might be able to re-use certain ingredients. If you need garlic and tomatoes for pasta on Monday, think of other tomato-based dishes you might be able to make later in the week.
Making a list helps to keep food shopping a lot more manageable, especially if you're shopping for your family. If you've got a big group to buy for, go around and ask everyone if they have any requests so you can be sure you'll get everything.
If you're not sure what to you will need, head to the market and see what looks good. Buy a variety of fresh ingredients and take them home and find out how to cook them later. This is the chef's way of doing things. Ensure you don't overstock on items that will perish before you can use them.;
, Don’t come home from the store, butcher, delicatessen, market or other food vendor with three packages of bacon, bread and a fennel bulb, unless those are the foods you need to buy. Aim for a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, starches, quick snacks and meal ingredients to make your food shopping trip the most efficient possible.


Try to get in the habit of buying things you'll be able to use more than once where practicable. Buying pasta could make for a great hot dish one night and cold pasta salad when mixed with greens the next day. Hot Pockets don't have the same advantage, because they’re the same every time.

, You don't want to end up with a bunch of green rocks when you thought you were getting avocados unless you plan on using them in a couple of weeks time. Pick up produce and learn to identify fruits and vegetables that are at their peak of ripeness to make the right choices.


Smell fruits and feel for the firmness of vegetables when shopping for these foods. Lots of people are intimidated by selecting produce, thinking there's some big secret. There isn't. It should look and smell like you want to eat it. If it smells like nothing, it'll probably be bland and need some time to ripen.
Look for any signs of discoloration or spottiness. If vegetables look slightly spotty or feel very soft at the store, they'll probably turn before tomorrow rolls around. Unless you're going to eat something right away, buy slightly under-ripe produce.
Pick up fruits and vegetables, and don't be afraid to feel them. Dig around the bin. You want most fruits like melons, lemons, and other produce to feel heavier than it looks, which is a sign of ripeness.

, If you're a meat eater, buying fresh meat can be surprisingly challenging. The wall of cuts at most meat store or butcher is enormous and looks complicated. Whether you're looking for poultry, beef, or pork, spend some time looking for the best value and the highest quality. Make the freshness your first consideration.


Only buy meat that you can inspect yourself. If you can't see through the packaging, don't buy it. Look for any grayness or discoloration on poultry, beef, and pork. Check the use-by date, but use your own common sense and judgment more than the stamp that the store put on it.
It's usually best to buy big, when it comes to meat, but only if you'll be able to use it. It's a lot more cost-effective, for example, to buy a roasting chicken and learn to break it down yourself, than to buy boneless and skinless breasts. Buy what you need, as basic as it comes.
If you have questions, talk to someone. If you're shopping at a grocery store full of employees who don't know their products, consider going elsewhere. Smaller more independent and local butchers will know their meat intimately. They're the ones to buy from.

, A common source of confusion at the grocery store or supermarkets comes from understanding what exactly organic produce and meat is and what it means. It's almost always more expensive, but learning the ways in which it differs from ""normal"" produce will help you to make informed decisions.


To obtain an organic certification, food producers, farmers, and livestock must have a federal inspection performed, in which the soil is tested for the presence of pesticides. There can have been no pesticides used on land certified organic for seven years in the United States.Meat, eggs, and other animal products that are certified organic must have been fed feed certified organic.
""Natural"" is not the same thing as ""organic."" If food is labeled ""pesticide free"" or ""hormone free,"" it means probably that the farm or the company hasn't received it's organic certification yet, because it's an expensive and time-intensive process. It doesn't mean the food is worse, it just means it hasn't been certified. Organic produce is usually more expensive because there is a lower yield of crops, because pesticides cannot be used.While an organic apple isn't technically ""better for you"" than a regular apple, nutritionally, sustainably-grown produce that's organically certified is better for the environment.Long term studies about the effect of pesticide residue on health are inconclusive.

, If you're going to buy any pre-prepared or packaged foods, it's a good idea to look at the list of ingredients on the back of the package. It's a good idea to get in the habit of checking out what it is you're actually eating, to learn more about nutrition and the food you buy.


Keep an eye out for preservatives and other additives that you don't recognize if this matters to you. A good rule of thumb is that if there are more complicated chemistry words that end in ""-ate"" or ""-ide"" than there are recognizable foods, it's better to buy something a little simpler.
The next time you're at the store, compare a jar of ""natural"" peanut butter and a jar of ""reduced fat"" peanut butter. Natural peanut butter usually includes a pair of ingredients: peanuts and salt. Reduced fat peanut butter has a whole host of added oils and additives, to replace the flavor leached out when the peanut oil was extracted. Which is ""better?""

, Learn to read food labels and you'll be able to make more informed choices about what you buy. Counting the calories and the calories from fat in each serving is important. When you look at the back of a candy bar, it might say ""250 calories,"" which doesn't sound all that bad. When you notice, though, that the serving size is ""half the bar,"" you've got to double all the numbers to find out what you're really getting.


Some foods labeled “low fat” or “reduced fat” are the same basic products, but the manufacturers have toyed with the serving size and fiddled with the numbers to make the product look healthier. It’s not.

, If there's one thing other than rent that absolutely has to come out of your monthly paychecks, it's food. You have to eat, ergo, you have buy food, and buying affordably and responsibly at the grocery store, market, supermarket, green grocers, bakers or other food sellers, needs to be a priority in your budget, especially if you've got a sizable family.


If you want to start a budget, but aren't sure how to estimate your food costs, start saving all your receipts now. Shop normally for a month, but keep track of your receipts, or keep your total bills tallied on your phone. Add it all up at the end of the month and figure out what percentage of the money you make every month that represents.
Look over your receipts and identify two categories of items: essentials and extras. Essentials should be things like fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, milk, rice, pasta, eggs, and lean meats–ingredients used to make meals. Extras are things like snack crackers, chips, sweets, and other snacking goods. If you're spending too much money on food every month, tighten up on the extras.

, Learn to look at the ""per unit"" price on each item before you buy it, to save as many pennies as possible. This is usually listed on the label on the rack at the store, just under the big price. This tells you how much each ""unit"" of the item is worth.


For example, you might compare two jars of tomato sauce, which look to be basically the same shape. If one is $3.99 and the other is $4.25, it may seem obvious that you're getting the deal with the cheaper jar. But wait, the more expensive jar is 15 oz. and the less expensive is only 12. Which is the better deal? The price-per-ounce should be included on the label. That's the unit price. The lower number is the better deal.
Don’t overbuy. It’s easy to waste a lot of money a few dollars at a time. A whole gallon of milk that goes sour before you can drink it all. A pound of bacon left out on the counter to spoil. Three kinds of bread all for one week when you’ll be home alone. Look for the best deal, but don't buy more than you'll be able to use before heading back to the store.

, The place to go big and save money is in buying items that won't spoil or go bad in bulk. This means you won't have to go back to the store or re-buy these items in smaller portions for quite some time. It's a great way to save money.


Rice and pasta are great bulk items. If you go through a lot of rice, buy 10 pounds at a time. you might have to spend what seems like a lot, but if the per-unit price is low, and you won't have to buy rice again for six months, it's worth it.
Dried beans, oatmeal, and cheap canned goods are also excellent ways to buy in bulk and save food for rainy days. If you're running a little lean some month, a big batch of oatmeal, or beans and rice for dinner can be a great way of stretching a buck. Those are some of the cheapest meals you can make.

, While it might seem like it makes more cost sense to buy a single frozen lasagna instead of buying noodles, sauce, cheese, and the other ingredients necessary to make one, the per-unit price and the actual cost of the food you’re getting is much higher with frozen meals. Learn to cook and make your own dinners rather than buying the packaged variety if you are able and this is practical for you.


Health-wise, the sodium content and the preservatives added to frozen meals make them less healthy for your family than when you make it yourself. You can control the ingredients, making it tastier and healthier.

, Whatever store you're visiting, check the bargain shelf. All stores have them, from Walmart to Target to the supplement store that smells like patchouli. Look for an area of the store with marked down or over-market stock that you can get on the cheap. This is an especially great place to get sauces, canned goods, and other foods.


Lots of people are scared to buy ""out of date"" products. Dates are often placed arbitrarily, and getting people to think they need to use a product ""before it goes bad"" is a way of getting people to buy more stuff and spend more money. If an item says, ""Best by"" that means it won't go bad for a long time past that date, if at all.

, Many stores will have coupon inserts available in local papers and at the front door of the store when you head inside. These are good ways of checking out the deals and the discounts on produce and other items, and can be a great way to save money.


Coupons can also be used to get people hooked on stuff. Don't buy two boxes of chocolate peanut butter cups just because it was on sale. Buy food you're already shopping for.

, If you're struggling to pay for food regularly there may help. Applying for Federal food assistance and getting financial aid for purchasing food is an important step to take, as long as you meet the criteria. Look for a charity food bank near you.


Commonly called ""food stamps"" or ""EBT,"" different regions in different countries handle food assistance in different ways, most often with an electronic debit card that includes a certain amount of money per month that can go toward food. Learn more about assistance in your area by clicking here.

, If you need to stock up on food, food vendors are the places to go. There are lots of different styles and specialty stores, and some may be more appropriate for you, given what it is you're looking for. You probably shouldn't go looking for sushi-grade salmon at Walmart, and you probably shouldn't expect to find super-cheap saltines at the Natural Food Co-Op. Learn what different places specialize in and shop for different foods at the right place.


Chain groceries and box stores like Safeway, Kroger, Sainsbury's, and Woolworth's, Tesco, New World, etc specialize in affordable perishable and nonperishable food. Box stores like Walmart, Meijer, Target, and other chains also have grocery sections that are expansive and usually cheap. These are good places to visit for name-brand goods and find deals.
Natural groceries and specialty vendors may be the best place to visit for local produce, fresh vegetables, and raw ingredients, but they tend to be more expensive than chain stores. You're paying for quality. Food cooperatives are common in some places, allowing you to buy in to a partial ownership of the store and decide what should be stocked. If required, check out bulk suppliers - these used to be called Cash and Carry. You may need to buy a membership card, but you could save money if you need to buy food in bulk.
Corner stores, convenience stores, dairies and local shops are good places for prepared food, snacks, and alcohol, but not great places to find fresh vegetables or fruits unless you have no other option.

, Grocery outlets supply overstocked off-brand food that can be purchased for much cheaper than at regular grocery stores. Amelia's and ALDI are common examples of this, offering a somewhat limited variety of fresh and non-perishable foods for much cheaper than at the bigger stores.


You don't have the same variety, so it's not the place to go looking for super-specific ingredients, but it's a good place to find staples, like cooking oil, sugar, or vinegar. It's also a good place for things like snack crackers, bread, and other off-brand goods.

, By far where practical, the best place to find quality produce where you live is to find out about local farmers' markets. Typically held on weekends, farmers' markets combine a festival-like atmosphere with outdoor stalls and extremely fresh produce. Depending on the climate, this might only happen during the harvest season, but some markets go year-round in certain climates. These are excellent places to get fresh fruits, organic vegetables, and local meat raised in a humane way.


Markets also give you a chance to see and interact with the people who grow, prepare, and sell your food. It's a lot more personal than buying cookies at the corner store.
Markets are also a good place to find out about Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) in your area, if applicable. Many booths may offer CSA packages, which allow you to buy into the farm, essentially paying an up-front or a monthly price for a package of fresh vegetables that you can pick up or have delivered.

, Like anything, it's also possible to buy certain specialty ingredients online and have it delivered. This can be an excellent choice if you live somewhere very remote and struggle to find access to certain ingredients or fresh supplies in your area. Everything from organic gummy bears to bulk bags of caraway seeds and jasmine rice can be had for decent prices online.


Coffee co-ops are very popular online options, letting you buy in and ""subscribe"" to a coffee club that will deliver high-quality whole beans directly to your door. If you're a coffee-food eater, it's a no-brainer.
Citrus delivery doesn't have to be reserved for Christmas-time. Since citrus can only grow in limited climates, having high-quality oranges, grapefruits, lemons and limes delivered straight to your door is another great option if this happens where you live.

, Increasingly, stores are charging for the use of plastic or paper bags, making it much more cost-effective to buy one and take it with you when food shopping. It's also cutting down a lot on waste to get rid of those 20 useless plastic bags that come home with you every time you head to the store. Invest in five or six good quality tote-bags and keep them in your car, or near the front door so you'll remember them when you head to the store.

, Sometimes, you just don't feel like cooking. While it's usually more cost-effective to cook meals at home and get more bang for your buck, if you're solo it can be a whole lot easier buy food buy going out for a sandwich than to buy a bunch of ingredients to cook at home. One always-easy way of buying food is to buy it already made at the restaurant.

Shop for snack items clearly labeled “gluten free”.,
Identify specific brands that provide gluten-free snack options.,
Find the gluten-free section in your local grocery store.,
Search online for listings of gluten-free snacks.",How to Buy Gluten Free Snacks2," If you’d like to snack on an item that typically would have gluten—for example, crackers, snack bars, or cereal—you should readily be able to find a gluten-free version. The packaging for these items should clearly state “gluten free.”Due to the recent prevalence of gluten-free diets, nearly all popular snack foods that conventionally contain gluten are now manufactured in a gluten-free version.

Food products labeled “gluten-free,” “free of gluten,” “no gluten,” or “without gluten” are regulated by the FDA and must comply with governmental specifications.
Keep in mind that although gluten-free snacks lack wheat products, they may have little other nutritional value in general. Look through the ingredient list for items with plenty of protein and fiber if you’re concerned about healthy snacking in general.

, If you can narrow your search for gluten-free versions of popular snacks down to just a few brands (rather than shopping through every snack brand in the grocery store), you’ll save yourself time.Speak to the sales staff at your local supermarket, and they can help you identify brands which provide many gluten-free snack options.


Many potato chip brands are gluten-free, as are many “all-natural” snacks such as sweet potato chips, some corn tortilla chips, or chips made of different vegetables (such as carrots, spinach, or tomatoes)., If your local supermarket has a specific gluten-free section, this will dramatically decrease your shopping time. If no gluten-free section exists, speak to a manager or inventory staff member and ask if there is a natural or organic foods section. This section will likely contain a number of gluten-free options.

Within a gluten-free section, you may be able to find gluten-free versions of certain name brand rice and tapioca puddings. Even certain candies, chocolates, and energy bars come naturally gluten-free.

, Gluten-free dieters have already cataloged “commonly available” food brands that are gluten-free snack options, such as Post Cocoa Pebbles cereal, that are available at most grocery stores. You may also be able to use an online search feature on the websites for specific grocery store chains (e.g. Kroger or Safeway) to search for “gluten free snacks.”You can also search online forums compiled by gluten-free food advocates. Such forum sites will provide information relating to popular and common gluten-free snack brands at grocery stores.

Assume a packaged snack contains gluten unless labeled otherwise.,
Do not buy products typically derived from grains.,
Beware of unnamed food additives or preservatives.,
Snack on fresh foods.,
Avoid snack foods processed on shared equipment.",How to Buy Gluten Free Snacks3," Perhaps the most time-consuming part of shopping for gluten-free snacks is reading the ingredients list of each item. Unless a product is specifically marked “gluten-free,” it likely contains gluten. Before purchasing, should check for any indications that the food or drink may contain gluten., Gluten is a wheat protein, commonly found in all wheat and grain products and byproducts. So, to buy gluten-free snacks, avoid buying any items with wheat or other grains.Before you buy a snack item, check for barley, durum, farina, graham flour, kamut, rye, matzo meal, semolina, bulgur, triticale, wheat, and spelt on the label.


Stay clear of bread, crackers, cookies, muffins, chips, sweets, snack bars, or other grain products unless they have “gluten-free” on the label.
Dips, dressings, and sauces may also contain gluten unless specifically labeled otherwise.

, Certain starches, sugars, and added flavors may contain gluten, such as malt flavoring or modified food starch.If you’re buying processed food that contains many additives, either look for an unambiguous “gluten free” label on the packaging, or look elsewhere in the store for a similar item with fewer unfamiliar ingredients.

, Foods that are fresh and have not been processed are more likely to be gluten-free. In addition to fresh fruits and vegetables, look for snacks including fresh proteins. Eggs and non-marinated, non-breaded meats are gluten-free. So are many dairy products, including cheese and yogurts, both of which are commonly sold in packaged snack varieties.Foods that have undergone high levels of processing are more likely to include gluten, or to have been processed on machinery that also processed gluten-heavy foods.

, Even if an ingredient label does not specifically list a source of gluten, check for a notice that indicates whether the food has been processed on equipment or in a facility that also produces foods that contain gluten. This should be written somewhere on the packaging, although it may be in quite small lettering.Cross-contamination can make those with wheat allergies or Celiac disease ill even when the food contains very small amounts of gluten transferred from other products.

Buy fresh vegetables in season.,
Choose healthy cooking methods when you prepare vegetables.,
Don’t forget frozen as an option.",How to Cook Healthily2," Asparagus, spinach and scallions are best in the spring. Many vegetables, like tomatoes, squash and Swiss chard are good in the summer. Root vegetables like acorn or butternut squash bring warmth to any autumn table. And if you live in a warm climate, you can explore options of cultivating your own vegetable gardens to get the most selection based on your tastes.

, Burying vegetables in butter, preparing them with animal fat or dousing them in oil adds many extra calories without adding nutritional value. Try steaming or roasting with a little bit of olive oil for nutritious and delicious preparations.


Even though too much fat is not beneficial, adding some plant-based fats like olive or walnut oil to your deep greens (like leafy greens, broccoli and Brussels sprouts) actually helps your body absorb more of their nutrients.

, Freezing vegetables in season and storing them for future use is an easy way to get the flavor of the harvest all year round. For quick dishes, choose frozen, pre-chopped organic vegetables from your grocery store.

"
"
Avoid refined carbohydrates.,
Cook creatively with whole grains.,
Try something new.",How to Cook Healthily3," For example, choose to replace white bread with whole wheat or rye. Also, whole wheat pastas have improved greatly in quality since they were first introduced to the market.

, For instance, add barley to beef stew or make a whole grain pilaf with sliced almonds and dried fruit.

, Learn to cook with quinoa, spelt or couscous so that you can have a break from rice and pasta.

"
"
Choose proteins high in omega-3 fatty acids.,
Remember non-meat sources of protein.,
Watch your portion size.",How to Cook Healthily4," Foods like salmon and omega-3 enriched eggs are great sources of omega-3 fatty acids. These nutrients promote healthy brain function as well as cardiovascular health.

, You can eat servings of protein that are lower in calories and higher in fiber by choosing proteins like beans or tofu. Chop up some tofu and add it to soup or serve bean and cheese enchiladas with a side of rice in place of meat enchiladas.

, A good rule of thumb is to remember that a serving size of protein is about the size of a deck of cards. Generally, a piece of meat or other protein should be no larger or thicker than your palm.

"
"
Learn to cook with low-fat dairy options.,
Become more versatile with yogurt.,
Focus on flavor instead of quantity when cooking with cheese.",How to Cook Healthily5," In many recipes, heavy cream or whole milk can be replaced with low-fat or skim milk. Be careful when baking to stick to reduced fat dairy rather than fat-free dairy.

, Yogurt is delicious eaten out of the container, but plain yogurt can also be served in soups or used as a marinade for meats. Salmon served with a lemon and dill yogurt sauce, for example, makes a nutrient-packed and elegant meal. Look to food from Middle Eastern and Indian cultures to inspire you to find more ways to use yogurt in your cooking.

, If you purchase a high-quality, flavorful cheese, then you can use less cheese and still add flavor to your cooking. Grate pecorino on top off a pizza and cut down on the mozzarella, or sprinkle a little bit of Gorgonzola on a salad instead of heaps of mild cheddar.

"
"
Choose oils and fatty foods that are low in saturated fat.,
Avoid trans fats.,
Remember that quality can lower quantity.",How to Cook Healthily6," Olive oil and canola oil are the healthiest oils that you can use in your cooking. Other nut and seed oils also make healthy choices. Prepare fatty fish like salmon or mackerel instead of beef. Avocados are also an excellent source of healthy fats.

, Trans fats are found in foods that have been hydrogenated so that they can maintain shelf stability at room temperature. These fats are universally understood to be bad for your health, and they hide in places you might not expect. Before you roll a piece of chicken in bread crumbs, check the package to make sure that the crumbs don’t contain trans fats. Also, avoid margarine and shortening in your cooking whenever possible.

, Investing in an excellent olive oil for cooking allows you to put more flavor in your food even while using less oil. Another idea is to choose a creamy European butter; the intense flavor will allow you to cut the butter content in your cooking by at least one-third.

Use a hygrometer to gain an accurate humidity reading of the room or area you want to dehumidify.,
Use specific characteristics of the room to determine its humidity levels if you do not have access to a hygrometer.,
Determine your air changes per hour (ACH) to calculate the airflow needed to properly dehumidify your room.,
Calculate the amount of square feet present in the room or area that you need to dehumidify.,
Calculate the amount of cubic feet in the room you need to dehumidify by taking the height of the room and multiplying that value by the amount of square feet.,
Determine the amount of airflow or cubic feet per minute (CFM) you will need in order to dehumidify the room using your cubic feet and ACH values.,
Determine the pints of moisture you need extracted from the air on a daily basis to properly dehumidify your room.,
Buy a dehumidifier that can support your CFM and pints requirements.",How to Choose the Size of a Dehumidifier,"


A hygrometer can be purchased from any retail store that specializes in home repair and will provide you with the percentage of humidity that resides in a specific room or area.;
,


If the room is extremely wet and contains standing water or puddles of water, the humidity will be between 90 and 100 percent and is considered ""extremely wet.""
If the room smells and feels wet and contains visible mold, mildew, leaks, and water stains, the humidity level will be between 80 and 90 percent and is classified as ""wet.""
If the room feels very damp and you can clearly smell mold and mildew, the humidity levels will be between 70 and 80 percent and is known as ""very damp."" You may or may not see visible water stains on walls and on the floor.
If the room only smells musty in damp or humid weather, the relative humidity will be between 60 and 70 percent and is considered ""moderately damp.""

,


If your humidity level is extremely wet or between 90 and 100 percent, your ACH will have a value of ""6.""
If your humidity level is considered ""wet"" or between 80 and 90 percent, your ACH will be a value of ""5.""
When your humidity in the room is considered to be ""very damp"" and falls between 70 and 80 percent, your ACH will have the value of ""4.""
Moderately damp humidity levels that fall between 60 and 70 percent will have an ACH value of ""3.""

,


Measure the length and width of your room using a ruler or tape measure.
Multiply the length and width values to figure the room's square footage.
For example, if a room is 8 feet (2.43 meters) by 9 feet (2.74 meters), the total square footage will be 72 square feet (6.68 square meters).

,


For example, if there are 72 square feet (6.68 meters) in a room and the height of the room is 8 feet (2.43 meters), the measurement will be 576 cubic feet (16.31 cubic meters).

,


Multiply the cubic feet value by the ACH and divide the result by the number 60.
For example, if your measurement is 576 cubic feet (16.31 cubic meters), and your room is considered ""extremely wet,"" multiply 576 by 6 for a result of 3456. Divide 3456 by 60 for the amount of airflow you need, which is 57.6 cubic feet (1.63 cubic meters) per minute.

,


For moderately damp conditions, you will need dehumidifiers that can extract 10 pints (4.73 liters) of water within 500 square feet (46.45 square meters). For every additional 500 square feet (46.45 square meters), add 4 pints (1.89 liters). For example, for rooms that are 1500 square feet (139.35 square meters), you will need a dehumidifier that can extract 18 pints (8.51 liters) of water.
For very damp conditions, buy dehumidifiers that can extract 12 pints (5.67 liters) of water within 500 square feet (46.45 square meters). For every extra 500 square feet (46.45 square meters), add 5 pints (2.36 liters).
For wet conditions, choose dehumidifiers that can collect 14 pints (6.62 liters) of water within 500 square feet (46.45 square meters). Add 6 pints (2.83 liters) for every additional 500 square feet (46.45 square meters).
For extremely wet humidity conditions, buy dehumidifiers that extract 16 pints (7.57 liters) of water from the air within 500 square feet (46.45 square meters). Add 7 pints (3.31 liters) for every extra 500 square feet (46.45 square meters).

,


Read the manufacturer labels and boxes for dehumidifiers to determine the correct size you need to buy.
If your CFM levels are much higher than the CFM levels supported by dehumidifiers you see for purchase, you may need to buy multiple units to properly dehumidify your space.
If your CFM levels fall between a range of CFM levels supported by dehumidifiers, you may want to buy a unit with a higher CFM than what you need and run it less often.

, Remove and empty the water tank. With the cool mist humidifier switched off, remove the water tank and dump the water out into your sink or tub. Without replacing the water tank, turn the machine on. This will allow the wicking filter to dry out. When you’re done, turn the cool mist humidifier off and unplug it from the electrical outlet., The wicking filter is the part of the cool mist humidifier that holds moisture. When dry air moves through the filter, it becomes humidified, and produces vapor.In some cool mist humidifiers, the filter is an open-ended cylinder, while in others it is a flat piece. In either case, it has a sort of spongy, mesh-like appearance.You might need to disassemble the cool mist humidifier’s housing to access the filter.
Handle the filter gently to avoid tearing it.
The wicking filter removal process will vary depending on what sort of cool mist humidifier you have. Consult manufacturer directions for more information about removing your wicking filter.

, The water tray is the pool below the cool mist humidifier that the water tank drains into. The water tray might slide out or need to be unclipped from the base of the humidifier., Use white vinegar to fill the water tray about halfway. Allow the vinegar to stand for 20 minutes. With the vinegar in the tray, use a sponge dampened slightly with vinegar to wipe the parts of the tray that are not submerged. Be careful not to splash any vinegar on the surface where you’re cleaning the water tray.Unless otherwise directed, do not use soap, detergent, or any other type of abrasive cleaner to clean your cool mist humidifier’s water tray.

Check your space.,
Determine your budget.,
Read reviews.,
Choose a style, color, and finish.,
Choose an appliance that will be cleanable.,
Choose the features you want, and be realistic about it.,
Check the energy ratings for your appliance.,
Shop around and negotiate.",How to Choose Appliances," Whether you're looking for a refrigerator, microwave, or clothes washer, check the space you have for it first. Measure in all directions and have the size limits written down before you go looking at appliances. Don't bother evaluating anything that won't fit.


Check capacity, too. Do you wash lots of big dishes or do laundry for a large family? Or, do you live in a small apartment and do laundry only for yourself?;
, If you know ahead of time that you'll be replacing an appliance (such as if you're replacing it for style or because it is starting to fail), you may also wish to check prices ahead of time and start saving up towards a replacement.


Remember, no matter what appliance you're getting, there are usually basic options that cost less and costly options with more features.
A higher price does not always mean higher quality. If you're on a budget, try for a good, mid-range model that will work well and last a long time.

, It's very easy to find online reviews on just about any product these days, and for appliances, it's certainly worth reading a few for the model(s) you think you want. If a brand or model has a lot of problems, you'll know it.


Don't forget Consumer Reports. They regularly test things like major appliances. It's worth seeing what they thought of various models, too.

, This may be more important if you need something to match other appliances in your kitchen. In your garage or laundry room, it might not matter too much.


Expect to have major appliances for a while. Generally, choose a neutral color that will still look good (whether or not it's still current and in fashion) in ten years or more.

, Look for a finish that will help to hide fingerprints, unless wiping the surface of your fridge is your favorite hobby. Look for small or enclosed spaces that might be hard to clean, and if something needs to come apart to be cleaned, try taking it apart.


Don't forget buttons, knobs, and controls. Some appliances have nice, flat panels that can be cleaned in one wipe; others require a lot of disassembly to get at spills down underneath knobs.

, It's very easy to spend a lot of money for features you'll use twice and forget about. If you're buying a refrigerator, it's to keep your food cold. Maybe the ice maker is important to you, too, but does it really need a digital temperature control on the front? Most people only set the temperature in a refrigerator once, unless something changes.

, Over the life of an appliance, a little bit more energy used can add up to a lot of money. This is the extended cost of your appliance purchase.


If this is an upgrade, see if your local utility or anyone else is offering rebates for upgrading to a more energy-efficient model.

, If you know what make(s) and model(s) you want, it can be well worth calling around. If you're not a great negotiator, simply ask, ""What is the best price you can offer?"" and ask various stores. Don't forget to look online, too.

In addition, you can visit a wide arrange of general retailer outlet stores, like the Sears outlet., Before you buy the appliance, you should look on the internet or ask around to see if anyone you know has experienced buying a refurbished product from the seller. This is important, as not all retailers or sellers are honorable, and some may misrepresent the term “refurbished.”

Check Yelp and other online review sites to get an idea of the seller’s reputation., When looking at refurbished appliances, you should ask who refurbished it. Inquire about their experience with the brand and model. In addition, ask if they hold any certifications or are an authorized repair person for the manufacturer of the appliance.

Look for the “Certified Refurbished” phrasing on refurbished products. This often means that the manufacturer stands behind the refurbished product, or that the product was refurbished by the manufacturer. These products will often have a manufacturer warranty in effect., Whether you’re in a big box store or an independent retailer, you should ask for a demonstration of the appliance. This way, you’ll be able to see that the product clearly works before you buy it.

It may be difficult to test out some appliances, like dish washers, before buying them. However, you should verify that the appliance powers on and at least appears to work properly.

, While refurbished appliances may look good and work good, purchasing them does come with a certain amount of risk. The product has still been used, fixed, and transported several times. There is a real risk that the appliance may not work as advertised and/or could break down easier than a new product., When it comes time to pay for a refurbished appliance, you should expect big savings. The savings might depend on the retailer, the age of the appliance, and more. However, you should expect at least a 20% savings and sometimes as much as 50% or more.Don't be afraid to haggle the sales person down. In fact, if you enjoy haggling, make sport of it. The chances are high that the sales person wants to sell the item quickly.
If the savings is not substantial, you should consider purchasing a new product.

, When you go to purchase the appliance, inquire as to whether the item is covered by a manufacturer warranty. In addition, ask if the retailer offers a warranty on the product. If not, inquire as to whether you can purchase a warranty on the appliance. This way, you’ll have some assurance as to how long the appliance will work for you.

A retailer might offer to sell you a third-party warranty on the product. These typically cost a percentage of the price of the product. This could range from 1% to 10%.
If you purchase a warranty, get the longest warranty period possible (if reasonably priced)., Before paying for the appliance, ask the sales associate about the retailer’s return policy. While some retailers might extend a normal return policy (30 days) to a refurbished appliance, others might not. As a result, you need to inquire before purchasing. There would be nothing worse than having an unwarranted appliance breaking just days after purchasing it."

Ask your friends for a referral.,
Look for license and insurance.,
Check to make sure their license number is valid and their insurance is current.

,
Check the length of time the company has been in business at the same location, under the same name.,
Look to see that they are in the major business internet directories.,
Be aware that companies who spend a lot of money on advertising have to get that money from somewhere... usually in the higher fees they charge you.

,
Weigh the benefits of the personal attention you will receive from a family-owned business vs the unknown technician a larger company will send.,
Ask the name of the technician they are sending and ask to speak to him/her.,
Ask a specific question.",How to Choose the Right Appliance Repair Service in Your Area," The very best way to find an appliance repair service is by referral. When someone you know recommends a company they were completely happy with (which includes service, price, professionalism, etc.) then you already know you're getting a good company. Just be sure you trust this person's opinion.;
, The ad you're looking at should say ""licensed and insured"" and should have the company's state license.

,, A company with a long local history is a better bet than a recent startup with no history in the area.

,(yellowpages.com, superpages.com, google maps, yahoo local, etc.)

,, A local person has a reputation to uphold locally. A representative of a large national chain however, may or may not be concerned about giving you the best deals or service.

, It's ok to ask them how long they've been repairing appliances and see if they will talk to you about your problem. If they are honest, they will discuss your problem with you. If you explain the symptoms you are experiencing with your appliance, they should be able to give you some possibilities of what type of repairs you may need. If they won't talk to you about it, you should consider that a red flag.

, For example: ""Hello, I have a Kenmore gas dryer that was working fine until today. It still runs fine but there is no heat at all. If all I needed was a new igniter replaced, which is part number 279311, how much would the total repair cost me? I understand that you may find other things wrong and the estimate you give me over the phone could change, but all I'm asking is how much would it cost me if all you had to do was replace the 279311 igniter?"" If they won't answer that question, it should be a red flag to you.

Decide whether you want the ability to use a cleaning detergent for extra cleaning power on heavy stains, mold and mildew.,Look at the job you'll be doing and think it out in advance, you may need to purchase a longer hose to the machine or from the machine to the area you will be cleaning

,Petrol powered washers may use more water than a hose can deliver, a simple solution to this is a small tank like a wheelie bin adding a water tank ball cock means it will top up when needed

",How to Buy a Pressure Washer,"


A light-duty pressure washer with 1,200 to 1,900 psi can clean 10 to 40 square feet in 10 minutes. This would be a good model for cleaning a vehicle, garage floor or patio furniture.
A medium-duty pressure washer with 1,950 to 2,600 psi can clean 40 to 90 square feet in 10 minutes. This type of pressure washer can handle larger areas, such as a driveway, sidewalk or deck.
A heavy-duty pressure washer with 2,650 to 3,800 psi can clean 90 to 190 square feet in 10 minutes. You'll need this is the type of pressure washer for cleaning a fence or siding, especially on a second story.;
, Multiply this number by the psi to determine the true cleaning power of a particular pressure washer.

,


Gas pressure washers are more powerful, but they have drawbacks. They are loud; have the added cost of buying gas, oil and spark plugs; are more difficult to start; and have polluting emissions.
Electric pressure washers are tethered to an electrical extension cord, which can restrict movements. The unit's power cord should have a built-in ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCl) to prevent electrical shock.

,


A telescoping wand helps to clean second-story siding and other raised areas (operating a pressure washer from a ladder isn't recommended).
The width of the spray, which may range from a concentrated jet to a 40-degree fan, may be adjustable by twisting the nozzle or attaching different tips.

,, A heavier hand unit will require 2 hands to operate.

, This requires a pressure washer with a cleaning solution injection system. You may find a pressure washer with a cleaning solution storage tank easier to use than simply pumping the solution out of a nearby bucket.

, This small temperature and humidity gauge is available online for $15 to $30. Measure the humidity in each room of your home to see how many rooms require a humidifier.


Hygrometers are available in digital and mechanical displays. Digital hygrometers with LCD displays are slightly more expensive and may not pick up low levels of humidity.
Make sure you reset the hygrometer as you move from room to room and wait an appropriate amount of time before judging the humidity., You will need to convert the measurement to square feet or square m. For rectangles or squares, you can simply multiply the length measurement in feet by the width measurement in feet.


You can also use an online calculator at http://www.squarefootage.org/square-footage-calculator.php

, A 500 square foot (47 square m) room will need a dehumidifier that can process between 10 and 16 pints (4.7 to 7.6 l) of water in a 24-hour period.

, A floor model can work for 1 large room or a few smaller rooms that are connected by a door or entryway.

, These models can be as large as a window air conditioner.


If you plan to use a dehumidifier in several rooms, pick a model that is on casters so you can push it from room to room. , You can attach it to existing air circulation systems for best results. It will need to process between 22 and 44 pints (10.4 to 20.8 l) of water per day.

, Laundry rooms and basements usually need the maximum dehumidifying power for the space. , If you have a home improvement store or a large department store, you may be able to compare accessibility factors before you purchase a model.


If you can’t find dehumidifiers to test, then make sure you have a quality assurance and/or satisfaction guarantee.

, If you are using a small to medium-sized dehumidifier, you will probably need to empty the bucket manually. The bucket should be accessible through the front and the top.

, Basement and whole house humidifiers may require a hose to empty large amounts of water that is removed from the air. Ensure you have a place in your house, such as a utility sink or a drainpipe that will work for this purpose.


Whole-house dehumidifiers require a hose that extends outside of the house. You should employ an installer to make sure the hose is emptying into an appropriate place on your property.

Look around the edge of the inner door panel to find eleven screws.,
Use a screwdriver to latch the small cam of the handle by pressing on it.

,
Take the handle off.,
Lift one side of the handle and push it toward the other end as you pry it away from the door latch gently.,
Transfer the dishwasher handle to the new latch without any problems.,
Take hold of the handle and pull it up until you can see that it has locked into place completely.,
Use the wire harnesses to stabilize the dishwasher's electrical wires.,
Perform a final check of the latch before you start putting the screws back on the inner panel.",How to Repair Your Dishwasher’s Door Latch," Use your Torx driver to remove these.


After you lift up the inner panel, the door latch mechanism should be exposed. You are going to need to separate the electrical connections from the switch, so use a screwdriver to pry them off. Be gentle to avoid damaging these components.;
,, With a flat screwdriver, pry off one end while you simultaneously lift the handle.

,


Two pivot points should be free at this point. Slide the handle forward, then lift the handle away from the dishwasher.

,


All you'll need to do is slide both of the two inner pivot points mentioned earlier. Fortunately, both of these points have been tapered, which makes the reattachment process a breeze.

, At this point, you can simply turn the latch in place so that it's facing down and then snap it at one of its sides with the use of the tapered pivot. This should allow the other side to slide in without any trouble. Make sure to note that this latch will remain in its locked position until you eventually re-install it in the dishwasher.

, You can easily find these by lifting up the door. There is plenty inside the dishwasher to push against the wires, so make sure they're not touching anything.

, Put it in place and set the handle through the slot on the door.


Put all eleven screws back on, then open the door to make sure that handle is working as it should. Turning on the dishwasher is the final test because a disconnected latch will actually prevent the dishwasher from starting at all.
As long as both of your tests work out, you've successfully fixed your dishwasher's door latch.

Prep the area around the fence.,
Pick the right paint for your job.,
Pick a suitable day to do the painting.,
Decide how you want to paint a fence.",How to Paint a Fence," Preparation is a critical phase of fence-painting. You want to protect the vegetation along the fence line while readying the surface for painting. This is a time-consuming process, but it makes the job easier.


Mow and edge the grass along the fence line. Trim back bushes and shrubs that abut the fence. Use a leaf blower to blow dirt and grass clippings away from the fence line.
Spread a drop cloth or plastic sheeting under the section of fence you'll be painting. Keep it in place throughout the project to collect residue from prep work and protect against spills.
If the fence was previously treated, scrape off loose or flaking paint.
Pressure-wash or sand a new, untreated wood fence. It's best to sand a fence that was painted before. This helps the paint adhere to the wood. If necessary, use a scrub brush and a 1-to-1 mixture of bleach and water to eradicate mold on the fence. Let the surface dry.
If you're painting iron or metal fencing, use a steel brush to remove rust and then sand the surface with medium-grit sandpaper.
After sanding, wipe off residue with a clean rag.
Seal and tape off parts of the fence you don't want to paint, like ornaments, gate latches and handles and other hardware.;
, Make sure you use an outdoor paint on your fence. These are specially treated to withstand the effects of weather and come in a variety of types.


Acrylics: Acrylic paint is durable, providing an excellent layer of protection for your fence, but you might have to apply a primer to an untreated surface before you can paint.
Acrylic stains: Stains bring out the natural beauty of the wood and usually don't require the primer coat that paints do. They also are easier to re-coat and require minimal surface prep.
Oil-based outdoor paint: Oil-based paints may require multiple coats and may not protect as well as acrylics, but they do provide a superior-looking finish.
Enamels: Enamel paint is ideal for iron fencing and gates. Usually, you'll need to treat the surface with a rust-inhibiting primer.
Automotive epoxy paint: The benefits of automotive epoxy are, it's a 1-step process and is very durable. You will have to mix in a hardener with this paint, which does force you to get the job done within about 6 hours.

, Certain weather conditions are ideal for fence-painting. Pick a day with no rain in the forecast. Ideally, paint on a day with calm winds and ample cloud cover. Breezes can kick up debris that can stick to your paint job; direct sunlight makes the paint dry too fast and saps its protective properties.

,


Long fence: If you have a long fence, you probably will want to use an industrial spray to complete the job quickly. Aim lengthwise, along the grain of the wood. Spray downwind and wear a respirator. Be sure to cover plants to protect them from overspray. Keep a brush handy even if you opt for a sprayer, in case you need to do any touch-up work.
Short fence: If you have a smaller project, you probably can complete the job using a roller on flat surfaces and a brush for detailed, hard-to-reach sections.
Wrought iron fence: Because they're often intricately designed, it's best to paint iron fences by hand to get optimum coverage. A single heavy coat of enamel or automotive epoxy paint usually is enough.

Select paint appropriate for your outdoor project. You will need a paint that is resistant to moisture and sun exposure. Outdoor concrete paint is available for outdoor projects. However, an oil-based paint also may work for your needs.
Pick a paint for your indoor paint project. Basement concrete paint is available in many paint and home improvement stores, however you also can use an interior acrylic paint for the project.;
, For exterior projects, use a power washer to rid the wall of all dirt and dust. If your project is indoors, scrub the wall with soapy water and a scrub brush instead of using a power washer.

, Follow the directions to mix up the concrete patch mixture. Fill holes and use a trowel to smooth the patch to match the surface of the wall.

, Paint applied to a wall that is not properly sealed will not adhere properly.


Tape plastic sheeting to the wall. Attempt to get the sheeting as air-tight as possible.
Check the plastic after 24 hours. If moisture appears within the plastic, you will need to seal the wall. If no moisture is present, the wall is already sealed.

, Roll on 1 coat of concrete sealer and allow it to dry overnight. Concrete sealer is available at most hardware or home improvement stores.

, You can use rollers or brushes to apply the paint. Ensure the primer is applied evenly, whichever technique you use. Let it dry for 24 hours. If you can see the wall through the primer, apply 1 more coat.

, Paint should be applied in at least 3 thin layers. The paint may be sprayed on, rolled on or painted on with a brush. The paint should not be streaky or show brush strokes. Allow to dry for 24 hours.

, Cover with 2 coats, allowing it to dry between coats. Paint sealer helps the paint to adhere to the wall and last longer.

Let the wood dry thoroughly.,
Re-stain the door periodically.,
Sanitize the fixtures.",How to Clean Wood Doors," Doors often get covered in layers of dust and cobwebs quickly – especially if they are in the corner or on an outside wall. Use a duster to periodically dust off your wood doors to keep the dust and cobwebs from building up over time.Try to dust your wood doors once every week or so to keep them looking nice. This will also help prevent larger stains from forming.
This is especially important for exterior doors because it will help keep spiders and insects from congregating near the entrance to your home.;
, For minor cleaning, you should be able to use a bit of mild dish soap mixed with hot water. Dip a nonabrasive sponge into the water and scrub the surface of your wood door.When you finish, make sure you rinse all of the soapy residue away with hot water.

, Open the wood door and use a clean, damp cloth to wipe off the edges all around the door frame. You may need to rinse the cloth as you go to keep it clean enough to do the job, especially if there is significant buildup of dust or dirt.You can add a bit of mild dish soap to your damp rag if the dirt seems resistant to wiping. But be sure to clean off all of the soapy residue when you finish.

, Apply a few drops of mineral spirits to a clean, soft rag until the cloth feels damp. Wipe the surface of the wood door with the moistened rag, always going with the grain of the wood. This should work to help remove any dirt or grime buildup.Mineral spirits are also called paint thinner. You can purchase this product at any home improvement store.

, Spray some liquid furniture polish on the surface of the wooden door and use a clean dish cloth to rub it into the grain of the wood. This will help remove any existing stains and will restore the wood’s natural sheen.This is especially important for use after applying mineral spirits to the wood.

, Get a steam cleaning machine with a hose attachment and add a tiny bit of soap to the bristles at the end. Spray the steam at the stains on the dirty wood and move it back and forth across the stained portions. The dirt should just disappear as you do this.Make sure you rinse off any soapy residue with a clean rag when you are done.
You can rent steam cleaners from most grocery stores or carpet repair stores.

, If your wood door has an old paint finish or other kind of varnish that you want to remove, there are a couple of options. You can sand the old varnish off – a very time consuming task. Or you can use chemical strippers to remove the layers of paint.Either option will work well, but remember that chemical stripping must be done in a ventilated area with proper precautions (like wearing a dust mask).
There are several types of chemical strippers – liquid, brushable pastes, and wash away strippers. In any case, you apply the chemical stripper to the wooden door and let it sit until dry. Then you brush off the remnants (or rinse it off, depending on the kind of stripper you are using).This method is particularly effective for exterior wood doors.

, When cleaning your wood doors with water or other liquid cleaners, make sure you let the wood dry thoroughly. If the wood isn’t sealed properly, the moisture could cause the wood to warp or stain over time.Wipe any excess moisture off with a clean towel. You can also point a box fan at the wood door to help it dry more quickly.

, It’s important for your wood to have a protective seal on it to keep it safe from the elements and to help keep it clean after extended use. Wipe down the door thoroughly before you apply any finishing stain or paint. Choose a stain that is made specifically for indoor wood (unless this in an exterior wood door) and choose a color that suits your décor. You may need to sand down the door or scrape (and then sand) away any existing varnish that is chipping or flaking. Apply the stain or varnish and let it dry completely before you begin using it like normal again.If there is a glass window on your door, make sure you tape it off with painter’s tape before you begin staining. Otherwise, you might get the glass dirty or accidentally paint it.

, As you clean your door, be sure to periodically clean the fixtures as well. This means that you should take some time to thoroughly clean all door knobs. Use a regular all-purpose cleaner to wipe down and sanitize both sides of the door knobs.The fixtures come into contact with the most bacteria, so it’s important to address this when cleaning your wood doors.

, With some multi-purpose spray and a damp rag, get to town on making that fan cleaner than it’s probably ever been. You don’t want to paint over dust, dead bugs, and grime. This goes for the blades, the brackets, switch housing cover, download, and anything else that you’re going to paint (even if you’re not painting certain parts, these could probably go for a cleaning anyway).Either let it air dry or wipe it dry thoroughly with a clean rag when you're done. And dry it thoroughly – you don't want to be working with a wet or damp fan.

, This will help strip the fan of any leftover dirt, dust, or old, flaky paint. This part could be optional if you’re working with a fan that’s in very good condition, but for older fans, it makes the job much easier.After sanding, make sure to wipe off any grains of residue. A clean rag and some soapy water is simple and works well. Let the parts air dry.

, In an old t-shirt and gloves, shake up the bottle and test it on an area of old newspaper or cardboard. Once it’s ready to go, spray the blades and/or hardware pieces with a thin, even coat. Allow them to air dry.


It’s easiest to work with primer in spray paint form when it comes to a ceiling fan. You could use generic liquid primer, but this stuff is much less messy and goes on easier and more evenly.

, Again, using spray paint is easiest (though not mandatory), and for any color you should be spraying from about 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) away.Move the can in a side-to-side motion to get an even coat of paint. It’s best to start with the blades first, so they can get to drying.


Neutral colors (grey, white, brown) generally always work, but brighter colors can add a splash of fun that match the room’s look, too. What’s more, you could even buy paint in shades of metal, like nickel or copper, to give your fan an updated, more modern look.
If you don’t want certain bits to get painted, cover them with painter’s tape.

, Let it dry, too, and inspect the pieces for any parts that have gone missed or that need a thicker coat in certain areas.


If you’ve only missed a teeny, tiny section, you could always touch it up with the right shade of permanent marker.

, Start with re-installing the down rod and securing the screws (aren’t you glad you put them off to the side in that bowl?). Let the canopy drop to the top of the motor housing assembly. Then, also from the ground, re-install the faceplate and the blades to the blade brackets.

, Once that’s done, reconnect all wiring with electrical tape and wire nuts. Slide the canopy up to the ceiling and secure it.


If this is getting a little confusing, wikiHow has articles on both installing ceiling fans and replacing ceiling fans that could help you decode how to do it correctly.

, Make sure all the screws are placed in tightly and line up – this will likely be the most tedious task of them all. It’s not difficult; it’s just time consuming.

, After you’ve completed this task, pull the chains and turn on the light. If it works, great. If it doesn’t, you’ll have to go back and retrace your steps. Odds are something was just done in the wrong order.


After that, your only job is to sit back and enjoy your newly painted ceiling fan!

, Don't paint an apple, then paint the background! Start out with your background first, (blue for the sky.) And if you would like, add details (White clouds, and green grass.) Then, paint the red ball that will be your apple. After this, paint your green stem and any shine/shading on the object. Layers are VERY important, and you must think before you paint!

, You could even set up your object! just make sure it doesn't move too much, or your painting would be one big blob.

, Try to get the right tints. for example: If i was painting an apple, i would put a darker shade of red for shading. Mix the color your using for the base apple with a tiny bit of black to make the shade. blend it with the base red, and voila! your apple now has 2 different shades. See how many shades you can get for blending.

, This is a  very important step. Take a pencil and lightly tap a dot on the corner/side that the sun/light is coming from. Now, when you're painting, think of the dot as a flashlight. What does the light hit/does NOT hit? Paint the glow of the flash light where it would appear. Put shading where it does NOT appear.

, Using different sized paint brushes help if you are looking for detail, or a base coat. Use a larger brush for your background, and the small tipped brushes for detail.

, Don't start your very first painting and try the Mona Lisa!  Simple everyday items such as blocks, Bouncy balls, books,soap bars, silverware, fruit, and even candles!

, Painting skill doesn't just randomly appear one day! It takes time. Some times, 1 simple painting could take you 6 hours!

Choose a terracotta pot and drain plate.,
Spray paint the outside of the pot white or off-white.,
Spray paint the bottom of the plate a bright color.,
Add white spots to the mushroom cap using acrylic paint.,
Allow the paint to dry fully before sealing it.,
Assemble the mushroom.,
Allow the glue to cure before moving your mushroom outside.",How to Make Decorative Garden Mushrooms1," The pot will make the stem and the drain plate will make the cap. The plate needs to be a 3 to 5 inches (7.62 to 12.7 centimeters) wider than the pot, so don't choose the matching size—go a few sizes larger., If you need to apply more coats, let each coat dry before applying the next. It will take about 15 to 20 minutes for the paint to dry enough for a second coat.You do not need to paint the bottom of the pot.

, Flip the plate over so that the back is facing you. Spray paint it a bright, contrasting color. Red is the most popular choice, but you can also do pink, purple, or even turquoise. Once again, if you need to do more than one coat, let the paint dry first.The top part of the plate won't be visible so you don't have to paint it.

, You can paint the spots on using a paintbrush or a round, foam pouncer. You may need 2 to 3 coats of paint for this. If this is the case, allow each coat to dry first., Just because the paint feel dry doesn't mean it is ready to be sealed; some types of paint require curing times as well. Check the label for more complete drying times as each brand is different. Once the paint is dry, give the pot and plate a few coats of a clear sealer.Choose a clear, outdoor sealer in either glossy or matte.
Allow the sealer to fully dry and cure.

, Turn the pot upside down so that the bottom is sticking up. Coat it with epoxy or waterproof outdoor glue. Place the plate, painted side up, down on top of it. Make sure that it is centered., This can take a few hours to several days. When moving you mushroom, hold it by the stem—do not grab it by the cap.

Set the mushroom out in your garden.",How to Make Decorative Garden Mushrooms2," Wipe the bowl down using window cleaner, household cleaner, or rubbing alcohol. You can also wash it with soap and water. Focus on the outside of the bowl, as that is the part you will be painting. You want the bowl to be free of any residual oils.You can also use a wooden bowl instead., This will give the bowl some tooth and help the paint stick better. You want to lightly buff the bowl without scratching it.When you are done, wipe away any dust with a damp cloth.

, Flip the bowl over so that the bottom is facing you. Use a drill to make two holes in the center of the bowl. You will be using these to attach the bowl later.The holes need to be the same size as your screws.

, Red is the most popular and recognizable color, but you can use another color for your mushroom if you prefer.You only need to paint the outside of the bowl, since you won't see the inside when you are done.
Don't forget to paint the tops of the screws as well.

, Apply the spots using a paint brush or a round, foam pouncer. If you need to apply a second coat, let the paint dry first before doing so., Just because the paint feels dry does not necessarily mean that it is ready. Check the label on your can of paint, and see if there is a curing time. Once the paint has fully dried and cured. apply a coat of clear, outdoor-quality sealer.The sealer can be glossy or matte; this is up to you!
You need to let the paint dry completely before sealing it. If you don't, the paint may warp.

, The log should be about twice the height of your bowl. It needs to be about the same width as the base of you bowl. Birch logs wok especially well for this because of their white bark. If you are using a different type of log, consider painting it white, and then sealing it with your clear sealer.

, Place the bowl on top of the log so that the bottom is facing you. Use a pen or pencil to make marks in the middle of each screw hole. Lift the bowl away when you are done., Make sure that the holes are wide and deep enough for your screws to fit into. When you are done, gently blow away any sawdust.

, Place the lid back onto the log so that the bottom is facing you. Insert the screws through the holes in the lid. Screw them into the log using your drill. Try to get the screws as tight as you can so that the bowl doesn't bottle., If the drilling ruined the paintwork, touch it up with a small paintbrush and a matching paint color.

Fill the cup with more cement.,
Wait for the cement to set.,
Tip the mushroom out of the bowl, then cut the plastic cup off.,
Paint the mushroom.",How to Make Decorative Garden Mushrooms3," You can use any type of oil you want. The oil is simply there to make de-molding the mushroom cap easier.If you can't find a plastic bowl in the right shape and size, you can use a different material. Plastic is easier to use because of how flexible it is.

, This will eventually make the stem, so make sure that the shape and size suits the cap.If the cup is too small for the bowl, try a different container, such as a tall yogurt container.


The cups that you get iced coffee in are great for this!

, Every brand will be a little different, so follow the instructions on the package. Ideally, it should have a slushy-like consistency.Make sure that you mix enough to fill both the bowl and the cup.

, You can use your trowel to smooth it down, or you can leave it rough for a more organic look.Gently tap the bowl to remove any air bubbles., Make sure that the cup is centered and straight. The wider part of the cup should be facing you., Use your trowel to smooth the cement down. This will help the mushroom stand upright.Once again, gently tap the cup to remove any air bubbles.


If you will be using this mushroom on a lawn, consider pushing a galvanized steel nail into the stem. This way, the nail will stick into the lawn and help anchor the mushroom., How long this takes depends on the type of cement you are using, how big your mushroom is, and the weather conditions in your area.

, Use a craft blade to cut straight down the plastic cup first. Then, cut around the top edge of the stem, where the stem meets the mushroom cap. Carefully pull the plastic cup off. Part of the plastic cup will remain embedded in the cement, which is fine., Paint the stem and the underside of the mushroom cap white. Next, paint the cap a bright color. Let the paint dry, then add white spots onto the cap. Let the paint dry again, then seal the paint using a clear, outdoor sealer.


If you need to apply more coats of paint, allow the first one to dry completely.
Turn it into a mosaic mushroom by attaching glass gems to the cap using tile adhesive, then filling the gaps with grout. Wipe the grout away with a damp cloth before it dries."

Drill the holes.,
Connect the timbers.,
Secure the timbers.,
Place the trellis in your garden.,
Anchor the trellis.,
Plant vines around your new trellis.

",How to Make a Reusable Plant Trellis," Drill a hole in each timber, about 1"" from the end. The hole made should be slightly larger than the threaded rod, so that the rod slides through freely.;
, Line up the timbers, line up the holes, and push the threaded rod through all three timbers.

, Put a washer on each end. Thread a nut over each end until the rod protrudes just past the nut. DO NOT thread the nut down tight to the timbers. The timbers should be loose on the rod.

,


Stand up the tripod, and swing the middle timber one way, and the two outside timbers the other way.
Spread the two outside timbers apart, away from each other. The threaded rod will bend a bit.

, Trellises like this tend to blow over once they are covered with lots of foliage, so they need to be anchored. This can be done in several ways:


Dig holes and bury the ends of the trellis in the ground, preferably at least 1 foot (0.3 m).
Or, hammer three 2' lengths of reinforcing bar (""rebar"", available at many building supply centers) into the ground, and wire the trellis legs onto them. Set up the trellis the way you like it, and then hammer the rebar right next to the trellis legs, following their angle into the ground. The legs can then be wired onto the rebar.
Instead of wiring the legs to the rebar, hose clamps can be used to secure the trellis legs to the rebar.

Search online listings like Craigslist or inquire around at local tackle or sailing shops to find an appropriate boat.


Find an old wooden rowboat (or similar). One which is no longer fit for use in the water will probably be cheapest.
Paint it whatever color you would prefer and drill a few holes in the bottom.
Place it in its final location, such that the boat is level. A trench may be necessary.
Line the bottom with gardening plastic, and place a number of rocks or other fill material to even out the bottom a bit.
Fill with dirt and plant whatever you desire.;
, You can purchase antique bed frames to make your gardening bed look quirky and unique. The downside, of course, is that it may end up at an awkward height for planting and it will be difficult to reach the center if using a very large led. A child’s twin bed is recommended.


If you can only find a head- and foot-board, these can be attached to an appropriately sized bed as described below.
If the frame of the bed is intact with sideboards, you can simply add more sideboards to create a box within the bed. Measure for the boards and nail them (from the inside of the bed) to the posts. Fill with dirt and plant.

, Wine crates, orange crates, or any similar crate can be turned into an excellent planting box. Simply drill holes for drainage if there are none, fill with dirt, and plant. Place them on your gardening beds or on a flat or angled table to display.

Buy a garden structure from a garden store.,
Use vertical features you already have.,
Build your own vertical trellis.",How to Build a Vertical Garden1," Since vertical gardens are growing in popularity, home and garden stores increasingly carry a variety of structures suitable for building a vertical garden. Choose from among these options:


Buy simple poles you can set into the ground. Metal poles are better if you have dense or clay soil because they can be driven through hard ground. If your ground is loose, wooden poles will be fine. Stick the poles every few feet along a row of plants. As the plants grow, run a line of garden twine down one side, loop around the far pole, and tie off at the end where you started. Tie the twine to each pole along the way to support plants.
Buy a trellis. Trellises are often made of wood. They are built in the shape of a box with a cross-hatched top and sides, allowing vines and plants to weave themselves through the gaps in the wood.;
, There's no need to go out of your way to buy a structure if you don't want to spend the money. You probably already have items you can use to grow a vertical garden. Consider the following:


A tree. That's right, you can train a plant to grow around a tree. The best type of tree for this is one with branches that begin more than 6 feet (1.8 m) up the tree.
Bamboo poles. Is there a stand of bamboo located near your home? Bamboo provides a sturdy base for a vertical garden, and it's often easy to get it for free. If you don't have bamboo, another strong, tall stick of some kind will do.
Your deck. If you have a deck that extends several feet or yards above the ground, you can train plants to grow up the sides.
A fence. Most any fence provides suitable structure for a vertical garden - the taller, the better!

, For a completely customized vertical garden structure, build your own out of wood. Building your own structure allows you to create a garden with the right dimensions for your yard. Here's a step-by-step guide for building a 6-foot high garden structure:


Build a 2 foot (0.6 m) square by 11 inch (27.9 cm) high box from redwood, cedar, or pressure-treated 2 x 6s. Screw 8-foot pressure-treated 2 x 2s at the center and one corner in back, and 6-foot 2 x 2s at the other corner and 18 inches (45.7 cm) from the back on both sides.
Pre-drill, glue and screw 1 x 2s every 6 inches (15.2 cm), starting at the top of the box. Extend the 1 x 2s at least an inch beyond each 2 x 2 to minimize the danger of splitting.
Add platforms by screwing on 3-foot 1 x 2s, then screwing on 1 x 2s laid flat to create a miniature deck.
Add one more 6-foot long 2 x 2 in the center at the front, and screw it to the crosspieces.
Add a 1 x 4 crosspiece at the top of the two longest 2 x 2s. If you want, you can attach a bird house to the crosspiece.
Fill the box with good soil, then plant climbing plants and train them up the lattice. Add other plants in pots and hanging baskets.

",How to Build a Vivarium,"









Determine if their basic requirements make them incompatible (Such as high humidity frogs and low humidity cacti).;
,









An aquarium is basically a glass box that is only open at the top. Terrariums usually have hinged or sliding glass doors on one of the vertical sides to make access easier.
You may also build your own enclosure. This can be done with glass and silicone, wood and epoxy, cement and epoxy, or a number of other ways.
If humidity and temperature in your living environment are suitable, then you can water substrate for a plant at any level with a siphon (inverted-U) hose connecting to an aquarium. This arrangement can be raised, lowered or replaced according to root growth, substrate depth(s), and hydrophilic properties of substrate(s). If using plants that were previously potted plants, be sure to thoroughly flush out the roots with water to remove any toxic fertilizers before planting them in the vivarium.

, Desert vivariums do not need a false bottom since there will be little watering.









A false bottom is an area for excess water to pool without drowning the plants roots. The two main types of false bottoms are filled vs. open false bottoms.
A filled false bottom is a 1–2 inch (2.5–5.1 cm) layer of gravel or LECA with a screen on top to prevent dirt from entering.
An open false bottom consists of a piece of egg crate supported by PVC, with a screen on top.
Both styles are adequate methods with their own pros and cons.

,









These can be attached with silicone or hot glue; however, it is important that the dried adhesive is inert and cannot contaminate the vivarium with harmful chemicals.
Possible background and hard-scape include: wood, cork-bark, rocks, disguised foam, disguised plastic, ornaments, or any number of other items. It is important that anything placed in the vivarium is clean and non-toxic. Items found outdoors must be cleaned before placing them in the vivarium.

,









A screen top usually prevents high moisture since the vivarium will take on the humidity of the room it is in; while a mostly glass top (90-95% glass, 10-5% screen) will keep the humidity level much higher. However, normal glass and screens blocks most UV light, thus UV lights must be placed inside the vivarium

,









Plants require full spectrum lighting with a color temperature between 5000-7000K for best growth. Most 'normal' home lights are drastically less than 5000K while 'bluer' bulbs can be much higher Kelvin.

,









Equipment includes a thermometer, hydrometer, under-tank heater, in tank heater, pumps, filters, etc.

,









There are a large number of substrates available at pet-stores. Usually it is best to use these rather than collect anything from outdoors. Both plants and animals have substrate they prefer (do research!).
A temperate or rain forest vivarium might have a layer of peat, fir bark, and black earth, followed by a layer of sphagnum moss, with a layer of leaves on top.
A desert vivarium will probably have just a layer of sand with maybe some gravel in certain areas.

,









For temperate and tropical vivariums it is best to wet down the entire vivarium to make sure there are no overly wet areas.
A desert terrarium will usually just have a water dish.

,









Remember, every plant has its own requirements; such as soil moisture, watering schedules, and light levels.

,









This will allow you to monitor the health of the plants and the functionality of your design without unduly disturbing the future animals.
This is particularly important with water features.

,









This is important to prevent contaminating a vivarium that took a long time to build. A one to four week quarantine is suggested.

Visualize and then design the shape of your raised bed.,
Draw your planned bed, measure your available garden space, and add the measurements onto your drawing.,
Decide which materials to use.,
Gather your supplies.",How to Construct a Raised Planting Bed2," Luckily, a raised bed doesn’t take much! You basically build an open-topped and open-bottomed box, and you can do it in any shape that you want. Think of yourself as building a form to pour soil into (like one might pour cement or plaster into a form).

, Now you’ll be able to determine how much material you’ll need to build the bed.

, You can use just about anything that will hold dirt. Lumber, plastic, synthetic wood, railroad ties, bricks, rocks, or a number of other items are possible materials. However, using lumber is generally the easiest and most efficient method. This article will focus on making a raised bed out of lumber or synthetic lumber.

, A full list of supplies is below under Things You'll Need. All that you really require are sides cut to your desired length and at least 24"" (60 cm) in height. If you want a triangular raised bed, you will need three sides. If you want a square bed, you will need four sides of equal length. For a rectangular, bed you need four sides, with two of one length and two of another. You get the idea!

"
"
Place posts.,
Attach long-side boards.,
Attach short-side boards.,
Create a lip, if desired.,
Cut a piece of gardening plastic or weed mat to fit the footprint of your raised bed.",How to Construct a Raised Planting Bed3," Use 4x4s cut to twice the height of the intended raised bed. Dig holes and place the bottom half of the 4x4 into the ground, anchoring the post. Cover and ensure that the posts are level and in the correct place.

, Cut your intended siding to the length of the long side between posts, including the width of the post itself. Use nails or screws of an appropriate length and drive two at the end of each board into the posts. Place boards until the sides are the intended height of the bed. Cut boards to be narrower for the last piece, if necessary.

, Measure and cut the short-side boards to the distance between the outer edge of the two long-side boards. Again, use two nails at the ends of each board, driven into the posts., You can create a more attractive raised bed by adding a lip to the upper edge. First, cut and miter a picture-frame style lip from boards of the desired width for the lip. Acquire lumber posts which are half the width of the lip and use appropriate nails to attach these to the outer side, at the top of the bed. Fit the mitered lip together and nail those pieces at the inside corners from the top, down into the post and the brace beam underneath., By putting a barrier down, you will significantly reduce the weeds that will grow in your bed. Seven or eight layers of dampened newspaper will also keep the weeds from growing, as well as cardboard from appliance boxes (be sure to remove any tape on the cardboard).

"
"
Once your bed is in its permanent position, fill it with soil.,
Start planting.,
Protect your raised bed from the elements.",How to Construct a Raised Planting Bed4," Add some composted manure into the bottom of the bed and then layer potting soil on top of the nutrient-rich compost. You can cut costs significantly by using some soil (up to 50%) from other parts of your property. Plan on filling at least 1/3 of your raised bed with compost or composted manure (available from nurseries or garden centers in 40-pound bags).


Mix in dry organic fertilizers (like wood ash, bone meal, and blood meal) while building your bed. Follow package instructions.

, Some people like to grow flowers in their raised beds. Some prefer to grow vegetables. The options are nearly limitless. If you do want to grow food, raised beds are excellent choices for salad greens, carrots, onions, radishes, beets, and other root crops.

, To build a miniature organic insect control spring/summer/fall ""greenhouse"", add hoops to your raised bed by bending and connecting PVC pipe in an arch over the bed. Put an arch every 4-6 feet (1.2 meters - 1.8 meters).


Buy a piece of floating row-cover, also called spun fiber cloth from a garden supply store or online, clip it to the arches, and you’ll have an insect-free, moisture-conserving, hoop house that you can use to grow food in throughout the growing season.
When the plants in one section become so tall that the cover is no longer practical, you can uncover that portion, and take the cover all the way to the ground between portions still using the cover. It may seem strange but light, warmth and moisture can all penetrate the cover in sufficient proportions in full sun, but bugs and wind-borne weed seeds cannot. Therefore this step can help you reduce your watering, weeding, and pesticide demands.
You can also use the frame to support plastic bird netting to limit, if not eliminate, deer damage to your hard won efforts.

Grow vegetables vertically.,
Create a vertical flower and vine garden.,
Plant the three sisters.For a completely natural vertical garden, you can't go wrong with the three sisters: beans, squash and corn.",How to Build a Vertical Garden2," Many types of vegetables and legumes grow on vines, making them great candidates for a vertical garden. Peas and beans naturally twist and curl over stakes and trellises, and many of them also produce pretty flowers in the spring. Here are a few ideas:


Grow scarlet runner beans, which attract hummingbirds and have red and white blossoms.Go with tomatoes, which must grow vertically in order to stay healthy and produce a lot of fruit. Your summer will be filled with juicy red goodness.
Some varieties of squash grow vertically, too. Try trombetta squash, which produces pretty flowers.Cucumbers also grow well on trellises.

Hops, which are the essential ingredient in beer, grow at least 6 feet (1.8 m) into the sky.

, If you're keen on building a whimsical vertical garden - the kind you can stroll underneath with your sweetheart while you enjoy the fragrance of its flowers - look for flower and ivy varieties that prefer to grow toward the sky. Be sure to choose plants that do well in your particular region.


Morning glories grow fast and strong, and they produce gorgeous flowers in many different hues.
Wisteria, which blooms purple and produces a lovely scent, is a popular choice for vertical gardens.
English ivy provides a pleasing green backdrop for more colorful flowers.

Climbing roses will give your vertical garden a romantic touch.

, Native Americans planted these three vegetables together because they coexist so well with one another. They also make for a gorgeous natural vertical garden; the corn provides a ""pole"" for the beans while the squash will grow along the ground.

"
Pick a good spot.A vertical garden, like any other type of garden, needs to be planted in an area with good soil drainage and the right combination of shade and sunlight.,
Make sure the garden structure is stable.,
Plant around the base of the structure.,
Care for the plants according to their needs.,
Train the plants.",How to Build a Vertical Garden3," Figure out what conditions the plants you're growing need to thrive, then choose a suitable area in your yard or on your patio.


Most vertical gardens do well with a lot of sunlight.
Pick a spot close to a wall if you want your garden to eventually climb the walls of your house.

, If you're using a trellis, a stake or a pole, be sure to bury it deep in the ground so that it doesn't wobble or fall over. Remember that the garden will get heavier as it grows, and it will need a solid foundation that can stand up to wind and rain.


Use a post driver to push your metal or wooden posts deep into the ground.

, Taking into account the individual needs of the plants you are using, plant seeds or seedlings in holes spaced around the base of the trellis, pole or other structure you are using. Make sure they aren't too close to each other or the structure so that they'll have room to root and grow.

, Make sure they get adequate water and that you fertilize them, protect them with mulch, and take other measures they need to grow healthy and strong.

, When the seedlings get a few inches high, it's time to train them to wrap around the structure you erected. Gently wrap the stems of the plants around the base of the structure, taking care not to bend or break them. Use ties to hold the stems in place as they grow.


Don't tie the stems too tightly. This prevents them from growing properly and may actually damage the plant.
As the stems begin to grow and wind around the structure, continue using ties to train them to grow in the direction you want them to grow.
For vines like hops, tie a string to the trellis a few feet above the ground, and stake it to the ground near the plant. Train the plant up the string until it reaches the trellis. If you are using metal or other slick types of materials, run the string all the way to the top so the vines have something to grab onto.

Although a metal trellis can look very ornate and attractive, metal isn’t always the best choice because it can heat up in the sun and burn the plant.



 


Wood is easier to work with and paint, and is more sympathetic to the plant's needs.






When selecting wood, make sure you use kiln-dried wood to avoid warping. Cedar is a popular choice.






Consider treating the wood with wood preservative before you work with it: this will prolong the life of your trellis.






Get 4 pieces of 2x2 wood, all about 8 feet (2.4 m) in length, plus another 4 pieces of 1x3 wood about 5 feet (1.5 m) in length.






Get some shorter lengths for making horizontal cross pieces like the slats on a ladder.






Remember that the wood may be roughly finished, so beware of splinters and use work gloves when handling it.





;
, You can make a garden pyramid trellis using pre-cut wood or by cutting your own wood, depending on your skills, experience, and available tools.

Cut your wood to size if you need to, otherwise, move to the next step.






You can download free cutting guides for woodworking that may make the job easier by telling you how and where to cut.






A mitre saw will probably be essential if you are cutting your own wood to size.







, It’s best to pre-drill any nail holes in order to prevent splitting in the timber when sinking nails.


Additionally, if you plan to paint your pyramid, you should do so before assembly to make it easier to cover every surface.
Dark green paint always looks good, or you can try using a contrast color such as bright blue, deep red, or white.
These colors will look good against any green foliage you have in your garden.
Remember that it’s hard to repaint once foliage is climbing up the structure, so paint your trellis with primer or undercoat, then apply at least 2 coats of a good quality weatherproof paint so the paint lasts and looks good over the years.

, Use the 4 longer pieces of wood that you cut or purchased to make 2 V-shaped frames.


Start by cutting the 4 longer pieces of wood on their joining edges at a 10 degree angle.
Make sure they fit flush against their partner at the pointed tip, then nail them together.
If you are unsure about cutting at an angle, or don’t have a mitre saw to do so easily, consider building a tall oblong shape, as this lets you retain the square edges and join the pieces at right angles.
This may be slightly less stable once finished, so it will need a sheltered position out of strong winds.

, Nail the crosspieces of increasing lengths up the length of the shorter pieces, like making a ladder with only one central vertical length.


The shorter lengths of wood should be used to hold up the horizontal crosspieces.
Use stainless steel nails (or brass) and make sure you sink them slightly beneath the surface of the wood.

, Start by joining the 2 V-shaped longer pieces. Then, add the shorter lengths along all 4 sides of the pyramid, joining using the crosspieces.


It may be helpful to have a second person to help support the pyramid whilst you secure the pieces together.
You might like to place the nails where they aren’t so visible, i.e. on the inside surfaces of the pyramid.
This isn’t essential, and can be a little more fiddly.
You can add a finial (decorative wood top).
You can simplify the design by adding crosspieces to the 4 long pieces and skipping the step where you add shorter vertical lengths to the structure.

, If you are in a windy area, you should anchor your pyramid to prevent it toppling.


If the pyramid moves, it may cause damage to any plants that are growing on it.
You can achieve an attractive look by shaping garden canes or willow rods into a pyramid shape and attaching them to the trellis with garden twine to keep it in place.
Remember that climbing plants will eventually add their weight to the structure, and may topple it if it becomes too heavy on one side.
Consider planting on both sides to balance your trellis and anchor it to the ground.

, If you plan to keep the structure in place for a while, consider preparing the area before placing it.

Dig some manure or compost into the ground.






Remove stones and weed the area before placing your pyramid trellis.






Be aware that if you dig first, the ground may settle and the pyramid may sink a little over time.






If the feet sit in damp ground, they are more likely to rot or crack.






Soaking the lower part of the structure (or all of it) in wood preservative overnight will help prolong the life of your trellis.






If possible, place it on hard, free-draining ground because the trellis won’t last as long if it sits in wet earth or a puddle.







, After choosing a position for your pyramid trellis, you can plant climbing perennial plants such as Clematis, Ivy, Passionflower or Climbing Rose against it.


Some climbing plants will benefit from being lightly tied onto the pyramid structure; others will be able to scramble up by themselves.
Also consider annuals such as Black-eyed Susan, Sweet Peas or Morning Glory.

Reinforce joints with a waterproof wood glue, if desired.,
Repeat this process until four frames are made.,
Position the first set of legs.,
Attach the first set of legs.,
Reposition the frames carefully.,
Fasten the second set of legs to the frames.,
Add vertical supports to the frames.,
Cut your plywood shelves.,
Install the shelves.,
Finish the wood, if desired, and enjoy.",How to Make a Garden Shelf," Each tier of this shelf will be comprised of one frame. The front and back of the frame are formed by 96 in (2.4 m) 2x4 boards. There are four supports for each frame, and each support consists of one 21 in (53 cm) 2x4. Measure and mark where your supports will go with a tape measure and pencil.


The supports will fasten the front and back piece of the frame together. Each support is separated by 29 in (74 cm).
The front and back boards should extend 1½ in (3.8 cm) beyond the left and rightmost supports on either side of the frame. All wood should be balanced on its narrow, long edge.
Three 2½ screws in per support should be sufficient to attach them sturdily to the back of the frame.;
, Each support needs to meet the front and back boards and form an L-shape. Use a carpenter’s square to check the angle formed between the supports and the back board.


Adjust the supports by hand until each forms a right angle with the back board. Slide the next 96 in (2.4 m) 2x4 into place at the front of the frame and square it up with the supports in the same fashion as the back board., The supports should be held loosely in place by the screws connecting them to the back board. Double check the angle formed by the front/back boards and supports. Line up and screw in the supports to the front of the frame. Use three 2½ in screws per support.


If the angles formed by your back/front boards and supports don’t form an L-shape, this could compromise the stability or appearance of your shelves., A joint is where two pieces of wood meet. Though gluing the joints of your frame is not necessary, doing so will give your shelf greater sturdiness. Follow the glue’s instructions for best results., Continuing in the same fashion you made the first frame, make three more. Each frame will be exactly the same. Remember to check the angles formed by supports and front/back boards. Each should form an L.


Keep in mind that the front and back boards of each frame should extend 1½ in (3.8 cm) beyond the left and rightmost supports., Arrange each frame so it stands upright and there is 19¼ in (49 cm) between each one. Align the outer edges of the frames. Lay one 72 in (1.8 m) 2x4 on the left and right protruding ends of the frames.


The long 72 in boards should be positioned on their long, narrow side and balance on the part of the frame extending beyond the left and rightmost supports.
This part of the project can be awkward by yourself. The frames will fall over easily, but once you get the 72 in boards in place, their weight should hold the frames somewhat in position.
Ask a friend or family member to help you during this part of the project or use other tools, like clamps, to hold the wood in place.

, Before you do, check the squareness of your angles (you want them to form L-shapes) and other measurements.Adjust the wood as necessary. Use your drill to fasten the 72 in (1.8 m) board to each frame with four 1¼ in screws. Do this for each frame for both 72 in boards., Your shelf is halfway done and should be relatively stable at this point. Still, roughly handling materials at this point can cause damage to the wood. Carefully flip the shelf upside down, so the attached 72 in (1.8 m) legs are off the ground and opposite the floor.

, In the same fashion you fastened the first two 72 in (1.8 m) legs to the frames, fasten two more 72 in boards. Rest the long, narrow edge of each board on the part of the frame extending beyond the left and rightmost frame supports. Fasten these to the frames with 1¼ in screws.


Before fastening these legs, check all your measurements and angles again. While repositioning your shelf, you may have slightly altered something, like the distance between frames. This can cause the finished product to look poorly constructed., Orient your frame so the attached 72 in (1.8 m) boards are standing straight up. Position the final two 72 in boards in line with your middle frame supports. Fasten the vertical supports with two 2½ in screws per frame., Three of the four plywood pieces will need to be cut to make shelves. The fourth piece will fit as the top shelf without being cut. Use a saw to cut three plywood pieces down to 24x93 in (.61x2.36m).A table saw or a suitable handheld saw, like a circular saw, will work best for cutting your plywood. However, a handsaw will also work in a pinch.

, Slide a single piece of plywood onto each frame to form the baseboard for each. Use your drill to fasten each piece of plywood to the frame with 1¼ in screws. The plywood should be fastened with a screw every 6 in (15 cm)., Sand down your newly built shelf to take the rough edges off. Use wood staining to finish the wood, or coat it in primer and paint it. When the staining or paint has dried, add your plants to it and enjoy your garden shelf."

Plan a garden space suitable for the railway.,
Find out who wants to get involved.,
Plan the track and layout.,
Plan the budget.,
Purchase suitable track and carriages.,
Start building the garden railway.,
Select your trains.,
Maintain the garden railway.",How to Make a Garden Railway," You'll need to set aside enough of a space where the track can be laid out, scenery grown and tended to, and model features such as buildings and bridges can be added.


Try to choose a place that is visually pleasing and easy to access.
Consider elevating the display if possible; it will make it easier to look after and to see. Something about the height a young child would find easy to view is good.
Be sure to keep in mind the usual use of the garden and how that will impact and be impacted by the garden railway. In addition, consider the possible problems of pets and wild animals having access to the track and plan to guard against any potential damage.;
, Make it as much a family affair as possible because it's more fun that way and you'll have more hands to help out. Kids are usually thrilled to be involved but their level of interest depends very much on their ability to contribute, so try to find something age-appropriate for each of them. If you've got a neighbor who is keen too, rope them in!

, Your design will need to reflect your aesthetic preferences, your budget, and the space available. If you plan to build the track over stages, take this into account when preparing the plan.


A simple round or oval track without anything fancy is a good starting layout. It will allow you to shape the plants and props around it to give it more interest, and it will be easy to incorporate a bridge and a tunnel if wished.
If planning a fancier design, ensure that the design can be achieved by doing a layout with regular track on your floor.
Always account for the size of the trains you'll be adding as this will determine the size of the track, which in turn impacts the whole design.

, It's important to be aware from the start that a garden railway can cost a fair amount, including the costs of preparing the garden space (soil, retaining or elevating elements, gravel/pebbles, etc.), the costs of the plants, and the costs of the track, trains, and accompanying items. The fancier you get, the costlier it becomes but you will probably enjoy making some of the times, and hunting things down in online auctions, etc. Plan to add to it gradually and the costs will be spread out over time.

, The track and carriages must be capable of staying outdoors in all weather, so be sure to purchase or build items that are capable of withstanding outdoor elements. Some of the things to consider purchasing or building include:


Track
Bridge
Buildings
Make use of natural features incorporated into the garden railway
Tunnel

, This will take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks or even months, depending on the time you have available and the complexity of your design. The weather will also impact your ability to complete it.



Prepare the garden space. Clear away all debris and unwanted plants in the vicinity. Use a level to ensure evenness of the surface.
Gather the materials. If you're elevating or adding retaining features, put these in first.
Ensure adequate drainage and weed protection. Consider laying down weed mat. Be sure that the soil will drain well following rain.
Follow the design. Lay the track where the design indicates. Use rustproof nails and screws.
Place down the materials that will cover the soil, around and over the track (sand, gravel, etc.). For the track, use layering to build railway ballast, such as sawdust, fine cover, then larger pebbles or small rocks.
Smooth over the soil cover so that it sits evenly.

Use a brush (a pastry brush or paintbrush are both good) to remove sand or soil off the tracks as you build.
Place the buildings into position once the track and soil cover are neatly in place.

, You should have already chosen the train size to suit the track. Now it's time to find some trains!


Make a decision about whether you prefer having the trains controlled by battery inserted direct into the train, or using a transformer box. If using electricity outdoors, follow all the safety instructions for outdoor usage and get the help of an electrician if needed.
Investigate a timer for the trains to prevent them from running continuously and running down their batteries.

, It's important to keep the garden railway well cared for or you risk losing it to nature's overgrowth.


Weed it regularly.

Trim the bushes serving as ""trees"" regularly. Consider bonsai methods.
Remove dirt, dust, fallen leaves, and other garden debris on a regular basis.
Keep trains inside when not in use.

Fill the barrel with the growing mix, leaving the top 2” free.,
Before planting, make an arrangement by placing your plants in the most suitable spot in the container.,
Water your freshly planted barrel until you see water flow freely from the bottom.",How to Use Wine Barrels As Planters," If you don’t have an electric drill, inquire at the local hardware store or lumberyard about handyman services. For a nominal fee, some establishments will perform small jobs such as drilling or sawing, especially if you purchased the item from them.;
, It is not necessary to line the sides of the barrel with the cloth. Empty the entire bag of stones into the barrel and spread them evenly over the cloth.

, Add ½ cup of Osmocote and with your trowel, mix it thoroughly into the soil.

, Check the labels for height and width potential of mature plants. But bear in mind, a plant growing in confined quarters doesn’t have the freedom to stretch its roots the way it could if it were planted in open ground. If you are satisfied with how your design appears, remove plants from their pots and insert in soil.

, Moist soil on the top doesn’t mean that the entire container has received the water it needs in order to become a thriving, healthy and productive garden.

Cut the bubble wrap to fit.,
Wrap the container of any plant subject to frost damage in bubble wrap.

,
Tape the bubble wrap into place using strong tape.,
Remember to remove the wrap when the weather gets warmer.,
Keep an eye on your plants.",How to Use Bubble Wrap to Protect Outdoor Container Plants," Each piece of bubble wrap will need to be large enough to go right around a plant container and it should also extend above the container about 5 cm / 2 inches. If you have a lot of containers of the same size, it makes sense to cut all the pieces first and then wrap but if your pots differ in size, it can be easier to cut the wrap separately as you fix each container.;
,, Duct tape or packaging tape work well. Alternatively, use garden twine or plant wires to tie the bubble wrap around the container. Check that it is sturdy.

, If you don't your plants risk baking.

, You will find that the plants will respond well to this insulating wrap, which keeps the soil warmer than the winter air surrounding the plants.

Smooth hand over concrete to remove air bubbles and create a flat surface.

, Cut wire to within 5 centimeter (2.0 in). of the edge, overlapping pieces if necessary.


Add more concrete over the chicken wire, spread again to a 2.5 to 4 centimeter (1.0 to 1.6 in). thickness. Smooth your hand over the top to remove bubbles.

, The plastic will remain in place as the design cures and dries, which could take up to 48 hours.


Add a second piece of plastic over the top of the design to ensure it cures properly and does not simply dry out.

, If you worked in a humid environment, the leaf may have already decomposed and broken down.


Use a hose with jet spray nozzle to remove remaining leaf pieces.

, You can place the stones in the desired area, but avoid walking on them until the curing process has finished.

Although fuse replacement is easy (but not necessarily safe), a blown fuse is often a sign of other electrical problems which may be difficult for a layman to handle. If you are not experienced with electrical repair, hire a professional.;
, Microwaves are among the most dangerous household items to repair. Protect yourself before you begin:Remove all jewelry and watches, which could snag on components and conduct electricity. Magnetic microwave components may damage some watches.
Wear rubber soled shoes and consider wearing insulated gloves.
Have someone nearby to call emergency services if necessary.
Take care not to touch any metal parts within the microwave, especially circuit boards and capacitors., If your microwave is mounted under a cabinet, the power cord is usually threaded through the overhead cabinet.

, The vent grille is usually located at the top of the microwave, attached with a couple screws on the upper surface. After removing the screws, unhook the plastic tabs by sliding the grille (usually left or upward). Set it aside. Label all screws with their original location.


On some models, you'll need to open the microwave door to access the grille.Some models have the grille on the back of the machine. You may not need to remove this rear grille to remove the other panels, but there could still be a fuse behind it., Look for screws on the side of the control panel revealed by the grille removal. Also remove any screws on the upper surface of the panel. Lift the control panel and pull forward to detach it.Prop it up in a stable position without unplugging any wires.

, You now have access to some but not all of the microwave's interior. You may look for an electrical problem now, or unscrew and remove the remaining panels for full access.

, The capacitor can hold a potentially lethal charge even when the microwave is unplugged. Although the charge is supposed to drain when the microwave is turned off, this may take several minutes. Even after waiting, do not assume the capacitor is safe. This safety feature may have failed, or may not be present in your model.Always confirm the microwave is unplugged before you continue.

, In most models, the capacitor is a metal cylinder with two or three electrical terminals. If you cannot identify the capacitor, hire a professional repairman. Never disassemble interior components to look for it.


Do not touch any part of the inverter board that contains the capacitors. The aluminum heat sink, windings, and choke coil are all high voltage., You may also wish to wear insulated gloves, especially if you are not sure what voltage the handle is rated for. Voltages up to 5000 volts may be present., Clip a 100K Ω resistor rated for 25 watts or higher to the blade of your screwdriver. This will slow the rate of discharge, preventing damage to your screwdriver or microwave components., Attach the other end of the resistor to the metal chassis of the capacitor, using an alligator clip. Insulated gloves are recommended for this step to avoid brushing against the terminals of the capacitor.

, Hold it there for a few seconds while the charge drains.


According to the GE service manual for a JES series microwave, you may discharge at the magnetron filament terminal instead., Confirm the clip is still grounded, then touch the screwdriver tip to the other terminal.


Repeat with the third terminal if present.

, Withdraw the screwdriver and unclip the resistor. Touch the screwdriver tip to one terminal, then slide it to the other. If there is a popping noise or spark, the capacitor has not discharged properly.The voltage should now be gone, but drain each terminal to ground again just in case.


Never test for voltage using a standard multimeter. They are not made to handle the extreme voltage found in microwaves.

, A blown fuse is usually a sign of an electrical fault. Perform a visual inspection for scorch marks, dead insects or other debris causing a short circuit, and broken or leaking components. If any of these are present, you will likely need to replace or repair additional parts besides the fuse.


There are many possible causes for a blown fuse, and these are not covered in this guide. One common cause is a broken door interlock switch, which may require replacing several door components or realigning the door.WARNING: Do not touch or disassemble an unidentified component. If you cannot identify the broken part or do not know how to handle high-voltage equipment safely, hire a professional repairman.

, Your microwave may have two types of fuse. The line fuses are usually familiar ceramic tubes, about 1¼ inches (3 cm) long.The thermal cutoff fuses are typically squat black cylinders with two prongs on the same side. Their exact location depends on your model, but check behind the control panel.If you are having trouble, consult the wiring diagram printed on the inside cover of the microwave (or occasionally on the underside or back of the exterior panels).
Some fuses may be hidden by other components.Only remove these components if you are familiar with their function and know how to handle them safely.

, Pop out the fuses with a fuse puller or the tip of a screwdriver with a well-insulated handle. To remove thermal fuses, pull the wires off the prongs. Make a note of where each fuse came from.

, Most microwave fuses do not look any different after they are blown. To test them, set your multimeter dial to the continuity test if present, with the symbol ))). Otherwise, set it to the lowest Ohm setting. Test the fuse resistance:


Touch the two probes together. You should hear a tone if the multimeter is set to continuity. If set to measure resistance, the multimeter should read 0 Ohms. (Analog multimeters may need calibration.)
Touch the two probes to opposite ends of the fuse.
If the multimeter reads 0 Ohms or you hear a continuity tone, the fuse is working. If the multimeter measures resistance or displays ""OL"" for overload, or if there is no continuity tone, the fuse is blown.

, The fuse must be exactly the same size and have the same amperage rating as the original. This information should be displayed on the fuse, although you may need a magnifying glass to read it.


Pop the new fuse back in with the fuse puller or insulated gloves.
Buy a couple spare fuses. If there is an underlying electrical problem, the new fuse could blow as well.

, Replace all panels and screws in the reverse order you removed them. Check all tabs around the edge of panels to make sure they fit securely in their slots, without pinching any wires. Improper reassembly could cause radiation to leak out of the microwave during operation. Make sure all screws are in their original position, as some may be responsible for grounding the cover.Never plug in or run the microwave until it is fully assembled. Place something inside the microwave before testing to avoid overheating."

Size your range hood based on the heat output of your range.,
Examine the relationship between your stove's size and the required range hood size.,
Determine the recommended ventilation based on your kitchen's size.,
Add more based on Ductwork.,
Choose the greatest of these 3 guidelines to size your range hood.",How to Calculate CFM for Range Hoods," The first guideline for sizing a range hood depends on the output of your range as measured in British thermal units (BTUs). The recommendation by the Home Ventilating Institute (HVI) is to divide the BTU rating of your stove by 100 to arrive at a minimum guideline for CFM rating. So, a range that is capable of producing 35,000 BTUs should be paired with a range hood with a rating of 350 CFM or greater. This minimum guideline should be examined alongside other guidelines based on stove and kitchen size.;
, The HVI also provides recommendations for sizing a range hood based on the width of your range. If your stove sits against a wall, you should provide 100 CFM of airflow per linear foot of range. For example, a 24 inch (60 cm) range would require a hood rated at 200 CFM or greater. If your stove is on an island, you should provide 150 CFM of ventilation per foot of your stove's length. So, a 24 inch (60 cm) range on an island needs 300 CFM of airflow.

, The HVI also recommends that your range hood should be capable of cycling the air in your kitchen completely 15 times per hour. This equates to a complete cycling of '9 Dair every 4 minutes.


Begin by measuring the floor area of your kitchen. In a rectangular-shaped room, this can be done by multiplying the width and length. For example, a 10 ft x 15 ft (3 m x 4.5 m) kitchen has a floor area of 150 square feet (14 square meters).
Calculate the total volume of your kitchen. This is done by multiplying the floor area by the ceiling height. For example, if a kitchen has 150 square feet (14 square meters) of floor area and a ceiling height of 8 feet (2.4 m), the total volume is 1200 cubic feet (34 cubic meters).
Divide the total volume by 4 to get the required CFM rating. A kitchen with a volume of 1200 cubic feet (34 cubic meters) would need a range hood with a rating of (1200 / 4) or 300 CFM.

, Once you've calculated your CFM based on the above points, you're also going to want to add 9 CFM for a 9' duct and 25 CFM for every elbow bend encountered., After arriving at CFM recommendations based on heat output, range size, and kitchen size, compare the numbers. To ensure the best performance, size your range hood based on the highest number of the 3. Don't forget to add the value from Step 4! You just need to add it up to the highest of the other three.

Working a little bit at a time, start peeling away the backing and pressing the contact paper down onto the packaging paper.You can use clear contact paper or colored contact paper for some contrast.
If you paper is very wide, you may need to add more rows of contact paper. Overlap every row by about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) to prevent leaks.

, You don't have to do this, but it will give the planter some texture. It will also make the paper softer and easier to work with.Once the paper is textured to your liking, smooth it out on a flat surface., Set the paper down, contact-side-up. Orient the paper horizontally, then fold the side edges towards the middle. Overlap them by about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters).

Don't worry if your paper looks too tall at this point. The next few steps will fix that.

, Lift the top flap up. Run some glue or double-sided tape along the edge of the bottom flap. Press the top flap back down and run your finger along the seam.

Avoid getting any glue inside the planter. A glue stick might work best for this as it won't leak out.

, How far up you fold depends on how wide you want the planter to be. The higher you fold, the wider the planter will be.Plan on folding the bottom edge up at least to the halfway point., When you folded the bottom edge up, you will have ended up with a two-layer pocket. Pull the two layers apart and flatten them, turning the pocket into a diamond-shape with a slit down the middle.You can gently crease the edges of the diamond, but you don't have to.

, Make sure that the corners overlap each other by ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters). Secure them to the bottom of the bag with glue.

You can also place a strip of sturdy tape (ie: packaging tape or duct tape) over the corners instead., Place your hand into the planter and gently push out the bottom until it is flat. Set the planter down on a flat surface. Don't worry if it wobbles around too much., This will add some thickness and dimension to the top band. For a smaller planter, fold it down by only 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters). For a larger planter, try 3 to 4 inches (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters).

For a softer touch, roll the top down instead., You can always leave you planter plain if you'd prefer, but a simple word, phase, or image would look quite charming. Choose a spot for the stencil, then flatten the bag. Place a stencil over the bag, then apply some acrylic paint over it. Use a foam brush and a dabbing/tapping motion. Lift the stencil away, then let the paint dry.

If you have neat handwriting, you can write the word using a paint pen instead.
If you used colored contact paper, try to match the paint to it.

, Even though the planter is waterproof, you still should avoid getting it wet, so avoid placing it outdoors. If your plant drains a lot, it might be a good idea to place a little dish or saucer under it in the planter as well.

If you don't have a potted plant, you can try filling the planter with soil, and then adding a plant to it. Keep in mind that this is not recommended due to the lack of proper drainage.

Get a paper bag.,
Paint the bag.,
Decorate the bag with paint pens.,
Fold or roll the top edge of the bag down.,
Place you potted plant into a plastic bag.,
Place the bagged plant into the planter.",How to Make Paper Bag Planters2," This will become your planter, so choose a size that appeals to you. A paper lunch bag would work great for small planters while a grocery bag would work for larger ones. Focus more on the width of the bag than the height.

If your bag came with handles, cut them off.

, The easiest way to paint the bag would be with spray paint, but you can use acrylic paint as well. Allow the paint to dry, then apply a second coat, if needed. You can use any type of paint you want, but flat or matte paint would look the best on a paper bag planter., Flatten the bag first, then write a word or message on the bag. You can also do a design instead, such as a grid, polka dots, chevron, etc. Use a color that will show up well on your background. White and black are great choices, but silver or gold would also work. Let the ink dry before moving on.If you can't get a paint pen, use acrylic paint and a small brush instead.
You can also add designs using stencils, acrylic paint, and a foam brush instead.
Keep the finished height of your planter in mind. You will be rolling the top down!

, Keep folding or rolling until the bag is the right height for your plant. How thick you make the rolled or folded band depends on the size of the bag. The smaller the bag, the thinner the band should be. The larger the bag, the thicker the band should be.

Don't worry if the bag rips or tears at first.

, Choose a plastic bag, preferably a clear one, that fits your plant's pot. Place the pot into the bag. Don't worry if the fit is not perfect; as long as the bottom portion of the pot is covered, you should be fine. This planter does not have any protective coating, so the bag will keep it from getting ruined.

If you don't have a potted plant, you can try filling the bag with soil, and placing a plant into it. This is not recommended however, because the water won't drain properly.
If you can't find a plastic bag, place the plant onto a little dish or saucer instead.

, Push down any bit of plastic bag that is sticking out over the rim of the planter to hide it from view."

Decide whether you want a built-in or freestanding stove.,
Determine what size stove you need.,
Decide whether you want an electric or gas stove.,
Consider the aesthetic impact of your stove.,
Choose between buying a new or used stove.",How to Choose the Right Stove," Built-in ovens and cook tops offer streamlined and space-saving design, but can be more expensive to install, repair, and replace. Freestanding ranges (as well as ""slide-in"" or ""drop-in"" models) are often cheaper and are more widely available. Your decision in this matter will depend not only on budget and aesthetic preferences, but also on your current kitchen configuration. Replacing a freestanding unit with a built-in model, for example, will require major remodeling work.;
, Stoves come in many different widths, from compact 20-inch (50 cm) models to huge 60-inch (150 cm) professional-grade stoves. If you are replacing your current stove, it is most economical to go for the same size to avoid the cost of rebuilding the surrounding cabinetry. If you are designing a kitchen from scratch, you can choose a size based on your space constraints and personal preferences.

, Gas stoves tend to offer more rapid and even heat, while electric models are easier to install. If you already have either a gas line or 220/240 volt stove outlet installed, it is most economical to replace your current stove with the same kind.

, Stoves come in several different finishes, including white, black, stainless steel, and a multitude of bright colors. Consider your kitchen's color scheme and the finish on your other appliances when choosing a finish.

, Once you know your desired size, fuel source, finish, and whether you want a freestanding or built-in unit, you should begin looking at both used and new stoves that fit those specifications.


Used stoves represent the most economical choice. It is fairly easy to find used stoves in good condition on online classified sites like Craigslist. Though you may have to make some aesthetic sacrifices when working with a very small budget, you can also find reasonably priced stoves from the 1950s or 1960s that have a distinctive retro charm.
Buying a new stove will give you more choice as well as the peace of mind that comes with a new appliance with a warranty. Budget-model stoves can still be had at reasonable prices, while luxury brands like Aga and Viking come with astronomical price tags.
If you want the safety and security of a new stove but still want vintage charm, you can consider a retro-themed stove from companies like Big Chill and Elmira Stove Works.

Gas-powered ovens use either natural gas or propane depending on your town. Gas ovens are more expensive than electric ovens, but they cost less to use.
Electric ovens provide less control over your heat settings, but the ovens often work better overall.
Dual-fuel ovens tend to use gas to power the cook top and electricity to power the oven.
Convection ovens use fans to spread heat evenly throughout the interior.;
,


Most ovens come in a standard 4 cubic feet (1.22 cubic meters) size, but smaller ovens come in 2 to 3 cubic feet (0.61 to 0.91 cubic meters). The size of oven to buy depends on the number of people in your household as well as the amount and size of foods you plan to cook.

,


Freestanding ovens are the most common style. The appliance is completely standalone with panels on each side. Freestanding ovens typically rest on the floor.
Drop-in ovens are literally dropped in between counters or cabinets. Drop-in ovens are always electrical. Unlike freestanding ovens, drop-in ovens have no bottom drawer.
Slide-in ovens are the same as freestanding ovens except without side panels. Slide-in ovens are situated between cabinets.

,


Most ovens include the following features: self-cleaning cycles, racks, smart timers, locking doors, broiling option and a front facing window.
Choose a coil type for electric ovens. Open-coil burners are coils on top of the range in a slightly concave position. Smooth-top burners are completely flat and the heat comes from under a glass panel. Smooth-top burners heat up slowly. Halogen burners are a modern option that uses glass tubes and magnetic fields for precision cooking.
Determine if dual-element burners are important to you. Many oven ranges feature various-sized burners for different types of range cooking.
Select a digital or analog display. Most ovens sold today are completely digital; however, there are a few brands that are still made in a more old-fashioned tradition.
Decide if you want super-modern, next-generation oven features. These features include a dehydration option, a warming drawer, Internet hookup, touch screens, speed cooking and downdraft ventilation.

Consider your heating needs by evaluating the size of your home.,
Choose the type of stove best suited for your space.,
Look for a stove dealer.",How to Buy a Wood Burning Stove," You will need to determine the heat load necessary to maintain the square footage of the area you want heated. Heat load is measured in BTUs, or British thermal units. You will need 25 to 30 Btus per square foot.


Measure each room to be heated with measuring tape. Write down the measurements for each room.
Add the square footage of each room to calculate total square footage. Although size requirements may vary, a stove that is rated at 60,000 Btus will heat a 2,000-square-foot area, whereas a stove rated at 42,000 Btus will cover about a 1,300-square-foot area.;
, Wood stoves are categorized as catalytic and non-catalytic.


Consider the options of a catalytic stove. These types of wood stoves contain converters that allow gases and fumes to heat repeatedly, resulting in a fire that is longer lasting and more even. Because of the recycling system in these stoves, they emit fewer pollutants into the air. These stoves are more expensive and must be cleaned regularly.
Consider the options of a non-catalytic stove. Like fireplaces, non-catalytic stoves lose more heat because of how they are vented. Unlike a catalytic stove, they do not recirculate heat, and therefore lose a certain percentage of warmth, as well as create extra pollutants. However, they do not require as much maintenance as catalytic stoves. Non-catalytic stoves are very common on the market and less expensive than catalytic stoves.

, Once you have determined the factors needed for a wood stove, look for a reputable wood stove dealer.


Check with the Better Business Bureau to find certified dealers, or ask the dealer to provide proof of certification. A reputable dealer will be certified by the National Fireplace Institute. He will help you choose from the many types of stoves and manufacturers available.
Choose a dealer who can provide a comparison of stoves that you can look at, deliver and install your stove, and repair and provide parts and warranties for your stove.

Choose a spray paint suitable for the colander you are using, spray paint it, then allow it to dry according to the paint's label instructions.


Although drying times will vary depending on environmental conditions and the kind of spray paint you've used, generally you can expect it to dry within an hour.
Metal surfaces and plastic surfaces will require different kinds of spray paint. Check the label to ensure you're using the right kind before painting.;
, Depending on the size and shape of your colander, you may only need to use a single piece between the handles. Larger planters might require you to string two lines of twine between the handles of your colander for better stability.


Wrap your twine around the handle, tie the loose end off to the part being strung to the other handle, and repeat the process on the other side.
Allow enough excess twine between handles so your planter hangs easily. If there is too little slack in your twine, it won't hang well.
You may want to use a dab of glue on the knots on both sides of your colander. This will help preserve the knot., If your colander doesn't have handles, you can use a drill and a drill bit (or some other suitable tool) to make small holes in the colander's sides. Push your twine through this hole and tie a simple knot to hold the twine in place.

Measure the length of vent pipe required to extend through the exterior wall to the outside of the home.,
Purchase a range hood, vent pipe (duct pipe), pipe elbows and a vent cap.,
Examine the manufacturer’s instructions and design to determine whether the ductwork will go into the wall directly behind the range hood or whether the pipe will extend above the range hood.

,
Measure a distance of 24 to 30 inches (60 to 75cm) above the stove for the placement of the range hood.,
Hold the template in place, if you have one, and use a pencil to mark the spots for the screws to fasten the range hood to the wall and where the vent pipe will enter the wall.,

Use the convection option when you want to roast food.,
Try the convection setting when you want flakier baked goods.,
Turn the convection setting on when you want to toast or dry food.,
Avoid using the convection setting with delicate pastries.,
Turn the convection on with fried and crunchy food.",How to Use the Convection Setting on an Oven1," The convection setting is great for roasting food because it will help render fat quicker and result in a more uniform-looking browned surface. In addition, convection cooking will help the natural sugars in fruits and vegetables caramelize quicker. This will result in a creamy center and crisp edges. Some examples of food you can roast with the convection setting on include:Turkey
Chicken
Potatoes
Various vegetables
Apples;
, Because of the way hot air moves in a convection oven, your baked goods will be lighter, crisper, and flakier. They might also cook faster. In addition, you won’t have to rotate them that often. Some baked goods you may want to cook with the convection setting turned on include:Cookies
Brownies
Some types of bread

, The convection setting will speed the drying process and make sure your food is more uniformly toasted. In fact, a convection oven may be better at drying jerky than a dehydrator. Consider toasting or drying:Nuts
Jerky
Fruit

, The circulating air in your convection oven will disrupt and harm any delicate dishes you cook. This process could dry out your dish or cause it to ruin in some other way. As a result, avoid cooking the following on the convection setting:


Cakes
Some breads
Custards
Soufflés
Desserts with a meringue, If you’re cooking or warming something that you want to stay crunchy, you should turn on the convection setting. This works because the convection oven will move hot air around the food, removing moisture, and crisping the dish.If you are reheating fried chicken, you can do so in the convection oven.
If you like your French fries crispy, cook them in the convection oven.

Ready your milk jug for upcycling.,
Cut the top off your milk jug.,
Create drainage in the bottom of the jug.,
Decorate your planter, if desired.,
Add soil and plants to your milk jug planter.",How to Make Upcycled Planters2," Clean your milk jug thoroughly with hot, soapy water. Rinse this thoroughly and then let it air dry. If labels are stuck to your milk jug, you may need to soak the jug in warm, soapy water before these come off easily.


For especially stubborn labels or glue, use a scrubbing pad or kitchen implement (like a spatula) to help with removal.
Gallon milk jugs tend to be the favorite choice for this upcycling project. However, feel free to use smaller sizes as well. Mixing gallon and half gallon sizes, for example, can add some nice variety.

, Depending on the size of your jug and the kind of plants you'll be planting, you may want to cut the jug right along the top to allow for more space for soil and the plant. However, this may be too large for some plants. In this case, cut your milk jug in half, or closer to its base.


In some cases, sharp edges in the jug may be created in the cutting process. If you're concerned about these, use a file to take the edge off.
Feel free to cut patterns, like waves or other designs, into the border of your milk jug to make it more artistic., If you don't poke holes in the bottom of your jug, the water won't drain away. This can cause root rot or decay to set in and can kill your plants. Use a pushpin to poke small holes in the bottom of the jug.


Depending on the amount of drainage the plants you'll be using need, the number of holes will vary. However, in most cases, four to six holes should be enough., Although this step isn't necessary, a plain milk jug might look unappealing. It's simple enough to use a plastic safe spray paint to cover your jugs in a base color that's more pleasing to the eye.


After the base layer is added to the jug and has dried, you might want to use some regular paint and a paintbrush to add more artistic designs.
Feel free to add things like sequins, paste jewelry, glitter, and other similar accents to your jug with glue.

, You may need to use a special soil for particular kinds of plants, but in most cases a general potting soil should be sufficient. After adding soil, add your plant to your planter and it's finished."

Insert your slats and attach your burlap.,
Put potting soil in your tire, add plants, and enjoy.",How to Make Upcycled Planters3," Use a hose and a scrub brush to clean off dirt, grime, and oil from your tire. Surface dirtiness can negatively impact the painting you'll be doing later, or could cause harm to your plants.


For especially dirty tires, you may want to use a moderate to strong soap while scrubbing the tires clean. Be sure to rinse this from the tires completely.

, Use a spray paint that is suitable for rubber tires and cover the outside and top of the tire with paint. Then allow this to dry for the time listed on the paint's label instructions.


Once the paint is dry, feel free to use regular paint and a paintbrush to add embellishments to the design. You might draw little suns, flowers, simple birds, and so on., The inside bottom of your tire will collect water unless holes are drilled in it. Poor drainage can cause root rot or decay, which can be harmful for your plants. Take your drill and a drill bit to create five evenly spaced holes around the bottom of the tire.


Depending on the kind of plants you'll be planting and the size of your tire, you may want more or less holes. , Use wooden boards (like 2x4's or thinner planks) to create slats in the bottom of your tires. You may have to cut these pieces of wood with a saw so they fit inside the tire. These, along with the lining, will support and hold the soil.


Lay your boards on the top of your tire. Use a pencil to mark where you'll need to cut them so they fit inside, using the tire to help estimate this.
You don't have to waste time cutting these boards perfectly. These will be hidden from sight, so they only need to fit in the bottom of the tire., Put your slats inside your tire, arranged so there's some space between slats. Then line the top of the slats with an even layer of burlap. Use scissors to cut the burlap to fit the shape of the tire, and use staples or nails to hold the burlap in place.Plastic backing or landscaping fabric will also work well for this. When using a material that you don't think will drain well, cut holes in it to facilitate drainage.

, In most cases, a general purpose potting soil will work well, but special plants may have special soil needs. Once you've added the soil, add your plants and enjoy this unique, upcycled planter.

Rubber boots are the best kind to use for this upcycled planter. Anyone who has kids likely will have a pair of boots that are outgrown and can be upcycled.

, Some molds and fungi thrive in boots. These are likely mild strains, but even mild mold or fungus can be dangerous to a plant's roots. Use hot water and a mild soap to clean the boots inside and out, rinse them thoroughly, and let them air dry.

, If you're using children's boots, it may be the case that there are already designs on the outside of the boot you want to keep. Plain boots, however, can be decorated with a suitable spray paint.


You can even add designs to the base layer of spray paint after it dries. Use a paintbrush and regular paint to add your own flair to the boots.

, Old boots may already have holes in them. In this case, you may not need to add any. If you do need to add some, use a sturdy pair of shears to poke/cut these in the bottom.You can always check the drainage of boots by pouring water into them. If the water appears like it can easily flow out, your drainage is likely good enough.

, To prevent your boots from tipping over and losing soil or damaging your plants, you may want to put something heavy in the bottom of the boot. For example, a few rocks in the bottom could help flimsy boots stay upright.

, Although some plants may have special soil needs, most should be fine with a general potting soil. Add this to the boot, insert your plants, and place these upcycled boot planters around your house or garden."

Reduce the temperature by 25 degrees.,
Set your timer for 25% less time.,
Cook with low-sided cookware.,
Add extra liquid if you want to keep your dish moist.",How to Use the Convection Setting on an Oven2," Since the convection option moves hot air around the oven, it may have the effect of overcooking the outside of a dish and undercooking the inside. As a result, you should lower the temperature by 25 degrees before you start cooking a dish.Your oven might automatically lower the temperature when using the convection setting. Check this before you set your temperature.

, In addition to lowering the temperature when cooking your dish, you should also shorten the amount of time that your recipe calls for it to be cooked. If you don’t cook your dish for less time, it could burn or dry out.For example, if the original bake time was 60 minutes, reduce it to 45 minutes in the convection oven.

, Because the convection process moves hot air around the oven, your dishes will cook best if you use low-sided cookware. Ultimately, this will help your dish cook more equally and make it crisper.Depending on the dish, you may want to use rimless ovenware.

, Since the exhaust system on your oven will remove moisture from your oven, you may need to add extra water to any dishes you want to keep moist. If you don’t, the dishes could dry out or ruin."

Check food often.,
Avoid loading your oven with too many dishes.,
Secure parchment or aluminum foil.,
Experiment.",How to Use the Convection Setting on an Oven3," As your dish cooks to completion, you should check it relatively often. This is especially important if you’re not that familiar with the convection setting, as dishes may cook faster than on a regular setting.


Check your food about halfway through.
Start to check your dish more often about two thirds to three quarters of the way to the end.
Trust your sight and smell more than the timer., By putting too many dishes in your convection oven, you’ll slow down the ability of the fan to move air around the oven. This will essentially make the convection option ineffective – and you may spoil your dish., Because the fan in your convection oven will be moving the air around, you’ll need to secure parchment or aluminum foil that you use to line a baking sheet or cover a dish with. To do this, either bend the aluminum foil down around the cookie sheet, or place a metal spoon or something similar on top of the foil or parchment paper., Ultimately, the convection setting is just one feature on your oven. You should experiment to see what settings help you to make the best food you can make. Consider cooking the same dish with and without the convection setting on, then, offer them to your friends and family and ask which one was better.

Wrap up.",How to Install a Stove With 220 Line," Ultimately, the spaces must be adjacent to each other so it will be able to support a ""double-wide"" circuit breaker that is generally required for a 240 V circuit.;
, The main disconnect switch is usually at the very top or very bottom of most electrical service panels, but not always. The main disconnect switch should be the largest value circuit breaker in the panel. This switch will probably be a double (or in some cases a quadruple) wide switch and be rated at 100, 200 or more amps. Leave the remaining circuit breakers in the ON position. All lights and power at outlets should now be off.

,, Recheck power with a meter, 120 V test light or other tester rated for 120 V by touching one probe to an unpainted surface (scratch through existing paint if needed) of the panel while touching the remaining probe to the terminals of several circuit breakers that are in the ON position. Do not proceed unless power is not present at all breakers. Only the main disconnect switch should have power on it's terminals.

, If there is enough space to install the circuit breaker, skip to the next step. Otherwise, inspect the panel and assess your ability to move breakers up and / or down to create a space large enough for the breaker to fit. Some older services have two ""single- wide"" circuit breakers installed adjacent to each other that provide power to a single ""three wire"" cable (a three wire cable has a bare or green wire and three insulated wires: white, black and red). The red wire is the indicator of a three wire cable. If there is a red wire connected to a single circuit breaker, trace it back to the cable from which it originates. Once located, trace the black wire from that same cable to the point it connects to a circuit breaker. Most likely, this is the breaker directly above or below the breaker that has the red wire. Be sure to move these two single breakers as a pair. Do not create a space between these two circuit breakers to install the new circuit breaker. Do not move just one breaker to the opposite side of the panel, they must be considered as a ""matched pair"" only.

, The circuit breaker will pop off the bus bar in the center of the panel and then it may be pulled off the side rail.

, Most circuit breakers are designed to be clipped on the side rail by aligning and pressing down at the terminal end or have a tang to engage a slot on the rail. The tang must be engaged first, and then pressed onto the bus bar in the center of the panel. This is the same as the removal procedure, but in reverse order.

, Place the blade of a screwdriver at the inside-most ring and strike sharply with pliers or hammer. Carefully twist out the bent metal and continue to enlarge the opening until the circumference required by the connector is met.

, Hold the connector so that the screws will be readily accessible as you tighten the locknut. Once tight, drive it tight by placing the flat edge of a screwdriver in a valley of the locknut and rap sharply with pliers or hammer until tight.

, The cable size and type, like the circuit breaker value, is determined by the appliance's or device's electrical requirements. A quick rule of thumb (there are variables in the Code that adjust these values up and down) is a #14 wire will supply a 12 amp load. A #12 is good for 16 amps, a #10 for 24 amps, #8 for 32 amps and #6 for 40 amps when copper cables are used. Aluminum cables can be used instead but often have additional requirements and slightly lower capacities. If installing a circuit to supply a typical 220 Volt / 30 Amp electric dryer, a cable with #10 copper conductors is required; a 220 Volt / 40 Amp electric stove would require use a cable with #6 aluminum conductors (a cable with copper conductors of this size tends to be very expensive). Local electrical code, conditions, etc. supersedes wire sizes mentioned above.

, between the electrical service panel and the location of the range. Use a bit large enough to allow the cable to slide easily through. 1-1/8"" would be a good choice. If old work, you will need to fish or snake the cable in the voids of walls, etc. instead.

,, Only a space wide enough for the cable - that will not result in contact of the cable with the range frame, drawers etc. will be needed.

, Leave several feet (or more) of the range cable in this area

, Remove 6"" of the jacket and any plastic shielding from around the conductors.

, Inspect the range outlet. Install the supplied cable connector to the range outlet with the hardware provided. It will be easier to wire the outlet if the connector is installed into the bottom of the outlet rather than the back. The bottom installation allows the cable to be easily passed into the outlet and wired without having to bend the conductors 90 degrees. Either way will work, one is just a little harder to work than the other. Lay the cable into the outlet by first lining up the jacket so that it will just be visible into the outlet body. Arrange the conductors to lay into the terminals. The black and red conductors will land in the gold terminals (it does not matter which of these two conductors land in the left or right gold terminals), the white conductor will land into the silver terminal and the uninsulated conductor will land in the green terminal. Mark them so that the conductor will extend just slightly beyond the terminal (1/16"" max.)

, Cut them one at a time as marked previously to allow the 1/16"" extension beyond the terminal. Carefully strip the cable as per the strip gauge indicated on the range outlet. Be sure to remove all insulation from the part of the conductor that will be in the terminal. Use extreme care to not nick any of the conductors. A nicked conductor must be cut back and redone. Since the working area in the outlet is so small, all the conductors will have to be re-cut to length and stripped over again.

, If using aluminum cable, apply a generous coating of aluminum oxide inhibitor to the individual stripped portion of the conductors and into the wire compression terminals of the range outlet (the amount of inhibitor should not be so much that it drips from the conductor or terminal). Application of oxide inhibitor to aluminum conductors is a code requirement, and must not be skipped. Copper conductors however, do not require application of any oxide inhibitors.

, Inspect the back of the range to get an idea as which locations will meet this requirement. Often times, removing the drawer will allow access to the wall - where it may be marked with a pencil, etc. Install the outlet cover and press any excess range cable back into the hole.

, Allow for 10"" or so of slack available (should it need for later use - the cable can still be used), and pull the rest back to the electrical panel.

, Mark the cable jacket where it will be clamped at the locknut side of the connector. Determine how mach cable will be needed to a.)connect to the new circuit breaker, b.) connect to the ground bar, and c.) connect to the neutral bar in the panel. Add 2 feet (0.6 m) or so this distance and cut the cable to this length when measured from the mark on the cable jacket.

, Remove the jacket and any plastic shielding from around the conductors. Untwist each of the four individual conductors.lay the cables in the electric service panel to where each will be terminated.

, Locate an existing red wire in the panel - in either column of circuit breakers. Determine if it is connected to an ODD or EVEN numbered circuit breaker. The new red wire will be connected the same way - if existing red is EVEN then the new red will be connected to EVEN (or if existing is odd connect new to odd). Determine if the top terminal of the new circuit breaker (when installed) is the even or odd terminal. Cut to length needed, strip and install the red wire and black wires under the appropriate terminal after applying the oxide inhibitor compound to the stripped portion of the conductors.

, Most homes with a single electric service panel have one bar to provide both neutral and ground conductor terminations. If the electric service panel is a sub-panel, there should be separate bars for neutral and ground terminations. It is easy to determine, but very important to connect correctly.


ONE BAR If there is one bar in the electric service panel, and both the bare AND white insulated wires are connected to it, bring each of the bare and white insulated range conductors into separate unused terminals.







TWO BARS If there are two bars AND one bar has all bare and/or green wires connected AND the other bar has all white wires connected, be sure to do the same - bring the range white insulated conductor to the bar with existing white conductors and the range bare to the bar with existing bare / green conductors.







BAR AND LUGS The last configuration (and least likely to be found) is one bar with only white insulated conductors and one or more ""lugs"" secured to the panel back or side that have all the bare and green conductors connected. If this is the case, the range white insulated conductor will connect to the bar into an unused terminal as above, and a new lug for the range bare will be needed. This lug will have to be secured with a machine screw into a tapped hole. Sheet metal screws are not permitted to secure lugs.







Notice in the pictures below that there is only one wire per terminal screw. Never terminate multiple conductors under a single terminal.







, Cables run through bored holes floor joists, rafters and those laying on ceiling strapping are considered supported and do not need to be stapled. Secure the cable within 18"" of any electrical enclosure or box it enters.

, Check for any tools, parts or other foreign objects accidentally left in the electric service panel.

,,,, Using a voltmeter, check the new range outlet for proper voltages.

Check for 240V between the two flat blades openings that are parallel to each other.






Check for 120V from the round pin opening, to each of the two previously tested parallel openings.






Check for 120V from the flat blade opening opposite the round pin opening to each of the flat blade parallel slots first tested.






Finally, check for 0V between the round pin opening and the flat blade opening opposite it.







, Correct any improperly wired connections and test again.

, After the new outlet is wired correctly, shut off the breaker, then push the range plug into the outlet. Set the range into place., Update the panel directory to reflect the addition of the new circuit breaker and new positions of old circuit breaker (if any needed to be moved). Make sure all circuit breakers have been turned back on.

Remove your old range hood, if one exists.,
Purchase your new range hood.,

Make sure that a venting range hood will vent through the right spot in the wall.,
Disassemble the cover of the range hood as well as the fan and filter underneath.,
For safety, shut off the electricity to circuit supporting the range at the main electrical panel.,
Use the template (or instructions) that came with your hood to mark the spot in your wall or cabinet for the vent cutout.,
Drill or cut for the vent.,
Work around any obstacles you find in your cutout.,
Install any necessary ductwork so that it leads safely outside of your home.,
Mark the holes for the screws and cable.,
Drill the mounting brackets or screws into the wall or cabinet above.,
Check your alignment.,
Connect the wires.,
Reattach the filters to the hood and fasten any grease guards back onto the hood.,
Reset the power and test the workability of the fan and light.If the range hood is vented, check the duct outside to ensure proper ventilation.

",How to Install a Range Hood," Detach all the wires near the light fixture of the old hood by unscrewing all the wire nuts and separating the connections. Next, loosen the screws that hold the hood into place while a partner holds the old range hood in place. Lift the hood slowly off the screws, put the hood down, and remove the loosened screws.;
, Make sure the range hood is large enough to cover your stovetop and that your space above the stovetop leaves at least 24 inches (60.96 cm) of clearance. If you can, purchase a range hood that extends at least one inch (2.5 cm) over all four sides of your cooking area.


Buy a hood with the correct CFM rating. The cfm rating represents how much air the vent can pull each minute, or cubic feet per minute. To find the right cfm rating for your kitchen, multiply the square footage of your kitchen by 2. 250 cfm is a respectable amount for an average-size kitchen, while 400 cfm is excellent.
Make sure the range hood you are buying is the correct size that will fit. The most common sizes are 36in, 48in, and 60in

, Range hoods will vent either through the cabinets above or through the wall. If you're buying a new range hood and dealing with a pre-existing vent pipe, make sure that both connect easily. If, for example, the range supports cabinet (upper) venting but your existing vent pipe goes through the wall directly behind the vent, you're going to have trouble connecting the two.

, Remove the filters first, then use a screwdriver to remove the bottom panels. Next, unscrew the duct connector, which is usually attached to the underside of the bottom panels in order to prevent damage during shipping. Finally, remove the perforated duct knockout from the back of the hood. Use a slotted screwdriver and a hammer for this, but be sure to work gently so that you don't damage any metal around the knockout.

, Next, make sure light and power switches on the old hood are off.

If your range hood is a plug in, just unplug it and skip this step.

, Most range hoods will come with a manufacturer's template. Use a laser level or water level to help you mark the exact middle of the wall. Then line your template up with the middle of the wall and tape it off. You're ready to start drilling for your cutout. Of course, the cutout in the wall needs to match the knockout in the range hood perfectly.

If you need to, drill for the electrical wiring as well. If you're not familiar with electrical work, call an electrician to spec the job for you.

, Use a drill or wallboard saw to cut through the drywall to get the templated shape of your cutout. If the space behind the wall is not occupied by any studs or piping, consider yourself lucky! If it is, there are several workarounds you can use. (See step below.)

, If, while cutting out the opening for the exhaust vent, you come across piping, you'll have to call an audible. Open up a larger rectangle of the wall so you can work freely. Then, you'll have to do three main things:

Reroute and re-solder the pipe so that it leaves your opening entirely free. If you are not familiar with this type of job, it's best to call a professional plumber or general contractor to help you.
Drill 1 x 3 cleats to the top and bottom of the wall to support the new wall patch. This will give the new wallboard that covers up the opening structural support.
Drill, tape, and mud the new wall patch to cover up the hole entirely. Then, when it's dry, remove the original cutout for the exhaust again with your template. Follow the same procedure as before.

, Remember that the venting cannot terminate inside the wall or attic — the exhaust must travel through duct outside of the home.

, If you have a template, now is the time to use it. Otherwise, hold the hood into place and have a partner mark inside the holes for the screws.

, Where you drill the screws depends largely on whether you're mounting your hood directly into the wall or into existing cabinetry. Note: If you are mounting directly into a wall using brackets, drill the screws fully into the wall; if you are mounting into existing cabinetry, drill the screws only halfway into the cabinetry — you want the range hood to be able to slip over these screws and rest on top of them.


If you're mounting into the wall, for example, and the wall is tiled, use a nail set and hammer to tack small holes into the tile. This way, you're less likely to damage the tile when you drill your mounting brackets directly into the wall.
If the cabinet is thin, you might need to install wooden blocks to accommodate and strengthen the mounting screws.

, The vent should match the hole for the ductwork for vented range hoods. Realign the hood as needed before tightening the screws.

, Run the cable from inside the wall through the cable hold in the hood. The fan and light both have black and white wires that must be attached. If you have never done an electrical project before or don't fully understand the manufacturer's electrical instructions, call an electrician to help you out.


Connect the two black wires from inside the hood to the one black wire from inside the wall.
Repeat this process with the white wires.
Fasten the green grounding wire coming from the wall to a grounding screw on the range hood.
If you are using a plug in hood, install an electric plug if you don't have an existing plug. Then plug in your hood.

, Then, replace the hood cover by tightening the screws.

, Take a measurement of the space where you plan to install the hood to ensure it will fit.


Similarly, make sure the hood will hang 24 to 30 inches above the stove, and will cover the entire cooking space. Ideally, there should be a three inch overhang between the edge of the hood and the edge of the cooking space., Go to your circuit breaker or fuse box and cut the power supply to your range and the old hood, if there is one. This is necessary to prevent electric shock during installation., If there's a hood already installed, start by removing the filters, then the cover that conceals the fan and motor. Finally, disconnect the power wires and unscrew the hood.Have someone hold the hood up while you unscrew it so it doesn't fall down.This is a good opportunity to use a voltage adapter to make certain the power to this area of your home is off before you proceed any further., Remove the fan, hood, ducting, and all other components from their packaging.


If the fan and filters are attached, remove them to expose the wiring.There may also be a panel over the electrical wiring that needs to be removed.

, Determine from which direction the wiring will come and which direction the duct will go (either from above or behind the hood), based on how the old hood was installed. The new hood should have pre-cut areas that can can be knocked out with a hammer and screwdriver to accommodate whichever side the holes need to be on.Work carefully so as not to damage the metal of the hood as you remove the knockouts.
The wiring knockout should create a small, round hole in the hood.

, The next step is to create outline on the wall where you will be cutting through for the vent and electrical wiring.


One way to do this is to lift the hood up to where you will install it and have someone else create an outline by tracing inside the holes with a pencil.Alternatively, you can measure the holes, then measure the space, find the center point of the wall, and align your holes accordingly.This method works well if you don't have a helper to trace the holes for you. The instructions that came with your hood should provide further guidelines on creating outlines for the holes via this method.Make certain to plan for both duct and wiring holes.
If the duct and wiring holes in your new hood match up exactly with the old one, you may not need to mark or cut your wall. In this case, you can skip parts 2 and 3 altogether and work with the existing holes and ducting.

, Use a drill with a long bit to punch holes in the corners of your outline. Drill all the way through the interior wall and out through the exterior wall of your house.These holes in the outside wall should line up exactly with the ones inside, allowing you to install a duct cap outside that will line up perfectly with your interior ductwork.
If your stove is positioned against an interior wall, you will need to install additional ducting to create a vent to the outside. The duct can go up through the cabinets and between ceiling joists, and then out through the nearest exterior wall.However you position your duct, make certain it ultimately leads outdoors. Never create a ventilation duct that ends in your attic or anywhere else inside your home. This can create serious mold problems., Using a drywall saw, cut along the outline you drew on the wall, moving from one drill hole to the next.Drilling a hole in the outline for the electrical wiring will make it easier to cut out.

, Pull at least 12 inches of wiring through the wiring hole to wire up your hood., Go outside your house and find the locator holes on the side of the building. Use them to draw an outline for your exterior vent hole, then cut through the siding to create the hole


Use a reciprocating saw, saber saw, or keyhole saw to cut all the way through, from the exterior to the interior. Remove any loose insulation or other debris that might get in the way of your duct., Place the duct cap in the hole and push it all the way in to see if the duct will be long enough to reach through to the vent hole on the other side.


If it is not long enough, you'll need to purchase a duct extension, which can be attached to the cap with sheet metal screws and duct tape.By the same token, if the duct is too long, trim the excess ductwork using metal shears.

, Remove the duct cap and apply caulk to the area around the hole where the edge (flange) of the vent cap will rest against the wall. This creates a better seal., Press the cap firmly into place and attach it by driving screws into the exterior of the house.

, Apply caulk generously around the cap's flange to fully seal it., Return to the kitchen and have an assistant lift the hood. Pull the wiring from the wall through the hood's wiring hole and clamp it to the hood with a cable clamp., Slide the hood into place and drive the screws halfway into the cabinet you are affixing the hood to.Push the hood upward to allow it to connect with the ductwork.

, While the screws are only halfway in, check to make sure the hole in the hood aligns properly with the ductwork. If it doesn't, take the screws out and readjust the position of the hood., Secure the hood firmly to the underside of the cabinets.

, Both the fan and light in the hood should have a black wire. Attach both of them to the black wire protruding from the wall by twisting the exposed ends together.Cover the exposed ends with a wire nut.
If there is not enough exposed wire, strip the sheathing off the ends with a pair of wire strippers.

, Repeat the process in step one with the white wires from the fan, light, and wall.

, Your home's ground wire should be green or exposed copper. Attach it to the green grounding screw and tighten the screw with a screwdriver., Tuck the wires into place and replace the cover. Following the instructions in the hood's manual, attach the fan and light bulbs, and slide the filter into place., Go to the circuit breaker or fuse box and restore the power supply.

, Turn on the lights and the fan to make sure they are operational. You should also go outside while the fan is running to make sure air is flowing freely through the duct.Damp or greasy air that is not pulled through the duct may cause damage to your walls.

Deep-clean your stove regularly.",How to Clean an Electric Stove Top," Burners should be cool to the touch. Use a clean, lint-free cloth, like an old t-shirt or dishtowel. Thoroughly dampen it with water. Wring out any excess moisture. Lightly wipe all surfaces of the stovetop, including the tops and sides of coil burners.In some cases, you may only have a flat stovetop without coiled burners, like a glass topped stove. Generally, these stoves are simply wiped clean with a suitable cleaning agent, like window cleaner.Lint left behind on coil burners will smoke unpleasantly when you turn these on later. For this reason, only use lint free cloths to clean your electric stove.;
, This is a self-cleaning measure designed into electric stoves. The high heat will burn off much of the remaining dirtiness on the coiled burner. However, in many cases, this feature only reduces dirtiness. A thorough cleaning is required for heavy dirtiness or stubborn buildup.


This technique will likely cause smoke to rise from the burners. This is natural. Prevent your smoke detector from going off by turning on a stovetop fan or opening a window.
When the smoke stops rising from your burners, they have burned off what they can. Turn off the burners at this point.
Refrain from touching the burners with your bare hands shortly after turning them off. Doing so could result in burns., Allow the burners to cool fully before handling them. Most coil burners can be removed by tugging the burner in the opposite direction of its connection to the stove and lifting. Some stoves may have extra fasteners. Consult your user manual if you have difficulty removing your stove’s burners.If you don’t have the manual for your stove, look up its make and model number online. Most appliance manuals can be found in digital format online., Hold coil burners so the end that connects to the stove and supplies the coil with electricity does not get wet. Rinse your rag in warm water and wring out excess moisture. Apply dish soap to the rag and use it to scrub the coil burners.


For especially dirty burners, you may need to “rinse” surfaces while cleaning. Wipe dirty burner surfaces down with a separate clean, lint-free, water dampened dishrag.

, In a small bowl or cup, combine a half cup (118 ml) of baking soda and 3 or 4 tbsp (44.4 or 59 ml) of water. This will make a thick paste. Apply this paste to dirty burners for about 20 minutes.


When the baking soda paste is through, remove it by wiping it away with a damp, clean, lint-free cloth. Rinse this cloth often to remove paste from it.
This baking soda cleaning paste can be used to clean much of the stove. For example, you might want to save some to clean the areas beneath burners., Use a clean dishrag, warm water, and a little bit of liquid dish soap to wipe down these areas. If any baking soda paste remains, this can be used as a soap substitute. Lightly scrub dirty areas with a cleaning pad. Avoid getting the socket (connecting) end of the burner wet.In some cases, you may need a cooktop scraper to remove stuck-on gunk. These are usually made of a hard plastic to prevent scratches to your stovetop., Wipe all surfaces of your stovetop and coil burners with a dry, clean, lint-free dishtowel. Reinsert your burners into their positions on the stove. Run each burner to verify you’ve installed each one correctly, then use your clean stovetop as you please., The sunken area beneath coil burners is called the drip pan. This part of the stove tends to get dirty quickly. Save yourself time and effort spent cleaning by using drip pan liners, which are available at most supermarkets and grocery stores.


Save money by making your own drip pan liners out of aluminum foil. Layer the bottom of your drip pan with the foil and discard the foil when it becomes dirty., Every time the cooktop cools, you should wipe it with a clean, lint-free cloth. This will keep your stove looking neat and well maintained. It also helps to prevent heavy buildup that can be time-consuming to remove.


Set a time every day you can make it a habit to lightly clean the stove. This will make it easier for you to remember to do regularly., Even cleaning messes as they occur, over time, spills and spatter will build up on the surfaces of your stovetop. Keeping up with your day to day light cleaning, however, should make a once a month deep-cleaning fast and relatively easy."

Rinse rice before cooking.,
Adjust cooking times to fit your cooker.,
Don't overfill your slow cooker.,
Don’t underfill it, either.,
Use slow cooker liners.",How to Reduce Slow Cooker Messes1," Making rice is a popular use for slow cookers, but can also be one of the more annoying clean-up jobs since rice is prone to sticking. To prevent this, rinse it in a strainer under clean running water. Keep your eye on the runoff and continue rinsing until the draining water turns from milky white to clear.For best results, go with rice that’s marketed as “easy to cook.”;
, Expect most slow cookers to have the same settings (usually “low” and “high”). At the same time, be aware that there is no standard for what these settings actually mean. Anticipate different cooking times and temperatures between any two models. Adjust your recipe’s instructions accordingly to avoid overcooking and burning foods.Unfortunately, this may require some experimentation whenever you try a new recipe.

, Never fill a slow cooker all the way up to the brim. Doing so may cause foods to boil or spill over, even when cooking at low settings. At most, only fill it two-thirds of the way when adding ingredients at the start., Recognize that a slow cooker works by distributing heat evenly. This means that putting too few ingredients inside will cause them to absorb more heat than intended and potentially burn. Whatever you’re cooking, add enough portions to fill the cooker at least halfway to ensure that there’s enough food to absorb heat as intended., Make life easier when trying a new recipe or cooking one that has proven to stick to the inside of your cooker. Insert a plastic liner specifically designed for slow cookers before adding ingredients. Then simply remove it after dishing out your meal for a hassle-free clean-up.Some plastics contain bisphenol A (otherwise known as BPAs), which can be transferred to food during cooking and cause health problems. Before purchasing any brand of slow cooker liners, research whether or not their plastic contains BPAs.

This helps prevent scratching and other damage., Place some vinegar in a spray bottle. Liberally spritz the surface of the stove with vinegar. Use a paper towel or a very soft cloth to wipe down the stove, catching any obvious dirt and debris in your hands.Remember the directions in your owner's manual. If you are not supposed to use vinegar on your stove, choose another mild cleanser.

, Most stainless steel stoves can be cleaned with mild dishwashing detergent. Mix a teaspoon of dish detergent into a quart of hot water. It is not necessary to use bottled or distilled water. Tap water can easily be used on stainless steel.Make sure to wear gloves to protect your hands from hot water.

Fully cook and heat food.,
Line a cardboard box or plastic bin with towels.,
Cover with aluminum foil.",How to Transport Your Slow Cooker1," Before you transport your favorite slow cooked meal to a dinner party or event, make sure that you fully cook and heat the food. To ensure that food does not spoil during transport, it is best to make sure the food is hot and ready to serve. Food should not dip below a temperature of 165 degrees fahrenheit (74 degrees celsius).Bring a thermometer so that you can check the temperature of the food throughout transportation and before serving.;
, In order to keep the slow cooker warm during transport, you should line a cardboard box or plastic bin with towels. This will help to insulate the slow cooker. It will also provide extra padding and help prevent the slow cooker from shifting and spilling while being transported., Another way to keep your food warm is by covering the slow cooker with aluminum foil. This can provide added insulation to the slow cooker and will also help to prevent the contents from slopping while in motion.


Pace aluminum foil over the lid and down the sides of the slow cooker.

Refer to your owner’s manual first.,
Clean the outside.,
Wash handles and knobs seperately, if needed.,
Check the bottom.,
Hand- or machine-wash the insert.,
Check the interior, too.",How to Reduce Slow Cooker Messes2," Expect slow cookers to be made from a range of materials. Be aware that not all cleaning methods are suitable for each type. Always read your owner’s manual before cleaning and check if it advises against certain cleaners or materials., First, unplug the cooker to avoid electrical shock or fire. Moisten a cloth in warm water and wring it out. Scrub the exterior and wipe dry. If water alone doesn’t work, add a few drops of mild dish detergent to warm water and try again.


Stronger cleaners are generally advised against since they may ruin the exterior’s finish and/or damage parts.
Adding baking soda to the water/soap mixture will help get rid of any particularly stubborn bits or stains.

, If any spills have dribbled down into the handles and/or knobs, detach them as directed in your owner’s manual. Wash each with warm water (or warm water with mild dish detergent). Dry thoroughly before reattaching.Don’t forget to inspect their connection points before reattaching. If food has spilled into them, clean the connection points with your dampened cloth if it’s safe to do so. Otherwise, use a toothpick or dry brush to pick or scrape off foods.

, If food has run all the way down the cooker’s sides, look underneath. Usually the electrical parts are housed here, so only clean with a damp cloth if the area in question is solid, with no direct access to internal parts. For any areas with slits or holes, use a dry brush or toothpick to remove crud from them., Remove the stoneware insert from the cooker. Wash in the sink with a sponge, warm water, and mild dish detergent. Or feel free to stick it in the dishwasher for its next cycle if the owner’s manual states that it’s safe to do so., Once the insert is removed, inspect the cooker’s interior casing in case any food seeped in during spills. If so, moisten and wring out a clean cloth with plain warm water and scrub the interior. Dry immediately to prevent rust and other damage to internal parts."
"
Heat water in the cooker before cleaning.,
Add dish soap and baking soda for really tough messes.,
Loosen tough spots in the interior casing with ammonia.",How to Reduce Slow Cooker Messes3," If the stoneware insert of your cooker has a lot of burnt food or other hard-to-clean residue, fill the stoneware insert with water after dishing out your meal. Set the heat to low and let the water heat for three or four hours (or even more if needed). Wait for it to loosen the residue for an easier clean-up., If heated water alone wasn’t enough to loosen residue, add a few drops of mild dish detergent and/or three or four tablespoons of baking soda. Heat on low as before and try cleaning it again after a few hours., If any spills have caused major caked-on residue in the cooker’s internal casing, place a small bowl or glass inside and fill it with ammonia. Cover the cooker with its lid and let the ammonia sit overnight so its fumes can loosen the caked-on bits. Then scrub the inside again with a moistened cloth.Be careful not to spill any ammonia when filling the bowl or glass.

Wipe down your appliances in the direction of the grain.,
Apply a special cleaner for harsh stains.,
Rinse and dry your stove.,
Shine with oil.",How to Clean a Stainless Steel Stove2," Get a washcloth slightly damp and then wipe down your stove. Start at the top of your stove and work your way downwards as you clean. Remember to clean in the direction of the grain. Vertical grains should be wiped down vertically and horizontal grains should be wiped down horizontally., After giving your stone an initial cleaning with your detergent solution, look for any harsh stains. If there is any splattered food or grease on your stove, use a special cleaner to remove it.Cleaners containing oxalic acid are usually the best course of action for a stainless steel stove. However, you should double check your owner's manual to make sure such cleaners are safe for your stove.
When applying a cleaner on dirt and grease stains, remember to move your rag in the direction of the grain.

, After applying cleaners, rinse your stove off completely. Dampen a clean wash cloth with hot water. Run it over the stove, moving in the direction of the grain, until the water runs clear. Immediately dry your stove with a paper towel or cloth.It's very important to use hot water only to rinse off a stainless steel stove.

, To give your stove a nice shine after cleaning, dip a soft cloth in a small amount of mineral oil such as olive oil. Moving in the direction of the grain, give your stove a quick polishing. This will remove any streaks from the cleaning process and leave your stove shiny."
"
Avoid abrasive brushes or cleaners.,
Do not use any kind of bleach.,
Do not clean your stove when it's hot.",How to Clean a Stainless Steel Stove3," Only use paper towel and soft cloths on a stainless steel stove. Harsh, abrasive brushes, like steel wool, will very easily scratch stainless steel., Bleach of any kind should never be used on stainless steel. Chloride products and oven cleaners often contain bleach, which can seriously damage stainless steel., If you just cooked on your stove, avoid cleaning it until it cools down. Wait until your stove is cool to the touch before applying a cleaner."
"
Secure the lid of the slow cooker.,
Place the slow cooker in a cardboard box or plastic bin.,
Consider purchasing a slow cooker carrier.,
Position securely on the ground of your vehicle.",How to Transport Your Slow Cooker2," When transporting a slow cooker it is common for the contents to spill. This is especially true if you are transporting soup or other liquids. In order to prevent spills, secure the lid to the slow cooker. This can be done in a number of different ways:


Purchase a slow cooker that has a clamp on lid making it easy to seal the contents during transit.Secure the lid using painters tape. Simply tape the lid to the sides of the crockpot. Do this on all four sides.Use elastic bands to secure the lid. Wrap an elastic band around the handle of the slow cooker and then loop it around the handle on the lid. Do the same thing with the handle on the other side of slow cooker., In order to transport the slow cooker and keep the contents secure, place it carefully in a snug cardboard box or plastic bin. Use a box or bin that is only slightly larger than your slow cooker. The tighter the box the better.Fill in any gaps with extra tea towels.

, You can also purchase an insulated slow cooker carrier designed to transport slow cookers. There are a variety of different options available with easy-to-carry handles. Search online to find a carrier that fits the dimensions of your slow cooker., Once you have placed the slow cooker securely in a carrier or bin, position it in a safe place in your vehicle. For example, you could place the slow cooker on the floor between the feet of a passenger. This will prevent the slow cooker from shifting and moving while the vehicle is in motion.Do not put the slow cooker on a seat. The slow cooker could easily topple off of the seat spilling the contents all over the vehicle.

"
"
Coil and secure the electrical cord.,
Pack any necessary utensils.,
Take an extension cord.",How to Transport Your Slow Cooker3," Before transporting your slow cooker, you should also consider safety. Always coil and secure the electrical cord so that you do not trip over it while transporting. For instance, you can roll up the cord and secure it with a twist tie or rubber band., Aside from transporting the slow cooker, you may also need to transport utensils, such as a ladle or serving spoon, as well as plates, napkins and bowls. If you are moving the slow cooker in a plastic bin or cardboard box, you could also put the extra utensils and plates in the box as well.

, Depending on where you are headed, you may want to have an extension cord with you so that you are able to plug in your slow cooker once you arrive at the event. For instance, if you are transporting chili in your slow cooker to attend a football tailgate, you should also bring an extension cord with you. This way you will be able to reach the electrical outlet that may be quite some distance from the food table.

Use a 1 liter soda bottle.,
Use a 1 gallon soda bottle.,
Use a mason jar.,
Use a fish tank.",How to Make a Mini Greenhouse1," You can use a simple 1 liter plastic bottle to make a variety of greenhouses. These are ideal for growing a single, short, shallow-rooted plant. Examples would include an orchid, a small fern, or a cactus. Look for bottles in a variety of shapes, as this can give you more customization options.


To make a complex soda bottle greenhouse, begin with two bottles. One should be slightly wider than the other if possible. Carefully cut the top off of the thinner bottle, just past the point where it curves to form the tube section. Cut as straight and clean as possible.
Use hot glue to attach the opening of the bottle top you just cut to the bottom of the remainder of the bottle. This will form a vase-like base for your mini greenhouse. Smooth any rough edges so that it sits evenly on a table.
Next, make the lid for the greenhouse by cutting the top off of the wider bottle, maybe a centimeter below where the top curves into the tube section. The top of this bottle then becomes a lid for the thinner bottle to which you glued the base.
If using this style, be sure to put the proper growing materials at the bottom of your greenhouse. This style does not have drainage and will have to be treated more like a terrarium.
A simpler method would be to cut the bottom from a 1 liter bottle and simply push the upper portion into the dirt or over a small pot but this will not look as nice as the method described above.;
, You can use a 1 gallon bottle in much the same way as the 1 liter bottle. It will, however, need to be reasonably tube-like in shape (if going over a pot or making a vase structure). This bottle can accommodate up to three small plants of the same varieties used with the 1 liter jars.


You can also use this bottle to create a base which drains, by puncturing the bottom and cutting 1” vertical lines into the bottom edge of the lid. Be sure to leave at least 1” of jar above the desired dirt line when cutting for the lid. This will keep the dirt from falling out when the bottle is opened.

, If you want to grow very small plants, you can use a lidded mason jar to create a small terrarium. Mason jars come in a variety of sizes and should be chosen appropriate to the size of the plant you intend to grow. Simply fill it with growing materials appropriate to a terrarium and you will have a beautiful tiny greenhouse.

, You can use a fish tank to make either a mini greenhouse or a terrarium. Either a square or rectangular tank can be used or you can use a fishbowl. It will depend on the size and number of the plants you intend to grow.


A small plant in a bed can simply be covered with an upside-down, wide opening fishbowl.
A right-side up fishbowl can be used like a terrarium, either covered with plastic or left open at the top.
A large tank can be treated as a terrarium with no drainage, holes can be drilled in the bottom to provide drainage, or (if it has a glass bottom) it can be flipped upside-down to form a greenhouse. If left right-side up, a lid will need to be created from plastic wrap or using the wood-frame method described below.

Keep the tray on a warm windowsill.,
Transplant to larger containers.,
Adjust pH and calcium levels.,
Fertilize regularly.,

Harvest as late as possible.",How to Grow Tomatoes in a Greenhouse," Tomatoes grow best at daytime temperatures of 70 to 80º F (21–27º C), and nighttime temperatures of 60–65º F (16–18º C).Make sure you can maintain these temperatures in your greenhouse for several months before you plant.


Ideally, bring temperatures to the lower end of this range on overcast days, and raise them to the upper end (or even slightly higher) during clear, sunny days.
You'll also need to keep humidity below 90% to prevent excessive leaf mold. Ventilate regularly to bring fresh, dry air into the greenhouse, especially on cool, cloudy mornings.;
, There are thousands of tomato varieties, so for detailed information it's best to talk to local growers. There are a few guidelines and tips that apply to all regions, however:


Tomatoes marketed as greenhouse varieties are more tolerant of greenhouse conditions.
The letters VFNT and A after the name mean the variety is resistant to disease.""Indeterminate"" tomatoes grow and produce fruit indefinitely, taking advantage of the longer growing season inside a greenhouse. If you're short on space, plant a ""determinate"" variety, which stops at a certain height.

, Tomatoes can grow in any well-draining material. You can use your preferred soil-less mix, or one of these options:


Perlite bags or rock wool slabs are the cheapest options in many areas.Some growers prefer a 1:1 mix of sphagnum peat moss and vermiculite.Purchase sterile soil mix or make your own. Never use soil or compost from your garden without sterilizing. Choose this option if you do not want to install an irrigation system.

, Most growers install drip tubing to deliver water to each plant. A fertilizer injector attached to the tubing can automate fertilizing as well.Tomatoes are also easy to grow in a hydroponics system. See this article for detailed instructions.

, Wash the tray thoroughly with soap and water to disinfect it. Fill the tray with any of the potting mixes described above.


If you use soil, make sure it is sterile.
If you use a soil-less mix, you'll also need a seedling nutrient solution (see below).

, Poke a ¼ inch (6 mm) hole into each compartment of the starting tray. Drop a single seed into each hole. Cover lightly with the potting mix.

Plant about 10-15% more seeds than you plan on growing, so you can discard the least healthy seedlings.

, Use plain water for soil, or seedling nutrient solution for soil-less mixes. Either way, water until the mixture is just damp enough to press into a clump, with only a few drops squeezed out.Water regularly to keep the mix damp.A 5:2:5 nutrient solution that contains calcium and magnesium is ideal. Dilute the solution according to label instructions.

, Do not bring the seeds into the greenhouse until they've sprouted, so you can check for disease and pests. Provide plenty of sunlight and keep the temperature at 75–80º F (24–27º C) during the day.To keep temperatures under control, you may want to start the tray in partial sun. Move to full sun once all seedlings have sprouted.This usually takes 5 to 12 days.

, Transplant the seedlings to small pots in the greenhouse about two weeks after they emerge.After six to eight weeks, or once seedlings are 4-6 inches (10–15 cm) tall, transplant them to larger pots or bags. A typical plant needs roughly ½ to 1 cubic foot of potting material (3.7–7.5 gallons, or 14–28 liters).Even smaller varieties may produce less fruit if grown in smaller pots.If you see any insects, mold, or disease spots on a plant, do not bring any of them to the greenhouse.
Give each plant about 4 square feet (0.37 m2) of floor space.Planting too close together can reduce airflow and encourage disease.

, Before the final transplant, you may want to check soil pH, which ideally falls between 5.8 and 6.8.If your soil is too acidic, add about 1 tsp (5 mL) hydrated lime for each gallon (3.8 L) of potting mix. Besides raising the pH, this adds calcium that can prevent blossom rot later on.If your pH is fine, mix in gypsum or calcium sulfate instead to add calcium without changing the pH.Alternatively, just choose a fertilizer that contains calcium and apply every week or two.
In a hydroponics setup, you can supply calcium by injecting calcium nitrate into the irrigation feed. This requires a second injector, as calcium nitrate cannot be stored with your main fertilizer., Start fertilizing the day you transplant the tomatoes into their final pot. Use a complete fertilizer high in nitrogen (N) and potassium (K), such as a 15-5-15 or 5-2-5.Dilute and apply the fertilizer according to label instructions.


Reduce fertilizer as the final fruits ripen. Do not fertilize in late autumn or winter, unless using artificial grow lights and reliable heaters., Once a week, pinch off ""suckers,"" or side shoots that emerge where a leaf meets the main stem. Leave only the main bud at the top of the steam, plus the highest sucker below it. This trains the plant to grow upward instead of wide.








If the top of your plant is damaged, the top sucker can become the new main stem.

, Tie the plants loosely to stakes with twine to keep them upright as they grow. Use plastic garden clips where necessary to secure the twine.









In peak growing season, the plant will grow up to 6 in (15 cm) per week and will need tying each week.
Commercial operations save on materials by stringing a wire over each row, with a support post every 20 ft (6m). Wrap the twine around each plant and fasten to the overhead wire.For smaller home gardens, you can place a tomato cage over each plant when it is small. These don't require as much maintenance as staking.

, Unlike many plants, a tomato can pollinate itself — but it needs some help. The pollen in a tomato flower is trapped inside a tube, and must be released through vibration. Since most greenhouses lack bees or high wind, you'll need to act as the pollinator once flowers are fully open:








For best results, buy an electric plant vibrator. Touch the vibrator against each flower stalk every other day, at any time between 10am and 2pm. (An electric toothbrush is another, less effective option.)
Alternatively, you can place fans in the greenhouse and direct the airflow over your plants to distribute the pollen.
Large operations should consider keeping their own bees.
Hand out cotton swabs to your children or family members and have them rub the cotton swabs in the flowers to distribute pollen.

, Apart from weekly sucker removal, pruning is not necessary until the plant starts to fruit:









Once fruit starts to grow, thin each cluster down to four or five fruits, removing the smallest or most misshapen. Very large fruits or winter conditions may require going down to three per cluster. Varieties with small fruits may not need any thinning.As the fruit matures, snap off older leaves from the lower clusters. This helps improve air circulation., The longer the tomatoes stay on the vine, the fuller and redder they become.Commercial growers typically pick a little early, when the fruit is 60–90% red, to allow for time in shipping."

String up a clothesline between two bare trees, tightly, about head-high.,
Drape a clear plastic sheet over the clothesline.,
Spread out the sides like an old army pup-tent and fasten them to the ground with rocks or bricks.,
Tape the flaps together on North end only.,
On the inside, some old warehouse pallets or fruit crates are great for keeping your potted plants off the cold ground.,
To form a super-insulated greenhouse, string up another clothesline about 6–12 inches (15.2–30.5 cm) above the first one.",How to Make a Plastic Sheet Greenhouse,";
, A standard 9'x12' size works okay, but for more space the bigger the better. Clip it with clothes pins to keep it in place.

, You can cover the air gaps by piling dirt on top.

, The south end -- the entrance -- will be fastened by clothespins.

, Alternatively, you could add the heated made from clay pots which is powered by a single tinned candle that expires on it's own when the wax is gone to add a bit of heat.

, Drape 2 larger drop-clothes over that and fasten like the first one. This will create a double-walled greenhouse with an insulative layer of air between. It will provide added protection to plants.

Get frames.,
Form the main structure.,
Form the roof.,
Fill and attach the roof.,
Finish.",How to Make a Mini Greenhouse2," You will need eight picture frames with glass or glass equivalent. The sizes and numbers you will need will be: four 5"" x 7""s, two 8"" x 10""s, and two 11"" x 14""s. Sand the frames to remove any unwanted texture and paint. Frames like these can be purchased at a local drug or grocery store, at an art store, at a camera shop, or online from a variety of sources. You can also sometimes find used ones cheaply at thrift stores like Goodwill.

, Form the main body of the greenhouse by aligning a 11”x14” frame with the 8”x10” frame so that the 11” and 10” sides touch, the back side of the 10” frame pressed against the outer edge of the 11” frame.


Attach the frames together by drilling a small hole through the inside edge of the larger frame and half-way into the smaller frame. Then use a screw of a size corresponding to the hole you drilled to join the frames securely.
Continue joining the frames until you have a rectangle formed by the four largest frames (both 11”x14” frames and bother 8”x10” frames).

, Form the roof of the greenhouse by joining together the four smaller, 5”x7” frames. They will be attached together in twos and then joined to form a triangle roof. A hinge will be attached to allow you to open the greenhouse to water the plants inside.


Place two of the 5”x7” frames side-by-side, so that the short ends are touching. Then join them together by screwing 2” mending plates at each end of the joined edge. Drilling pilot holes first will make this easier. Repeat process with the other two 5”x7” frames.
Join the smaller frame structures to each other, by placing them at a 90° angle along the long edge and screwing in a 90° angle brace to make them secure.

, You will want to attach the roof to the rest of the greenhouse structure in such a way that you can get inside easily. You may be able to simply place it on top but joining it to the rest of the frame will be more secure. Be sure to eliminate large gaps by finding a filler for the ends of the roof.


Join the roof to the structure by attaching two 1” utility hinges, evenly spaced, along the edges to be joined.
Fill the triangular gap with material cut from the backing of the larger frame, plywood, foam, or another other material you think appropriate. Plywood or foam would need to be accordingly thick, to make them easier to attach to the frame. Whatever material you choose, simply trace the inside of the triangular end (if using plywood or foam) or the outside edge (if using the backing of the frame) and glue into place. The plywood can be nailed if desired.

, Finish the frame with whatever paint and decoration you desire and then reattach the glass to the frames. After this, feel free to fill your greenhouse with the appropriate plants.


Use wood paint and be sure to do all of your painting before replacing the glass.
Replace the glass from the inside of the greenhouse and attach it by hot gluing the corners. Once the glass is in, seal all the edges with more hot glue. You can even use plastic instead of glass frame.

"
"
Get PVC pipe and joints.,
Connect wall pipes.,
Connect roof pipes.,
Place on the bed.,
Cover.",How to Make a Mini Greenhouse3," Since this greenhouse is modular and the size is completely up to you, the number and lengths of the necessary pipes will vary to a certain degree. You will need to measure the dimensions that you want and determine the amount of pipe that you need from that. Try to break up the larger structure into 2’ sections. This will give your greenhouse greater stability and strength.
Use relatively thin PVC pipe, no more than 1.5” wide. A good size to use would be closer to ¾”.
Also, be sure that your joints and PVC pipe are sized so that they will fit together. This should be labeled, but you can test in the hardware store to be sure or you can ask a hardware store employee for help and advice.

, You will form the base and the walls together, out of connected sections of pipe. Begin by connecting vertical pipe sections at two foot intervals to horizontal pipe sections with T pipe joints. Form corners in the horizontal bottom section by attaching a T joint to an elbow joint with a very small section of pipe.


When you are done, you should have a horizontal rectangle or square base with posts coming up from the T joints at regular intervals. The corner posts should come from the the last T joint on the long sides, with the elbow joints and short side of the base protruding out from the “wall”.

, Next, you will need to connect the wall pipes to the roof pipes and form a roof. It is important that the roof not be flat across, as this will diminish the amount of light which can get through, as well as cause rain and snow to build up on top of your structure.


Form the central roof structure by creating a line of PVC pipe identical to one long side of the base. The pieces should be connected with four-way joints at the same intervals as your wall posts, except for the ends which will be capped in T joints. From the T joints and four-way joints, place short sections of pipe and cap them in 45° joints.
Next, place 45° joints at the top of each of your wall posts. After that you will need to measure how much pipe you need to join the 45° joints of the wall to the 45° joints of the central roof structure. Cut this pipe once measured and fit it between each of the 45° joints.

, Place the greenhouse on the raised or ground bed that you want to cover. You can attach it to the ground with stakes and ties or to a raised bed with a conduit anchor but be sure to only attach one long side. This will allow you to lift the structure to water and care for your plants.

, The final step will be to cover the structure with plastic or cloth, depending on why you need the cover to begin with. If using sheet plastic, use thin clear plastic and cover the whole structure with one large sheet if possible. Whatever material you use, wrap the structure and then secure with tape (duct or packaging). You’re done!

Assess your budget.,
Choose between a charcoal filter and an aluminum filter.,
Evaluate your aesthetic preferences.,
Evaluate your desired airflow rate.,
Assess the noise level of the ductless range hood.",How to Choose Ductless Range Hoods," Your budget will constrain the level of functionality and appearance you can expect from a range hood. The primary budgetary factor of a range hood is usually its aesthetic. Slick, contemporary stainless steel hoods typically sell for a much higher price than other models. Allocate your range hood budget based on the money spent on your other appliances. You may not want to pair a professional-grade, stainless steel range with a cheap plastic hood, for example.;
, Ductless range hoods either pass air through a charcoal or aluminum mesh filter. Charcoal filters perform far better in removing all manner of particulates, oils, and odors. However, they cannot easily be cleaned and must be periodically replaced. Aluminum mesh filters do not filter oils or odors very well, but they can be easily washed in soap and water.


The type of cooking you do should dictate which type of filter you buy. If you cook frequently, especially using oils at high temperatures, a charcoal filter is best. If you cook infrequently or usually cook using low-grease methods like boiling or poaching, an aluminum filter will be adequate.

, Ductless range hoods, just like their ducted counterparts, come in a variety of different styles. You can find them in stainless steel, white, black, and colored finishes. If you are attempting to match the hood to your existing range, check the manufacturer's website to see if they produce a matching model.

, The rate at which range hoods cycle air is usually measured in cubic feet per minute, or CFM. Your ideal CFM rating will depend on your kitchen size, but this rating is much more important for ducted hoods that actually exhaust air. The true effectiveness of a ductless range hood will be largely determined by its filter quality, not how much air it moves. Nevertheless, a higher CFM rating indicates a more powerful hood.

, All range hoods generate noise, as they must utilize powerful fans to move the air. This noise level is generally reported in ""sones,"" a unit of perceived loudness. The loudest sone rating appropriate for home use is about 4. Higher sone numbers indicate louder levels of volume.

This will also help minimize the expenses of the other supplies and materials needed.;
, An insulated greenhouse should be appropriate for cold climate areas. This will help provide the needed warmth and heat for your plants. For warm places, a greenhouse that has a shade control is advisable.

, You can create an environment that would be appropriate for the types of plants that will grow in the greenhouse.

, The location of the greenhouse should be built were there is enough sunlight. You may choose a solar greenhouse for vegetables and exotic fruit bearing plants if you want your greenhouse to be situated on the east-west part where it is more exposed to sunlight.

, The most advisable shades are the expensive glass made coverings and fiberglass. They provide more durability and they do not deteriorate quickly compared to plastic coverings. A greenhouse covered with glass or fiberglass allows more humidity and warmth.You can also use plastic polythene sheets.

, The foundations can be concrete for a more secured greenhouse. Others prefer the less expensive lightweight foundation where they use improvised materials such as railroad ties, which they can easily attach to the ground. It all depends on how much you are willing to spend on the structure of the greenhouse.

, You can add benches or materials that will be used for comfort every time you want to relax in the greenhouse. You can add many accessories to the place like automatic watering systems, heating systems, ventilation system and other automatic equipments that are effective in maintaining the plants.

, They prevent and control the spread of the bad bugs in a greenhouse. If you ever find insects on a plant, you can isolate the plant and place the plant outside the greenhouse so that the insects would not harm the other plants.

, You may place a tool rack nearer to the potting place so that it would be easier for you to transfer the soil from the pot of the plants. You can also place buckets and tool holders to accommodate the other equipment when they are not in use.

Prepare greenhouse orchids for new seasonal growth.",How to Grow Orchids in a Greenhouse," If you are installing a new greenhouse, it is preferable to build one that is at least 14 ft (4.3 m) wide by 16-20 ft (4.9-6.1 m) long. This will allow enough space for your orchid collection to grow and will allow space to display your collection with benches and other materials. This will save you money in the long run so that you don’t have to add extensions., You will want your greenhouse to get consistent light with at least 6 hours of sun per day. Don’t install it near trees or buildings that provide a lot of shade. You can easily reduce light with window coverings but it is harder and more expensive to add light. It is great to have one facing north to south so that the sun travels across the whole length of the greenhouse. A greenhouse professional will be able to help you with this.You can install artificial lighting, if needed.. Fluorescent lights are the most economical. You can get ones that are 2 ft (0.61 m) wide by 4 ft (1.2 m) long to provide adequate lighting.
Try using a 50/50 mix of cool white and warm white tubes as bulbs because they are bright and inexpensive. You can get them for around $10.
Gro-Lux tubes more closely resemble the spectrum of light in natural sunlight, but are much more expensive. They can cost around $60.Consider whitewashing the windows of your greenhouse to prevent your orchids from getting sunburnt. Whitewash is a mineral substance that can be painted onto windows. It is often made of a hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide) solution.
Whitewashing adds partial opacity and can also be removed if you no longer want it. It will allow light to enter without being too direct or scorching., Consider using benches that are 30 in (76.2 cm) tall by 33 in (83.8 cm) wide. If placing a bench in the center of the room, you can double this width. Make sure the benches’ material is moisture resistant, such as treated lumber, aluminum, or steel. Make sure air is able to circulate through the top of the benches. This can be accomplished by adding aluminum mesh or redwood/cypress strips. Besides allowing for air circulation, this will also allow adequate drainage.
If you need additional space for your orchids, wall mounts or hanging displays are a good option. They add visual interest by creating varied levels of height. This way you can truly be surrounded by your orchids., Most orchids need temperatures of 60-80 degrees Fahrenheit (15.5-26.6 degrees C) during the day, and 45-65 degrees Fahrenheit (7.2-18.3 degrees C) at night. In order to be a successful greenhouse grower of orchids, these temperatures should be closely maintained. Install a thermometer in your greenhouse to keep track of the temperature.Although it may be possible to get away with slightly higher night temperatures, never exceed the higher day temperatures or the orchids will not cope well.
If you do wish to grow orchids from different climatic zones, try dividing your greenhouse to maintain different temperature levels.
Make sure that you have a heating system if you live in an area that gets colder than 45 degrees Fahrenheit (7.2 degrees C). You can use any kind of heating system, including steam, solar, circulating hot water, or natural gas.On the other hand, if you live in a very warm climate, you will need a cooling system. This usually is not necessary because ventilation is able to regulate temperature on extra warm days., In nature, orchids generally come from areas that have consistent, gentle winds. Ventilation is key to allowing your orchids to thrive. To provide appropriate airflow, use ceiling fans and oscillating fans. Keep the fans clean to avoid spreading disease. Ceiling fans move a high volume of air and allow you to change their speed.Oscillating fans change airflow pattern to cover large areas without drying out your orchids.
Use side and roof vents for increased ventilation. These are manually operated and a simple way to improve airflow., Humidity is absolutely necessary for orchids to grow well. Humidity should be at about 50 to 80 percent. Keeping a larger number of orchids will help increase humidity. If your greenhouse is not humid enough, use a humidifier.If you aren’t sure about the humidity levels of your greenhouse, buy a hygrometer from a home improvement store to test your levels and adjust your humidity accordingly.

, Consider using a clear pot to monitor root progress. Three gallon pots work best to allow adequate space for the roots to grow. Make sure the pot has drainage holes so that excess water and mineral buildup can escape.Choose an orchid pot, which can be found with the terracotta pots at garden shops.

, Use a material such as moss, bark, coconut fiber, sifted perlite, granular charcoal, cork, or rockwool. The purpose of the potting medium is to hold up the plant. Soil should not be used because it can damage orchids. Buy an orchid potting medium instead at your local gardening store., Place the orchid on top of the potting medium and fill the rest of the pot with potting medium. Pack firmly around the orchid to keep it in place. The same method works for planting seeds or replanting already-grown orchids., Certain types of orchids are easier to grow. Consider starting out growing Cattleyas, Phalaenopsis, Paphiopedilums, and Cymbidiums. They are beautiful and among the least finicky.Cattleyas are the standard orchid that most people are familiar with. They like average temperatures around 65-78 degrees Fahrenheit (18.3-25.5 degrees C) during the day and 55-62 degrees Fahrenheit (12.8-16.6 degrees C) at night. They like a lot of light, so west and south facing windows will give them the best light levels., Leaves are a key indicator of the health of your orchids. If they are not getting adequate light, leaves will likely be dark green and will not flower. Additionally, the distance between the leaves will usually increase. If caught early, leaf damage will not necessarily destroy the plant, but serve as an indicator to change conditions.If your orchids are getting too much light, their leaves will turn a yellow-green or even look reddish. The leaves can even get round sunburn spots if they are overheating.

, When the potting medium is dry, it is time to water your orchids. They should be checked daily. If leaves appear shriveled, this is another sign that they need more water. Be careful not to overwater orchids. They tolerate being dry better than being drenched.To prevent overwatering, make sure your pot has adequate drainage holes.
Make sure there aren’t too many dissolved salts in your water and that its pH level is neutral or slightly lower. Sodium should not be greater than 25 ppm.Quality water is important in caring for your orchids. For best results, mist your orchid daily with bottled, filtered, or distilled water.

, Consider using a water-soluble fertilizer for best results. The type of fertilizer depends on your type of potting medium. Add fertilizer to the water every three of four waterings. The fourth watering should be fertilizer-free to flush the pot and remove excess mineral buildup from roots.For bark, use a high nitrogen fertilizer with a 3-1-1 ratio of nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium. Make sure the nitrogen is urea-free because the orchid is not able to use urea-based nitrogen.
For charcoal-perlite or rock, use a 1-1-1 ratio.

, When the orchid is done blooming, cut the ends of the stems. This will help them to grow in the future. If you aren’t sure whether it is done blooming, it is best to wait because certain kinds of orchids produce a second crop of flowers., You will need to know what climate region your type of orchid comes from in order to replicate the right temperature for them. This makes mixing types of orchids a little tricky, so try to stick with one temperature region. Orchids can be roughly divided into three main climate types: cool, intermediate, and warm.Cool: cool climate orchids are used to minimum winter night temperatures of 45º F (7º C) and a maximum summer's night temperature of 57º F (14º C).

Intermediate: these orchids like a minimum winter night temperature of 50º F (10º C) and a maximum summer's night temperature of 64º F (18º C).

Warm: warm climate orchids like a minimum winter night temperature of 57º F (14º C) and a maximum summer's night temperature of 72º F (22º C)., The potting medium will break down during this time which will cause the roots to be restricted. Remove the orchid from the pot and remove all potting material from the orchid and root system, as well as any dead roots. Fill your pot halfway with a potting medium, add the plant, and cover with more potting medium. Press the potting medium down firmly so that the plant is securely supported.f the plant still fits comfortably in the same pot, you can reuse it.
If your orchid has outgrown its pot, it is time to transfer to a larger pot. Try the next size up, but don't go too large or the potting medium will dry too slowly., At the end of the flowering season, orchids go into a resting period during winter/cooler weather months. Keep a resting orchid in full light, dry and un-misted until the first growth shows in spring. Follow any instructions as given for individual orchids as well, which may differ depending on where they have been sourced from.

Deal with damp-off.,
Beware botrytis.,
Remove the rust.,
Vanquish the virus.,
Banish blossom end rot.,
Master the mildew.,
Scare away the sooty mould.",How to Identify Glasshouse Diseases," Damp-off or damping-off is a fungal disease that attacks seedlings. The disease attacks at the soil level of the seedling, causing it to collapse. The reality of glasshouse growing is that an almost perfect environment is created for this fungus, especially when the glasshouse is damp and seedlings are overcrowded. To reduce the chances of damp-off, ensure that the glasshouse is well ventilated and kept at a constant temperature. Water carefully, only when needed and keep away from other plants that might need more watering. Look at your soil also; you might need to replace old soil with fresh soil, or even with sterilised soil until the problem passes. It is a good idea to thin out seedlings as soon as possible, transplanting some to new trays to make enough room for all.;
, Botrytis is nice for the grapes that make sweet dessert wine but it's a killer fungal disease that can attack a wide variety of plants in a glasshouse. It looks like grey mould and turns leaves, stems and fruits black. Botrytis likes cool and damp temperatures so it is important to maintain a temperature over 13ºC in your glasshouse, as well as ensuring good ventilation. It is also important not to cram plants too closely together - allow for space between pots to ensure adequate air circulation. In order to prevent further infection, it is essential to destroy plants that have been attacked by botrytis.

, Rust usually appears on blooming plants in the form of orange-brown spots on the leaves. The rust continues to develop into brown capsules of dust-like material. In the context of a glasshouse, keep an eye out for rust on chrysanthemums, carnations and gerberas (rust is white on gerberas).

, Viral diseases in plants are as many and varied as they are in human beings. Given the many possibilities, the term ""viral disease"" covers a wide range of possible diseases that do not have bacterial or fungal origins. Symptoms of viral disease in glasshouse plants include blotches, yellowish mottling, streaks and distorted shapes. Plants suffering from viral attack will often be stunted. Viruses tend to be transferred from one plant to another via sap-sucking insects and poorly cleaned gardening equipment, such as pruning tools. Plants that are attacked by viral disease must be completely removed from the glasshouse environment and destroyed by burning. Clean all of your gardening tools in hot, soapy water and dry hygienically. Always keep tools cleaned between use. It is also important to attend to any insects that might be spreading the disease.

, This disease occurs in glasshouse tomatoes. Look for such symptoms as a leathery scar or rot on the blossom end of tomato fruits. The cause for this is usually a sudden change in the temperature of the soil moisture and impacts rapidly growing plants hit by high, dry temperatures the most; another cause is a lack of calcium. Remove infected fruits.

, Mildew is a very commonplace plant problem affecting both glasshouse and indoor plants. Mildew arises from a group of fungal diseases and thrives in stagnant air. You will see grey or white fuzzy patches on plants if you have a mildew problem. To improve things, increase the ventilation to get the air circulating more freely and increase the temperature inside the glasshouse. Remove affected plants for recovery; discard if recovery does not seem possible.

, This fungal disease is probably the most common glasshouse disease invader but it can be a little deceptive in its symptoms. Leaves turn black rather than fuzzy as with mildew. Sooty mould usually only forms on plants that have been attacked by sap-sucking insects (aphids, scale, white fly) because the mould grows on the honey-dew they leave behind. Remove the sap-sucking insects using an organic spray.

Start with a fridge that's new, or one that's been defrosted.,
Set the temperature control to the highest/warmest value that will still safely preserve your fresh and frozen food.,
Keep the food section and, especially, the freezer section as full as possible, leaving very few air spaces.,
Open the fridge door as infrequently as possible.,
Use a small brush or rough sponge to brush or rub off some of the ice crystals.",How to Stop a Fridge from Ice Build Up," This will ensure that there's no ice already present.;
, A freezer doesn't need to be set much cooler than 32℉ (0℃) and the fridge section may usually be set as high as 40℉ (5℃) without compromising food quality.

, Less air means that less water in that air will be available to condense and form ice on the freezer coils. At times when you don't have a lot of food taking up space in the freezer, fill up drink containers—milk cartons, plastic orange juice bottles, and similar containers—with some water and let those freeze. The big blocks of ice you make in this way will keep the freezer fuller and colder.

, Don't stand there with the door open and gaze in, looking for something good to eat. Be quick. When you are getting ready to open the fridge to make a sandwich, plan on pulling out everything you need all at one time. Cold cuts, cheese, lettuce. Don't forget that mustard your spouse likes for some unknown reason. If you are going to be baking, take the eggs and the butter and the milk out all at one time. This way you open the door only once.


If your memory fails you, keep a list of what is in the fridge on the fridge door. That way, you'll know what tasty snacks are in there and can make the decision before opening the door, allowing you to grab them quickly. This list can be very useful for shopping if you also note what has been eaten, allowing you to see what you're running out of and need to restock.

, If you see ice starting to build up, physically remove the ice crystals as best you can, but be very careful - you don't want to damage anything (a strong wooden spoon is often a good way to chip at ice without harming the fridge materials). Once loose, use your hand to sweep out the fallen ice crystals and drop them into the kitchen sink to melt.

Regularly check and maintain all heating system components, especially before the winter.

,
Check for and fill any gaps in the greenhouse exterior.,

,
Install roof vents at the ridge line of the greenhouse's ceiling and roof.,
Place small fans at diagonally opposite corners of the greenhouse.",How to Maintain a Greenhouse2,", Use caulk for small gaps and new glass panes for larger holes.

,,,


A frequent problem with greenhouses is that hot air gets trapped near the ceiling, depriving plants at the bottom of warmth. Vents will allow hot air to escape and fresh outdoor air to come in, increasing air circulation.







, Use these constantly during the winter.


The fans serve the same purpose as the roof vents, which you should close during the winter to conserve heat.

Restore power.",How to Remove a Vented Hood Fan,", Many range hoods are powered by a circuit other than the one that supplies an electric range. In the U.S., most electric ranges are 208 or 240 volt types. Most range hoods are 120 volt. One single pole (single width) circuit breaker or fuse will likely provide power for the range hood. 240 volt electric ranges by contrast, will likely be supplied by one two pole (double width) circuit breaker or two cartridge fuses. Turn the fan and light (if equipped) of the range hood on, and have a helper turn circuits off and then back on until the fan and light both shut off. If unable to locate the circuit, turning off the service disconnect or main should shut power off to the entire house., Move the electric range if located under the hood if possible. Gas and propane ranges are often too heavy to move easily or without damaging the floor. Regardless of type, be aware of the length of power cord sets and any flexible gas line. Electric ranges are often provided with cord sets that allow easy insertion and removal from a receptacle. Gas and propane lines however, should not be loosened or disconnected unless done by licensed professional. Many newer gas and propane ovens and ranges also have electrical connections via cord sets, too., This may be a cabinet or other storage area that can provide a great deal of information as to how the hood is secured, powered and ducted (in the case of ducted units only)., Many times, range hoods are held by one or more fasteners that may be hidden behind these objects., One of the covers removed above should provide access to the field wiring compartment. This is where the house power is brought into the range hood and connected to it. Label every wire with a number written on masking tape (or other method), if it is to be reinstalled later. Use a scheme that works best such as color coding, numbers, letters or even a photo taken with a cell phone. Make sure that it is clear enough to understand days or weeks later when it is time to reconnect., Generally, white, black and possibly a green or bare wires from the hood are connected to like colors of wires from a cable or conduit with wirenuts or other connector designed for the purpose. Since the wires have been identified in the previous step, this will not be of concern. Simply unscrew wirenuts or other devices, cut off any wires connected with crimped connectors as close to the connector to leave as much wire as possible., Spin the locknut off any fitting holding the cable or conduit to the wiring compartment. Some fittings clip in instead. If unable to remove the fitting from the hood, it might be possible once the hood is no longer secured to the mounting surface, later., With a helper providing support to the hood, remove all but two fasteners. Leave two fasteners at opposite ends of the hood in place. Merely loosen these two enough to peer into the void between the support surface and the hood to see how the unit is powered, etc. (this is particularly helpful if unable to access the space above the hood, outlined in an earlier step)., Have a helper hold the hood while the final two screws are removed. Most home center variety hoods are not very heavy, but are bulky. Trying to remove fasteners while holding the hood at the same time can be done if no other options are available, but is much easier with a helper. Custom or specialty hoods may be extremely heavy depending on construction materials used and physical size of the unit., The hood will be connected only by the power source cable or conduit (if unable to disconnect in previous steps above) or duct work (if provided). Use the ability to access connectors and fittings above and below to allow the hood to be pulled away from the power source. Check for the presence of screws used to connect the hood to any duct work, and remove them. The hood should now be able to be moved freely., Install an approved electrical switchbox if the range hood will not be used again, otherwise individually cap the ends of the wires securely with wirenuts so that they will not cause shock if contacted while power is on., If the service disconnect or main was turned off, or if the hood is part of another circuit that is needed, the fuse(s) or circuit breaker(s) will need to be returned to the on position. Be sure to safely terminate the wires as described above before performing this step."

Verify the electrical requirements of the dryer.,
Check that any existing dryer receptacle has this same rating and note number of slots (either 3 or 4 slots).

,
Obtain a cord set with the same electrical rating and number of slots as the receptacle.,
Connect the cord set to the terminal block at the rear of the dryer.,
Notice that the center wire (neutral wire) of the cord set goes to the center connector.,
Understand color coding of conductors in the cord set.",How to Wire an Electric Dryer," Most sold for use in the U.S. and Canada require a 240 volt / 30 amp supply.;
,, If purchasing a cord set by matching the electrical rating of the receptacle; remembering the slot pattern will not matter, as they are standardized. Most hardware stores and nearly all home supply centers offer cord sets for electric ranges and dryers with a choice of either 3 or 4 conductors for under $25 or so. These cord sets may look similar, but are not interchangeable due to different electrical ratings. Dryer cord sets are 240V/30A and range cord sets are 240V/40A for use in the U.S. & Canada.

, The cord set selected should have only 3 wires (line 1, line 2 and neutral; no ground wire). The center wire of this cable is the neutral wire and the outer wires are the ""hot"" line 1 and line 2 wires. These hot wires connect to the outer 2 connections the power terminal block of the dryer, does not matter which is which as long as one hot is connected to each of the outer terminal connectors.

, Since in this case the neutral serves as a neutral and a ground connection, a jumper conductor (ground strap) is also connected to the center terminal and to the frame of the dryer. A green wire could also be used to connect the center connector to the frame of the dryer.

, If the dryer cord does have colored wires, white is the neutral wire to the center connector, the red and black wires are the hot line 1 and line 2 wires which connect to the 2 outer connections of the dryer terminal block.

, This is not possible on all washing machine models, and can be an involved process on others. Look up your model online with the query ""remove front panel"" to save yourself the frustration of figuring it out for yourself, or look for screws in the following places, continuing down the list if the front panel still won't come off with a good tug:


The front panel itself, or the sides and base of the machine near the front panel.
Remove the detergent dispenser and look for a screw behind it.Detach the kick panel (below the large front panel) and any other smaller panels on the front. Some kick panels can only be detached after pulling open the filter with a flat-head screwdriver, then detaching the drain hose.Unscrew the lid and look for screws beneath it attaching the front panel.

, If the front panel is not removable on your model, you'll have to do the job through the front opening. There are a few things you can do that give you more room to work:


Unscrewing and removing the lid.Unscrew the door hinge, if possible.
Setting the machine carefully on its back, so the drum drops slightly down, away from the door., Most washing machines have a small band flush against the outer edge of the rubber door seal. Pry this away with a flat-head screwdriver, then pull it entirely off the seal., Pry the rubber door seal off the edge of the drum using your fingers or a flat-head screwdriver. Fold it off the edge and into the drum to access the inner retaining band underneath it. If you feel any resistance, stop and locate any clips holding the clamp in place. Clips can usually be removed with a screwdriver, either by removing the screws holding them in place, or by prying them off with a flat-head.

, This part presses the rubber seal in place. Locate the screw or nut holding the spring in place, and loosen it so the seal can be unhooked and removed. You may need to use one of the following techniques to access the screw:


Unscrew the lid of the washing machine and come in from the top.
Remove the front panel of the washing machine, then unbolt the large, round counterweight surrounding the drum.In rare cases, the clamp band has no tension adjustment, and can be pushed off using a flat-head screwdriver or fingers. Start from the bottom and work your way around the drum in both directions.

, Look for small drain holes near the bottom of the seal. Your new door seal should have the drain holes in a similar position to allow water to drain correctly.

, Pull the seal away from the lips of the drum to remove it. Some door seals are glued in place, but these can still be removed with a strong tug.


On some models, the door lock also has to be unscrewed before the seal can be pulled off. Take note of the door lock position before you remove it, since you'll have to orient it in the same position after installing the new seal., Before you put in the new seal, remove all grime and mold from the attachment area using a damp cloth.

, Unless your seal came ""pre-lubricated,"" you can rub the lip with a little dishwashing liquid to make it easier to fit on.If the seal is not lubricated, you have the option of attaching it more firmly using a specialized adhesive for rubber door seals. This is usually not necessary, unless the seal needs to be glued to a drain hose., Fit the door seal on, working the inner lip over the drum. Make sure to line the seal up so the drain holes are at the bottom, near where the previous seal's drain holes were. There will often be a mark, such as a triangle, on both the door seal and the machine. Line these up when attaching the seal., Fold the new door seal in to the drum again. Hook the spring or band back together, then pull it on over the seal. Tighten it again using a screwdriver or wrench.

, If you have removed the counterweight or front panel, replace them first. Next, pull out the door seal again and hook the outer lip over the outer groove. If there was an outer retaining band, fit this over the outer lip and press tightly to reattach it.

, Screw back on the front panel, door, lid, or any other parts you had to remove to get at the door seal. Plug in the washing machine.


Consider running the washing machine on empty while supervised, to check for leaks. If the door leaks, you'll need to disassemble it and check that all parts are firmly attached.

, Make sure your vent hose is in good shape. If you have the white plastic vent hose, replace it now! It is not safe and has been outlawed. Use the aluminum type vent hose and make sure the length is as short as possible and not crushed or kinked.

, It's very important that the vent line (from the wall behind the dryer to the outside flap) is not restricted or clogged up with lint. This greatly increases your chance of a dryer fire. If you are unable to clean out this line yourself, call a professional. Many Chimney Sweep companies offer this service.

, In the event that your dryer does have a lint fire, don't give it more fuel to destroy your home. Make sure there are no articles of clothing, boxes, cleaning supplies, or anything else behind or around the dryer. You should also keep things off the top of the dryer.

, Your dryer needs to be opened up and vacuumed out periodically. Most dryers today are not easily accessible for the homeowner. Unless you know how to take your dryer apart and put it back together, you'll need a technician to do this. Any time you have your dryer repaired, ask the technician to vacuum it out for you. He should be doing this anyway as part of the service.

, If you have a gas dryer you should check your gas line. If it looks old or questionable, you should replace it. Make sure when you push your dryer back into position, you don't kink the line.

Some older homes only offer 110 volt service, while most modern homes are equipped to support 240 volt service. Check your circuit breaker to make sure you have two columns of 120 volt circuits.If you’re not sure what to look for, ask a qualified electrician to look at your circuit breaker and make sure that your home can handle a 120 volt dryer.;
, The vent on your dryer needs to match up with the one in the wall in your laundry room. Most exhaust vents are 4 inches (10.16 cm) in diameter.

If the vent in your dryer does not match the one in your wall, you should be able to purchase a vent adapter or transition pipe at a hardware or home supply store.

, Your gas dryer will need an appropriate gas hookup. The gas line should have a supply valve in the same room where you intend to install the dryer, preferably within 6 feet (1.8 m) of the unit.If there is no gas pipe in the laundry room, you will have to have one installed by a qualified technician., The breakers can be turned off at the main breaker panel. The location of this varies from home to home, but they are usually found in the garage or basement for houses and in utility closets or bedrooms for condos and apartments. The gas valve can be turned off at the supply valve for the dryer’s gas pipe, or at the main gas service shut off valve.The location of the main shut off valve varies from home to home.


In many homes, the gas valve can be turned off by using a 12 to 15 inch (30.5 to 38.1 cm) adjustable wrench. Turn the valve until the tang (handle you attach the wrench to) is perpendicular to the pipe.
If you are unsure of how to turn off the gas valve, contact your gas supplier.

, Before connecting the piping on your dryer to the gas pipe in your wall, you will need to coat all threaded connecting pieces with a pipe thread compound. This will help create a good seal between the pipe components and prevent dangerous gas leaks.Look for a pipe thread compound designed for use with liquid petroleum gas (LPG) at your hardware or home supply store., Fasten a flexible connector with stainless steel fittings to the gas pipe on the dryer. These are sometimes included when you purchase a dryer, or you can find them at your local hardware store. Explain what you are doing and the store employee should be able to help you find what you're looking for.


You may need an adapter to attach the 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) end of the pipe connector to the 3/8 inch (1 cm) pipe end on the dryer.Make sure your connector is long enough to connect your dryer to the pipe in your wall.
Do not attempt to reuse an old pipe connector! If you are replacing a previously installed gas dryer, throw away the old connector and replace it with a new one., Once you’ve hooked the pipe connector to the pipe on the dryer, connect the other end to the gas pipe in your wall.The gas pipe should have a threaded valve component attached to it. You will be attaching your pipe connector to the valve component.
If you have older gas fixtures in your home, you may wish to replace the old valve with a modern-style ball valve designed for use with gas. If you choose to do this, you will have to shut off the gas at the main service valve first.You will probably need an adapter to attach the connection pipe to the valve., Use a pair of adjustable wrenches to tighten the connections between all the gas line components. Take care not to over-tighten and torque the pipes or strip the threads., Make a solution of one part water and one part mild dish detergent. Spread a thin coating on the connectors between the various gas pipe components. Then, switch on the gas at the dryer supply valve. If you see bubbles forming on the connectors, this means there are leaks in your gas line.If you do see leaks, turn off the gas, carefully tighten your connections, and try again.
To be extra certain that there are no leaks, you can rent a gas leak detector from your local hardware store.
Never attempt to test for gas leaks with an open flame!

, Shut the gas off again at the dryer supply valve. Leave the gas off until the full installation is complete.

, You'll need a venting system, but you'll have to choose between two types. There is rigid venting, which comprises a hard metal tube that works for distances no greater than 40 feet (12.2 m). There is also semi-rigid venting, which uses a flexible hose that works for no more than 20 feet (6.1 m).In general, rigid venting is best for dryer vents that are installed at floor level.
If you need to attach your dryer to a vent above floor level, you may need a semi-rigid vent hose. Or, if you use a rigid vent hose, you can attach a pair of elbow-shaped bends to the top (where the hose connects to the wall) and the bottom (where the hose connects to the dryer).
Dryer vent hoses should be 4 inches (10.16 cm) in diameter.
Use a metal vent hose rather than plastic or vinyl, as these are a fire hazard.

, Make sure the connections at both ends of the vent hose are secure. You can do this with hose clamps, duct tape, or foil tape. However, hose clamps are the most secure option, as tape can eventually dry out and lose its adhesive properties., Make sure that it is clear of lint and other blockages, and that the vent hood is still in place. Carefully clean out any buildup., If your dryer does not come with a cord, buy a power cord which is suitable for the dryer you have purchased. You will also need a strain relief to keep the cord from becoming damaged.

The appropriate cord and strain relief type should be listed in the manufacturer's manual.
Install the strain relief at the power cord through-hole.
Open the terminal block access cover and attach the ends of the power cord to the appropriate terminals.
Tightly secure the ends of the power cord and the strain relief with the screws, and then replace the terminal cover.

, It should be several inches away from the wall. It should also not be located in an area that is overly cold, as this can inhibit the dryer's function.


If you are using a flexible or semi-rigid exhaust vent hose, take extra care not to crush the hose between the dryer and the wall., Keeping your dryer level will ensure that it is stable. Get a basic level and check it side to side and front to back, at all four corners, and at the center. If necessary, adjust the lengths of the legs on the dryer to make it completely level., You should now be ready to use your new dryer.

Replace the damaged door.",How to Remove a Scratch from a Stainless Steel Refrigerator Door," Like wood, stainless steel products also have a “grain.” When you clean, polish, or sand stainless steel, you always need to work in the direction of the grain. To identify the direction of the grain:


Look closely at the stainless steel door. You will see tiny brush strokes—these brush strokes indicate the direction of the grain.
Note if the grain (brushstrokes) is moving horizontally or vertically.;
, When removing scratches from stainless steel, it is important that you begin your work on a clean surface. If sanded or buffed, excess dirt, grime, stuck on materials, and loose materials left on your fridge could cause further damage to your door. You may clean the door with a polishing cleanser powder, such as Bon Ami, Comet, or Ajax.


Wet the entire surface of the fridge door with water.
Sprinkle a gentle polishing cleanser powder onto the wet door.
Dampen a clean sponge. Move the sponge across the surface of the door in the direction of the grain to combine the product with the water.
Rinse the fridge door with water.
Pat it dry with a clean microfiber cloth., Cleaning vinegar is 1% more acidic than traditional white vinegar. The additional acidity allows this mild, yet powerful, cleaning product to cut through greasy fingerprints with ease. Prior to removing any scratches, use this product to cleanse the surface of your fridge door.


Pour the cleaning vinegar into a small bucket.
Wet a clean cloth with undiluted cleaning vinegar.
Moving in the direction of the grain, wipe down the surface of your fridge door with the damp cloth
Wiping with the grain, remove any excess vinegar with a dry cloth., There are several products on the market designed specifically for cleaning stainless steel. Select a product that you are comfortable using to remove dirt, oil, and stuck on materials from your fridge door. Before applying the product, always read the directions listed on the cleaning product.


Be sure to note any recommended safety precautions, such as wearing gloves., When applied with a little elbow grease, gentle polishing cleaners can buff out hairline scratches from your stainless steel fridge door. These cleansers, such as Bon Ami, Ajax, Comet, and specially formulated stainless steel cleaners, come in both a powder and a cream form.


If you are using a powder form, mix the product with water to form a paste.
Apply the paste or the cream to the hairline scratch with a damp cloth or sponge. As you rub the paste or cream into the scratch, always move in the direction of the grain.
Occasionally wipe away the cleaning product with a clean damp cloth and inspect the scratch. Continue to apply the cleaning product and buff the affected area until the scratch is no longer visible.If the scratch remains, try to remove the scratch with a mildly-abrasive product, like whitening toothpaste.

, Unlike gentle polishing cleaners, whitening toothpaste is mildly abrasive. If the gentle polishing cleaner did not remove the scratch, try to treat the marred area with a whitening toothpaste.


Coat the bristles of the toothbrush with the whitening toothpaste.
Use the brush to apply the toothpaste directly to the minor scratch. As you work to buff out the scratch, always move the toothbrush in the direction of the grain.
Periodically remove wipe away the toothpaste with a wet rag and assess the scratch. Wipe in the direction of the grain. Continue to apply the whitening toothpaste to the scratch until it is no longer present.
Once the scratch is gone, wipe away the toothpaste with a clean, damp rag.
Condition the area you cleaned with metal polish or olive oil., If the scratch in your refrigerator door is deep, it is possible to sand out the prominent gash. Always contact the manufacturer to determine which grit is acceptable to use on your fridge door.


Wet the scratched area with a sponge or cloth saturated with water. Throughout the process, keep the surface wet.
Wet a piece of sandpaper with water. Throughout the process, make sure the sandpaper remains wet.
Move the wet sandpaper lightly over the scratch in the same direction of the grain. Feather out from the scratch to blend in the affected area.
Once the scratch is removed to your satisfaction, wipe the area with a wet rag in the direction of the grain.
Pat the area dry with a microfiber cloth.
Condition the treated area with a metal polish or olive oil.
You may use a chloride-free paste In addition to water, If your fridge door is severely scratched or has multiple scratches, you may want to consider purchasing a stainless steel scratch removal kit. These kits are sold at home repair shops and online. The kits typically contain a sanding block, three abrasive pads, a lubricant, and an instructional video.


Always read and follow the instructions provide by the product’s manufacturers.
Affix the finest grit sandpaper to the sanding block. Coat the sandpaper with the sanding lubricant. Sand the affected area in the direction of the grain.
If the scratch is not vanishing, affix the next coarsest sandpaper to the sanding block. Coat the sandpaper with the sanding lubricant. Sand the affected area in the direction of the grain.
If the scratch still remains, affix the coarsest sandpaper to the sanding block. Coat the sandpaper with the sanding lubricant and sand the affected area in the direction of the grain.
Once the scratch vanishes, use the same grit sandpaper to treat the entire stainless steel door in the direction of the grain., If you are not a diy-er or your fridge is severely damaged, consider hiring a professional stainless steel refinishing and polishing company to complete the work for you. A professional repairman will be able to assess the damaged fridge and provided you with a variety of repair options. If the scratch or scratches can not be buffed or sanded out, the repairman may suggest refinishing, or sanding, the entire fridge door., If you have exhausted all potential repair options, consider replacing the fridge door. Contact the manufacturer to inquire about the availability and cost of a new fridge door.

DON’T OVERLOAD: Overloading not only is damaging to your clothes but also puts unnecessary stress on vital components.,

Be sure the drain hose height is correct.,

Watch for rusting.,

Get rid of soap scum.",How to Make Your Washer Last Longer," Compare overloading your washer to pulling a loaded trailer behind your family car all the time. Extra strain on the motor, transmission and suspension will most certainly shorten the life of your car. Oh, did I say your washer also has a motor, transmission and suspension?...How does overloading damage my clothes? Rubbing together of cottons causes linting. The more rubbing together the more linting and the shorter the life of the garment.
, Be sure to follow manufactures directions regarding proper installation. Washers have small pumps, either self powered or driven by belt off main motor. Ideally, the drain hose should hook into a drain pipe directly behind the console of your washer. If your hose is too high the pump takes longer to evacuate the water from the tub putting stress on your washer and possibly reducing cleaning effectiveness. To low a drain hose and your water could siphon out of the unit during the wash cycle. I have been on calls where the customer said there washer would wash, stop, fill, wash, stop, fill etc. Water was siphoning from the tub., Clean surfaces frequently to avoid rusting, especially clean around the bleach dispenser as bleach is corrosive and will cause severe rusting if not kept clean and dry. If rusting has already appeared go to your hardware store and pick up a bottle of rust converter (not rust remover). Follow directions on bottle. This works very well on rust. It can also be painted over after 24 to 48 hours., To reduce the build up of scum fill your washer with warm water, add a pint of vinegar and let it run through a full cycle. Follow this procedure once a month."

Observe your dryer’s efficiency.,
Pay attention to strange sounds and smells.,
Confirm that it’s actually broken.,
Take the age of the unit into account.,
Find out if your appliance is under warranty.,
Follow the “50% rule.” If your dryer is more than 50% through its lifespan and is estimated to cost more than 50% of its original price to repair, you’ll probably be better off buying a new one.,
See if the dryer can be repaired.,
Compare the prices of newer models.,
Look for a dryer that suits your needs.,
Match your new dryer with your washing machine.",How to Know if You Should Replace Your Dryer," The best way to tell if the appliance might be on its last legs is to simply see whether it’s doing its job properly. Start paying close attention to how your appliance is working. If your clothes are coming out damp, for instance, it might mean that they just need a little more drying time, or it could indicate a problem with the dryer's heating elements.


Look for recurring issues that point to a specific flaw in the unit itself.
Failure to start, erratic drum rotation or a tendency to shut off mid-cycle are all common (and potentially serious) dryer issues.;
, Squealing or banging noises may be a sign that one of the unit’s key mechanical components, such as the drum belt or rollers, is wearing out. Similarly, a burning smell could indicate that the dryer is overheating.For the most part, your dryer should not make any noises or give off any smells other than those associated with the normal drying cycle.
If left unaddressed, problems like overheating can quickly lead to safety hazards.

, Inspect all the dryer’s main components (including the drum, lint trap, dials or display and wall outlet) to see if another factor might be the cause. For instance, bad wiring can prevent a perfectly good dryer from turning on, and regular overheating could be the result of a clogged lint trap.Seemingly serious problems sometimes have simple explanations.
Make sure you’ve exhausted every other possible option before shelling out the money for expensive repairs.

, Most dryers typically last somewhere between 10-13 years, according to consumer reports. If your dryer is approaching the 10 year mark, it may be a good idea to consider replacing it even if you haven’t experienced any major performance issues yet. By springing for an updated model, you’ll get a better return for your investment.The longer you use an old dryer, the more common malfunctions will become. This can get quite expensive after a while.
It may help to look up consumer reviews on the internet to learn what other owners have to say about the longevity of your particular dryer model., Some washers and dryers come with guarantees from the manufacturer that the unit will function correctly for a certain number of years. If your dryer is under warranty, the company may cover the cost of a repair or replacement for issues that pop up within the time frame specified. This will be the cheapest and simplest way to get your dryer back in good working order.Review the paperwork that came with your unit to see if it includes warranty information.
You might also be able to get an answer by calling a company representative directly.

, This so-called 50% rule can be very useful in helping buyers decide whether to have older appliances repaired or replaced.The 50% rule doesn’t always account for things like fluke breakdowns, but is more geared toward general deterioration.

, If you feel confident with a tool set, you might be able to make the necessary adjustments yourself. If not, call a handyman to come and take a look at the dryer’s potential problem areas. Repairing an appliance will almost always be far cheaper than replacing it.Important pieces like the heating elements and drum belt tend to be costly and labor intensive to replace. Don’t try to save a dead dryer if it’s going to be a bigger financial commitment than upgrading to a new one., Once you’ve made the decision to buy a new dryer, the next step is to find one that fits within your price range. Research your options, looking at the least expensive models first, then work your way up from there. Finding a dryer similar to the one you’ve been using can be a good place to start.Appliances vary in price from affordable basic units to more deluxe styles equipped with a host of sophisticated features.Come up with a budget that you’d be willing and able to spend, and stick that number to make the most economical purchase possible.

, Now may be a good time to invest in features that your previous model lacked. Newer appliances boast customizable settings, higher loading capacities and even energy efficient drying modes that can all make your life easier, especially if you’re used to dealing with an unreliable unit. These types of added conveniences usually justify a slightly higher price point.While you’re shopping around, size up different models to make sure they’ll fit comfortably in the space you have.Choose from various colors and finishes and settle on one that you like.

, Assuming you’re only replacing your dryer, you’ll want to pick out one that’s consistent with the look of your current washer. Both appliances should be roughly the same size so that you can place them close together without creating an obstruction. Sticking to the same color scheme and general construction will also keep mismatched units from being so obvious.It’s important to choose appliances with similar capacities—the dryer should be able to hold the washing machine’s maximum load size.
If you have the space, consider buying a washer/dryer combo. That way, your appliances will match, and you can be sure that they’ll both stay in good working order for years to come."

Empty the refrigerator of all its contents.,
Remove the shelves.,
Unplug the refrigerator.,
Defrost the freezer if necessary.,
Close and secure the doors.,
Find some helpers.,
Use a moving dolly.,
Slide the refrigerator away from the wall and secure it to the dolly.,
Tilt the fridge gently.,
Load the fridge into the truck.,
Move the fridge into the new space.",How to Move a Refrigerator," Before you try to move a fridge, it's best to take everything out. Make sure that both your refrigerator and freezer are free of food, condiments, ice cube trays, and anything else that might rattle around and shift weight. Remove items placed outside of your refrigerator as well, such as magnets.


If there are perishable items in the refrigerator, finish them or give them away. If you're in the middle of a big move, it's probably easier to just to toss the things you can't finish now.
If you want to move the fridge a short distance in the same room, to clean behind it or reorganize the kitchen, remove the items anyway, and place them on the counters. It'll make it safer to move and you won't risk tipping over the fridge. Use moving rollers, and place them under the feet of the fridge to do this. Slide it out enough to unplug it, then simply slide it where you want it to go.;
, Remove all removable components from the inside of the fridge, including shelves, trays, and other loose or movable items, organizers, and dividers. Wrap the shelves in towels for protection, then label and stack them carefully.


You may also opt to secure shelving in place with tape instead of removing, but it is recommended to remove them altogether and pack them separately. Depending on your fridge, though, this might be a fine option. If they're fairly secure, consider taping them into place and creating less mess with the move.

, Coil the power cord securely and tape it in a tight bundle to make sure that it stays in place while moving. If your refrigerator has an ice maker, disconnect this from the water source as well.

, If a considerable amount of frost has built up in the freezer, you'll need to defrost it before going forward with the move. This would normally take 6 to 8 hours to complete, so make sure you have ample time before the move. It is best to do this the night before the move so there would be enough time to defrost overnight, and you can wipe the inside of the refrigerator in the morning.


Don't waste a bunch of valuable moving time scrubbing the fridge, but this is also a good opportunity to give it a reasonably thorough cleaning, before you take it to your new place. While the freezer defrosts, wipe down the drawers and the interior surfaces with disinfectant.

, Fasten the refrigerator and freezer doors snugly shut using strong rope or bungee cord. If your refrigerator has a double-door, tie the door handles together as well. Be careful not to tie the refrigerator too tightly, or the doors may be pulled out of alignment. It is not recommended to use tape for securing the door, since it may either damage the finish of the refrigerator, or leave a residue.


If the move is scheduled to take longer than a day, it is recommended to keep the doors slightly open to allow for air flow, and prevent any mold or mildew from growing inside the refrigerator., Because a fridge needs to be held upright and operated using a dolly, it can be tempting to go it alone, but it's always safer to lift heavy objects and negotiate them through doors, around corners, down stairs, and into a truck with the aid of some assistants. Moving a refrigerator is a job for at least two., One of the best pieces of equipment to use would be a refrigerator dolly, which can handle the weight of the refrigerator, and provide ease during moving, especially if the refrigerator needs to be transported down stairs.


Any dolly with straps will do, but make sure that the base is big enough to seat the bottom of the fridge on securely and that straps are big enough to secure the refrigerator safely. It's very important that the base is big enough because you need to keep the fridge upright to avoid leaking coolant.
If you don't have a moving dolly, you need to rent one. While moving straps are available that could theoretically be used to strap a fridge to your back, buying moving straps would be more expensive and much more dangerous than borrowing a dolly. Don't attempt to move one without it.

, With most fridges, you should be able to slide the dolly right under, lifting it gently if necessary. Tie the refrigerator to the dolly with the use of moving straps or bungees. Make sure that you minimize any tilting when lifting and positioning the refrigerator on the dolly. Maintain its upright position, to ensure that oil will not seep into the cooling tubes.


Never move the refrigerator on its side or back for any reason. The oil in the compressor may flow into the cooling tubes. When the refrigerator is returned to an upright position, the oil may not completely drain from the cooling tubes, and the refrigerator will not cool properly.
If it is unavoidable to lay the refrigerator on its side, make sure to do it at an upright angle if possible. Place a box or a big piece of furniture under the top of the fridge to help keep it relatively upright.

, When you've got the fridge hooked up to the dolly, roll it slowly to the truck that you're packing, moving forward. It's important to move in the direction opposite the tilt to maintain the most security. Have a helper assist on the other side, coaching you through obstacles and helping to secure the fridge.To move the refrigerator down a flight of stairs, move it down one step at a time, your assistant easing it down onto each successive step. It would be ideal to have two people in front of the dolly and another at the back, holding the handles and letting it down slowly. Communicate loudly and don't go to fast.

, Whether you're moving your fridge into a pick-up or a moving truck, back it up to the bed, placing the dolly between the lip of the truck bed and the fridge. Ideally, a moving truck will have a truck ramp that you'll be able to roll it up easily. If not, you'll have to use a bit more care.


To lift a fridge straight up into the bed of a truck, you need to get up into the bed and have at least two people down on the ground. Coordinate and lift simultaneously, pulling straight up with the handles of the dolly while the helpers on the ground lift from the base and push it back into the bed. It would ideal to have another helper with you, too, to make sure the fridge doesn't fall backward onto you.
Secure the fridge upright in the truck. If you can leave it hooked up to the dolly, that would add security and stability to the fridge, but if you can't, brace it with other furniture or moving supplies, or strap it into place using the bungees.

, Let the refrigerator down and move it into the new place just as you moved it out. Allow it to sit for at least 3 hours before plugging it in. This will allow for the oil and fluid to flow back into its compressor, and would prevent any damage to the appliance. It would take around 3 days for the refrigerator to return to its ideal cooling temperature and be useable.

When doing so, be sure to remove everything in the refrigerator and have at least one strong person around to assist you.


Do not leave any shelves in the refrigerator that can be jostled during the moving process. Either take the shelves out and move them separately or use tape to secure them.
Be sure that the doors don't open up while you move the refrigerator. Take a strap and tie it around the doors or wrap tape around them.
Don't ever lay a refrigerator on its side.;
, It might be tempting to measure the size of your current refrigerator. But it is possible that the refrigerator is not the optimal size for the space. Begin by measuring the open space where you will put the refrigerator., Place one end against the wall. Extend the tape to reach to the opposite end of the open space. Mark the measurement on the tape with a pencil. Write down the measurement on a separate sheet of paper., Not only is it possible that you misread the tape measure, it is also possible that your house has settled. In the process, some of the surfaces might become uneven. Repeat the measurement at a different point in the open space.If there is a discrepancy, use the smaller measurement. It is better to have too much space, not enough.

, You will want at least an inch of additional space on both ends of the refrigerator so that you have space to clean dust off the sides of it. However, you will also want at least two inches on any side that has a door hinge, so that have space to fully open and close the refrigerator. , To get some of the measurements, you will need to move the refrigerator. When doing so, be sure to remove all the food in the refrigerator. Get at least one strong person to help you.


Do not leave any shelves in the refrigerator. These can be jostled during the moving process. Either take the shelves out and move them separately or use tape to secure them in place.
Be careful that the doors do not open when you move the refrigerator. Either take a strap and tie it around the doors or wrap tape around them.
When moving a refrigerator, don't lay it on its side. This can cause serious damage to the refrigerator.

, You might need the assistance of a second person to secure the tap at the top of the space, while you pull it down to the bottom and record the measurement. You might also need the assistance of someone taller than yourself. It is helpful to have a second person around, if possible.


Alternatively, hang the metal hook at the top of the tape measure on whatever surface is available near the top of the space. Pull the tape measure down to get your first measurement. Then measure the distance from the top of the space to the overhang from which the tape measure was hanging. Add this distance to the first measure to get the total height., That way, the tape will reach a height that is taller than you.

, Have a second person pull the measuring tape to the ground. Mark the end point on the tape measure then write the number down on a paper pad with the other measurements.

, Not only is it possible that you misread the tape measure, it is also possible that your house has settled. In the process, some of the surfaces might become uneven. Repeat the measurement at a different point in the open space.If there is a discrepancy, use the smaller measurement. It is better to have too much space, not enough.

, Refrigerators require ventilation to work properly. There must be at least one inch of space remaining above the refrigerator., To get many of the measurements, particularly dept, you will need to move the refrigerator. When doing so, be sure to remove everything in the refrigerator and have at least one strong person on hand to assist you.


Do not leave any shelves in the refrigerator that can be jostled during the moving process. Either take the shelves out and move them separately or use tape to secure them in place.
Be sure that the doors don't open up while you move the refrigerator. Either take a strap and tie it around the doors or wrap tape around them.
When moving a refrigerator, don't ever lay it on its side.

, Place the measuring tape against the back of the available space. Extend the tape out to the front of the counter. Write down the number on the measuring tape.

, Not only is it possible that you misread the tape measure, it is also possible that your house has settled. In the process, some of the surfaces might become uneven. Repeat the measurement at a different point in the space allotted for the refrigerator.If there is a discrepancy, use the smaller measurement. It is better to have too much space, not enough.

, If you have not allotted two additional inches on the side for the door hinges, you will need to move the refrigerator two inches out from the counter space to give the doors room to open. This will allow you more room for depth, but you will need to verify that the doors do not extend too far out into the room.

, Refrigerators require ventilation to work properly. There must be at least an inch of space remaining behind the refrigerator., Having enough space for a refrigerator won’t amount to much if you can’t get it through the door. Determine what path you will use bring the refrigerator into your home. Compare the size of the doorways to determine that there is sufficient space to get the refrigerator in., Many refrigerator models don’t advertise the door measurements. At the store, open the doors to a 90 degree angle and measure from the back of the refrigerator to the end of the doors. At home, take the measuring tape and see how far the doors would open into your kitchen. Start from where the back of the fridge would be located, at least an inch from the wall, and measure out the combined length of the depth of the fridge and the length of the doors.


If you need to move the refrigerator out past the end of the counter to accommodate the hinges of the door, you might be required to adjust your measurements. Start from two inches past the counter. Measure back to the wall the depth of the refrigerator. That point will be where the back of the refrigerator rests. From that point measure outward, the depth of the refrigerator plus the length of the door. That will be the length that the door extends into the room.
Once you know how far the door will open up into the room, ask yourself if that is acceptable. Will there be enough room to open the door entirely without hitting a counter? Will the open door block a pathway in the kitchen or make things uncomfortably tight?
If the door does extend too far, consider an alternative model. Refrigerators with French doors and side-by-side doors will not open out as far into your kitchen., How much storage space you need will vary depending upon the size of your household and your eating habits. You should allot at an absolute minimum 4-6 cubic feet of space for each adult using the refrigerator.


On average, a couple that does not eat frequently at home should aim for 12-16 cubic feet of refrigerator space.
A couple that does cook frequently should have at least 18 cubic feet of space.
A family of four should generally have at least 20 cubic feet of space.
Also account for what type of space you need. Are you more prone to eat frozen foods or fresh vegetables? Find a model that allots space in a way consistent with your dietary habits."

, First remove the quarter-inch hex head screws, then remove the cover by tilting it at the bottom and disconnecting it from the upper lip. From the back of the refrigerator, the condenser fan motor can be found along the right side of the compressor.

You will see that the condenser fan's motor shaft has a small clasp nut on the end. Use a pair of slip-joint pliers to loosen it enough so that you can remove it with your finger. Now you can slide the blade off and pull it out.

, Slide the blade of a small, flat blade screwdriver under the locking tab and lift up to remove the harness.
, Once you've removed the harness, there are two quarter-inch hex head screws to remove. These screws attach the motor to the mounting bracket. With these screws removed, you can now pull out the motor.

The mounting bracket is secured to the frame via four quarter-inch hex-head screws. Now that the motor and the fan have been removed, you can access and remove these screws. You should be able to pull out the water tubing and remove the mounting bracket.

, Mount the motor by lining up the three holes in the back of the motor with the three holes in the bracket. For a metal bracket, place the shorter screws through the holes, and tighten them once they're all in place. For a plastic bracket, use longer screws.

Keep in mind that this adapter is only necessary if your motor does not have a four-wire connector. If you have a three-wire adapter, this piece connects to your wire harness while the four-prong connector fits into your motor.

, Place the blade on top of the shaft with the pointed end pointing upwards, then press down on the blade until it reaches the stop screw. Now the motor can be reinstalled into the refrigerator., First slide the motor in from behind the refrigerator, and attach it to the frame with four mounting screws.

Verify that your refrigerator's gasket needs to be replaced.,
Determine the type of gasket needed for your refrigerator model.,
Purchase a new gasket.,
Prepare the new gasket for the refrigerator.,
Remove the defective gasket from the refrigerator.,
Clean the gasket mounting area on the refrigerator.,
Obtain the supplies needed to attach the new gasket.,
Attach the new gasket to the door panel.",How to Make a Refrigerator Door Close1,"


Place a thin piece of paper between your refrigerator door jamb and the gasket.
Pull the paper out from the refrigerator door. If the paper comes out easily without resistance, the problem with your door closing lies with the faulty gasket.;
,


Consult the manual for your refrigerator to determine its model. You can find the model type printed inside or on the cover of the manual.
If you cannot determine the model of your refrigerator, contact the manufacturer directly by visiting their website or calling the phone number provided in the manual.
You can also cut out a small piece of your gasket from the refrigerator door and match it to the gaskets in stock at a retail store that specializes in home repair or refrigerators. In the event your gasket needs to be special-ordered, reattach the gasket piece to the refrigerator using glue or rubber cement.

, A new gasket can be obtained directly from the manufacturer or from a retail store that sells refrigerators, appliances, or home repair supplies.

, The gasket must be of the correct temperature to seal and work properly on your refrigerator.


Consult with the gasket instructions if they are provided with the new gasket to determine the method of preparing it for use with your refrigerator.
If no instructions are provided, leave the gasket in the same room as your refrigerator for at least 24 hours to allow the gasket to conform to the same humidity and temperature levels of the current gasket.
You can also try soaking your gasket in warm water until it becomes pliable enough for the seal to work.

, The removal method may differ depending on the properties or materials that hold the gasket in place on your refrigerator.


Examine the gasket on your refrigerator to determine how it is held in place. The gasket may have adhesive strips, screws, or clips that fasten it to the refrigerator door panel.
Use the appropriate tools or methods to remove the defective gasket. For example, if the gasket is held in place by screws, use a screwdriver to remove the screws. If adhesive strips are in place, use a putty knife to pry the gasket away from the refrigerator door panel.
Pull the gasket away from the door panel one side at a time. This will allow you to verify that all fastening components have been completely removed, preventing pieces of the gasket from breaking off and being left on the door panel otherwise.

, This will allow you to remove any residue that has been left behind from the old gasket; such as adhesive or dirt that may present difficulty when applying the new gasket.


Use a sponge with liquid dishwashing detergent and warm water to clean away remaining residue. You may use a steel wool scrubbing pad in place of the sponge to clean any stubborn residue that is difficult to remove.

, Depending on the manufacturer of the gasket and refrigerator, the tools needed to attach the gasket may vary.


Refer to the instructions of your new gasket to determine which supplies are needed; such as screwdrivers, adhesive tape, or gasket cement.

,


Apply the gasket to the door panel one side at a time; ensuring that each side is straight and aligned properly.
Smooth down each side to ensure it lies flat against the door panel without any bumps, or curling edges.
Use the tools and supplies indicated by the manufacturer to secure the gasket to the door panel; such as screws, bolts, clips, adhesive, or gasket cement.
If you use gasket cement or adhesive glue to fasten the new gasket, you may need to allow the materials to dry before you can begin opening and closing your refrigerator door again.

Check your supply hoses.,
Switch off your washing machine valve.,
Use a drain pan.",How to Install a Washing Machine," Depending on your living situation, you may be limited in your options of places to put a washing machine. However, you should try to find a spot that will reduce the risk of uneven loads, leaks, and potential damage to your appliance or your home. It is also important to have access to hot and cold water, a drain and an electrical outlet that can support your washer and dryer.A level, hard-floor surface is an ideal location for a washing machine.
Make sure the room temperature will not fall below 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius). The washer should also be away from sources of heat like your furnace, radiators, or fireplaces.
Because of the utility requirements, most houses and apartments have specific areas intended for use with a washer and dryer.;
, Washing machines come in a number of shapes and sizes, so you may need to measure yours to ensure it will fit properly in the space you intend to put it. You should also measure the doorways it will need to pass through in order to reach its final destination. Remember that you will need to measure the width as well as the depth of both the washing machine and the space you will put it to ensure a proper fit.Make sure the doorway’s interior dimensions are wider than the washing machine.
Many washing machines are most narrow when carried or loaded onto a hand truck from the side.

, Leveling feet are the little legs underneath the appliance itself. These are adjustable and should be calibrated so that your washing machine will be as level as possible. Turning leveling feet clockwise will lower that corner of the washer and turning them counter clockwise will raise it. Place a carpenter’s level on the top of the appliance, then twist the feet located at the bottom of each corner as needed until the level reflects an even surface.A nut around each leg prevents them from turning once you have set the proper height for each corner.
Loosen the locking nuts by turning them counter clockwise independent of the leg itself. Once you have leveled the appliance, turn the nuts clockwise until they’re tight to lock the legs in place.
Remember to use the level both left to right and from front to back, as the washer must be level in both directions.

, If you are replacing an existing washing machine, you should disconnect and remove it entirely before bringing the new one into place. Make sure to shut off the water leading to the old machine before disconnecting it and have a bucket in place to catch the remaining water as it drains from the lines once they’ve been disconnected. Be careful not to allow any draining water to come into contact with the power outlet for the washer and dryer.Make sure you turn off both the hot and cold water that leads to the old machine before disconnecting it.
You may need pliers or a wrench to disconnect stuck on hoses attached to the old washing machine.

, The water supply hose is what feeds water into your washing machine when you do laundry. If you have pipes that run to your washing machine's location you can simply attach the hoses here. Make sure to tighten your water connections snugly to prevent leaks from developing, but do not overtighten. You can usually make these connections tight enough using only your hands.If the hose is too short you can purchase a longer hose meant to withstand higher pressure. Never try to stretch the hose, as this may cause it to break.
Connect the hot and cold hoses to their respective water pipes. These pipes should resemble a hose spigot with threads to screw water lines onto, though some houses and washers may use a different connection method.
A lot of connectors have a rubber washer to ensure water can’t leak through the threading once connected. If yours doesn’t, you may want to wrap the spigot in Teflon or plumbers tape.

, The drain hose needs to be installed correctly to prevent leaks. If your washer is located near a sink, you can feed the drain hose over the edge and into the sink. If you do not have a drain or sink basin near the washer, you may need to use a standpipe. Make sure the pipe is secured down or it may loosen over time, causing flooding.If using a sink, attach a plastic hose guide to keep the hose bent downward and make sure the hose doesn't reach too high above the washer - 60 to 90 centimeters (23 to 35 inches) is ideal.
Your washer might come with a plastic hose guide. If not, you can purchase one at your local hardware store or through an online retailer.
If using a standpipe, choose one with a diameter greater than that of the hose.Position the standpipe so that its top is higher than the washing machine's water level. If your washer does not indicate the water level, you can estimate it by examining the interior of your washer.

, Once your washer is hooked up, you should be ready to do a load of laundry. However, instead of loading your laundry and leaving it unattended, it's best to closely monitor your washer for the first few loads to ensure that there are no leaks.Wait by the washer and check around, under, and behind the appliance.
If you see any signs of leaking, tighten all the connections around that leak, taking care not to overtighten.
If the washer won't stop leaking, turn it off and call a professional plumber to inspect your pipes and connections.

, Old supply hoses that are cracked or worn out are likely to cause problems. You should check your supply hoses periodically to ensure they're still in good shape. Try to take a look at the hoses every few months if possible.If you see any cracks or stretch marks, you'll want to replace your hoses as soon as possible.
If you're installing new supply hoses, consider buying no-burst hoses. They have a stainless steel sheath that prevents them from tearing and protects your home.

, The hoses that connect your pipes to the washing machine should go through a washing machine valve. This valve is usually at the spigot and can be used to prevent water from passing into the lines. Close the valve by turning it or moving the lever from one side to other, depending on the hardware.You can switch off the valve whenever you're not going to be home for extended periods of time.
Switching off the valve when your washing machine isn't in use will help take some pressure off the hoses that connect the washer to your pipes. This may help preserve the hoses and reduce the chances of a leak.

, If your washer hose bursts, it can leak many gallons of water and cause thousands of dollars in damage to your home. One easy way to reduce the risk of this happening is to use a washing machine drain pan under your appliance.If your washing machine is located on a floor other than the basement, it is particularly recommended that you use a drain pan. Some buildings may even require that tenants use a pan.
To install a drain pan, simply reposition your washing machine and slide the pan underneath it.
If your drain pan comes with a pre-cut hole, you'll just install a one-inch PVC fitting and connect the pan to a floor drain. If it doesn't have a pre-cut hole, you'll have to drill one yourself.
If you're unsure of how to connect your drain pan to the floor drain, you may need to contact a professional plumber to ensure that your home is protected against leaks and water damage.

Determine how to tighten your refrigerator door hinges.,
Tighten your refrigerator door hinges.,
Use shims to correct additional hinge problems.",How to Make a Refrigerator Door Close2," This procedure will vary depending on the make and model of your refrigerator.


Consult your refrigerator's manual to determine how the door hinges can be tightened. If you do not have the manual, contact the manufacturer directly or visit their website to obtain contact information or a copy of the manual.
Most hinges can be accessed by opening the refrigerator and freezer doors, and will contain hinge caps that can be removed or pried off with a screwdriver.

,


Use a screwdriver or similar tool as required to properly tighten the door hinges.

, You may need to place shims between your hinges and the refrigerator door if the door is still loose or refuses to close completely.


Shims made specifically for refrigerators can be purchased from retail stores that specialize in home repair or refrigerators. You can also use pieces of cardboard in place of metal or stainless steel shims.
In some cases, you may need to remove shims that have not been properly installed in order to correct sagging or alignment problems with the door.
If your refrigerator door contains a magnet catch that doesn't work, remove the magnet catch and place a shim underneath to allow the door to properly seal and close.

Sell your old unit.",How to Pay for a Refrigerator," Since retailers have to pay a fee to credit card companies when consumers charge a purchase, some will offer a discount to customers who pay cash. Check to see if the store you're in has a policy posted about this. If it doesn't, ask to speak to a manager about a cash discount.;
, Credit cards are a common method of payment for appliance purchases. If you plan to pay the balance off when the bill comes, choose a card with a rewards program. If you plan to pay over time, use the card that offers the lowest interest rate available to you.

, Asking for gift cards to a store that sells refrigerators for gift-giving occasions is an effective way to save up for an appliance purchase. If your credit card has a rewards program, you might also find that you can cash in your points for gift cards to a variety of retailers, including several that sell refrigerators. Some airline frequent flier points also can be cashed in for retail gift cards.

, Although layaway programs are less common than they used to be, there are still appliance retailers that offer them. Layaway programs typically allow you to pay a down payment, then make payments on a fixed schedule (usually every week or 2). Once the item has been paid for, you're free to take it home. Be sure to read the rules carefully to ensure you understand what fees are involved in your layaway purchase.

, Some retailers (especially independent stores) are willing to barter for goods or services. If you have a skill or a product that might be of use to the owner of an appliance store, offer an exchange for the refrigerator, or a discount or upgrade on your purchase. Perhaps you can write an employee handbook, fix a computer or design a new logo for the store. Be sure to research the tax implications of your trade before you finalize the deal.

, Some manufacturers or stores offer rebates on the sale of certain models. Check the store's print advertisement or website before shopping. Stores also may offer trade-in rebates, allowing you to exchange your old model for a discount on a new one.

, Various parts of your existing refrigerator may have cash value that you can apply toward the purchase of a new unit. Contact scrap metal dealers in your area to find out what parts they can use and how much they are worth.

, If you have a refrigerator that still works, consider selling it and applying the cash to your new purchase.

Now go on to step 21, ""Venting Requirements."", This step is more of a list of stipulations, but do not skip reading it--it outlines several potential hazards you want to avoid.

First of all, your vent must be heavy metal, not plastic or metal foil.
Select the route that follows the straightest/most direct path to the outdoors, with as few elbows/turns as possible.
Bent the vent carefully so as not to hinder its effectiveness.
Use clamps to seal all joints, and in terms of the vent's ""elbows,"" a 45° angle is much more effective than 90°.
Exhaust vents in mobile homes must be securely fastened to a flame resistant portion of the home and the vent's ending should be outside the structure itself.
Remember, improper venting can cue moisture damage to woodwork, furniture, wallpaper, etc., so as you move on be sure to follow all instructions exactly.

, Use caulk to seal the outside wall around the exhaust hood, to prevent leakage., Use the following chart:





, The vent MUST fit inside the hood, secured with a 4"" clamp. Run the vent to the dryer location following the venting requirements above., Take a large, flat piece of cardboard (such as a piece from the carton your dryer came in) and gently lay the dryer down onto it., Use a wrench to turn these until the diamond marking on the middle of each leg is no longer visible., Make sure the dryer vent fits over the exhaust outlet, and secure the connection with a 4"" clamp., Do not remove the cardboard yet, and take extra care not to damage the vent. Once the dryer is in place, you can remove the cardboard and level the legs using a wrench."

Replace a fridge that would require expensive repairs.,
Lean towards repairs on younger fridges.,
Default to repairs depending on the type of the fridge.,
Retire fridges older than 10 years.,
Consider downsizing whenever possible.",How to Know if You Should Replace Your Refrigerator1," As a rule of thumb, if repair costs are 50% or more of the cost of a new fridge, you should buy a new fridge. There are two main reasons to do so. First, as refrigerators age, they will need more and more repairs. Second, replacing an older refrigerator gives you the opportunity to get a more efficient model that will reduce your energy costs., Different types of fridges are more prone to needing repairs and have varied overall lifespans. For instance, built-in refrigerators are generally worth repairing. In general, however, any fridge that is only a year or two old is worth repairing., Side-by-side fridge and freezer appliances are usually worth repairing for the first five years of their life, and fridges with a bottom freezers are usually worth repairing for seven years or so. Fridges with freezers on top can usually be repaired within the first three years of their life, but may need to be replaced in seven years or less., Refrigerators are expected to last between 10 and 20 years. If yours is at least 10 years old and has begun to have issues, it’s simply time for a replacement. Not only will repairs on older models be more expensive, the fridge will likely need additional repairs sooner than later, and a newer model will be more energy efficient., If you find that you are not using all of the space in your present refrigerator, consider replacing it with a smaller model. For instance, if your children have grown up and moved out, you may find that a full size fridge is no longer necessary for your household.

Remove the grille over the legs.,
Examine the legs.,
Rotate the legs.,
Measure the refrigerator’s tilt with a level.,
Measure the refrigerator’s slope.,
Replace the grille.",How to Level Your Refrigerator1," At the very bottom of the refrigerator, you may see a covering over the legs. Many times, this grille can be removed by pulling with your hands. Some grilles will be attached by clips or screws you’ll have to undo first.Consult your owner’s manual for advice when you’re unsure of how to remove the grille.;
, Check the legs first for screws or bolts that you’ll need to adjust. While some legs can be rotated freely, some require a wrench or a screwdriver. Refrigerators made by GE, for example, require a flat blade screwdriver.

, Look along the top and bottoms of the legs. You’ll either see a slot near the top or a screw or bolt near the bottom. Use a flat-head screwdriver on the slots and an adjustable wrench or pliers on the bolt. Turn clockwise to raise the refrigerator. Turn counterclockwise to lower the refrigerator. Try to get the refrigerator level from left to right.Legs without fasteners, such as those on Whirlpool refrigerators, can be turned to the right to lower the refrigerator and to the left to raise it.If you cannot reach the legs to adjust them, you’ll need someone to lean the refrigerator to the back. Be very careful and don’t tilt it back too far.

, Place the level on the top of the refrigerator behind the door. The level will be flat if the refrigerator is even from left to right. Adjust the legs to get the refrigerator even from left to right., Place the level against the bottom of the refrigerator. It should slope slightly to the back. Make sure the front is .25 inches (6.35 mm) higher than the back. Make adjustments to the front legs as necessary., Push the grille back onto the bottom of the refrigerator. Replace any clips or screws.

,
Check to make sure both machines are level.,
Adjust the feet at the bottom of each machine as needed.,
Run both machines to ensure that they are working.",How to Hook up a Washer and Dryer," Before you try to install your washer and dryer, measure the area where you intend to put them to ensure they will fit. Keep in mind that your dryer will need about four inches of additional space in the back for venting., Installing the machines on carpet, soft tile, or any weakly supported structure is inadvisable, as the machines may be unstable or damage the floor., The instructions provided here will apply to most washers and dryers, but you should read the instructions that came with your machines in case they include any special features that might require additional steps.

, Unless your house has never been lived in, it is important to make sure your dryer vent is free and clear of all debris, as a blocked vent may be a fire hazard.








Most home improvement stores can sell you an inexpensive vent brush. Starting from indoors, insert the brush a few inches and spin, then remove the brush and clean off the bristles. Repeat until the bristles come out clean.
After cleaning the indoor side of the vent, go outside and remove the vent hood to ensure it is clear of all lint and debris.
It's a good idea to clean your vent every two years. In addition to the safety issues that a blocked vent can cause, drying clothes with a blocked vent can damage your dryer and void your warranty., Leave yourself a couple of feet of space behind the dryer so you can stand comfortably while hooking up the vent hose.


If using metal ducting instead of a flexible hose, you'll need to move the dryer all the way into place and attach the ducting while standing alongside the machine.

, Place one end of the vent hose over the vent hole in the back of the dryer.









If space permits, it is a good idea to use a metal vent duct, as ribbed plastic and aluminum hoses can catch lint and clog more easily. Joints in the metal duct should be sealed with duct tape, as screws may also catch lint. The end should fit snugly into the machine, so no clamps or tape should be needed.The straighter the vent, the better it will function, as lint can gather in areas where the hose bends. This is another good reason to use metal ducting rather than a plastic or flexible aluminum hose.If using a plastic vent hose, slip a circular dryer clamp over the hose to hold it securely in place.
Make sure your clamps are the right size and fit tightly. Many hoses come with clamps that are made to fit.

, If using a flexible hose, clamp it into place, as in step 3. A metal duct will not require clamps but should just slide into place.

,, Place a bucket or tub underneath the hot and cold water outlets you'll be hooking up to and run some water through each. This will clear any debris that might clog your valve screens. Afterwards, make sure the faucets are turned completely off.

, Make sure you have enough room to navigate either to the side of the washing machine or behind it to hook up the water supplies.


Most hoses only have a reach of a few inches; you may need to leave yourself room on the side to hook it up.

, Make sure the hot water hose is connected to the hot water faucet and the cold water hose is connected to the cold.









Many hoses are color coded, with red for hot and blue for cold. Others are not marked, so it will be up to you to remember which is which when it comes time to connect to the washer.
The end of the hose that has a filter screen in the coupling attaches to your faucet. If the filter screen is not yet in the hose, insert one into the coupling before attaching the hose to the wall. The screens should be included with your hoses.Turn the coupling clockwise by hand until tight. Then, with a pair of flyers, tighten the coupling by rotating it another quarter to half a turn. Do not over-tighten, as this may cause leaks., Make certain the correct hose is attached to the correct inlet.









The ends of the hoses with plain rubber washers attach to the washing machine. If the couplings do not have washers in them, insert the washers first, otherwise your hose will leak.
As with the screens,washers should be included with the hoses if not already inserted.
Tighten the couplings as in step 3.

, If hoses are leaking, turn off the water and double check that your couplings are tight and correctly threaded.








, The drain hose should screw onto the water outlet similarly to the water hoses. With some washing machine models, you may find it is already connected, so you can skip this step.

, Depending on your plumbing, you'll need to feed the hose into a drain on the floor, the wall, or into a laundry sink, or there may be a rigid pipe that extends down to a floor drain.









Your washer should come with accessories such as straps and/or a hook to help you secure the drain pipe. Consult the manual for your machine to learn how to use these parts correctly in conjunction with your plumbing.
Make sure to leave a space of several inches between the end of the hose and the bottom of the drain or sink, otherwise your machine may siphon drained water back up the drain pipe.

,, Uneven floor or incorrectly adjusted legs may prevent the machines from sitting flat. A level, available at any hardware store, will make it easy to tell if this is the case.


Failure to level your machines may result in damage to your machines or floor.

, Lift or tip the machines slightly off the ground to adjust the feet. Some feet will self-level and will fall down to the floor as you lift. Others will need to be twisted counterclockwise to loosen and level the machines' feet.








Consult the instructions that came with your machines for information on how to level them. Some machines require you to install feet or pads before you begin installing the machine., The washing machine should fill and drain completely, while the dryer should heat up quickly.

Replace fridges with interior wall damage.,
Test the door seal if you find condensation.,
Replace the seal yourself.",How to Know if You Should Replace Your Refrigerator2," Another cause of condensation or frost may be a crack in the interior shell of your refrigerator. These cracks will allow cold air to escape and are extremely hard to repair. If your refrigerator is still under warranty, contact the retailer or manufacturer to see about getting a replacement.It may be worth contacting an appliance repair professional before deciding to replace the fridge, but cracks in the shell usually mean the appliance will need to be replaced.

, If water is collecting on any surface of your fridge, including the exterior, this may be a sign that the door seal is no longer airtight. Excessive frost in the freezer or on the exterior of the fridge may also indicate a faulty seal.Look at the rubber gasket all the way around the door to ensure it hasn't come loose somewhere. If so, you may be able to push it back in.
Test the seal in multiple spots by closing the door onto a piece of paper money. Try to pull the bill out of the door slowly. If it easily slides out, you may be able to fix the fridge by replacing the rubber gasket that runs around the edge of the door.

, You may be able to replace your refrigerator's seal yourself. You can likely get a kit that contains the materials necessary to do so from your local hardware store or an online retailer.Be sure any kit you purchase is compatible with your fridge. You may have to order a special kit from the refrigerator's manufacturer.
Kits to replace the gasket on most refrigerators cost about $50.

Have a pro look at a noisy fridge.,
Feel the air behind the fridge.,
Pay attention to the fridge’s temperature.",How to Know if You Should Replace Your Refrigerator3," You shouldn’t be able to hear your fridge running all of the time. This indicates the motor is going at full blast trying to keep the fridge cold. If a fridge is running properly, the motor will only run periodically.Note that your fridge’s motor will run more often if the door is frequently opened. For instance, if you’re having a party and people are going in and out of the fridge, the motor will run more frequently.

, If you feel excessive heat coming from your fridge, have a appliance repair professional come take a look at it. There are coils on the back of the fridge that release heat regularly, but it shouldn’t be too noticeable unless you’re nearly touching the insulation that covers the coils.If the fridge is emanating heat, it likely needs new coils. Weigh the cost of repairing your fridge against buying a new one. It is often worth buying a newer, more efficient fridge in these cases.

, If you notice food going bad more quickly than expected, or that you have to keep turning the fridge’s thermometer down to keep items cool, your fridge has probably become less efficient.Whenever you notice a fridge is not working as well as it used to, have it looked it by a professional. For instance, a freezer that's running too cold is also an issue.
Even if it is still working, the fridge may be using more energy than it should, not to mention increasing your energy costs.

, Try to use a cleaning product such as smelly washer twice a month to keep the mold from growing.

, Get them out as soon as the cycle is finished. If clothes are left for a long period of time mold growth can begin to form from the moisture in the clothes which will cause your clothes to smell moldy.

,, Keep it open for a few hours to dry out. Mold begins to grow if the lid is down because the moisture with the laundry detergent is a breeding ground for the mold to grow.

If your washer is giving you an error code, check to see what the manual says the problem is. The most common error code for long drain time is F9 E1, but your washer may be different. If the manual says your pump needs to be replaced, you need to call a repair man or refer to How to Replace a Washing Machine Water Pump.;
, Remove the drain hose from the back of the washer. Run a moderate to high pressure water stream through it (an outdoor water hose connection works great). If it is clogged, this should force the clog out.


Replace the hose on the machine, ensuring that the outlet the hose goes into is not more than 8 feet (2.4 m) from the floor, that the end of the hose is no more than 4.5 inches (11.4 cm) into the drain hole, that the drain hole is not taped shut, and that the hose is not kinked or bent. These can all affect your drain time.

, If it drains, you are done. If it doesn't, proceed to step 4.

, First, unplug the machine. Then find out where the pump is located on your machine. It is usually in the back for top loaders and in the front below the door for front loaders. You may have to remove a panel to get to it. When you find the pump, there will be a section that is round with an oval handle in the center. It will probably be white plastic.

, Don't be afraid to apply pressure, it is a very tight seal. Make sure you have a bucket and towels ready to catch any water that gushes out. Inside, you will probably find a lot of lint, some change, and possibly some small pieces of cloth or socks.

, Stick your finger in the hole to the right of the screen and make sure nothing is caught in the pump fan and that it moves freely, then replace the filter, turning it clockwise until it is tight, and then replace any panels you removed.

, Your washer should drain quickly. If it does not, your pump needs to be replaced, in which case you can call a repair man or refer to How to Replace a Washing Machine Water Pump.

Start here for a top-loaded washer.,
Depress the lid switch with a pen.,
Approach the problem


If there is no sign that the machine is trying to drain, this switch is probably broken.",How to Fix a Washer That Will Not Drain Its Water Before Going Into Spin Cycle1," This method only applies to top-loaded washers. If you use a front-loaded washer, skip down to the section on unclogging the pump.;
, Open the lid of your washer, on the top of your machine. A small gap with a switch inside should be located where the edge of the lid hits the washer. Press this switch down with a plastic pen, toothbrush handle, or similar object. This tells the washer that the lid is closed, which should start an attempt to drain the machine.

, Order a replacement part from the manufacturer.
If the machine drains successfully, the switch works but may be bent out of shape. Try to bend this gently, until closing the lid depresses the switch. Replace this part if necessary.
If the machine makes noise but fails to drain, try unclogging the pump, as described below.

,
After installing the hose, turn the dryer on regular and go outside and make sure that you get a good air flow to the outside.

",How to Improve the Lifespan of your Clothes Dryer," If the clothes are being dried properly with the hose disconnected, the problem is on the hose, between behind the dryer to the outside of the house. Do not perform this test if you are using a gas dryer.;
,,"
"
Understand the problem.,
Listen to the hum of the motor.,
Pause the machine.,
Redistribute the load.",How to Get a Washing Machine to Spin Faster1," Most modern, front-loading washing machines have intelligent load sensing systems. If your machine detects an uneven load, it may bypass your selected spin speed for a slower one to avoid damage due to vibration. A good portion of machines can attempt to rebalance an uneven load, but will still drop to a slower speed, if these attempts fail. This is the most common cause of slow spinning.


These features include motor torque, RPM detection, and drum weight detection.;
, Listen to the washing machine during the slow ""shuffle"" before it begins spinning:


If the motor noise varies instead of staying at a constant tone, the load is probably unbalanced. Continue to the next step.
If it sounds jittery or ""jumpy"" you may have a mechanical failure, described in the section below. These are rarely the cause of slow spinning, so you may want to try balancing the load first anyway.

, Pause the machine and wait for it to stop spinning.

, It is not always possible to get a perfectly balanced load, but you can usually balance it enough to increase speed significantly. Here are some tips for how to arrange the laundry:


Light, polyester clothing should be in the middle of the load.
Towels and other large items should wrap all the way around the clump of clothing, rather than bunch up in one large ball.

"
"
Turn off the power to the washing machine.,
Place a large bucket next to the machine.,
Shut off the water supply (optional).,
Detach the drain hose from the water supply (optional).,
Let the hose drain into the bucket.,
Tuck towels against the machine.,
Remove the pump maintenance port.,
Clean out the pump.,
Reattach all parts.,
Test the machine.",How to Fix a Washer That Will Not Drain Its Water Before Going Into Spin Cycle2," Unplug the machine so you can handle it safely. Never work on the interior of a machine while it still has power, or you could be electrocuted or injured by moving parts.

, Choose a bucket you can easily lift when filled with water.

, An unpowered machine should not allow more water to enter the system. If you want to be extra safe, find the supply hoses leading from the back of the machine, and disconnect them where they meet the plumbing. The supply hose or hoses are smooth, not rippled. Disconnect them by turning each valve so it runs across the pipe, instead of along it.A cold-only supply is grey or blue. If there is a second supply hose for hot water, it is usually red. Both hoses are smooth.

, The drain hose is grey and rippled, similar to a vacuum cleaner hose. Detach it on the plumbing end by removing the twist tie, or by unscrewing the hose clamp if present. Ease off the hose, which may be firmly attached. Do not lower the hose or let it fall to the ground.


If there's a kink in the hose, this could be the problem. Straighten the hose, restore water and power, and run a spin cycle to see if the machine drains. If not, shut off water and power again and continue to the next step.

, Lots of waste water will flow out quite quickly. When the bucket is mostly full, lift the hose back up and reattach it to its connection again while you empty the bucket. Repeat until no more water leaves the hose.


If you empty the bucket into the same sink that feeds your machine, pour slowly. There's a chance that some water will flow through the open connection to the hoses.
When the water flow slows, tilt the bucket forward so you can bring the hose closer to the ground
If no water comes out, there is probably a blockage in the hose. Clearing this or replacing the hose may fix your problem.

, This next part usually gets messy. Lay a few dirty towels on the floor, against the front of the machine. Tuck them under the machine if possible.


On some machines, a thin baking tray can fit under the gap between the floor and the base of the machine. Use this as well as the towels if possible.

, Some machines have a blank plastic cover over this area, while others have a small ""door."" On a front-loaded machine, either type is usually located on the front of the machine, near the base. Look up instructions for your model, or search for and disconnect it on your own:


Most plastic covers are attached by plastic tabs. These break easily, so work slowly and methodically. Tug repeatedly until each tab unlatches, without using excessive force.
Square, door-like ports are sometimes attached by tabs as well, but some have a simple handle.
Round plugs often have a retaining screw, which you'll need to remove and set aside. Slowly twist the plug anticlockwise (this may require force). If water seeps out, wait until it's all come out before you remove the plug completely. If necessary, tighten the plug again while you replace the soaked towels.

, Once the port is removed, you should see the pump on the other side. Use a crochet needle, a wire with the end bent back, or a similar small item to reach into the pump. Clean out all the lint and any trapped objects you find. Be thorough, as there may be more than one object.


If you did not find any items, turn on your phone light or torch. Shine it into the pump interior, at the pump paddles. Use a long, thin spoon or other object to gently turn the paddles. If the paddles turn, the pump is probably not clogged.

, Follow the above instructions in reverse to reattach the port panel, retaining screw (if present), and hose. Restore the water supply and power.

, Open the machine door and fill the tumbler with enough water that you can see it above the holes at the bottom. Close the door and put on a spin cycle only. If the water drains, congratulations, you've solved the problem. If it does not, there may be an electrical fault to the pump. This requires a qualified washing machine technician to repair.

Use this method if your plumbing overflows.,
Shut off the water supply to the washer (optional).,
Block overflow holes.,
Plunge the sink.",How to Fix a Washer That Will Not Drain Its Water Before Going Into Spin Cycle3," If waste water rises into the sink, or wherever your washer is attached, follow these instructions. Because the water is connected to an open channel in your washer, you will need to block this before you plunge.

, This is not usually necessary, as your washing machine should automatically block water from entering. If you want to be extra safe, follow the smooth supply hoses at the back of your washing machine until they reach the plumbing. If valves are present, turn them so they lie across the pipe, blocking water to the hose. If there are no valves, remove the hoses, then plug the hole with a wet, tightly rolled cloth.

, If the waste water is coming out of a sink, look for overflow holes near the top of the sink. Plug these. You should be able to fill the sink at least ¼ of the way full, to act as a ""driving medium"" pushing the blockage down.

, When plunging, alternate between fast, repetitive movement (as though thumping a drum), and a steadier pace (as though using a bike tire). The first motion breaks apart the bond between clumped debris. The second drives the chunk of matter away. Continue plunging until the water drains.

"
"
Listen to the motor.,
Access the motor.,
Check for signs of damaged belts.,
Adjust the motor and belt.",How to Get a Washing Machine to Spin Faster2," Although rare, a machine can encounter mechanical problems that slow down the machine's spin. This may be your issue if the motor sounds jittery or ""jumpy,"" constantly adjusting its speed.


This is usually caused by a motor that's become offset so the belt no longer wraps tightly around it. A modern machine will attempt to adjust its RPM to keep the drum spinning at a constant rate, and the loose belt causes these adjustments to happen frequently.

, Let the machine drain and disconnect it from the power supply. Take apart your washing machine to give yourself access to the motor.


This is much easier if you have your washing machine manual.

, If the belt is old or has been slipping for some time, it may be wearing down. If there is visible wear on the belt, or if you see black, sooty powder on the floor beneath it, it is already damaged. Purchasing a replacement part is recommended.


If the machine is under warranty, the manufacturer may replace this part for free or a reduced cost.

, If the belt is loose, but not visibly damaged, adjusting the motor should fix the problem. Loosen the nuts holding the motor in place, then pull the motor with some gusto while tightening the nuts again. The belt should fit quite tightly around the motor. The belt is reinforced with a strong braid, so don't worry about breaking it.


This may be easier with some help.

Find out the reason for the shaking during the spin cycle.,
Try to tip or tilt the machine.,
Re-level your machine and ensure it is supported correctly.,
Use a pair of pliers if the thumbscrews are too tight to turn with your fingers, and spraying the screws with a lubricant may help, also.

,
Restart your machine when you have made sure all the leveling screws are in contact with the floor.

,
Use shims to support the machine if the screws have become unusable for some reason (broken, stripped, or otherwise damaged).,
Cut a number of shims, about 3 or 4 inches (7.6 or 10.2 cm) in width, and stack them under each corner where they are needed, until the corners are equally supported.

,
Restart the machine and observe your results.

",How to Fix a Shaking Washing Machine," The cause will usually be either a badly out of balance load, or a poorly leveled and set up machine.


Balance the load of clothes by opening the lid, and looking to see if there is a lot more on one side of the agitator than the other, and if this is the problem, move them around, close the lid, restart the spin cycle, and observe the results. You may try repositioning the clothes in the tub slightly more if you original efforts helped significantly.
If the machine is brand new and already started behaving this way from its first use, then it is possible that the shipping bolts were not removed from the back of the machine before first use. This would cause violent vibration during the spin cycle. You can check if this is the case easily by opening the door on a front-loader washing machine and pushing down on the drum. If the shipping bolts are still fixed to the machine, then the drum will not move vertically at all. If they have been removed by the person that installed it, as they should have been, then the drum should sink slightly under the pressure of your hand and then spring back up when released.;
, If it wobbles when you do, the adjustment screws on the machine's base may not be set correctly, or on older machines, the threads may be stripped or corroded out, causing them to fail.

, This is done by kneeling down in front of the machine, and rocking it to see which corner seems to be floating, or not in contact with the floor. The leveling screw should be screwed out (clockwise, if viewed from above), which lengthens it, or the adjacent side should be screwed in (shortened), so that each leveler is in contact with the floor.

,,, Shims can be made of almost any resilient, non-degradable material which can be cut easily, like scrap vinyl composition tile, rubber matting, or even plastic margarine container lids.

Read the manual for your washer.,
Avoid electrical shock.,
Grab some towels.,
Figure out where to put the water.,
Wait for the water to cool.",How to Drain a Washing Machine by Hand1," The methods included here are fairly standard and should generally work with most washers. Even so, break out your owner’s manual and read over the appropriate sections, just in case any directions or advice are particular to that manufacturer and/or model. Check its table of contents or index for subjects like:


Drainage issues and troubleshooting
Disconnecting and reconnecting drain hoses and/or filters;
, Draining your washer shouldn’t be an out-of-control project with water flying everywhere, but play it safe anyway. If your washer is plugged into a power outlet, unplug it. If it’s hardwired into your electrical system instead, switch off the appropriate circuit breaker. Eliminate the risk of electrocution just in case you experience any unforeseen mishaps.Do the same with any other electrical devices in the immediate area.

, Again, this project shouldn’t create a huge mess, but be prepared for at least a little water to possibly go wild. Before you begin, set yourself up with some towels to keep on hand. Make clean-up a cinch by having them within easy reach in case you spill any water on the floor or elsewhere.Draining a front-loading machine is more likely to be messy than a top-loading machine, so if that’s what you have, expect more spills.
In addition to towels, you could also lay out a tarp, dropcloth, or similar material on the floor around your washer.

, This may seem like a no-brainer, but make life easier by knowing exactly how you’ll dispose of the water before you start. If your laundry room has a drain in the floor, use that. If your washer is in a bathroom and has a drainage hose that will reach, use your bathtub or shower stall. Otherwise, have a bucket or dish ready to transport the water to a sink or tub elsewhere in your home.Be aware that used water from your washer is usually considered “gray water.” Your local, state, or even federal government may have laws regarding the proper disposal of gray water. This means that you may not be allowed to simply toss it outside so it can soak into the ground.
If you need to use a bucket or dish, consider the area that you need to cross between the washer and the drain that you choose. You may want to protect surfaces or clear the area of anything easily damaged by water in case any spills out along the way.

, If you only used cold water for your last load, go ahead and skip this step. If, however, you used hot water, give it time to cool off before you attempt draining. Don’t make things worse by scalding yourself.This is especially important with front-loading machines. With these, you can’t open the door and test the water, and your hands will definitely get wet once you start draining.
The time it takes for the water to cool off to a safe temperature will vary by your settings and your machine. As a precaution, wear safety gloves when you start your project.

Make sure your washing machine is on a level surface.,
Check for common quick fixes.,
See if oversudsing could be the problem.,
Run a cycle and watch where the water leaks.,
Methodically replace the most common leaky parts.",How to Fix a Leaky Washer1," To determine where the washer is leaking, you'll need to look at where the water is pooling and try to figure out where it's coming out of the machine. If the washing machine is not level, the water will run and it will be more difficult to know where the leak is occurring.






;
, Before you decide to replace hoses and gaskets, determine whether the leak is stemming from an issue that can be corrected more easily. Check the machine manufacturer's instructions to make sure you're using it properly. Here are a few common easily fixable problems:


An overloaded or unbalanced washer. If you're trying to load up the washer with too many clothes, that can cause water to leak out. Leaking issues can also happen if the washer has been loaded so that heavier clothes are on one side, causing an imbalance that shakes the washer during the spin cycle.

A tendency to interrupt the rinse cycle to add more time. If your rinse cycle has a spray rinse function, adding more time while it's spraying can cause the spray to go on for longer than it's supposed to, leading to leakage.

Make sure the manufacturer's drain plug is removed. If your washing machine is brand new, it comes with a drain plug that needs to be removed before you hook up the drain hose. If you run the cycle without removing the plug the washer won't drain properly.














Make sure the drain hose is properly secured in the drainpipe. If it's not attached properly, that could be the source of the leak.














Make sure the drain isn't clogged. It might seem like the washer is leaking when in reality your drain is backed up. Make sure it's clear before trying to do repairs.














, When the soap you put in your washer produces too many suds, it can cause overflow problems and lead to leaks. This is a common issue in households with water softeners, which make soap suds up more easily. If you have a water softener, you don't need to use as much soap to get the job done.









To see if oversudsing is the issue, do a load of laundry as you normally would. When you take the load out of the washer, put an article of clothing in a bowl of water and swish it around a bit. If the water gets sudsy, your clothes still have soap in them, and you're probably using too much soap.

, Do a load of laundry the same way you normally would and check to see where the washing machine seems to be dripping. Often you can find out what the problem is just by looking for the spot where the water leaks from the machine.









Leaks at the front of the washer are often caused by a clogged overflow tube or an improperly-fitted old seal (in a front-loading washer).
Leaks at the back of the washer are often caused by loose or damaged supply hoses.
Leaks under the washer are often caused by a hole in the water pump or leaky internal hoses.

, If you can't pin down the exact cause of the leak, and you have an older washing machine, replacing or repairing the hoses and fixing the other most likely culprits is your best bet. Over time washing machine parts can get clogged or lose elasticity, leading to leaks. They'll need to be replaced eventually, so you might as well do it now and try to catch the leak!









If you don't want to make all the repairs at once, start with the first most common repair, run your machine to see if it still leaks, and make the next repair on the list. Keep doing this until you've fixed the leaky part.
If after making all the common repairs your washing machine still leaks, call your machine manufacturer to see if they can help you assess the problem. It might be time to bite the bullet and call a washing machine repair person to come over and finish the job.

Locate the drainage filter.,
Raise the front of the machine, if it’s safe to do so.,
Remove the panel and set up your gear.,
Unscrew, drain, and repeat.,
Lower your machine and finish draining.",How to Drain a Washing Machine by Hand2," Look along the bottom of the front of your machine. Find the small panel that covers the drainage filter. Most panels these days are hinged and can be easily removed without tools, but if your panel is screwed into place, find an appropriate screwdriver. However:Don’t remove the panel just yet. For now, just note its location.

, Note that the drainage filter is along the very bottom of your machine, which means you’re going to have to use a very shallow dish to catch water coming out of it. To make life easier, pull the machine away from the wall just enough for you to tip it back a little. Lift the front end a few inches off the floor. Slide bricks or solid blocks of wood underneath the front corners for them to rest on while you work so you can use a deeper dish. However, keep in mind that:The washer weighs a lot on its own, and the water inside makes it even heavier. If possible, have a partner help you with this step to make it easier.
Do not attempt lifting your machine if you don't think you're able to do so, even with a partner. Skipping this step just means more trips to and from your drain. This may be a pain figuratively speaking, but it’s better than injuring yourself for real.

, Unscrew or unhinge the panel to your drainage filter. Lay a towel over the floor directly underneath. Then, depending on your machine’s design:


Set a shallow bowl, dish, or similar container directly below the filter if no funnel or similar device is included behind the panel.If there is a funnel or similar device to carry water away from the machine, extend it and set your dish below that., Once your towel and dish is in place, start unscrewing the drainage filter very slowly. Once it opens just enough for water to start trickling out in a manageable stream, stop unscrewing. Let the dish fill close to capacity, then screw the filter shut again. Dispose of the drained water, then repeat until no more water empties out of your machine.Don’t unscrew the filter all the way. This will enable more water than your dish can hold to spill out of the machine all at once. It will also make it difficult for you to fit the filter back into place and seal it shut as water continues to empty out.

, If you propped the front of your machine up on bricks, keep in mind that there is still some water inside, even though it has quit draining. Make sure the filter is sealed tight, then remove the bricks and set the machine back on the floor. Now finish draining your machine as you did before, using a shallower dish if necessary.Tipping your machine backward and propping the front up on bricks causes the water inside to gravitate toward the back.

"
"
Pull your machine out from the wall.,
Detach the drain hose from the wall.,
Fill your bucket.,
Finish draining the last of the water into a bottle.",How to Drain a Washing Machine by Hand3," If you’re worried about scratching up your floor, lift the front end of your machine so a partner can lay a dropcloth, blanket, or similar material underneath. Then do the same with the back, if possible. Once you’re ready, slowly pull the machine away from the wall. Stop once you’re able to reach the drain hose in back. Don’t pull it out so far that you end up yanking any hoses out of the wall.If the machine’s too heavy for you to move, open the lid. Use a pitcher or similar container to ladle water out into your bucket. Empty as much water as you like this way, or just until the machine’s light enough for you to move.
If you’re working by yourself and the machine’s still too heavy even after you’ve ladled out as much water as you can, ask a partner to help you.

, Uncouple the drain hose where it meets the drainage pipe inside your wall. Be careful to keep that end of the hose raised higher than the machine itself as you do. Expect gravity to start pumping water out of the hose before you’re ready if you lower it.You’ll need to do this even if you ladled all the water out of the machine’s inner drum. There is still water underneath that, which you can’t reach through the top of the machine., Avoid spills by feeding the hose’s open end inside the bucket before setting the bucket on the floor. As the hose lowers, water will start pumping out on its own, so keep an eye on the bucket’s water level as it rises. Once it fills as much as you’d like, simply raise the hose’s open end above the machine to stop the flow. Drain the bucket and repeat until no more water comes out.Although it may be tempting to use the largest bucket possible and fill it all the way up, remember the distance you have to carry it. Only empty as much at a time that you can safely carry without sloshing any over the sides.
Alternately, you can simply aim the hose’s open end over a floor drain or into a bathtub if there’s one within its reach.

, To completely drain your machine, lower the hose to floor level. The rim of your bucket or bathtub is probably too high for this, so switch to a gallon-size jug or bottle. Lay it on its side and cover its mouth with the hose’s open end. Drain the bottle as it fills up, and repeat until the job is done.If the hose’s open end is larger than the bottle’s mouth, try using a funnel to reduce spills.

Turn off the power supply.,
Check and repair the supply hoses.,
Check and repair the internal hoses.,
Determine if the pump is leaky.",How to Fix a Leaky Washer2," Make sure your washing machine's power supply is off before you try to make any repairs. Making repairs while the power supply is on could cause injury.








, These are located at the back of the machine, and they feed water into the machine during the wash cycle. Old or damaged supply hoses are a common cause of leaks located at the back of the machine. If you have a supply hose leak, the leak will continuously drip throughout the wash cycle. Here's how to repair water supply hoses:









Turn off the water main or shutoff valve.













Unscrew the supply hoses with pliers.













Examine the hoses. If they look old and corroded, replace the hoses with no-burst hoses and new washers.If the hoses are still in good shape, replace the internal washers. Old washers lose elasticity and don't fit as tightly.
Make sure all of the connections are tight and secure before using the washer again.

, The hoses inside the machine can also get corroded and worn out, and they need to be replaced from time to time. To access the internal hoses, you'll need to open the washing machine's cabinet or the panel behind which the hoses lie by unscrewing the bolts.









Look for old, corroded or ripped hoses and rusty hose clamps.
To remove a hose, use pliers to squeeze the hose clamp and slide it down the hose, then remove the hose.
Replace the old hoses and hose clamps with new parts., The pump moves the water from the tub of the washing machine to the drain. It's made with internal seals that can get worn out over time, leading to leaks.If you see signs that the pump is leaking - evidence of staining or rust - it will need to be replaced.








By the correct replacement pump for your machine.
Open your washing machine's cabinet.
Loosen the motor mounting bolts.
Disconnect the pump hoses and unscrew it, then remove it from the machine. Replace it with the new pump.

Understand what causes the smell to begin with.,
Understand why it grows there.,
Understand that cleaning your washer and leaving the door open will never solve the problem.,
In order to stop the mold from growing, you have to remove at least one of the 4 components to mold growth.,
Once you have installed your washer fan, just simply leave the door slightly open when you are not running your washer.,
Make sure to not use too much laundry detergent.,
Clean out your washer’s water pump filter periodically, as things do get caught in there from time to time.",How to Fix a Front Load Washer So That It Does Not Smell with Washer Fan," It is multiple types of mold (including black mold) growing in the internal drain hose inside your washer where you can’t see it.;
, Search ""mold growth"" and you will see that the biggest problem is high humidity (over 60%). This chart shows you at what relative humidity mold starts to grow. It starts at around 55% and by the time you get to 70% the chance of mold growth is close to 100%. Because it starts growing at about 55% we highly recommend you keep your relative humidity (RH) of your laundry area under 50% at all times. A dehumidifier is the best way to lower your RH.

, They will just help with the odor for a little while. This picture is of the internal drain hose inside your washer where the black mold starts to grow. The internal drain hose should look milk-jug clear, unless it is a grey hose. Where the pipe looks dark is the black mold inside the pipe. Most internal drain hoses are ribbed pipes and once the mold starts to grow it is very difficult to clean it out. When you just occasionally use special cleaners you are not solving what caused the mold to start growing to start with. This is why a washer fan is so important in permanently eliminating washer odor.

, In this case you need to lower the humidity level inside your washer drum below 50%. You can do this with a washer fan. You can purchase one online; just search the internet for ""washer fan"". You can install it yourself in seconds and there are videos on the website showing you how to do it. You can permanently fix the problem rather than covering it up.

, This allows the air being pushed into the drum to be exhausted out the front. As air exhausts out the front, it brings high RH with it and thereby lowers the humidity level inside the drum.

, Using too much soap only feeds the mold and can also wear out your washer prematurely. This image is the backside of the inner drum of a Whirlpool Duet washer that is about 5 years old. When you use too much soap (especially dry granular soap) it builds up over time and keeps parts of the washer wet continually. This leads to premature failure of your machine.

, You can find details about your particular washer online, as some owner’s manuals do not cover how to do this. Debris and biofilm trapped in your washer’s water pump filter can add to the odor problem. There are lots of videos online showing you how to get at your particular washer’s clean out and how to clean it out.

Determine if you have hard or soft water.,
If you have soft water, you only need about 1 tablespoon (1/16 cup) of liquid High Efficiency (HE) soap.,
If you have hard water, never use more than 2 tablespoons (1/8 cup) of liquid HE soap.,
After you have used the correct amount of soap (as outlined above), for a month or two, run the same test above just to make sure that with your water and the brand soap you use, it is the correct amount.,
Using too much soap also adds to the smell that most front load machines either have (or will have) over time.",How to Figure out How Much Laundry Soap a Front Load Washer Should Use," You need less soap when you have soft water.


You can do a quick test to see if you are currently using to much soap by simply running the washer on a normal cycle and DO NOT add any soap. Also do not add any clothes but run it empty.
Notice after about 5 minutes before it drains for the first time if you have soap bubbles on top of the water. You may need a flashlight to see into the drum through your glass door. You can also push the pause button an when you hear the click of the door lock release open the door to inspect.
Now close the door and resume the cycle. The very first fill cycle is when the soap that is normally added gets mixed in with the clothes. Every fill cycle after the first drain is only to rinse the clothes.
If you get bubbles after your last regular load, you were using so much soap that even with all the regular rinse cycles you were not able to totally rinse out the soap. This will shorten the life of your clothing as they are not meant to have soap in them when the wash cycle is over.
You can also test to see if you have residual soap built up in your laundry by putting in a load of CLEAN towels that have not been used yet and run a normal cycle but DO NOT add any soap. Check again toward the end of the first cycle and see if you have any bubbles in the water. If you do, you have soap in the towels from previous washings.;
, Some people will tell you that you need to use powdered HE soap vs liquid HE soap. As someone who has worked on the front load machines and taken them totally apart to fix them. Powdered soap that does not totally dissolve can get into the nooks and crannies of the internal metal parts of the machine, which over time cause the parts to fail prematurely. For this reason, use liquid and use the right amount for your water.

, For a reference, 2 tablespoons of liquid detergent just covers the bottom of the cap that the soap manufacturer gives you to measure out the soap.


Think about it, the soap manufacturer is in the business of selling soap and is not going to tell you to use less soap because that means less business for them. The manufacturer of your machine is also not going to tell you not to use too much soap because using too much soap will cause your machine to fail prematurely which means you will be a customer for them much sooner then you really need to be, which means more revenue for them.

, This is what the internal parts of you washer can look like if you have been using too much soap.

, The soap is a food for the black mold that grows inside the pipes of your machine, which is what you are smelling when you smell a foul odor. If you have been using close to the correct amount of soap, then you may not have that odor yet but given enough time most front load machines will get that smell.

Turn off the water valves.,
Pull or drag the washing machine away from the wall.,
Unplug the washing machine.,
Get a bucket.,
Detach the hoses from the machine.,
Remove the hoses from the wall.Turn the ends counterclockwise until the hoses detach.,
Remove the drain hose from the drain.,
Empty the water bucket.,
Double check your connections.,
Clean the intakes.,
Remove the power cord.,
Secure the drum.,
Wrap up your parts.",How to Disconnect a Washing Machine," Valves for the supply of hot and cold water are usually located behind the washing machine and in a washer box attached to the wall. Turn off the valves by turning them clockwise until they cannot be turned any further.









You'll want to turn these off first thing.This will protect you from major spills if you should accidentally tear a hose in step 2.;
, If working alone, grab one side and move it forward, then do the same with the other side. If you have help, try pulling on opposite sides simultaneously.









Pull the machine as far out as you can without putting stress on the hoses. Ideally, this will be far enough away from the wall that you can step behind the machine.If your house is on the newer side, some new water boxes are above the washer so it’s easier to reach the lines without moving the machine.

, Make sure the washing machine is not running, and pull the plug out of the outlet. This will disconnect the washing machine from its power supply.







, Place a water pan or bucket behind the washing machine, under the water lines where it will catch water. Surround the bucket with several towels to catch any additional leaks or water that may spill out when the pipes are detached.

, If they are attached with clamps, turn the screws atop the clamps counterclockwise until the clamps are loose. Then, point the ends of the hoses toward your bucket to drain any water. Alternatively, you can place them in the drain, located in the washer box.









It's a good idea to double-check that your valves are still off before doing this. Some styles of faucet handles are easy to accidentally turn back on, and this could have occurred as you moved the machine or when you stepped behind it.You may find it helpful to wait a few seconds after turning off the valves to try to remove the hoses, as this will allow the pressure in the hoses to abate, making them easier to remove.Turning on a few other faucets in the house may help them drain more quickly.

,









You may need to use adjustable pliers or a pipe wrench to loosen the hoses, especially if the machine hasn't been disconnected in a while.Once you've removed them, drain any remaining water into the bucket.

, Depending on your plumbing setup, this might be a laundry sink, a floor drain, a wall-mounted drain, or a tall stand-pipe. Each of these requires a slightly different process of hose removal. Consult the instructions that came with your machine if it is not immediately obvious.









Point the free end of this hose toward your bucket as well, to allow any water to flow out.

, Before moving the machine, get the water bucket out of the way. Wipe up any spills or drips. You wouldn't want to slip while moving the machine.

, Ensure there are no additional plugs or hoses connecting the washing machine to the wall. Continue moving the machine out of its place. There may be water inside the washing machine.

, If you are keeping this washer, this is a good opportunity to clean the water intakes with a bristle brush to remove any debris that may have accumulated over the years., Unless you are setting the machine back up in the same spot, it's a good idea to remove the power cord or, if it is not removable, tape it in place.This will protect the plug and prevent the cord from being pulled out accidentally during moving.
It's also a good idea to remove any knobs that can come off the machine, to prevent loss., If you will be moving the washing machine any significant distance, it is important to secure the ""drum,"" the inner chamber of the washer that moves.Depending on the model of your machine, this can be achieved with special bolts, a large y-shaped piece of foam, or even simply tightening some screws in the back.Consult your manual on how best to secure the drum in your machine. You may need to buy a special kit for this.

, If you are planning to move the machine any distance, leave your cords attached to the machine. You can tape any dangling cords to the sides of the washer to keep them out of your way.

Unplug the washing machine.,
Wait for a minute and then plug the washing machine back in.,
Open and close the door several times quickly.,
Test the washing machine.",How to Fix a Washing Machine That Stops Mid‐Cycle1," Often washing machine malfunctions are caused an electrical spike or computer malfunction. In these cases, unplugging the washing machine is the first step toward resetting the computer and fixing the issue.Usually this should be the first thing you try. It is less invasive or strenuous than other methods of fixing a malfunctioning washer.;
, Do not plug the washing machine back into the outlet immediately. Allow it to sit unplugged for a minute., Try to open and close the door 6 times in a span of 12 seconds. Many washing machines are set up so that this signals the computer to reset., To see if the washing machine is fixed, set it on “small load” and allow it to run without anything inside. If it runs through its full cycle, it is safe to begin washing clothes in it again.

Find the lid switch.,
Inspect the lid switch.,
Remove the lid switch.,
Test the lid switch with a multimeter.,
Order a new lid switch.,
Replace your lid switch.",How to Fix a Washing Machine That Stops Mid‐Cycle2," The lid switch is the part on top-loading washing machines, that sends the machine a signal indicating that the door is closed and that it is safe for the machine to run. It should be an oblong hole that is aligned so that a rod on the inside of the door will fit into it.Because this part takes a lot of wear and tear, it is prone to break. Thus, it is one of the most common reasons why washing machines stop at the spin cycle.

, You can often guess from appearance and touch whether the lid switch is broken. The switch should be level with the top panel that it is on. If it sags, it is likely broken.


Similarly, you can touch the lid switch to see if the spring underneath is functioning properly. If you press down on the lid switch and it does not give or spring back into place, then there is likely a problem with the lid switch., The process for removing a lid switch depends upon the model of washer. Review the instruction guide for directions on how to remove it or google “remove lid switch” and the model number and serial number for your washing machine. When you remove the lid switch, leave the wires attached.Be sure to unplug the washing machine before unscrewing any components.

, Put your multimeter on continuity mode. Find the connector to the lid switch. Unplug it and place the multimeter in the two outer connectors on the lid switch so that they touch the metal inside. Press down on the lid switch and test for continuity.The multimeter should recognize continuity when you press the lid switch down, as would happen if the door were closed, but should not recognize continuity if the button is not pressed down.

, Lid switches can be purchased online. They typically cost $10-20. Call your manufacturer and tell them the model number of the washing machine, so that they can direct you to lid switches that are compatible with your machine.

, You will need to consult the instructions for your specific model to determine how to replace the lid switch. However, if you have already removed the previous lid switch, it should not be too complicated. You will need to place the new lid switch where the old one had been, screw it in, and connect it to the electronic control board as the old lid switch had been.After the lid switch has been replaced, you will need to reinstall the console and plug the machine back into the wall.

Remove the control panel.,
Test the water level control valve.,
Clear water level control valve.,
Test the pressure switch with a multimeter.,
Replace the pressure switch according to specifications.",How to Fix a Washing Machine That Stops Mid‐Cycle3," The control panel is the interface with most of the buttons that you use to operate your washing machine. Use a screw driver to remove the screws that hold it in place., There should be a plastic tube underneath the control panel. It should be firmly plugged in. Remove this water level control valve and blow into it. The air should flow through naturally. If you can't exhale naturally there is a clog that needs to be fixed.If the tube is unplugged, then the washer might begin to work again if you properly reinsert it into the pressure switch.

, If the tube seems to be clogged, fill a turkey baster with vinegar and pump the vinegar down the tube. The vinegar will dissolve the soapy residue and should return the washing machine to normal., The plastic tube should connect to the pressure switch, which measures the amount of water in the washing machine. The pressure switch should be a circular piece that looks a bit like a gear, connected to a tube. It is generally directly underneath the control panel. Disconnect the wires and plug a multimeter in to check for continuity.There are three separate plugs, which also means that there are three pairs of connections to test with the multimeter. Test each of these pairs separately. There should be connectivity between all of the pairs.
If the washing machine isn’t filling up or is filling up with too much water, that is a good sign that there is an issue with the pressure switch or water level control valve.

, Each make and model will have its own unique method for replacing the pressure switch. If your test establishes that the pressure switch is the issue, check the instruction manual for directions on how to replace it.

Gather a notebook and writing utensil.,
Track the location of frozen food in your fridge.,
Chart your observations to find cold spots.",How to Identify Cold Spots in Your Fridge1," The main problem with cold spots is that they're invisible, which makes them easy to forget. Having a notebook and writing utensil handy in the kitchen will give you the opportunity to make a log of freezing.


You might find it even easier to remember this if you use a magnetic pen/notepad. This way, when you look at the fridge, you'll be reminded about cold spots.
Your fridge may have a few cold spots. To hone in on the location of these, you may want to draw a simple diagram of the shelves of your fridge and mark potential cold spots.;
, Location is the key element you'll need to track to find cold spots. The location of cold spots is usually consistent, so by tracking frozen food in your notebook, you'll be identifying cold spots.You should observe freezing in your fridge for two weeks for the most accurate cold spot identification.
Various factors, including the amount of food in your fridge, can influence freezing and give you false results. More observations will provide more reliable data., Now that you have a log of where food freezes in your fridge, you should be able to easily determine cold spots. Areas where food has consistently frozen are where you have cold spots in your fridge.


Even after finding the cold spots in your fridge, you might still forget where they are located from time to time. Mark these spots with a visible piece of tape, like a colored piece of painters tape.

Avoid placing a fridge or freezer near heat sources.,
Keep the door seals clean.,
Avoid overestimating your size needs.,
Keep the temperature of your fridge at 41ºF/5ºC.,
Avoid putting hot food into the fridge or freezer.,
Check the ventilation at the rear of the appliance.,
Keep the shelves stocked, with water bottles or ice packs if need be.The cold mass will help the unit recover quickly after door openings and reduce loss due to air changeover.

",How to Improve the Energy Savings of Your Fridge or Freezer," The most common source of heat in a kitchen is the oven and the dishwasher, but some kitchens also have a water heater in place as well. Keep the fridge or freezer well away from these heat sources. If you situate a fridge next to an oven, for example, the fridge will over-compensate for the heating up. For the same reason, it is also important to avoid placing a fridge or freezer in direct, constant sunlight.;
, If the doors don't shut tightly, energy is wasted. Clean them regularly and replace once worn.

, Only buy a fridge or freezer at the size for normal usage. The larger the fridge, the greater the energy usage. Your power bill will reflect this choice too!

, These are suitable temperatures that will save on energy usage. Every degree colder adds more greenhouse gas to the atmosphere.

, The appliance will try to compensate by cooling down the item. Equally, keep cold items cold by returning cold items to the fridge quickly after use.

, Good circulation of air around the coils helps the fridge or freezer work less hard, thereby using up less energy and your energy bills will be reduced. Keep the coils clean with a regular vacuum or dusting; dust decreases efficiency.

Pull the refrigerator away from the wall.,
Find the plastic water hose that brings water into the refrigerator.,
Inspect the water hose.,
Cut the water hose with a sharp knife about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) on either side of the leak.,
Splice the two ends of the water hose with a 5⁄16 inch (0.8 cm) ""union connector"" that is expressly for this purpose.,
Turn the water back on and be sure that your splice is watertight.,
Push the refrigerator back into place.

,
Celebrate saving $100!",How to Fix a Leaking Ice Maker," Many homes have a water shut off behind the refrigerator. Sometimes you need to shut off the water to the entire house. In that case, open a faucet to let the water pressure bleed off. You do not want to continue until the water supply is off.;
, It is much easier if you remove the contents (at least the liquids, which make up most of the weight).

, In most cases, this will be a white plastic flexible pipe about the thickness of a pencil. The hose will run from the wall or floor to the refrigerator.

, This is almost always the source of your leak. You may need to temporarily turn the water back on to find the leak. Remember to turn the water off again before proceeding.

, Be sure that your cut is straight and there are no burrs or extra bits of plastic left behind.

, The connector is available broadly. The connectors are less than two dollars before shipping. Buy extras because the water hose WILL leak again before you replace the refrigerator. The connect is a ""push on"" style, so you don't need tools to make the splice.

, This is important, because there may be more than one leak.

Does it need to have a freezer?,
Do you have size constraints?,
What color are you looking for?,
If you want a stainless steel façade, do you mind fingerprints showing up?,
How much refrigerator space do you need?,
What extras do you want?,
What is your budget?,
Have you considered your total consumption of perishable items?",How to Find the Perfect Refrigerator for Your Needs," If not, think about getting a freezer-less option. They offer excellent storage space. If it does need a freezer, where do you want it? You have options as to on top, bottom or the side. In deciding this you will also need to think about how much space you'll need and what kind of freezer you want. A good example is a side by side refrigerator; while it has a great deal of space, it doesn't allow anything wide to be placed in it. (Better measure that Thanksgiving turkey before bringing it home!);
, Does the refrigerator have a certain area that it has to fit into? Are there cabinets around it? If so, make sure you look for refrigerators that have a vent at the bottom otherwise the motor will burn out quickly.

, If you are looking for a color, is it one that will allow you to update your kitchen in the next 5-10 years or will the avocado green always make your kitchen look like it is stuck in the 70's? Remember, you will use it for a long time and if it can't withstand changes in your personal taste, trends and styles then you will regret it.

, Stainless steel will get fingerprints on it if it isn't treated with protective coatings, something that can be a nasty surprise for unsuspecting buyers.

, Remember to take into account what types of changes you expect in your life over the next 10 years. For example, if you're single now, you might get married, have kids and need more room.

, Do you need a built in ice maker? Do you long for an ice and water dispenser? Do you need adjustable shelves?

, Try not to rush into your decision because you may find that for only a few hundred dollars more you will get a lot closer to the refrigerator you want. In the end a few hundred dollars more is well worth being happy with your fridge for the next 10-15 years.

, If you live alone, you might want to consider a 3 cubic feet refrigerator. If you are a large family, say, with 5-7 members, you might consider getting a Side-by-Side refrigerator, which has much more capacity.

Find the lid switch.,
Inspect the lid switch.,
Review the instruction manual.,
Remove the lint screen.,
Remove the top.,
Unlock the door switch harness.,
Remove the lid switch.,
Replace the lid switch.,
Put the dryer back together.",How to Fix a Dryer That Will Not Start2," The lid switch signals that the door is closed. It should be an oblong hole opposite the door. It will be aligned so that a rod on the inside of the door will fit into it.Because this part takes a lot of wear and tear, it is prone to break.

, You can often get a good sense, just from appearance and touch, whether the lid switch is broken. The switch should be level with the top panel that it is on. It is broken if it is not flush with the surface of the panel.


Touch the lid switch to see if the spring underneath is functioning properly. If you press down on the lid switch and it does not give or spring back into place, it is probably broken., Because of variations in design, it is important to review the instruction manual to see recommendations for how to replace your lid switch. Alternatively search online for “remove lid switch” with the model number and serial number for your dryer., Generally, you will need to remove the lint screen to open the dryer. Pull out the lint screen. Then, use a screw driver to unscrew the lint screen housing panel that the lint screen fits into. After the screws are removed, pull out the housing panel.Always unplug the dryer before opening it up.

, Place putty knives under the left and right side of the top panel of the dryer. Lift simultaneously on both ends to pick up the cabinet top. Move it out of the way., Once you open the top of the dryer, you should be able to find a pair of wires connecting to the door. There should be a locking mechanism where two large plugs connect wires in the control panel to the wires in the door. Disconnect these two parts of the locking mechanism.


You might need to insert a slot screwdriver between the two plugs to release the locking mechanism., There should be two screws on either side of the lid switch, inside the door. Use a screw driver to unscrew these and pull out the lid switch., Put your replacement lid switch where the old lid switch had been. Screw it into place. Connect the wires on the lid switch to the locking mechanism that you disconnected earlier., Lower the top of the dryer back down. Screw the lint trap back into place. Plug the dryer back in."

Open the control panel.,
Remove the start switch.,
Use an ohmmeter to test connectivity.,
Remove the old start switch.,
Insert a new start switch.",How to Fix a Dryer That Will Not Start3," The control panel is the interface with all the buttons on it. Unscrew the screws holding it into place, or, on some models, unscrew the back panel behind it to access controls. Set the control panel someplace where it will be safe.As with most dryer repairs you should unplug your dryer before beginning this.
Skip this method if you have an electronic interface. Start switch malfunctions generally occur when the start button is an older, mechanical model., The start switch is the button that you press to start the dryer. There should be wires on the back of it that are connected to the start switch with metal parts. Use pliers to pull on the metal connectors, rather than the wires themselves, to disconnect the wires from the start switch.Take note of which wires insert into which parts of the start switch. You will need to correctly reconnect these wires to the appropriate spots.

, Insert the ohmmeter into the start switch and measure at a resistance of R X 1. The ohmmeter should record a reading of infinity. Now press down and hold on the start switch. The ohmmeter should now record a connectivity of zero.If the ohmmeter correctly records that the start switch has connectivity, then you should stop here. If it does not give correct readings, you should replace it.

, You should pull the knob out from the front. Then remove the hardware of the start switch from the back. On the back, there might be a locking tab connecting the start switch to the panel. Press down on it with a screw driver and pull out to release the start switch., Place the new start switch where the old one was. Connect the wires correctly to the places where they had previously been connected on the old model. After the switch is inserted, you put the control panel back on and plug the dryer in."

Select a suitable thermometer.,
Fill multiple glasses with equal amounts of water.,
Insert the glasses in your fridge and wait.,
Take the temperature of each glass of water.",How to Identify Cold Spots in Your Fridge2," A regular thermometer should work for this method of finding cold spots, but a higher quality one will give the most accurate reading. Being able to clearly differentiate between temperatures will make it easier to pinpoint cold spots.


Avoid touching the temperature gauge of your thermometer with your hands or fingers. Oil and heat from your hands can influence the temperature reading., Use the same kind of glass for each one. Different glasses may cool down more or less easily and ruin your results. The amount of water in each glass should also be equal. Larger amounts of water cool less quickly than smaller amounts.Fill enough glasses so that each shelf has at least one in each corner of the shelf and another glass in the middle.

, Generally, one glass per shelf corner and one in the middle of each shelf should be sufficient for identifying cold spots. You may have to rearrange items in your fridge to fit the glasses. Once the water is inside, wait for approximately one hour.


You can create a more precise temperature map of your fridge with more glasses. Arrange the glasses around the perimeter of shelves and across the middle of the shelves, left to right, front to back., Once the time is up, take your thermometer and use it to check the temperature of each glass of water. Some glasses will be colder than others. These colder glasses are where the cold spots are."

Position temperature sensitive food away from vents.,
Investigate the freezer settings.,
Add food to your refrigerator.,
Contact the manufacturer or a service representative.",How to Identify Cold Spots in Your Fridge3," Food directly beneath cooling vents will receive the brunt of the cold, which may cause freezing. In most cases, you can find the cold air vent above or to the side of the top shelf.Many of these vents will have a slatted or narrow opening through which the cold air passes.
If you have difficulty identifying the cold air vent in your refrigerator, open the door and feel around potential vent areas with your hand. If you feel cold air being emitted, you've likely found the vent.

, Your freezer can influence the coldness of your refrigerator, especially for refrigerator models with a freezer at the bottom. By raising the temperature of your freezer, you could solve your cold spot problem.Be sure not to raise the temperature of your freezer above freezing (32°F/0°C). This can cause bacteria to grow and food to spoil faster than normal., The food in your refrigerator acts like a sponge for the cold air. The more food you have in it, the more evenly distributed the cold air will be. Keeping your refrigerator more fully stocked could be a simple solution to your fridge's cold spots.This is especially true for the bottom of your fridge, where cold air can build up and cause freezing. Make sure the bottom of your fridge is well stocked.

, Refrigerators these days are complex pieces of machinery. In some situations, there may be a mechanical issue with the inner workings of your refrigerator. If this is the case, a service representative or manufacturer assistance may be the best way to resolve the issue.


The manufacturer information for your refrigerator can usually be found in its user manual.
If you cannot determine the manufacturer of your fridge, inquire with the retailer that sold it to you to determine this information."

Look the food packaging.,
Inspect the food.,
Smell the food.,
Check the date.,
Deal with the freezer burned food.,
Tightly seal your food.,
Repack opened store bought foods.,
Check the freezer temperature.,
Avoid storing food for too long.,
Utilize ice dips.",How to Detect Freezer Burn," An opening in the food packaging or a tear in the plastic indicate that the food has been exposed to cold, outside air, and has a higher chance of being freezer burned.;
, Remove the food from the packaging, and check the food for dry areas, areas of discoloration, and ice crystals.Food with any of these qualities, is highly likely to be freezer burned.


The exact color of freezer burn discoloration varies depending on the food, but freezer burn tends to look white on poultry (chicken), grayish-brown on meat (steak), white on vegetables, and icy crystals formations on ice cream.
Patches of wrinkling on meat or vegetables are also an indication that your food might be freezer burned.

, Smell the food and see if you can detect an unpleasant plastic-y and stale “freezer” odor. When fat from food comes in contact with air outside of its packaging and oxidizes, it creates the gross freezer flavor and smell we associate with freezer burn., Store bought food is usually labeled with a storage date. Check the label and determine if the food has been stored past this date. If your food is past the labeled date, and has ice crystals, your food is most likely freezer burned.

, Freezer burned food is not unsafe to eat. However, you can save a majority portion of the food you plan to eat by trimming off the freezer burned areas, and preparing and eating the rest of the food like normal.


If the freezer burn is widespread, throwing out the food may be the best option. Even though the food is safe to eat, it will be flavorless, or have a strange flavor.
Freezer burned ice cream, will have small ice crystals formations on the surface, which are perfectly fine to eat, though not very appetizing.

, Use freezer specific, sealable plastic bags to store food, and double-wrap your frozen items to stop water from evaporating from your food.Food wrapped in store bought packaging usually lasts about 1-2 months in the freezer, but if you plan to store your food longer than that, consider wrapping your food more securely.


Try storing food in air-tight containers (soups, broths, fruit) or vacuum packaging (fish, meats).

, Once store bought frozen foods are opened, the moisture-vapor seal of the packaging is broken, no longer keeping moisture from the frozen food. Because this barrier is broken, the food needs to be repackaged.


For example, putting a whole bag of opened veggies inside a freezer bag or taking frozen fish sticks out of an opened box and putting them into a small, freezer safe container, are efficient ways to repackage and store opened frozen foods., Your freezer temperature should be set to at least 0 degrees Fahrenheit, if not a bit lower.Any temperature higher than zero, or inconsistent temperatures (due to opening and closing the freezer door) increases the risk of freezer burn.

, All frozen food should be eaten within the recommended time period on the packaging labels.Try labeling your frozen foods with a date to use and eat your food within the recommended time frame.Remember: freezer burned food is not unsafe to eat; it just means it may not be at its best quality.

, Ice dipping is a very old method to preserve food. You dip your raw food in water and allow the layering of water to freeze into an ice coating on the food. Then you continue to dip the now ice coated food in water and again, allow the water to freeze into a layering of ice. This dipping is done until there is a thick enough coating of ice over the food to protect it from penetrating outside air.Fish is often dipped in ice for preservation. Other raw foods that are preserved this way include chicken and other meat.
Ice dips are also utilized to help save on plastic packaging costs.

Try plugging the refrigerator into a different outlet.,
Try leaving it unplugged for a while, then plugging it back in.",How to Diagnose Refrigerator Problems1," Pull out the refrigerator if needed and press the plug firmly into the outlet. Check your appliance's electrical cord for damage. Any exposed wire, kinks or cuts in the cord might make the appliance malfunction. If this is the case, do not use the cord and contact a repairman.;
, The extension cord may be damaged or faulty. Plug the refrigerator directly into the outlet. If this solves the problem, replace the faulty extension cord., Plug the other appliance into the same outlet that your refrigerator was plugged into. If that appliance also does not work, check your fuse or circuit breaker box. You might have a blown fuse or tripped breaker.








, If this solves the problem, then the problem is with the outlet. Check the current and voltage of the outlet with a multimeter and voltage tester. If you do not know how to work these tools, contact a professional repair technician or electrician.

, This may reset the circuit board (like rebooting a computer or a cell phone). By leaving it unplugged, you allow capacitors to lose any charge they may be holding.

While usually behind the front kick panel, it’s located in the rear of some models. Others have a non-removable pan.


If you’ve lost your owner’s manual, search for the appliance’s model number online to download a digital copy.If the pan is in the back of your fridge, just pull the appliance away from the wall and look around the bottom of the fridge’s rear.;
, If you’re just emptying out the drip pan and giving it a quick clean, you can leave your food in the fridge. However, if you're giving your entire refrigerator a deep clean, you should store your food in a cooler and unplug the refrigerator.If you’re also cleaning out the rear coils or if your manual notes that your pan is in the fridge's rear, pull it away from the wall.

, You’ll need to wear gloves when you remove and clean the pan. Drip pans can get moldy and fill up with dirty water, and you won’t want to get either on your unprotected hands. Further, you’ll likely be using bleach or a strong household cleaner., The kick panel is the front grill at the bottom of the refrigerator. It snaps in and out of place and, on most models, the drip pan is located behind it. Take it off and set it aside., Once you’ve removed the front kick panel, grab a flashlight and look inside. You should be able to see the defrost drain line, which leads to the drip pan.Take the pan out carefully and slowly, as it might be full of water., If the drip pan is full of water, carefully bring it to a sink or tub. Pour the excess water down the drain.You can also vacuum out standing water using a wet/dry vacuum.

, Mix one part bleach with two parts warm water in a clean spray bottle. Spray down the pan and let it soak for a few minutes. Then scrub the pan with rag or sponge and rinse it well under running hot water., You can use other cleaners if your pan is colored and you’re concerned about color loss, or if you just don’t like to use bleach. Try mixing one part white vinegar with two parts warm water. You can also use your preferred all-purpose cleaner.If you don’t like the smell of vinegar, mix in a teaspoon of lemon juice.

, Use a clean towel or paper towels to pat the pan dry. Let it sit out for an hour or so to air dry. When it’s dry, reinstall it then replace the front kick panel., Check your owner’s manual to identify your drip pan’s location. If it’s non-removable, it’s likely in the rear of your appliance. Check the bottom rear underneath the coils.For help finding the pan, look for the drain tube, which runs vertically from the top of the appliance to the drip pan.

, See if you can access the drip pan with a shop or wet/dry vacuum’s hose attachment. If you can, use it to suck up any standing water.If you can’t fit the hose into the pan, you might need to get creative. Try duct taping a straw to the end of the hose to create a narrow suction tool that will fit into the pan.

, Once you’ve removed excess water, spray a disinfecting cleaner into the pan. Let it soak for a few minutes so it can cut through any grime.Depending on your preferences, you can use a bleach or vinegar solution or an all-purpose household cleaner.

, Grab a thin, clean paint roller. Scrub the inside of the pan with it and rinse it with hot water as needed. Keep scrubbing until you've soaked up all of the cleaning solution.If you can’t reach the entire pan with the roller, try extending the handle by duct taping an appropriately sized stick or pole. In a pinch, try taping it to the end of a broomstick.
You can also try using a thin, long-handled brush if you don’t have a paint roller that can access the pan.

Turn the freezer on for 6-8 hours before adding food.",How to Clean a Deep Freezer," Make as much room as you can in your refrigerator freezer for the food you will remove from the deep freezer. One way to make room is to throw away all items that are outdated or unrecognizable in your deep freezer and your refrigerator's freezer., If there isn’t enough room in your refrigerator freezer, you will need to find another cold place to keep the food from the deep freezer. Set aside several large coolers and put a layer of ice in the bottom of each cooler.

, Take the food from the deep freezer and put it in your refrigerator freezer. Place the remaining food in the coolers and then put a layer of ice on top of the food. If you still need more space for the food, you can store it in the refrigerator itself.If you are cleaning on a day with freezing temperatures, you can try sitting the food outside while you clean the deep freezer.

, Every freezer is different. Take a moment to read through the owners’ manual to figure out exactly how you should go about defrosting your freezer. If you don’t have a physical copy of the manual, try visiting the manufacturer’s website to locate a digital copy., You will need to make sure your deep freezer is turned off and disconnected from its power source. This will ensure that all of the ice inside the deep freezer melts., You will need to leave the doors of your deep freezer open while it defrosts. This will help the freezer completely defrost more efficiently.

, The ice in your deep freeze will melt into water and could potentially make a huge mess. Try placing large towels on each of the shelves in the freezer as well as on the floor surrounding the freezer. You can also catch melting water by placing large pans on the freezer shelves., To prevent an unwanted mess, you will want to monitor the progress. Check in every 20 minutes and replace wet towels or empty pans that have filled with water., The size and model of your deep freezer will determine how long it will take for the appliance to defrost. For smaller models, this could take less than an hour. Larger deep freezers may take several hours.

, Check your freezer manual to see if the manufacturer recommends or cautions against speeding up the defrosting process. Try using a hair dryer, fan, or space heater to speed up the melting process. You could also try using a putty knife to chip around the edges of larger chunks of ice., Once all the ice in the deep freezer melts, remove any towels or pans from inside the freezer. Then take a clean towel and wipe out all the excess moisture and water from the interior of the deep freezer., If your deep freezer has removable shelves, take them out. Then clean the shelves with warm, soapy water and allow them to dry before placing them back inside the deep freezer.

, Wash down the inside of the deep freezer with warm soapy water. You can also mix one cup (240 mL) of water, one teaspoon white vinegar, and one teaspoon dish soap in a spray bottle. Spray the solution on the freezer walls and floor and then wipe down with a wet cloth., After cleaning the interior of the deep freezer, you will want to wipe down the exterior. Use a cleaning spray or warm, soapy water to wipe down the front, back, and sides of the deep freezer.

, After cleaning the interior and exterior of the deep freezer, dry it with a clean towel. Make sure you remove all the moisture from the interior of the freezer. This will prevent new ice from forming., Once the freezer is completely dry, close the doors and turn the freezer back on. Most manufacturers advise that you leave the deep freezer on for six to eight hours before you place frozen items inside. This time varies between models, so consult your owner's manual or the manufacturer."

Repeat the process all around the seals of the appliance. If there's no tension at any spot, the seals are starting to fail. You should also check for cracks and rigidity that could be causing a failing door seal.

, Use a multimeter to test the continuity of the appliances various components. These include the door switches, the defrost heater and timer, and the evaporator fan. If any of these parts fail, they could be your problem.

Wait a day to see if the problem solves itself.,
Defrost the freezer in case there's too much ice built up and clean your condenser coils.,
Test the door seal.,
Clean the condenser coils with a vacuum or brush.,
Test the continuity of the refrigerator's various components.,
Test the outlet voltage.",How to Diagnose Refrigerator Problems4," Several factors could cause your refrigerator to temporarily run continuously. If you live in a humid environment, just loaded the refrigerator, or recently adjusted its temperature, it might take a while for the refrigerator to cool completely. It could take 24 hours or possibly more for it to cool.

, If there is a build of debris on your condenser coils, they won't be able to efficiently dissipate heat, and the refrigerator will have to constantly cool. If the defroster is faulty, then the evaporator coils will frost over, and the refrigerator will work harder to keep cool.

, The door of your refrigerator has a seal that prevents cool air from leaking out. If the seal is faulty, your refrigerator will have to constantly cool itself. Use a piece of paper to check for breaks in the seal. Close the door on the piece of paper and pull it out. There should be resistance when pulling the paper out, and if there isn't, a faulty door seal may be your problem. Repeat the test along the whole seal.

, This part helps dissipate heat, and if it's too dirty, the refrigerator will have to work harder to stay cool. This cleaning should be done with the appliance turned off. You should clean rear-mounted coils once a year, and floor coils twice a year., This will require using a multimeter on several of the refrigerator's components. These components include: the condenser fan, the overload protector, and the compressor relay and motor. A fault in any one of these components can cause the refrigerator to cycle improperly.

, Use a multimeter to test the outlet voltage of the outlet that the refrigerator is plugged into. Do this only with the proper tools and safety measures. The voltage should test between 108 and 121 volts.

Check the drain pan and tube.,
Level the refrigerator.,
Check the water filter.",How to Diagnose Refrigerator Problems5," Water pooled outside the refrigerator might be caused by a dirty drain pan. Your drain pan should be cleaned about once a year. Water pooled inside the refrigerator might be caused by a clogged drain tube. Clean out a clogged drain tube by forcing a solution of water and baking soda or bleach through the tube with a basting syringe.


The refrigerator should be turned off before attempting to clean the drain pan and tube.

, If your refrigerator is not level, things might not seal correctly, and the defrost drain might leak. The refrigerator was designed to operate correctly when level. Unplug the refrigerator, then place a level on top of the refrigerator. Check the back and front of the appliance and adjust the feet until it is level throughout., If the water filter is not fitted properly, water may leak out. After unplugging your refrigerator, remove and reinstall the water filter. Also check for cracks in the water filter head and housing. If there are damages, your filter head or housing will need to be replaced.

Decide what style refrigerator you want.,
Decide whether you want an ice maker or water dispenser.,
Consider the usable space of each unit.,
Choose what features you want in the interior of your refrigerator.,
Check online reviews and consumer testing sites to find out which models are highly rated by people who have used them.,
Shop for your refrigerator.",How to Choose Your Refrigerator,"


Choose a top-freezer refrigerator if you want a basic, economical choice. These traditionally styled refrigerators tend to have fewer features, but they're usually cheaper than other options. They also have wide shelves, but most adults will have to bend down to reach the refrigerator section.
Pick a bottom-freezer refrigerator if you want your refrigerator shelves to be easier to see and reach. Most adults will have to bend over to reach the freezer section, but that part of the unit tends to be used less often. Bottom-freezer refrigerators may have either a single door or 2 side-by-side French doors for the refrigerator compartment. The French door style refrigerators tend to be more expensive.
Select a side-by-side refrigerator if you have a narrow space in your kitchen because this style offers more narrow options when compared to others. Some models, though, have shelves that are too narrow to hold a wide container (such as a pizza box).
Choose a built-in refrigerator if you want a sleek look. These come in a variety of door configurations, and doors can hold panels that match your cabinetry. However, they tend to be small and are more expensive than other options. Cabinet-depth refrigerators are a less-expensive alternative to built-in models, but they stick out a few inches farther and are still smaller than freestanding refrigerators.
Consider a refrigerator drawer if you need extra refrigeration space in your kitchen. They aren't big enough to serve as a primary refrigerator for most households because they're intended to hold specialty items such as beverages. They cost significantly more per cubic foot (liter) than other refrigerators.;
, Since these need to be hooked up to your plumbing system, the location of the refrigerator within your kitchen relative to existing pipes is important. Some units offer built-in water filtration as well; if you choose 1 of these, be sure to find how how much replacement filters costs and how easily available they are in your area. Refrigerators with these features also tend to require repair more often than those without them.

, Refrigerators have tags inside that indicate their storage capacity. However, anywhere from 20 to 35 percent of that space may be unusable. Top-freezer models tend to have the least unusable space; side-by-side units have the most.

,


Pick a unit with adjustable shelves and door bins if storage flexibility is important to you. Some units have shelves that split, pull out, or have a crank to move them up and down. Deep door bins allow you to store bulkier items such as milk jugs.
Choose a unit with specialty drawers if you want to keep your refrigerator organized. Some units have drawers for wine or canned beverages. Others have full-extension drawers that allow you to more easily access items in the back. Many refrigerators have drawers with separate temperature or humidity controls to store items such as meat, fruits, and vegetables in their optimum storage conditions.

, Check to see which brands have repair services available in your area.

, Home improvement stores, department stores, and appliance stores typically have a large selection of options. Check local listings to see if your area has an appliance outlet store, which usually sells floor models and units with scratches, dents, or other cosmetic blemishes. These stores can provide significant cost savings. Be sure to check the energy-efficiency rating of each unit, since that will affect your utility bills.

Tour local gardens for inspiration before planning to pebble the garden.,
Measure the amount of space dedicated for pebbles.,
Prepare the space in the garden for the introduction of pebbles.,
Ensure adequate drainage in the garden.,
Put down a weed mat.",How to Pebble a Garden1," There are a variety of ways you can pebble your garden. Check out local gardens to see ways in which landscapers have pebbles in public spaces.


You can also go visit some gardens in person. If your city has a community garden or other green spaces, see if you can get any inspiration from those places.
You can also check online to to view pebbled gardens from around the world.;
, Carefully plan out your pebbled space. This area should be blocked off from the rest of the garden to heighten the effect of the pebbles.Use a tape measure to get the exact measurements you need to pebble your garden. This will help you know exactly how many pounds of pebbles you need. In general, one ton of pebbles will cover about 100 square feet at 3/4 to 1 inch thickness.It may be useful to have extra pebbles around when you need to fill in your pebble garden, so make sure to have more than you need for the space you have.

, Clear out any brush or weeds in areas where pebbles will be used. Wear gloves and protective gear so you don't cut your hands or injure your eyes.


Tear out weeds, flowers, or any other plants in the space that will be pebbled. This makes sure they don’t grow underneath your pebbles.
Have gloves and protective goggles when tearing out weeds or flowers. This is especially important if you are using a weed wacker or electric hedge trimmers.

, Precipitation can build up in the pebble garden if you do not have good drainage in your garden.If water is building up when it rains, you may have a drainage problem.
You can create a French drain, which is a trench next to the garden filled with gravel. This may help to keep your garden free from overflow water.
Another option to improve drainage is burying a pipe underneath a trench. The pipe should send the run off water to an area that won't be flooded when it's raining., This should be placed over the dirt or other base material that will be covered with pebbles. The weed mat covers the cleared area for the pebble garden and makes sure little will grow underneath the weed mat.The base covering that will be covered by the weed mat can be soil, sand, grass, pavement or other natural material.
The weed mat will limit the growth of weeds coming up through the pebbles. It will also keep the soil or other base material from mixing with the pebbles.
Weed mats can be purchased in a garden or landscaping store. They are made from a variety of materials including plastic.
Get a weed mat that's safe for the environment and will only affect the area you want it to for your pebble garden. If you can get a biodegradable weed mat, that will guarantee your weed mat only affects your garden area and will decompose after you're finished using it in your pebble garden."

Shop around for different types of pebbles.,
Choose from a variety of shapes and textures.,
Come up with a design that fits the style of your garden.,
Transport the pebbles to the garden.",How to Pebble a Garden2," You can find pebbles for purchase at lawn and garden stores, and pool and pet stores.These pebbles will be of a wide variety of types and prices. Find the best one to match your needs.Types of stones available as pebbles include: Marble pebbles, which are pink, white, black yellow and brown.
Limestone pebbles, which show up in natural colors such as tan, black, white and brown.
Granite pebbles, which are pink and red in color.
You can also search riverbeds and streams for unique pebbles to use as accents.

, You can use flat pebbles, round or elliptical shapes, or combine many different types.The different pebble types will work better depending on your environment and pebbling plan.


Pea gravel, river rock, crush granite, and Mexican beach pebbles all offer different textures. Find different pebbles that work best for your garden environment and look., You can use one pebble color and shape, or can mix up up many different shades and textures in the garden. Plan out your design before pebbling the garden.If a less natural, and more polished look is desired in the garden, use monochrome stones in onyx or white for a brighter, refined appearance. These are available at landscaping stores and are more uniform in size and shape.
You can also make a pebble mosaic, where you combine a variety of different pebbles into one pattern. This can create a fun and interesting look for your garden.Some other pebble design options include blurring the boundaries boundaries of your pebble garden with plants, combining different sized stones, and adding a rock border. Try to find the best one that suits your particular garden., Pebbles can be heavy, especially if you are buying enough to pebble a large section of a garden. Make sure you have a good way to transport the pebbles from the store or environment, as well as some help when carrying them to your pebble garden.


If you are gathering the pebbles from the natural environment, like riverbeds and streams, use a wheelbarrow to get the pebbles to the place where they will be laid.
If you are buying them from a store, have someone help you transport them. Many bags of pebbles can be tiring to carry alone.

Spill the pebbles into the space dedicated for the pebble covering.,
Spread the pebbles over the designated area in the garden.,
Arrange them by hand around the plants and flowers.,
Cement the pebbles if necessary.,
Step back from the garden to assess the visual impact.,
Adjust where necessary and add pebbles if more are needed.",How to Pebble a Garden3," You should transport your bags of pebbles to the garden spot first, so you know how many bags you will need for the task. Place the bags next to the spot where they will go, so you have a good idea of how many bags you will need.


Open the bags and fill out the pebble path with loose pebbles. Cut the pebble bags and shake them out onto the garden path.
If you are creating pebble mosaic, you'll likely want to be cautious when moving the pebbles onto the garden space at first.

, After they are spilled out into the space, carefully move to cover the space. You should not be able to see the weed mat underneath, so layer the pebbles if necessary.Use a rake or similar garden tool to spread the pebbles. Try not to damage the pebbles when spreading them.
Your pebbles should totally cover the area. It's better to have too many pebbles than too little, since that will make your pebble garden look untidy.

, Spread them evenly around larger areas. Try to balance out the level of the pebble garden as much as possible. You can probably eyeball the level, but try to get down to the ground level to check it out.


Be careful not to damage any plants of flowers in pebble gardens. They should still be able to get plenty of water and sunlight as well.
Level out the pebbles as much as possible. You can try to eyeball it, but it may also be useful to use a gardening tool to smooth them out, even around plants and flowers.

, Depending on your pebble pattern, it may be necessary to cement the pebbles down. In areas where people will be walking over the pebbles often, you may want to use cement to guarantee they don't become dislodged from the path.Mix a 4:1 ratio from cement to sand when you're preparing the cement mixture. Ideally, the texture should resemble bread crumbs.
Pour the cement onto the path. Fill in pebbles into the path way. Don't use too much cement, since this will overwhelm your pebble path. Ideally, try to calculate the amount of cement needed and the amount of pebbles needed. In general, one 80 pound bag of cement will fill in a 4-inch thick slab of 2 square feet., The pebbles should give the garden a clean, decorative appearance. A pebble garden can make a garden look well decorated and take your breath away.


Ideally, the colors should be pleasing to your eye and fit in well with your plants and flowers.
Keep in mind the sharp lines and angles in designing the pebble garden. This will help you have a balance in your pebble garden.

, Buying extra bags of pebbles are useful now, since you will not have to head back to the store to get more pebbles.


Add pebbles to any low spots. Uniformity makes a pebble garden look at its best.
Check on your pebble garden on a regular basis. Keep up with how it looks on a regular basis, in case you need to fix anything or add additional pebbles.

Add your plants and flowers.",How to Turn a Log Into a Planter," You can make a planter out of any size log that you like. However, keep in mind that larger logs can weigh a great deal, which makes them difficult to move around your yard or deck. In general, try to find a log with a diameter of approximately 12- to 14-inches (30- to 35-cm)A log that’s approximately 45-inches (114-cm) long is usually a good size for a planter. You can go smaller or larger, though, depending on how much space you have in your yard and how many flowers you’d like to plant.
When it comes to the type of log to use, a harder wood will usually last longer. However, hard woods are more difficult to cut. Maple is a good option.;
, You can make the opening in your log planter as small or as large as you’d like. You can make it almost as long and as wide as the log itself, so nearly the entire top of the log is available for planting. You can also opt for a smaller opening so more of the log is visible.It’s best to use a tape measure when you’re trying to decide how large to make the planter opening. That will help you understand how much space that you have to work with.

, Part of the charm of a log planter is its rustic appearance. However, you may want to strip the bark off of the log to expose the bare wood underneath. You can use a debarking tool, such as a draw knife, to manually remove the bark or a debarker that attaches to the end of a chainsaw and uses a rotating blade to remove the bark much more quickly.If there are any twigs, moss, and other debris on the exterior of the log, you may wish to remove those as well.

, Because the log is round, it can easily roll around when you attempt to cut it. To keep it in place, set a large wooden wedge on either side of the length of the log. Make sure the wedges have a flat edge so they won’t move when you begin to cut.When you’re choosing a location to set the log up for cutting, it’s best to select a spot that’s close to where you plan to put the planter. That way, you won’t have to move it too far when you’re finished cutting it.

, Once the log is secure, use a piece of chalk to trace the interior cutting lines for the opening on the top of the log. It helps to use a tape measure or ruler as you’re tracing, so you know the lines are as straight as possible., Using a chainsaw and other cutting tools can be dangerous. To protect yourself, shield your eyes with a pair of safety goggles or glasses before you begin cutting. It’s also a good idea to wear a pair of canvas or leather work gloves to protect your skin.You may also want to wear a dust mask over your nose and mouth to protect yourself from the sawdust and chips that fly around when you’re cutting the log.

, When your safety gear is place, lift the chainsaw and begin cutting the short sides of the marked planter opening lines. You don’t need to cut the full depth of the opening -- just make a superficial score line.For best results, use a chainsaw with a low kickback blade.

, Once you’ve scored the short sides of the opening, use the chainsaw to make a superficial cuts along the longitudinal sides of the opening. You don’t need to go deep with the cuts; you just want to create shallow score lines as you did with the short sides of the opening., To finish cutting the longitudinal sides of the opening, adjust the chainsaw so you’re holding it almost perpendicular to the log. Plunge the tip into the wood and cut until you reach your desired depth. Aim for at least 5- to 6-inches (13- to 15-cm).When you’re using the chainsaw to make a plunge cut, you are more likely to experience kickback, which can cause you to lose control of the tool and run the risk of injuring yourself. Be sure to read the safety instructions for your chainsaw so you know how to use it safely.

, Once you’ve cut the longitudinal sides deep enough, plunge cut the short sides of the opening until they’re the same depth as the long sides. Make sure that you join the short side cuts with the long side cuts so the opening is cut to the desired depth all the way around., After you’ve cut out the entire outline of the planter’s opening, use the chainsaw to make several lengthwise cuts in the center of the opening. It’s best to create 3 to 4 cuts that are parallel to one another.The lengthwise center cuts should all be the same depth.

, Once you’ve made the lengthwise center cuts in the opening, make several diagonal cuts to the center portion of the opening that you’re going to hollow out. They should crisscross the lengthwise cuts that you made previously.The diagonal cuts should be just as deep as the lengthwise cuts to the center of the cutout.

, When the planter’s opening has been completely scored, you’ll be left with chunks of wood in the center. Cut this wood out with a hatchet or ax until you’ve created a complete opening for the planter., To prevent the planter from becoming waterlogged, it helps to create drainage slits in the bottom. Use the chainsaw to cut all the way through the bottom of the planter opening in three to four spots so the water can drain out.Be sure to elevate the log on a sawhorse before you cut the drainage slits. You may damage the chain on your chainsaw if you allow the blade to hit the ground.

, Once you’ve finished cutting the log, it’s time to set the planter in the spot where you want to keep it. It’s important to move it before you fill it with soil and plants because it may be too heavy to move afterward.If you like, you can elevate the log planter on two or more flat pieces of wood. You should secure the “legs” to the planter with screws, though, so it doesn’t roll off.

, When you’re happy with the placement of the planter, you must add soil to the interior. Garden soil, potting soil, and even soilless mixes, which usually consist of peat moss or peat substitutes, compost, and perlite, are all suitable.If your soil mix doesn’t contain slow-release fertilizer, you may want to mix some granules of it in yourself when you plant your flowers.

, After you’ve filled the planter with soil, you can add your plants and flowers. It’s best to start placing the plants in the center of the opening and work your way out on either side.Make sure that the plants have an appropriate amount of soil around them. The soil level should be 1- to 2-inches (2.5 to 5-cm) below the lip of the planter.
Water the plants thoroughly with a watering can or spray nozzle after you plant them.

",How to Turn a Bookshelf Into a Vertical Garden,";
, Remove any dust or grime from the shelves before decorating.

,, This will help to create a smooth surface for painting. Sanding can also remove unsightly stains that might seep through paintwork.

, Repaint the bookshelf a new color. Or, paint it various colors. Do this over a covered area, to prevent anything being stained as you prepare the bookshelf.


If the vertical garden is to be placed outdoors, be sure to use weather-resistant outdoor paints.

, Then consider decorating the bookcase with small drawings, such as of flowers, plant tendrils, vegetables and fruits, and so forth.


The bookshelf will be right in keeping with the garden theme if you paint vines and other flora on the sides and back of the shelves.

, It can be indoors, outdoors, or halfway between each. This will depend on how much space you have available and the types of plants you'll be growing in your vertical garden.

, Place it on a level surface so that it is absolutely sturdy and ready for adding plants to.


It is a really good idea to affix it to a wall or other back surface with chain or hooks, to prevent it from toppling over once the heavier plants are placed on it, or should there be an earthquake.

, It could be all ornamentals, all flowers, all food, etc. Or, it's more fun and useful to have a mixture of plants, with some edible, some medicinal, some ornamental and some experimental. Mixing it up will make it more visually interesting too.


The plants should not grow taller than the shelf space to which they will be allocated. Read the plant's tag or read in a gardening book to find out the standard expected height for the plants you're choosing.

, Either purchase, plant or propagate the plants to be used in the bookshelf vertical garden. You'll also need containers, soil and a watering can or similar device.


If buying plants, keep them affordable by buying small versions and looking for plants when on sale.
If sowing from seed, purchase or harvest seeds and plant them in the containers. Fill with soil, then push the seeds in according to the depth needed for the seed in question. Keep watered and wait for the sprouts to push through.
If propagating the plants, get some cuttings from favorite plants and dip them in hormone powder to help them get a head start when planted.

, Place them on the shelves, with the heaviest containers on the base shelf through to the lightest on the top shelves.


To stop containers from toppling over on the upper shelves, stick them down with poster tack in large blobs.
Don't shove too many plants onto the shelf; leave some space between them.

Finish the hanging basket.,
Make a plant container.",How to Reuse Plastic Bottles for Your Garden1," Take a two-liter bottle and poke small holes in the upper half. Then, cut the bottle in half, making sure all the holes are in the upper portion of the bottle.


Poke a hole in the bottle top and thread a piece of felt or cotton fabric through the bottle top.;
, Turn the top of the bottle upside down and place it in the bottom of the bottle. The fabric should be long enough to touch the bottom of the bottle and long enough to have some sticking up into the top.


Add enough water to the bottom of the bottle for the fabric to get plenty wet. Fill the top with soil, making sure the fabric is in the soil. This will help set up the self-watering plant.

, You can make small or large hanging baskets from bottles, depending on the size of bottles or jugs you use. Start by removing the slanted top of the bottle or the part of the bottle with the handle.


The hanger should be uniform and smooth all around, with no handles or sloping., Use something sharp to make holes in three to four places equidistant apart around the top edge of the planter. Using string or yarn, pull the yarn through the holes. Make sure to make a knot on the inside so the yarn or string doesn’t slip through.


When you finish, the yarn or string should be secure enough that the hanger doesn’t fall.
Tie the yarn or string together at the top. Place on a hook.
You can paint the bottle before planting it to add a creative touch.

, Turn a two liter or 20 ounce bottle sideways. Cut the bottle in half. Use both halves to make two planters. Cut small drainage holes into the bottom. Fill with soil and plant flowers or herbs inside.You can paint the outside of the planters to decorate your garden.

Make a garden scoop.,
Use it as a water jug.,
Use it as an irrigation tube.,
Create a mini greenhouse.",How to Reuse Plastic Bottles for Your Garden2," Use a craft knife to remove the bottom of the bottle. Then, on one side, cut an angled line up and stop right below the handle. Do the same on the other side. Cut across the top between the two cuts on the sides to remove the piece of plastic.Turn larger plastic jugs and smaller plastic bottles into garden scoops and shovels. This can help dig holes, transport soil from the bag to your garden, or scoop compost and mulch. This works better with bottles that have handles.
This should give you a scoop-shaped bottle you can use in your garden.

, Take a larger plastic jug, like a two-liter or gallon one, and turn it into a watering can. Take the cap and poke multiple holes into it. Fill the jug with water, and then tip it over to water the plants.If you have a very delicate plant that needs a specific amount of water, you can use a smaller water bottle and turn it into a watering can in the same way.
Don’t make the holes too large. Smaller holes will prevent the water from coming out too fast. The holes should be larger than a pin hole but not larger than a pencil. You want to be able to control the flow of water.

, You can use an small plastic bottle as an irrigation tube for your plants. Take a 16 or 20 ounce plastic bottle and poke small holes throughout its sides so water can seep out. Then plant the bottle all the way into the ground closely to the plant, leaving just the top of the bottle visible.Pour water in the top of the bottle whenever you want to water the plant. The bottle will slowly disperse through the length of the bottle along the roots of the plant.

, Use a two-liter bottle to create a mini greenhouse around your already planted seedling. Cut the wider end of the bottle off. Place the bottle in the dirt around where your seedling is already planted.


Make sure the cut end is pushed down into the soil firmly so it doesn't blow away and will provide the best benefits for your seedling.
Make sure to leave the top off the bottle so the seedling gets air."

Create a wind decoration.",How to Reuse Plastic Bottles for Your Garden3," Cut a round circle in the side of the bottle near the bottom. Make sure the hole is big enough for a bird to get through. Find a wooden or plastic stick for the bird to sit land on. Cut another smaller hole that is the same size of the stick. Place the stick in the hole and make sure it is secure.Fill the bottle with hay or other nest material.
You can paint and decorate the outside of the bottle anyway you’d like.
Place wire around the top of the bottle to make a hook to hang it if you wish.

, Use a small craft knife to cut a small hole into the bottle about four inches from the bottom. On a different side, you can cut another hole higher. Now cut holes out directly across from these holes so there are matching holes on each side., Take two wooden spoons and slip them through the holes. This will provide a place for the bird to rest and a tray for the food to come out. Fill the bottle with bird food and replace the cap.


Attach floral wire or some other kind of wire around the neck of the bottle so you can hang it up.

, Use the bottom of 16 ounce, 20 ounce, or two liter bottles to make a lovely garden decoration. Cut away the rest of each bottle, leaving only the “feet” on the bottom. The feet make the shape of a plastic flower. Poke one hole in one of the ""flower petals"" and place string, fishing line, or something similar through the holes.Make sure the type of string or line fits snugly into the holes. If the pieces won't stay, you may need to put a little glue around the hole so the plastic flowers won't move.
To construct the whole decoration, you can place one of the strung ""flowers"" on each line or string three or four on the same string. Hang multiple in a row together for a dangling wind decoration.
Try getting clear and green bottles for variety, or paint them like flowers for extra decoration.

Galvanize them or spray them with a coating of molten zinc.,
Avoid scratches.,
Have good drainage.,
Consider using more corrosive resistant materials like aluminum, glass, stainless steel, PVC, stone, or even wood.",How to Protect Your Garden Furniture from Corrosion," Both of these methods will coat your garden furniture with zinc, which is a sacrificial metal that will corrode first before the iron or steel does.


Cleanse it from any existing rust through a shot blasting process or immersing the affected parts in an alkali/acid bath.
Once this is done, your pieces will have to be immersed in a molten zinc bath of approximately 450 °C (842 °F).
Finally, it will be coated with a passive Chromate coat.;
, To take care of the protective coating of your iron and steel pieces, avoid scratching them, this would create an exposed surface of corrodible material. Even the slightest exposed area is enough to start off a chain reaction of corrosion in your garden furniture, so you should be very careful.

, Another good measure to protect your stuff from corrosion is to have a good drainage system installed so that your garden doesn’t store up excess water. This can lead to damp conditions, perfect for creating rusty iron and steel.Try not to leave your furniture on damp grass, this will certainly contribute to the corrosion of the legs of your chairs, benches, tables, etc.

, Select your type of wood very carefully. Many woods rot easily in damp conditions. Many great designs exist for any type of material you may want to use .Don’t be afraid to explore your options!

Use a soft paint brush with a fine tip.,
Identify the stamen, anthers, and pistil.,
Brush the anthers and stamen.,
Transfer the pollen to the pistil.,
Pollinate your trees once a day.,
Avoid washing the paint brush while pollinating.,
Place two trees close together.,
Make sure your trees get plenty of sunlight.,
Do not waste time pollinating outdoor trees.,
Move trees that bloom early indoors.,
Monitor the temperature closely.",How to Pollinate a Lemon Tree," You need to get into the inside of lemon trees while they flower to reach the pollen. Therefore, a paint brush with a fine tip is best to use. You can buy one online or at a craft store.Longer, skinnier paint brushes tend to work best.;
, If you don't already know the anatomy of flowers, you need to learn this prior to pollinating your lemon trees. The stamen, anthers, and pistil all play a roll in the pollination process, so make sure you know where to find these parts of the plant.The stamen is found deep within the flower. It's a tiny, bulb-shaped piece of the plant found within the center of the flowers.
The anthers are tiny buds found at the end of the thin stems sprouting from the center of the flower.
The pistil is found inside the stamen. While you may not be able to see it, you can access it with your paint brush by brushing deep within the flower.

, Take your paint brush and insert it between the leaves of the flower. First, brush it against the anthers. Then, move it inward and brush it against the tip of the stamen., After you get some sticky pollen on your paint brush, transfer the pollen to another flower. Insert your brush into the center of the flower and brush it around to pollinate the pistil., When kept indoors, regular pollinating is key to getting your lemons to grow. At least once a day, pollinate all the flowers on your lemon tree. With persistence, you will begin to see results as lemons grow.Pollinate your trees as soon as they start to bloom. The precise time of year your trees will bloom depends on your region and climate.

, There is no significant difference between the pollen in one flower and another flower. Therefore, there is no need to wash your paint brush during the pollinating process. Refrain from washing your brush until you've pollinated all your flowers., If a bee occasionally gets into your home, it can do some pollinating for you. This generally occurs most effectively if lemon trees are close together. This encourages cross pollination so, if you have two trees, keep them side by side., Keep your trees by a window, on a balcony, or near another source of sunlight. Pollination on its own will not make lemons grow in the absence of sunlight., There is no need to pollinate lemon trees that are kept outdoors. They will be pollinated naturally by bees. Pollinating outdoor trees is extra work that's not necessary., If you do keep lemon trees outdoors, keep an eye on when they bloom. If your trees bloom before the last frost date, uproot them and move them indoors. Lemons may not grow if flowers begin to bloom when it's still cold out., Lemon trees cannot withstand temperatures cooler than 20 degrees Fahrenheit (-7 degrees Celsius). If you're keeping your trees on a balcony or porch, make sure to move them elsewhere if the temperature drops."

Ensure that your wood has not been chemically treated.,
Measure the amount of sawdust you have.,
Add the sawdust to your compost pile.,
Adjust the moisture level of the compost pile.,
Keep the compost pile thoroughly aerated.",How to Recycle Sawdust in a Compost Pile," Chemically treated lumber (the most common form of this treatment is pressure treating) contains high levels of arsenic, chromium, and copper and is not suitable for composting.


Pressure-treated lumber can be identified through the characteristic green tint of the treating compound. If your wood has been painted or you can otherwise not clearly identify this tinting, cut into a piece and examine the cross section. Pressure-treated wood will have a very distinct ring of green color that penetrates only about a half an inch (1 cm) into the wood (this applies to soft woods only).
When you are working with both treated and untreated wood, take care to keep the sawdust from the 2 types separated when you plan to compost the untreated sawdust. This is best done by working with the untreated lumber first and sweeping up the sawdust before cutting any treated lumber. Also avoid using walnut wood and similar juglans, as their natural herbicide will kill many common garden plants like tomatoes.;
, Sawdust is a carbon-rich or ""brown"" composting material, and therefore it will need to be paired with nitrogen-rich or ""green"" materials. Combining browns to greens in about a 4 to 1 ratio by volume will yield the ideal setting for decomposition; this ratio can be altered as necessary of course.


Most organic materials that are still living or close to their living state are considered ""green"" materials. Examples of these materials include food scraps, fresh grass clipping, coffee grounds, and tea leaves.
As an example, if you have around 8 liters (2.1 US gal) of sawdust, you will want to add it to your compost pile along with about 2 liters (0.5 US gal) of nitrogen-rich material. An easy way to quickly gather nitrogen-rich material is to cut your lawn and use the clippings.

, Once you have prepared both the sawdust and the green material to go along with it, both can be added directly to your compost pile.


Ideally, the outermost layer of your compost pile should be completely composed of carbon-rich materials (like sawdust). To achieve this, you can add the green materials and then spread sawdust on top of them.

, The beneficial microorganisms that aid in decomposition need moisture to proceed, and it is a good idea to check the moisture content of your compost pile any time you add new materials. Ideally, a handful of compost should feel like a wrung-out sponge. Adding water after introducing sawdust is especially important for 2 reasons.


The first reason is that sawdust is hygroscopic, meaning that it will tend to absorb a high amount of water. If it is added dry to a compost pile, it will pull moisture away from your existing compost and dry those materials out.
The second reason is that sawdust poses the risk of flying away in windy weather. This risk can be mitigated by dampening the sawdust with water.

, Aeration is important in any compost pile, as aerobic bacteria need a continual supply of oxygen to break down your compost. This task becomes especially important when adding large amounts of sawdust to your compost pile.


As sawdust is composed of very small pieces of material, it can easily become compacted and obstruct the air flow through your compost pile.
To avoid this type of compacting, use a garden fork and turn over your your compost pile regularly; especially when adding new material.

,
Apply the stain to the least visible point in the room.,
Brush on the stain liberally.,
Work on 1 area at a time.,
Wait 2 days for the stain to dry.",How to Whitewash Trim," Cover the floor with a drop cloth. Open all windows and doors to provide ventilation. Wear gloves and a face mask.;
, Use paint remover for trim that has more than 1 layer of varnish or paint. Furniture stripper can be used on finishes with fewer coats. Apply the stripper or paint remover with a brush. Follow the manufacturer's directions for timing and removal. You may need to use a scraper or steel wool to remove stubborn stain or paint.

, Sand the surface, either by hand or with a palm sander. Start with 60 grit sandpaper, and end with 100 grit. You should see a light wood underneath.

, Bleach with a wood bleach if necessary. Use rags or sponges to apply. Wipe off as directed.

, Oil based stains produce more odors and fumes and are more difficult to clean up. Water based stain cleans up with just soap and water.

, Look at paint chips and samples to find the right stain.

, Add aluminum powder and titanium dioxide--both available at artists' supply stores--to a light toned shade of wood stain. For this method, fill a plastic bucket 2 inches (5.1 cm) with an oil based wood stain in a light toned shade. Mix in 2 tbs. white titanium dioxide. Stir in 1 tbs. of aluminum powder, and mix well.

,, Stand back to check the color and sheen. Add more stain, dioxide, or aluminum powder as necessary until the wood has the look you want.

, After a few minutes, run a rag along the wood to push it into the surface. Wipe away excess stain. Use a picking technique to whitewash oak. Brush the wood stain on against the wood grain to work it into the large pores of the wood.

, Let the stain penetrate for about 15 minutes. Wipe it off with soft rag, going against the grain for oak and with the grain of the wood for other woods.

, Brush on a clear matte water based sealer, such as acrylic, over the whitewashed wood.

Make sure that you have all of the supplies that you will need.,
Determine the type of paint on the brick (latex or alkyd/oil-base).,
Using an old paint brush or sponge, saturate the painted area you're working on.,
Have a look at the paint and once it begins to come up/flake off, start to scrub it off with the wire brush.,Always keep the room well ventilated when using any paint removers - most are flammable and the fumes are toxic.,
Wait out the smell.,
Depending on the age of brick you're working on, it may actually be stamped and colored concrete, not a clay brick.",How to Take Paint Off Brick," They are listed below.
, You will need to use different removal methods for both.

If you're unsure, put some nail-polish remover with acetone on a rag. Rub the paint with the nail polish remover and see if it removes the paint. If it does, it's a latex paint. If not, it's an alkyd paint.

, Don't cover an area larger than you can work on in 10 minutes - the paint remover will evaporate and you'll have to start all over again., Take off as much as you can a while the paint is still loose, and if there is still some paint left saturate the area again with the paint remover and repeat the above steps until all the paint is removed.,, Since brick is porous, there may still be an odor of paint remover left in the brick once you are finished. It should dissipate in a few days. If not, it can be neutralized by scrubbing the brick with a mixture of water and vinegar., You can usually tell by the age - if the brick is the newer than 40 years old, the chances are that it is actually stamped concrete, not clay brick. Concrete brick tends to be rougher looking and will have some visible aggregate in the brick, whereas a clay brick is solid in color. Concrete will be more porous than clay brick, which is baked in a kiln."

,, Stir the mixture again until it becomes a thick paste-like consistency.

, Stir well until the mixture is completely blended and has a similar consistency to cake or brownie batter. Continue stirring the mixture, adding extra water if you feel it is too thick. It's easier to fix a solution that is too thick than too thin, so only add small amounts of water at a time.

, Watch it dry, if it dries looking coarse and bumpy, the solution is too thick and more water needs to be added.

, Add pigments, purchased from a local hardware store, that can be safely added to any paint or plaster mixture.

, These stains can show through after whitewashing.

, This will help the whitewash spread once you apply the whitewash.

, It is easiest to apply the whitewash to the tips of the brush and lightly apply it to the wall. You should be aware that whitewash is thicker than paint and doesn't go on as smoothly as interior paint does.

Disassemble the furniture as much as possible.,
Protect delicate pieces of furniture by wrapping them.,
Utilize furniture sliders whenever possible.,
Shove blankets underneath the furniture for sliding.,
Use a hand truck or dolly to move pieces long distances.,
Ease furniture into place by ""waddling"" it.",How to Rearrange Furniture Without Help," Heavy pieces should be taken apart if possible to lighten their weight and prevent pieces from falling off while you move them. Remove shelves from bookcases, cushions from sofas, drawers from dressers, and hutches from desks, for example.;
, Some pieces of furniture may have fragile or delicate parts, like the glass top of a coffee table or the doors of a china hutch. Before moving these pieces of furniture, you may want to wrap a blanket or bubble wrap around the fragile components.

, Furniture sliders are small pads, usually made from plastic and rubber, that can be placed underneath furniture legs for easy sliding. These are crucial for moving furniture alone, as they allow you to avoid straining to lift bulky furniture and scratching your floors by dragging furniture across them.

, Another option that allows you to slide furniture across floors without damaging them is using blankets. Stuff thick blankets underneath the legs of a piece of furniture before sliding it to its new location.

, Perhaps the safest and most effective way to move large pieces of furniture alone is by using a hand truck or flatbed dolly. When using a hand truck, position the furniture as vertically as possible so that the weight bears evenly onto the hand truck. Dollies should be placed against walls when loading them so that they do not roll away.

, Once you have got the furniture moved and you want to adjust their locations slightly to perfect the arrangement, avoid the temptation to simply drag the furniture that last little distance. This can easily damage your floors or your furniture. Instead, carefully lift one side of the furniture and move it slightly. Then, lift the other side and move it a bit, and repeat this process until the furniture's location is perfect.

Fix buckling of painted vinyl siding by using a shade no darker than the original.,
Take care of fading color by using better quality paint, particularly if the fading is worse with western and southern sun exposure.",How to Troubleshoot Exterior Paint Problems," Other possibilities are a poorly prepared surface or too much moisture. To fix peeling paint:


Remove peeling paint by power washing, sanding or calling in a professional to use a torch.
Repair any problem areas in the wood with vinyl spackling compound.
Sand the exterior, particularly the speckled areas.
Paint the patches with an oil-based sealer.
Resume house painting with a quality paint.;
,


Make certain the exterior of the house and the area underneath the siding is dry before painting.
Avoid painting in extreme heat, which is another cause of bubbling known as blistering.
Blistering pops up when paint is too thin or the surface hasn't been prepped properly.

,


Chalking occurs when the layers of paint are too thin or from ineffective priming.
Prime the surface before repainting with quality paint.
Applying a surface bonder with primer can help coats of paint bond with the surface.

, This also comes from excess moisture.


Replace rusty nails with rust resistant fasteners, such as ceramic coated construction screws or hot-dipped galvanized nails.
When it's not possible to remove nails, sand the nail heads and apply a rust converter to them.
Treat rust stains with a shellac-based primer-sealer that doesn't allow bleed through. Paint finishing coats over the sealer.

,


Use a quality acrylic latex exterior paint to avoid cracking from changes in temperature.

,


Remove mildew with a diluted bleach solution made of 1 part bleach to 3 parts water. Let it sit for several minutes before wiping it away.
Prepare and prime mildew-free surfaces.
Use a quality latex acrylic for house painting, because it resists mildew more than other types of paint.

,


Remove the crusty areas with a stiff brush or power washer.
Apply a masonry sealer after the exterior dries completely and before you apply the finishing coats.

, Darker colors absorb the heat, causing the siding to expand.


Paint with acrylic latex in a lighter color.

,


Lapping marks in color can be avoided by painting smaller areas at a time and in cooler weather with limited wind.

Use a trundler.,
Use a trolley.,
Use a cardboard box.,
Finished.

",How to Move Big Pots," This requires thinking ahead when you first place your pot plant down. A trundler is a small frame on casters. This will allow the pot to be moved for cleaning and moving and also allows for the rotation of the plant for pruning, watering etc. It's a worthwhile investment to make at the beginning, so ask your local garden center what they have in stock. Look online if you can't get this locally. When purchasing one, see if it is possible to lock the wheels. If not, you may need to chock it to stop if from moving in high wind locations.;
, Purchase or hire a trolley with adequate width at the base able to take the pot size. There are many trolleys on the market; preferably look for one able to negotiate the terrain that you have, such as stairs, rough ground, etc. Use straps to tie the pot in place on the trolley. In terms of easing the pot onto the trolley in the first place, have at least three strong people available to help out; strength is important when shifting such a heavy item.

, For pots that aren't too heavy but are still cumbersome to lift up, slipping a fully opened cardboard box under the pot and then sliding the pot along can be an easy option. Simply undo a carton until it is completely flat. Slide it under the pot (get a helper to lift very briefly) and ensure that the pot is sitting in the middle. Shift the pot by pulling along the cardboard until the pot reaches its new destination. Slide the cardboard out (you can tear it off if easiest, as the portion under the pot will eventually decompose).

Figure out the cost of your plants.,
Organize your plants.,
Decide which shape to use to group the plants.",How to Organize Your Ideas With a Planting Plan1," If you are able to buy large trees and shrubs you will be able to have an instant garden; if you can’t afford them then you will need patience to grow young plants. For instance, Perennials can bloom and reach their maximum height in the first couple of years, so don’t spend money on big plants. Besides, it will be very interesting to see them grow as time goes by.

, Many people get excited and try to cram too much into a small space, but overcrowded plants tend to be unhealthy, so always think about what their final spreads will be when drawing up your plan. The best way to make your plants look fuller is to put them all in a group together.

, If you group plants in the shape of a sausage (which works well for cottage and prairie styles), or in triangle shapes they will look better and you will be able to create harmony among disparate groups.

Mark out a square meter on the ground and calculate plant spacing for different species using their final spreads.,
Design your plan on graph paper.,
Make sure you trace your drawing to develop a nice, complete design.",How to Organize Your Ideas With a Planting Plan3,",, This will help you decide where trees, plants or shrubs will be.

, Make a note of them for future reference. This will let you see how dense your planting will be.

, When choosing the scale, take into account how big the beds or borders are going to be. A scale of 1:50 or 1:20 is appropriate for an intricate plan.

, Make two versions: a drawing to keep for yourself and the other version that you can use when you are going to plant. It would be nice if you laminate your last draft to protect it from the weather.

Employ blacks and whites throughout your home.",How to Pick Colors for Interior Decorating," A simple way to pick colors is to draw them from a large, patterned piece that you already own - a piece of artwork, an area rug, or an upholstered chair, for example. Match paint, furniture, and accessories to colors that appear in this pattern. This will give your room a subtly cohesive appearance and will help feature the patterned piece.;
, This interior design guideline dictates that you should devote 60 percent of a room's color to a dominant hue, 30 percent to a secondary hue, and 10 percent to an accent color. This guideline helps maintain visual balance and keeps you from going overboard with bright accent colors or dull neutrals.


The dominant hue should be a relatively neutral or low-saturation color. The secondary color can be a bit brighter, and the accent color should provide bold pops of color that invigorate the room.
For example, the dominant hue could be used as wall paint, the secondary hue as the upholstery on your furniture, and the accent color for accessories like pillows and vases.
Note that this rule applies to all areas of design. Consider a man's suit - about 60 percent is the neutral-colored coat and slacks; 30 percent is the shirt; and the final 10 percent is the tie, where a bold, lively color is acceptable.

, There is a reason most ceilings are painted white or beige even when the walls are dark - rooms tend to look much better if the color tones are graded from dark to light as you move up vertically. Choose darker tones for low pieces like rugs and coffee tables; use medium tones for your walls; and leave your ceiling a light color.

, Even if you are completely flummoxed by choosing colors for your home, take heart - you're already well-versed in this process through choosing your clothes. You likely buy clothes in colors that appeal to you and match your complexion well, so follow the same rule when decorating. If you think pink clothes tend to wash out your skin tone and make you look sickly, for instance, avoid buying furniture or decorative items in pink colors.

, A color wheel, which can be found easily through an Internet search, is a tool that arranges colors according to the wavelength of light needed to produce them. This tool is used frequently by designers to determine how to introduce unity or contrast into a decorating scheme.


Adjacent colors on the color wheel are called analogous colors, and can be paired with each other for a pleasing, unified color scheme. For example, using greens, teals, and blues in a room will produce a calm, cohesive appearance.
Colors opposite each other on the color wheel are called complementary colors, and can be paired with each other to create striking but stable contrasts. A bright purple vase against a pale green wall can provide a visual boost that enlivens both colors, for instance.

, Small accessories in stark black or white play a major role in livening up your color scheme. These colors define the limits of the spectrum, and therefore they make other colors appear richer by situating them within the full spectrum of color.

Protect your paint job from peeling.,
Uninstall the hardware.,
Soak your hardware in soapy water in a crock pot.,
Brush the hardware free of remaining paint.",How to Strip Paint from Hardware1," Paint can easily pull away with your hardware when you remove it from the wall. Take a utility knife or a similar tool and cut along the perimeter of the hardware. Remove all supplemental parts, like the spindle and knob of doorknobs, pieces connected by a hinge, and so on.


In some cases, you might not be able to completely cut through the paint with your cutting tool. In this situation, score the paint deeply and, when removing the hardware, try to break/tear the paint along the scoring.
Peeling is especially common when there is an unbroken layer of paint connecting the surface of your hardware to the surface where the hardware is installed.;
, Paint may have filled in fastener slots (like screws) or created a layer over fasteners, making them difficult to remove. Use your utility knife to carve out these slots or to peel away paint so you can remove the fasteners easily. With an appropriate tool, like a screwdriver or claw hammer, take out the fasteners.


With screws, use the lightest pressure you can manage while uninstalling. Pressing too hard can cause your screwdriver to slip and result in gouged hardware., Insert your hardware into a crock pot. Add water to the crock pot until the hardware is completely covered. Mix in a tablespoon (15 ml) of liquid laundry detergent. Set the crock pot to medium or high. Allow the hardware to soak overnight.Your hardware may still be hot when you go to remove it from the crock pot. Use tongs to prevent yourself from getting burned.After a night of soaking in hot, soapy water, the paint on your hardware should be soft and ready to fall off.
Use an old crock pot or buy one secondhand at a thrift store for your paint removal. This will prevent paint from contaminating a crock pot you still use., Stiff bristle brushes may damage the finish of your hardware. Use a soft bristle brush to break up stubborn paint. Paint will harden quickly after being removed from the crock pot. Dip fixtures back into the hot crock pot water to re-loosen hardened paint.Hold the hardware with a pair of tongs or with gloved hands to prevent yourself from getting burned. While holding the hardware like this, brush remaining paint free."
"
Unfasten the hardware.,
Boil the hardware in water.,
Scrape off the paint.",How to Strip Paint from Hardware2," Use a utility knife or similar tool to cut the paint around the hardware to prevent paint from peeling off with surface to which the hardware is attached. Cut around fasteners and carve paint from their slots with your knife.


Remove fasteners with the appropriate tool and take off the hardware. In most cases, a screwdriver or claw hammer work well for fastener removal., Use an old pot for this. After boiling the hardware, do not re-use this pot for cooking to prevent food from becoming contaminated with paint particles. Fill the pot halfway with water or enough so the hardware is completely covered. Boil hardware for 10 to 20 minutes.For especially thick or stubborn paint, you may want to use a longer boiling time. Boil your hardware for a few hours for best results.
A quart (950 ml) of water mixed with ¼ cup of baking soda should intensify the paint stripping power of this method., Remove the hardware from the water with tongs. Put on gloves so you can handle the hot hardware. Hold the hardware in your gloved hands and use a tool, like a putty knife, to scrape the loosened paint from the hardware.


As the hardware cools, the paint will become more difficult to scrape free. Dunk your hardware back into the hot water with your tongs to soften it again.
Use a soft bristle brush to remove paint any remaining paint from the hardware. Brushes can be especially useful for removing paint from cracks and crevices."

Prepare your work area.,
Strip paint with chemicals safely.,
Apply the chemicals to the hardware.,
Scrape away excess paint.,
Clean the hardware.",How to Strip Paint from Hardware3," Lay down a drop cloth, cardboard, or a few layers of newspaper where you'll be applying your chemical paint remover. These chemicals can be very harsh, and can do damage to your home if they drip onto surfaces, like counters, tables, and the floor.

, Most chemical paint removers give off toxic fumes that can be deadly if they build up. Work in a well-ventilated area to prevent this. These chemicals can also be corrosive. Wear gloves and protective eyewear when applying your chemical paint remover.There are many different kinds of paint stripping chemicals. The proper usage and handling for these will vary. Follow the directions for best results.
Chemical paint strippers work well for hardware that is too large, heavy, or cumbersome for the crock pot method., The crock pot and boiling water techniques work wonders for paint removal, but it takes time. A chemical paint stripper, like methylene chloride, will remove most paint in under an hour. Apply your chemical according to its user directions.In most cases, you'll need to use an applicator, like a disposable brush, to apply a thick layer of the chemical to the painted surface of the hardware.
Generally, chemicals will have a recommended time you should wait before attempting to physically remove the paint with a scraper., Keep your gloves and protective eyewear on as you do so. Using a paint scraper or putty knife, scrape the paint off the hardware. The chemical paint remover should have loosened the paint, causing it to come off easily when scraped.


Depending on your situation, you may have to reapply your chemical to the hardware a few times before the paint is sufficiently loosened., Use a damp rag or soft bristle brush and remove any paint remaining on the hardware. A rag is especially useful for wiping away remaining paint flakes and chemical residue. Rinse the hardware thoroughly in water, dry it with a towel, and enjoy your paint-free hardware."

When you have completed this step, you are ready to work with this House Book forever.







, Every time you tear something from a catalog or magazine, you have a place for it.  f you don't have a category, say for ""Just Cool Ideas"" or Misc., etc., just make one. 


You can also create a section for holidays to include menus, shopping lists, budgets, preparation lists, having to do with the current holiday coming up. 
Add/delete as you decide on new ideas, or as you complete tasks. You may complete one room at a time, or you work on several rooms at the same time.
Of course, you can enter all the info onto Word documents, revise and print as you go but often writing the information down and re-writing it truly solidifies ideas and creates an opportunity to think things through.

, The most important thing is that you will feel less stressed about decorating because you have everything in one place. Best of all, it's easy to change the book and make it a tool that works for you.

Check where on the washer the leak is coming from.,
Get on the floor to check the bottom and back of the washing machine as it cycles through.,
Confirm whether you have a worn out gasket.",How to Diagnose Washing Machine Problems1,"


The leak will generally come from the discharge hose at the standpipe in the wall. Are there water stains running down the wall? Perhaps, when you turn the machine to drain, water comes out of the standpipe.
Adjust the drainage hose if you suspect an obstructed flow or stopped up drain.
Another common water leak can be a bad hose or loose connection. Pull out the washing machine and turn it on, allowing water to flow into the tub. Check at the back to ensure there are no cuts in the hose or at the connections as the tub fills.
There are two hoses that are part of the cycle system. Check as it cycles to verify the clamps and hoses are in good condition.;
,


You need to remove the bottom panel from the washing machine using a Phillips head screwdriver.
Possible leaks can be hidden under the washtub.

, This would make water come from around the top of the washtub during the spin cycle.


Raise the top of the washing machine to check the gasket. It is normally held in place with two clips in the front. Insert a thin-bladed flat head screwdriver and pry the top up. The two clips are at the back and act like hinges.
With the top up, visually inspect the gasket around the top of the tub for cracks, dirt or anything else that would keep it from sealing off the water.

Keep your major pieces of furniture all in the same wood tone.,
Blend wood tones between rooms using accessories.,
Balance different wood tones throughout a room.,
Mimic certain wood tones through matching upholstery.,
Balance your mix of woods with your mix of colors.,
Embrace contrast when necessary.",How to Mix Wood Colors in Interior Decorating," This is the most basic step you can take towards ensuring the cohesiveness of your furniture's wood colors. Sofas, armchairs, and coffee tables, for instance, could all feature mid-toned wood, while lighter or darker wood tones are incorporated through small accessories like picture frames and lamps.;
, Of course, you won't want to use a single tone of wood for the major pieces of furniture throughout your entire home. For instance, you may have 2 adjoining rooms, the first featuring beech furniture and the other featuring cherry furniture. To blend these 2 wood tones together, add accessories in each room that feature the wood tone prominent in the other room.

, If you do choose to use different wood tones for major pieces of furniture, try to spread them out through the room. Placing dark tones on 1 side of the room and placing lighter tones on the other will lead to an unappealing imbalance. The darker side of the room will feel ""heavier.""

, Consider the following design challenge: all of the wood furniture in your living room is dark mahogany, but the credenza that you're longing to buy is only available in a light and airy beech. To tie the credenza's look into the room, you can use a piece of furniture (like an ottoman or accent chair) that is upholstered in a warm yellowish brown that mimics the credenza's hue.

, As a general rule, mixing a lot of different wood tones will look messy and chaotic if you also have a widely varied color scheme. Therefore, if you have lots of different colored upholstery and décor in a room, stick to a limited palette of wood tones. If you want to mix lots of different woods, try to keep your color palette subdued.

, There are certain situations in which contrasting wood tones are vital to successful design execution. For example, placing a pine dining table on pine flooring may lead the table's appearance to ""wash out."" In this case, contrasting a different wood with the flooring will make a more assertive, composed statement.

Understand that a washing machine works by centrifugal force.,
Inspect the pump the same way you did the hoses on the bottom of the tub by removing the bottom panel at the back and running it through the cycles.,
Check to see if the belt is worn or has become loose.",How to Diagnose Washing Machine Problems2," It does not cycle the water in or drain it out during the spinning cycle if it doesn't spin.

,


Water pumps wear out. They are usually made of plastic and are subject to breaking the fins inside the pump. This would make the pump lose the ability to push the water out.
Watch to see if it turns unimpeded or if there is a grinding noise.

, Turn the machine off and push in on the belt with a straight edge. Hold the straight edge between two points on the belt.


The belt should not deflect more than .5 inches (12.7 mm). It is too loose if it deflects more than that.
Tighten the belt if possible. Otherwise replacement is the only option.

"
"
Check the electrical system.,
Test the safety switch on the door.,
Use a continuity tester to see if the washer is getting electricity on the back where the electrical cord is plugged into the outlet.",How to Diagnose Washing Machine Problems3," You might want to call a professional to do this due to the hazard of electrical shock. There are a couple of things you can do, however, without specialized digital equipment that is unavailable to the average DIYer.

, Raise the washing machine door. You should find it on the right side near the bottom front. You will find a plastic post pointing down that aligns with a hole in the lip of the opening.


This post is the safety switch that keeps the washer from operating when the lid is up. Use a small screwdriver to push down on the switch located just below the lip under the hole with the door open and the machine in wash or spin cycle. The safety switch is good if the machine comes on. Have it replaced if it does not.

, Put one probe of the continuity tester on the hot (positive) post and the other probe on the negative post.


The machine is getting electricity, and the problem is inside the control panel, if it lights up. This is when you need to call a trained professional to check it out and fix the washing machine.

, Magic eraser is an eraser sold by Mr. Clean that helps remove stubborn stains from various surfaces. Using magic eraser is simple. You simply dampen the eraser and gently swab it over the ink stain to remove the unwanted stain.If the stain is a little tough to get out, do not hesitate to scrub a little harder to remove it.

, Commercial bug spray can actually help remove ink stains. The brand Off works particularly well at eliminating ink stains. All you have to do is spray the repellent directly on the stain and proceed to wipe it away using paper towels., After using any cleaning method described above, you should always run bleach-soaked towels through a dry cycle to ensure any lingering stains are removed. Soak some old towels in bleach. Wring the towels out so they're not dripping wet and place them in the dryer. Run them through a complete cycle.If you still notice ink stains in the dryer, run them through another cycle.

Measure out a cup (236.58 ml) of baking soda and carefully pour it into the water in your machine., Allowing your machine to run will let the vinegar and baking soda wash away a lot of the dirt and grime on the inside of your washing machine., Letting the hot water and vinegar sit in your washing machine for an hour will help pull away leftover grime and dirt from within the machine., Use a clean cloth and citrus cleaner to wash down the rest of your washing machine. Citrus cleaners are great at removing limescale, soap scum and buildup. You can purchase citrus cleaners at the store or you can make them at home. Spray the cleaner in dirty areas and use the cloth to wipe up the grime and dirt.Citrus cleaners use the natural properties found in fruits like lemons, oranges, and limes to remove dirt.
When cleaning, make sure to wipe off the fabric softener and bleach reservoirs that are on your washer.
You can also use a toothbrush to get to hard to reach places.

, Close the lid and finish the cycle in your washing machine. Wait until the cycle completes and all the water has drained from the machine.

Vacuum on the ground floor.,
Peel back shingles that obstruct the vent on the roof.,
Remove the guard to the dryer vent on the roof.,
Use a vent brush to clean the surface.,
Put the vent brush inside the vent.,
Reinstall the guard.",How to Clean a Dryer Vent on the Roof1," You will need to use a vacuum to clean out the length of the vent and, unless you have access to an industrial vacuum, it is unlikely that you’ll be able to do this from the roof. Before climbing up to the roof, get behind the dryer to vacuum out the vent.There should be clamps that connect the exhaust pipe of the dryer to the vent. Use a screwdriver to release these so that you can vacuum.
You can put the tube of the vacuum directly up the vent. However, there are special attachments that can be clamped onto the end of the tube that are designed to pick up lint from a vent. These can help vacuum the vent.;
, Once you have safely ascended onto the roof, examine the area around the vent guard. If any shingles are covering the vent, or the screws that attach to the guard, peel back the shingles. If they are held in place with tar, use a utility knife to cut around the shingles and secure access to the vent., When you get on the roof, you should find that the vent is covered by a guard. If you can, remove it. You might find that there are gobs of lint stuck on in. You can remove some of this with your hands.If the guard is secured in place by nails, place a cat’s paw pry bar under the head of the nail and hit the pry bar with a hammer to release the nails. After you have removed the nails, hold on to them so that you can reinstall them later.After the nails have been removed, pull up on the guard to remove it. You might need to twist it as you pull to dislodge it.

, You can purchase a vent trap cleaner separately or a kit with attachments to your vacuum. Use it to gently remove lint from the guard and other exterior surfaces., Push the brush inside the vent and then twist it. This will get lint trapped in the brush. Then pull the brush out to remove the lint. Repeat until you are no longer picking up lint.Because much of the lint concentrates near the ends of the vent tube, this basic cleaning and the vacuuming on the ground floor should remove most of the lint. If you can see significant amounts of lint that remain beyond your reach, call a professional.

, If you removed the guard, put it back into place. Be sure that it is intact so that no animals or debris can enter the vent.


If you find that the guard is not intact, call a professional to have it replaced. Debris falling into the vent could seriously compromise your dryer."

Then finish running the load so the remaining traces of bleach are removed.
Make sure you rinse out the bleach thoroughly before using the washing machine again. If there is any remaining bleach, it could possibly stain your laundry or anything else it comes into contact with.

, Laundry detergents that are made for use in high-efficiency washing machines are better at maintaining cleanliness because they produce fewer suds during the cleaning process than regular detergents. This means that some of the excess particles may not get rinsed out of your clothes or your washing machine.Using the high-efficiency detergent on a daily basis will help keep your machine fresher longer, and will allow you to clean your washing machine less frequently.

Only experts should climb on top of slate or tile roofs., Rain will significantly increase the likelihood of you slipping and hurting yourself. Even a strong wind can destabilize you or the ladder when you least want it to., If the ground is soft or slanted the ladder could slip out from underneath you. Do not place the ladder on a slanted driveway., You should wear a helmet in case you fall. Wear shoes, like soft-soled boots, that will have good traction on the roof. You can also consider investing in a safety harness that will catch you if you fall.


Safety harnesses can cost about $300, which is more than the cost of having a professional clean your vent, which is about $120. However, if you do a lot of work around the house, a safety harness could be a good long-term investment., This will give you space to safely transfer from the ladder to the roof. If the ladder is not tall enough or requires an extremely steep angle to reach this height, buy a taller ladder., This means that your ladder should extend one foot out from the house for every four feet that it extends up. This ensures that the angle is gentle enough that you will be able to climb safely.


For example, if you know your roof is 21 feet tall and that you want the ladder to extend 3 feet past the roof, then the bottom the ladder should be planted 6 feet from the roof., You should have someone to hold the ladder secure as you climb up. They should also watch for anything that might disturb the ladder. Keep pets and children away from the ladder., To stay secure during the transition, keep both hands on the ladder when you initially step onto the roof. This technique requires that the ladder is positioned so as to extend well past the roof."

Locate the gasket.,
Remove any foreign objects.,
Check for dust or hair.,
Clean any mildew.,
Deep clean the gasket once a month.,
Sprinkle 1/3 cup (74g) of baking soda into the inside of the drum.,
Turn your washer on.,
Clean stains in a very dirty HE washer.,
Remove and clean the detergent dispenser panel.,
Clean the outside of the washer.,
Use the right detergent.,
Remove your laundry right after it is done.,
Dry the gasket in between loads.,
Remove and air dry the dispenser tray.",How to Clean a Front Load Washer," The gasket is the rubber ring that runs along the opening of your washer's drum. This is what creates a seal to prevent water from leaking out of your washing machine. Open the washing machine door as wide as you can and peel back the rubber that runs around the opening.


The gasket will remain fixed to the washing machine, but you can pull it open to clean it and make sure nothing is stuck.;
, Once you've pulled back the gasket, check for any objects between the rubber. Sharp items can damage the gasket and the washing machine if you run the machine. Always check the pockets of you clothes and remove items before washing them.Common foreign objects include:Hair pins
Nails
Coins
Paper clips

, If you notice hair in the gasket, this means that particles from your clothes are building up on the clothes. If you have pets or people with long hair in your household, you should check the gasket for hair at least once or twice a week. If the gasket looks dusty, you may need to occasionally keep the door on your washer closed. For example, if your dog will be crated in the laundry room overnight, keep the door closed.


Dust builds up on the gasket when dust or lint from your dryer or laundry room floats around and lands on the gasket. Cut back on dust particles in the air by regularly changing your lint trap.

, If you see black spots, your washing machine is growing mildew. This means that the gasket isn't getting dry enough between uses or your soap is leaving behind too much residue. This moisture causes the mold to grow. To remove mildew, spray down the gasket with hot soapy water or a mildew cleaner. Wipe the cleaner away using a clean cloth or rag.You may need several cloths if the gasket is slimy with mildew. Keep spraying and wiping until your cloth comes away clean.

, To kill the mildew, add 1 cup of bleach into your empty machine and run a hot cycle. You should also pour 1/2 cup of bleach into the detergent or fabric softener compartment to ensure that your entire machine gets clean. After the cycle is done, run a few more cycles through without adding any bleach. This will remove the bleach smell from the machine before you wash clothes in your machine again.If you notice black mold on mildew spots after running your machine, you may need to put on gloves, a mask and scrub the spots using a bleach solution. Dip a toothbrush in a solution of no more than 10% bleach and scrub the mildew., Baking soda will help to remove any odors from mildew or dirty cloths. Close the door. Load two cups (473ml) of white vinegar into the detergent tray. The vinegar and baking soda will create a reaction that cleans the drum of your washing machine.Always check the instruction manual that came with your machine for specific cleaning recommendations.

, Set your washing machine to do a cleaning cycle (if you have that option). If not, set it to do a regular wash. Choose a high-temperature wash so that the baking soda and vinegar will have a chance to react. Let the machine run through a full wash and rinse cycle.If your HE washer has a cleaning cycle, the owner's manual will have specific instructions about when to add the vinegar and baking soda.

, If your machine is very smelly and you suspect mildew is growing inside the drum, run a cycle with bleach. Load two cups (473ml) of bleach loaded into the bleach dispenser. Run a wash and rinse cycle. To completely rinse out your machine, run another rinse cycle without anything in the drum.


Never run a cycle with baking soda, vinegar, and bleach. These can create a dangerous reaction that could damage your machine.

, Pop off the detergent dispenser panel and soak it in warm water. Remove the panel and spray it with all-purpose cleaner. Wipe it clean and pop it back into place.


If your machine has a fabric softener dispenser, you should clean and wipe its panel as well.

, Spray a clean cloth or rag with multi-purpose cleaner. Wipe along all exterior surfaces of your washing machine. You'll wipe up any lint, dust and hair that can build up on the outside.


Keeping the outside of your machine can prevent dust and dirt from getting into your machine.

, Purchase a detergent that's specifically designed for use in an HE machine. You should also use only the recommended amount of HE detergent (and fabric softener). If you use more detergent than is necessary, the detergent will build up on your clothes and on your machine.Detergent buildup can create odor and cause mildew to grow.

, Don't let your clean wet clothes stay in the washing machine for hours before switching them to the dryer. Mildew and odors develop more quickly in HE washers than top load models.If you can't switch the load of wet laundry, at least try to crack the door open so that the moisture isn't completely trapped in the washing machine.

, Ideally, you should take an old towel and completely wipe around the gasket after every load of laundry you wash. The goal is to remove all moisture from the gasket so mildew can't grow. Keep the door slightly open when you're done washing a load so that moisture evaporates from the machine.You should also dry the inside of the door, especially if you tend to keep the door closed.

, While you should be in the habit of regularly cleaning the detergent dispenser panel or tray, get in the habit of at least removing it after each wash cycle. Take the dispenser tray out and let it air dry. This will also get air moving into the machine itself which can prevent mold growth.


If you're in the habit of removing the dispenser tray after each wash, you can quickly check it over for black mildew or stains that need to be cleaned.

Unplug the dryer.,
Clean your lint trap with every use and your dryer as a whole once a year.,
Clean the lint trap with a vacuum.,
Wipe down the moisture sensor.,
Open the panel surrounding the drum.,
Put it back together.",How to Clean a Dryer Drum1," Before you start, you should unplug the dryer to prevent accidents. The plug is usually located behind the machine. Test it to be sure that you have unplugged it correctly.


If you have a gas dryer, you will also want to shut off the gas.;
, You've probably noticed that lint gets everywhere. There seems to be a cloud of it anytime you open your dryer or fiddle with the trap. Of course, this means that lint works its way into all the cracks and crevices of your machine and you'll want to be sure to clean it at least once a year to prevent problems.


A dryer blocked up with lint can dry inefficiently and even cause fires.
The lint trap should, of course, be cleaned out after every use. This is very important because if you don't, new lint won't have anywhere to go, creating a mess and increasing the amount of time needed to dry a load of clothes.

, Use a vacuum cleaner to clean out behind the lint trap every few weeks to every few months, depending on how much lint your items create and how well your trap catches the lint.Pull out the lint trap and vacuum the tube that is on the other side.
You might also want to vacuum out the exhaust tubes, although these are often difficult to reach or inaccessible.

, The moisture sensor, which is on most modern machines, tells your dryer when the clothes are dry. If it's covered in lint it won't work correctly, which can lead to your dryer turning off before everything is dry. Wipe the bar down with rubbing alcohol to clean it and keep your dryer running correctly.


These are usually found near the lint trap or at the back of the machine. They will look like two long, silver strips of metal and are usually surrounded by or mounted on plastic.
If you don't clean these often, you might need to scrub with something a little more substantial, like a Magic Eraser.

, Much like you can lift the top of your stove to clean below the heating elements, you can open up your dryer if you're brave and clean the lint that builds up around the drum. Different dryers open in different ways, so check the user manual for your model or look it up online.


Generally, either the top or front panel will come off (or both). Look for screws around the lint filter, since this is usually the spot to start. With the screws undone, the panel can be removed, though there is sometimes a catch you will have to get around by pulling forward (for a top panel) or using a screwdriver at the gap (for a front panel).With the panel removed and the drum exposed, remove lint and lost items by hand or with a vacuum.

, Once you're done, snap the panels back into place and then replace the screws.

, Using a spatula or an old credit card, scrape any large pieces of crayon that may be left off of the dryer drum.

, Get an old rag and spray it with WD-40.You should be very sure not to spray the drum itself with the WD-40, just the rag.

, Use the rag to wipe at the spots covered in crayon. Try not to cover any more area with the WD-40 than you have to. This should allow you to remove all of the crayon without too much difficulty.


Switch which part of the rag you wipe with frequently to keep from spreading the crayon any more.

, Once you've removed all of the crayon, or at least as much as you can, you'll want to mix up a bucket with soapy water and use a sponge or washcloth to clean the WD-40 out of the drum. Pay extra attention to the spots with the WD-40.

, With the dryer rinsed out, run a load of old towels through a cycle in the dryer to remove any crayon which might still remain.

With a scrubbing sponge, put the paste onto the area you want to scrub and start scrubbing. When you're done, rinse with a wet rag. This should help remove some of the dye.


Make bleach water by mixing 1-2 cups of bleach with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water.
You'll want to wear kitchen gloves while you do this, as the bleach and baking soda can be very harsh on your skin.

, Now to remove the rest of the dye. Soak some old towels or a large number of rags in more of the bleach water that you mixed previously. Just get them thoroughly soaked, they should not need to be in the water for more than 5 minutes.

, Wring the towels out, to remove excess water.

, Run the towels through the fluff cycle on the dryer for about 30 minutes., This should have removed most if not all of the dye. However, if more remains, you can repeat the towel process a few times to see if any more can be removed.

, Once you've removed as much of the product as you can, mix a bucket with soapy water. Use this water and a clean cloth to wipe down the inside of the drum.

, Pull the dryer from the wall and locate the rear access panel.


Remove the metal screws of the panel with a Phillips screwdriver.

, Check the blower wheel housing and vent systems and look for a small, oval thermostat, about 1 1/2 inches (3.81 cm) in length.

, The dryer thermostat will have 2 wires connecting it to the heating element. Label each wire prior to removal so you will know how to reconnect them.


Identify the metal slip connector attached to the wires.
Pull the wires by these connectors. If necessary, use needle-nose pliers.

, Ohms are used to indicate electrical flow.


Use a multimeter to test the thermostat's resistance by setting it to the RX 1 setting.
Place each of the meter's probes onto the wire terminals. You should receive a reading of 0. Resistance that is low, or near 0, means that the electrical flow is good. If the meter does not indicate 0, but reads infinity, your thermostat should be replaced.

Remove the start capacitor.,
Examine the capacitor for bulging or fluid.,
Use an analog or digital volt meter.,
Touch the two terminals with your ohms meter test leads.,
Check for capacitance, if the capacitor is alive.",How to Check a Start Capacitor," The easiest and most convenient way to discharge the capacitor is to attach the terminals of a low wattage 120v light bulb (about 20 watts) to the capacitor terminals. This will safely discharge the electricity which may still be stored into it.


Be very careful that you do not short the terminals by connecting one to the other, until after the capacitor has been discharged. Doing so could injure or kill you. Use extreme caution when discharging the capacitor before proceeding.;
, Signs that the top of the capacitor are bulging out slightly, as if expanding, is a sign that the capacitor might be dead. Likewise, check and look for any dark fluid that appear on the top of the capacitor.If you see either of these, it's still a good idea to run the check with a voltmeter, since it only takes a few seconds.

, Both work in essentially the same way and are both appropriate for the job. Set the meter to 1k ohms to begin the test.

, The basic check involves touching the test leads twice and comparing the reaction. Touch the test leads to the terminals and then reverse them.


The needle in your meter should swing to 0 ohms and swing back to infinity on an analog meter, and should display open line every time that you reverse on a digital meter. If it does, you've got a live capacitor and your problems are elsewhere. If there is no difference the capacitor is dead.

, If you have a multimeter, you can use the capacitance setting to perform a quick check. If the number is relatively close to the number listed on the capacitor, it's in good shape."

, Front loaders are always more energy efficient and quieter to operate, but often have bad odor issues.

, Most good clothes washers will have the rating of 4 or 5, with 5 being the highest a washing machine can get. This means it will save you at least 25% on electricity and water usage.

, The quietest to run washing machine is often equipped with Direct-Drive motor technology, which eliminates the use of belts, thus reduces unnecessary amounts of part vibrations.

, If your house is a little tight in space, opting in for the Stackable type of washers may help. Another option is to choose a washer dryer combo - that can both wash clothes and dry them in one complete cycle.

, The major manufacturers include: Whirlpool, Maytag, Kenmore, Samsung, LG, Bosch, Miele, GE (General Electric), Electrolux and Frigidaire., For example, Samsung washers offer the unique Silver Wash technology which uses Silver (Ag) particles to effectively eliminate up to 99% of bacteria (as claimed by the company), thus keeping your clothes mold-free for up to two weeks.

, What they liked and disliked? Also note which particular model is given best reviews for each brand. There are many independent review sources you can find online by typing something like ""consumer washing machine reviews"" in Google or another search engine.

, It will be very frustrating if your machine suddenly stops working and you have to wait for weeks in order to get it fixed, or even worse; have to buy a new one because no one can repair it.

Opt for a methylene chloride stripper.,
Consider using a caustic stripper.,
Use acetone to remove epoxy paint on smaller surfaces.",How to Remove Epoxy Paint1," Since epoxy paint is strong and resistant to wear and tear, removing it with a typical paint thinner will not work. Working with a stripper that contains methylene chloride, also called dichloromethane, will work best for removing epoxy paint.These can be found at home improvement stores, industrial suppliers, and various online retailers.Methylene chloride is a carcinogen and can cause respiratory, eye, and skin irritations. In addition, exposure to high concentrations can cause dizziness, confusion, headache, nausea, and even unconsciousness and death.It is important to follow the safety measures and instructions provided with the product.;
, Caustic strippers are also an effective option for removing epoxy paint. These products work to break down the chemicals in the paint. They typically take longer to remove paint than methylene chloride strippers, but they carry fewer health risks.If the surface you are working with has several, thick layers of epoxy paint, consider using a caustic stripper.Caustic strippers should not be used to remove epoxy paint on wood since they can break down the fibers in the wood and attract moisture., Acetone is a solvent that can help lift away epoxy paint on small surfaces.Acetone evaporates quickly, so it will not work on larger surface areas. Soak a small plastic object in a plastic container that is filled with acetone. While wearing gloves, use a washcloth that is soaked with acetone to rub away paint after soaking.Acetone is highly flammable.Be sure to use this product in a safe environment away from an open flame.
Purchase acetone online or at your local home improvement store.

Use a fan to circulate the air.,
Wear a respirator.,
Wear neoprene or butyl gloves.,
Dress in protective clothing.,
Protect your eyes with splash goggles.",How to Remove Epoxy Paint2," When using chemical strippers, particularly methylene chloride, the air in the room must circulate and change 7 to 10 times every hour. As you are working, place a fan behind you so the vapors are pushed away from you. Point the fan toward an open window, or opt to work outdoors.The chemicals in some paint strippers are considered carcinogens, and being exposed to high concentrations in a short period of time can cause confusion, headache, lightheadedness, nausea, and vomiting.Keep the air circulating, and limit your exposure.

, A respirator is a device that covers your nose and mouth and helps filter the air you breathe to protect you from toxic gases and vapors. When using chemical paint strippers, it is recommended that you wear a respirator.These devices can run between $40 and $145 at home improvement stores.Some businesses allow you to rent respirators. Talk to an employee at your local hardware shop to see if renting is an option.


Dust or particulate masks can protect against dust, liquids, and some fumes, but they do not protect against chemical vapors and gases., Protect the skin on your hands by wearing chemically resistant gloves made from neoprene or butyl.These gloves can be found online and at your local home improvement store.

, When working with a chemical solvent or stripper, it is important to cover your body and feet with protective clothing. Be sure to wear a long-sleeved shirt and pants to cover your skin.Wear rubber boots to protect your feet in case you drip or spill the product.

, The chemicals in the paint strippers can cause eye irritations. Use protective eye goggles to prevent the stripper from splashing into your eye.The goggles also offer protection against the chemical vapors. These can be found for around $20 at home improvement and hardware shops."

Loosen the paint with a paint scraper.,
Wash the surface area.,
Test the pH level.,
Let the area dry.,
Clean up your work space.",How to Remove Epoxy Paint3," Slowly pour a small amount of the epoxy stripper into a metal container or can.Since the product should be applied incrementally to small surfaces areas, do not pour out a large amount at once. Apply the product to surfaces up to 9 square feet (0.83 square meters)., Dip a paintbrush into the stripper. Brush the stripper onto the surface that has been painted with epoxy paint. Be sure to brush in one direction only onto small surfaces., The paint stripper should remain on the epoxy paint for about 15 minutes. This will give the product enough time to break down the chemicals in the epoxy.The instructions may vary from product to product. Be sure to follow the suggested time in the instructions.
During this time, consider leaving the room to limit your exposure to the paint stripper.

, After 15 minutes, use a paint scraper to scratch the surface of the paint. If the paint lifts away, it is ready for removal. You may have to apply multiple coats to fully remove the epoxy paint., Use a paint scraper to lift away the epoxy paint. At a shallow angle, place the metal blade of the scraper onto the surface of the epoxy paint. Apply pressure and push the scraper away from you to lift up the paint.If you are working with wood, be sure to move in the direction of the wood grain with a plastic scraper to avoid damaging the surface.
Consider using a toothpick or a toothbrush to remove the epoxy paint in nooks and recesses., After you have removed the paint, wipe the surface area with a damp washcloth or towel to neutralize the pH balance. Caustic strippers can be cleaned with vinegar and water, while others can be cleaned with mineral spirits. If you used a methylene chloride stripper, use mineral spirits to clean the surface as water can damage the surface of wood., Paint strippers can disturb the pH balance on a wooden surface, which can cause problems if you wish to repaint the area. Use pH papers to check for a pH level of 7.Place the test paper on the damp surface of the clean surface, and compare the reading on the paper to the pH key provided.If the pH level is too high, wash the area again and test once more in a few days., After you have removed the epoxy paint, let the surface area dry. Point fans toward the surface to help speed up the drying process. Depending on your climate, it may take up to a week to completely dry., Carefully pour any unused stripper back into the container, and wash your tools and work surfaces with water and soap. After removing your protective gloves, wash your hands with cold water and soap."

Consider sand-blasting.,
Proceed with caution.,
Vacuum the particles.,
Check for white residue.",How to Remove Epoxy Paint4," A floor grinder is a tool that uses an abrasive surface to remove paint and dirt while polishing a large area. To remove epoxy paint or coatings from a concrete floor, consider renting a floor grinder at your local home improvement store. A bladed diamond grinder attachment or a diamond cup wheel can help scuff up a concrete surface and remove epoxy., Shot blasting can help remove epoxy paint from a concrete floor, and it can help prep the surface if you are planning to repaint it. This method removes the paint by chipping it away using tiny steel balls that rebound off the floor at high pressure. The grooves and surface texture that this leaves behind can be polished afterward.Home restoration professionals and industrial flooring companies offer these services. You can also rent these devices at home restoration and hardware stores.

, Sand-blasting is another form of abrasive blasting that can help remove epoxy on concrete or hardwood floors.Compressed air or steam shoots a stream of sand particles over a surface at high speeds to remove the surface coating.You can rent portable sand-blasting equipment at your local hardware store, or you can hire a home improvement professional.

, With any blast-removal method, it is important to wear protective earmuffs while working as these machines can produce a lot of noise. In addition, the area must be well-ventilated to prevent any toxic particles or chemicals from entering your lungs as you work., Remove the dust and particles from the surface after blasting by using a wet-dry vacuum.These can be purchased at home improvement stores and range between $30 to $130., After vacuuming, run your finger along the floor. If you lift up white residue, then the vacuum did not clean the surface entirely. Vacuum the surface again or pressure wash the floor to thorough clean the surface.If there is a large amount of white residue, mix ½ cup of trisodium phosphate, or TSP, with two gallons of water. TSP is a cleaning agent that can be purchased at hardware stores.Gently scrub the floor with the mixture, or use a push broom to move the mixture along the surface. Use a pressure washer or hose to rinse the surface."

,, (These two sensors could be your problem (in 50% of the cases, it is). Also, there is a heating fuse to your left, under the larger casing on the left. It is about an inch long, and has two wires attached. This can also be your problem. One screw holds it in. If in doubt, take all these to the appliance store, and they'll test them with a voltmeter.)

, It should easily come loose. If not, lift a little harder and pull the bottom toward you. There may be a screw and small bracket at the top that needs to be removed. There are some hooks on the bottom that will come loose.

, Take out the screw, and carefully pull out the element, which is a coil that heats up, on some metal housing. Examine the coil for breaks. If you have a voltmeter, test the element. Also test the Sensors. This will tell you what's broken.

, Replace the element, replace all the sensors and the back panel, as well as the exhaust hose. When done, try it out!

Assess the damage to the wall.,
Consider how much more soiled wall painting you will need to do in the next 2 years or so.

,
Buy an appropriate size of a stain-blocking primer.,
Remove any loose paint, cobwebs and the like.,
Roller the walls with your final color right over the blocking primer.

",How to Quickly Paint a Soiled Wall," Naturally if there are excessive holes, they will need repair (paint will cover small holes made from push pins and tiny nails). Is the whole wall stained and dirty or are there just some spots?;
,, Brands to look for include Kilz Premium Primers ™ and Zinsser Bulls Eye 1 2 3 Primer-sealer ™.

, Cover the stains in a liberal coat of the stain-blocking primer. Don’t try to cover or hide the stain, it will still show through the stain blocking primer, but it will end there.If you are blocking a deeper color that covers the surface of the wall, use a roller to apply the stain blocking primer. In almost all cases you will only need one coat. Wait until it dries - about 30 and 60 minutes.

Clean the surface of your laminate countertop where the scratches reside.,
Use a soft cloth to remove any remaining cleaning solution and to wipe the area dry.

,
Apply furniture paste wax to the scratches using a clean, soft cloth.,
Work the wax into the scratches on the countertop.,
Buff the wax across the entire surface of the countertop.,
Apply a seam or laminate filler, or a laminate repair paste, to the scratches on your countertop.,
Use a putty knife to spread the layers evenly across the countertop's surface.

,
Allow the laminate paste or filler to dry for at least 24 hours before using or touching the area.

",How to Remove a Scratch from a Laminate Countertop,"


Use warm water and liquid dish-washing soap or spray undiluted vinegar over the affected area to remove any existing stains before treatment. If the scratches are too deep and the vinegar does not remove the stains, pour small amounts of rubbing alcohol over the affected area instead.

,,


Waxing your laminate countertops is the best solution for hiding and covering smaller, lighter scratches.

,


Use the soft cloth to spread the wax lightly across the rest of the countertop, including the sections unaffected by scratches. This procedure will keep the appearance of the countertop consistent.

,


Use another clean, soft cloth to buff the wax or use an electric, motorized buffer tool that contains a lamb's wool applicator for optimal results.

,


Laminate pastes and fillers will penetrate the deepest parts of scratches and conceal them completely. Seam and laminate fillers and pastes can be purchased specifically for wood or plastic laminate countertops.
Select a paste or filler that matches the color of your countertop from any hardware store or retail store that specializes in home repair. You can also contact the manufacturer of your countertop directly for filler product recommendations or for help with determining the exact color of your countertop.
Apply multiple layers of the laminate paste or filler to each scratch using the method outlined by the instructions on the packaging. You may also use measurements of one-sixteenth of an inch (1.58 mm) for each layer.;

Test whether the granite needs sealing.,
Select a penetrating sealer for natural stone.,
Read the instructions on the label.,
Clean the granite.,
Wear gloves and ventilate the area.,
Test in a small corner.,
Apply the sealer evenly.,
Let the sealer absorb into the stone.,
Apply a second coat if necessary.,
Wipe up the sealer.,
Leave the counter alone for 48 hours.",How to Seal Granite Countertops," Ignoring the claims of late-night sales pitches, many granite counter tops are better left unsealed.To test your surface, leave a few drops of water or a wet paper towel on the granite for 10 to 15 minutes. If the water begins to soak into and darken the counter top, continue to the next step to begin sealing.If the water remains beaded on the surface, the counter top is already stain-resistant, and should not be sealed.









If the granite will be exposed to petroleum-based products, repeat the test with a few drops of mineral oil.Seal if either test darkens the granite.
If the water doesn't soak in, don't seal it anyway ""just in case."" The sealer needs to soak into the stone to be effective, and if it can't, you'll end up with an ugly, hazy residue.;
, Only use products specifically designed for natural stone, and ideally for granite specifically. A penetrating or ""impregnating"" sealer will soak into the counter top to slow stain absorption, without causing the structural or aesthetic issues caused by top sealers in this application.These guidelines are enough to prevent harm to your counter top, but you can dive into the fine print if you're interested:








For best results, choose a sealer that mentions ""fluorocarbon aliphatic resin"" on the label. These can provide years of good protection, but are also the most expensive.
The next best options use ""siloxane"" or ""silane,"" which tend to be a little worse at repelling oil.
Use silicone-based sealers or linseed-based sealers only as a last resort, as they are the least durable and sometimes even cause color deterioration.
Some sealant chemicals can be either water-based or solvent-based. Experts disagree on which is best; both are adequate, but water-based sealer is easier to apply and better for the environment., There are many varieties of sealer, and it's best to follow the specific instructions if available. The method below provides more detail than most labels will give you, but always go with the label if the two sets of instructions contradict each other.








, Wipe off the granite with water and dish soap or a specialized stone cleaner, then wipe with a dry towel or cloth, preferably lint-free. Wait 24 hours to allow the granite to dry completely and return to its original color before continuing, or 8 hours if a strong breeze is blowing across it.








If the counters were just installed or other construction projects are happening in the same room, it's best to wait until after they're finished. Dust from construction can interfere with the sealer's protection.

, Solvent-based sealers may produce unpleasant or harmful vapors during application, so open a window and put on a pair of gloves. Don't worry; the sealer will not leave any harmful chemicals in your kitchen.








, Choose an, unobtrusive corner of the granite, perhaps where a microwave or other appliance is normally located. Follow the steps below on a tiny area first, to make sure the sealer is compatible with the granite. If the sealer leaves a hazy residue or discolors the granite, find a different product.









While the advice in the preparation section should prevent most of these problems, the extreme variety found among granite surfaces makes it impossible to reduce the chance to zero.

, Cover the surface evenly with the spray bottle, or using a sealer-dampened, lint-free cloth or brush if the sealer is not in a spray bottle. The entire surface should be damp, but not soaked.








, Check your instructions for the exact time, as leaving it on too long can cause discoloration. Typically, the sealer needs about 20 minutes to soak into the stone, but trust the label for this one.








, If the label directs you to add a second coat, this is usually done when the first coat is almost, but not completely dry. Wipe this over the surface to ensure even application.








, After you leave the sealer on for twenty minutes or as long as the label direct, wipe up the remaining sealer with a clean rag. Too much sealer left on the counter can cause an unattractive haze.








, This is another number that depends on the exact product, but the sealer will need to ""cure"" for some length of time before it is effective. Some products cure after an hour or two, but it's still a good idea to avoid washing the counter for the first 48 hours after application.

Cover doorways with plastic sheeting—held in place with painters tape—to contain the splatters and plaster dust within the room where you are working. Remove cover plates from light switches and wall sockets to keep them splatter-free.;
, If there is a lot of damage (nicks, cracks, large holes), you must repair these first. You may just need to finish joints between pieces of new sheetrock; maybe you have to finish broken plaster or a plaster-sheetrock joint; or perhaps you plan to repair plaster that has begun to crack from years of settling or vibration. Perhaps you simply want to flatten your popcorn-style ceiling.Pull any nails from the surface that will receive the skim coat. Fill in the holes with joint compound.
Cover any cracks in plaster walls by scraping out any loose plaster, filling the hole with joint compound, and applying joint tape to prevent the crack from spreading. Allow to dry before continuing.

, Dust first, then wash if necessary to remove any grease. Use a sponge or a damp towel to wipe down the surface. Use water or a wall-friendly cleaning product depending on the extent of any grime. Rinse the wall with clean water after using any cleaning product.Sweep away loose particulates with a duster, or go over the wall with the dust-brush attachment on your vacuum cleaner.Wipe light smudges with a damp, clean sponge or paper towel.
For more resistant grime, try wiping the wall with a mix of warm water and mild detergent. Try rubbing stains with a paste of baking soda and water. Try mixing 1 cup ammonia, 1/2 cup vinegar, and 1/4 cup baking soda with one gallon of warm water for a powerful homemade cleaning agent.
Consider using commercial surface-cleaning products like 409 and Pine-Sol.

, You should only skim over matte paint or primer. Any other painted surface should be primed with a basic primer, then prepared by wiping down with a degreaser. This allows the compound to attach to the surface and not slide off or bubble. If you have removed wallpaper from a wall, prime the surface again with an oil-based primer.

, Joint compound—sometimes called sheetrock ""mud""—is very fine dust mixed with water. There are two typical choices for skim-coat materials:


Pre-mixed joint compound comes ready to apply to the surface. After application, it gradually dries out. As such, you can add more water to the mixture to extend your working time. If you have never applied a skim coat before, you may find it easiest to use a ready-to-use pre-mixed product.""Quick set"" is made from the same dusty base as pre-mixed joint compound, but you must mix it with water before use. Setting compounds are like concrete: they don't dry out. Instead, they undergo a chemical reaction which makes them ""set."", Spackling is often mistakenly used as a skim-coat. However, spackling is harder to spread, more difficult to sand, and is best used on wood trim to fill large imperfections., These could include:


A ladder or scaffolding to reach high places without fatigue. This is especially important if you are applying a skim coat to a high wall or ceiling.
A large five gallon bucket for mixing the skim coat.
A metal mixing rod that attaches to a drill. This will make it easier to mix large amounts of compound.
A mud pan.
The skimmer plate. This holds the prepared compound. You will hold the skimmer plate in one hand—or place it somewhere within easy reach—while you apply the skim coat.The compound applicator of your choice. You can use a paint roller or a flat, trowel-like ""compound applicator"". The applicator should be 6"" wider than the area being smoothed. Use a 12"" applicator for leveling., A setting compound (""quick set"") comes in bags, and you must mix it with water before using it. The bags have a time limit printed on them—often 20, 45, or 90 minutes—which indicates the working time under average conditions. Heat shortens working time and cold lengthens it. Mix your compound in small batches: if you mix too much at one time, it will start to dry out in the bucket before it can be applied.


The benefit of a setting compound is that it can be sanded or re-coated as soon as it sets. This also means that you have know exactly where you will apply it and be ready, because as it stiffens it cannot be re-wetted.
Setting compounds are much more durable than ""mud"" and will not come apart when wet. They are ideal for walls and ceilings in places that have been exposed to moisture, such as bathrooms and kitchens. A glop of setting compound will set even if dropped in water.

, Stir a bucket of ready-made joint compound with a paddle attached to an electric drill. Mix until the compound is completely smooth, adding water as needed. The resulting mixture should have the texture of custard.

, You can tint many joint compounds by adding tint while you are mixing. Find tint products in a hardware store. You can also add sand or other rough materials if you want a certain texture embedded in your coat.

, Start slow with the drill until the liquid is mixed, then gradually increase the speed. You can slowly add more liquid if you need to thin the compound. Run an image or video search for ""mixed joint compound"" to see what your compound should look like when ""ready.""


Mixing compound is much like mixing cake batter. Remember not to pull the drill mixer out of the compound while the drill is running, or you may have flecks of mud flying everywhere.
It is critical to make sure there are no lumps in your ready-to-apply compound. If you do come across a lump of dry compound during application, you can probably smash it into the surrounding wet compound. If the lump is too big to crush, remove it with a small putty knife.

, The five gallon bucket needs to be cleaned each time you use it, or else little pieces of dry compound will carry over to your new batch. Your helper can transfer the prepared compound from the bucket into a smaller container. From this container, use either your applicator or a smaller trowel to move the compound to the mud pan. Then, your helper can start cleaning the bucket and preparing the next batch of compound.

, Decide how thick you want the coat, or determine the type of finish that you want (from completely smooth to rough and textured). If you are right-handed, you will be holding the skimmer plate in your left hand and the compound applicator in your right hand. You may have to adjust your technique to get the desired thickness and texture. You can always add more compound to the surface, but once dry, it is messy and time-consuming to remove., Mound the compound up at one end of a repair area, then pull it across the surface with the compound applicator. Apply firm, even pressure in the direction of the joint/crack, similar to pulling a window squeegee, such that little material is present on either side of the repair area.


Start in one corner of the wall, and work down from the highest point. If you are skimming a ceiling, start at an edge and work towards the center.
If you have never skimmed before, try practicing on a piece of scrap drywall. This way, you can get used to the applicator and the weight of the compound, and you can see what it will look like when dry.

, Once you have applied the first scoop, take another and work out of the spot you just finished. Be thorough—make sure that each new scoop overlaps with the last. Pull the coat in different directions to even out bumps and valleys regardless of how they are aligned.


A repair area isn't flat: it is a low, smooth mound, made to look flat. Shine a light along the surface to identify areas where the wall is sunken, and mark those spots with pencil as you go.
Patience is key, but you must work efficiently so that the mixed compound does not dry out before you finish. Give yourself enough time to complete an entire section. Try not to stop in the middle of a surface, as blending a dried section with wet compound can be difficult.
Do not try to rush the application by taking a larger scoop. This may make your arms tired, it may lead to compound falling off your skimmer, and you may need to go over the area later to remove excess compound.

, Smooth fiberglass repair tape onto cracks and joints. Let the surface set or dry out before you apply the next coat. If repair areas are deep/large, count on 2-4 coats to get solid repairs & smooth surfaces. Do not apply excess material or try to finish with one coat—this can only be fixed by demo or lots of sanding. It is better to do many thin coats than an uneven one that needs repair., Use a fine grit sandpaper (180 to 220) to smooth out any rough edges. If you marked low areas with a pencil, you can blend them into the high areas to ensure that the next coat will bond fluidly to the surface.

, This time, work in a horizontal direction, perpendicular to the first coat. Allow to dry. Sand once more, and run your hands over the surface to feel out imperfections that you can't see with the naked eye.

, With each new coat, switch direction from horizontal to vertical to ensure even coverage of the drywall. Make sure that you allow each coat ample time to dry before you apply the next coat.

, Vacuum the walls and make sure that there is no remaining plaster dust. Apply a primer before painting or hanging wallpaper.

Connect your stucco sprayer to a compressed air source.,
Pull the trigger.

,
Let the sprayer run for 10 seconds.",How to Spray Stucco1,";
,, If the sound of the air blast changes after that time, the sprayer is ready to use. If the sound changes after only 5 seconds, you can still use the sprayer, but with caution.


The tone change indicates when the air pressure drops. A drop in air pressure means more air is being used than can flow through the line from the compressor.

Add the remaining sand to the mix.,
Turn off the mixer and take a sample of the mix.,
Place a full cup (240 ml) of mix on a trowel.,
Spray some mix on a wall or ceiling to test its consistency.",How to Spray Stucco2,",,,


If the mix is too watery, pour in more cement. If the mix becomes too stiff, pour in more water then add more cement.

, The stucco should have a toothpaste-like consistency at this point.

, If it becomes too stiff, add water to it.

, You can use a long-handed cup or simply pour a bit of it into a wheelbarrow.

, If it begins to slide off before the trowel is angled at 40 degrees, it is probably too wet.

, If it sticks, it is a good consistency. You may need to add water to the mix if it is too dry to stick. Likewise, if it is too wet to stick, add more sand to the mix.

Fill the hopper with stucco mix.,
Spray the stucco mix on the target structure.,
Level out the stucco coating with a trowel and allow the stucco to set.",How to Spray Stucco3," Sprayers come with a small tank on the front called a ""hopper,"" which allows you to scoop out small amounts of stucco mix for each application. If the mix you're using pours out of the nozzle before you pull the trigger, thicken the stucco mix with more sand.

, Point the stucco sprayer at the wall, making sure you are around 12 inches (30.5 cm) away and perpendicular to the wall. Spray in 1 to 2-second bursts. Try to keep the stucco coating even throughout the structure by constantly moving the sprayer up and down during the entire process, as spending too much time spraying one area may cause the stucco coating to be uneven across the structure.

, The trowel will help you smooth the stucco on to the structure. After the stucco sets, use the edge of the trowel to scrape off splatter and uneven stucco, then wipe the stucco surface down with a sponge and water.

If you can’t move comfortably around the furniture pile, you may need to move some pieces to a different room.;
, If you drip paint onto your floor, it may be hard to remove. Protect your floors by covering them with a thick drop cloth or some newspaper. The covering should start at the base of the wall and extend out two or three feet (0.6 – 1 meter.) Secure the drop cloth or newspaper by taping it against the bottom of the wall with painter’s tape.


Make sure the painter’s tape doesn’t cover a part of the wall that you want to paint.

, Remove wall features such as switch and outlet plates, light fixtures, wall hangings, and curtains. If you can’t remove the feature, cover it with painter’s tape or a plastic bag to protect it from paint splatters.Store switch and outlet plates with in a re-sealable plastic bag to avoid misplacing them.

, Before you paint, you must remove old wallpaper, scrape off loose paint chips, and repair any holes. Small holes in drywall can be repaired with putty. Larger holes should be patched with pieces of drywall.If your home was built before 1978, test your paint for lead before scraping it off with a testing kit. If it tests positive, call a professional lead paint remover.Find professional lead paint removers online or by calling your local home improvement store.

, Fill a large bucket with warm water and about a tablespoon of mild dish detergent. Next, dampen a large sponge in the soapy water and wipe it along the walls to clean them. Once the entire room has been cleaned, “rinse” the walls with a clean sponge and fresh water.


Let the walls dry for an hour or two before continuing.

, While taping, use many small sections of tape instead of one large piece of tape.Use the tape to outline the area you want to paint and protect the areas that you don’t want to paint. For example, cover the bare light switches and outlets with a small strip to protect the wiring.Consider lining:


Baseboards
Wall trim
Windowsills

, Paint fumes can be harmful when inhaled. Therefore, you should properly ventilate your room before beginning. First, open a door or window to encourage air flow. Next, set up a small fan to circulate the air in the room.

, Use a paintbrush to “cut in” the wall, or paint the edges. First, choose a large, angled paintbrush. Dip it into the paint bucket and wipe it along the edge to get rid of any excess paint. Next, paint about four to five inches (10 – 13 centimeters) along the edges of the wall using back and forth motions, framing the wall with a layer of paint.Cut in around any taped wall features as well.
Let the paint become dry to the touch before continuing.

, First, fill a clean painting tray with paint. Next, partially submerge the paint roller into the paint. Roll the roller along the ridged section of the painting tray to even the paint out around the roller and remove any excess paint.

, Gently run the roller along the wall on the section that was cut in, starting on the edges and moving towards the center. Move the roller in a zigzag pattern, overlapping each line of paint with another. Work in sections to avoid painting over semi-dry paint.If you have to press the roller against the wall to paint it, you need to apply more paint.

, Once the first layer of paint is dry to the touch, you can paint another layer. However, if the new color is very similar to the old color, you may not need to add another layer.Unless you are painting a very light color over a very dark color, you don’t need to cut in the walls again.

, As soon as you’ve finished painting, remove the painters tape. Slowly pull the strips of tape off of the wall at a 135-degree angle towards yourself to create clean, crisp lines in the paint.Once the tape is off of the wall, throw it away.

, Allow the paint to dry completely before you replace the light fixtures or wall hangings. Even if the paint is dry to the touch, it may not be completely dry yet. In fact, the paint can take anywhere from one day to one week to finish drying. Look on the back of the painting can to see the recommended drying times.

, Horizontal or vertical stripes can add a lot of color to a room. First, use painting tape to measure out your stripes. Next, use your roller or a large paintbrush to paint every other taped section. Once the paint is dry to the touch, remove the tape.If the original paint is dark, you may need several coats of paint on the stripes to cover it up.

, A large, textured painting sponge can be used to create a soft color gradient on your walls. First, dip a small part of the sponge in the paint. Next, dab the sponge against the wall. Continue dabbing with the sponge to create a soft pattern. Dab two or three colors on top of one another to create layers of bright color. For example:


Layers of forest green, teal, and bright yellow paint can be used to create a garden atmosphere.
Dab on light pink, dark salmon, and a dusky rose paint to add a romantic blush to the wall.
Create a neutral gradient by layering beige, light grey, and soft pink paint., Wall decals can be used to add interesting designs to your walls. First, peel off the backing of the wall decal. Next, press the sticky side of the decal against the wall. Smooth out any wrinkles with your hand or a soft towel. Last, peel away the clear transfer paper.Don’t peel the transfer paper too quickly or you may damage the decal.

, If you aren’t interested in painting your whole room, add an accent wall instead. First, choose a bold, bright color that matches the decorations in your room. Next, choose a wall to paint. Section off the wall with painters tape and paint it using a roller or large paintbrush.Remove any wall hangings or light features from the wall before painting it.

, Leftover paint can be used to touch up any areas of the wall that become damaged in the future. First, wipe away any drips of paint along the rim or on the outside. Next, replace the lid and tap it into place with a hammer. Store the covered paint in a cool dry place, such as a basement or utility closet.Label the paint by writing on the lid with a permanent marker. Include the date and which room the paint was used in.

, Blot off excess paint onto an old newspaper and throw it away. Next, clean the brush with warm, soapy water, taking care to remove the paint between the bristles. Rinse the brush to remove any soap residue.Place the brush on its side to dry. This will help maintain the shape of the brush.

, Remove the soft cover of the paint roller and throw it away. Next, use a damp dishtowel to wipe paint away from the metal frame. Let the metal frame dry completely before storing it to avoid rusting.

, If you lined the floor with newspapers, gather them up and throw them away. If you used a drop cloth, allow it to dry completely. Next, fold the drop cloths and store them in a clean, dry place., Replace any switch and outlet plates, light fixtures, wall hangings, and curtains. Next, move the furniture back to its original position. If necessary, vacuum or sweep away any dried paint chips that may have fallen onto the floor.

, Place something along the lines of a tarp,over areas that could possibly get dust or soot on them while chopping.

, Use a hammer and chisel to break off the damaged stucco and lath from the sheathing of the wall, but you must leave some lath around the damaged area, as the new lath will be tied to the old. The stucco should fall off fairly easily.

, from the non-damaged stucco in the outside of the patch area. This is the lath previously described as important that should not be removed. Pulling it back will allow you to work it a little more comfortably.

, Cut it as big as the uncovered portion of the lath. Use the hammer tacker to stick the piece on the sheathing.

, Use the rubber membrane to seal of the outside edge of the lath. The rubber membrane may not stick well to the area being sealed off. In that case, tack a few staples in or improvise in order to keep it in place.

, Cut the piece size to fit into the patch area. The metal lath should be large enough to fit beyond where the metal lath from the good stucco on the outside edge can fit over the cut piece.

, Place the lath in the patch and place a few nails in that will keep it in place.

, Place nails in places that will provide a good anchor to the lath. Don't worry about hitting studs because it is only a patch. The nails should be spaced about 6 inches (15.2 cm) apart.

, Take the old lath that you bent outwards and bend it over the new piece of lath you installed. Place nails where the two pieces overlap.

, Make sure it does not dry and harden.

, Use the scoop to place some cement on your hawk. Use your trowel to take the cement off the hawk and spread it onto the wall. Skim just enough cement over the lath so that it is covered.

, Use the scratcher to scratch the entire skimmed area.

, If your current batch is dried out, mix a new one.

, Clean them so they don’t get ruined. Use a wash brush and bucket of water, or whatever else that may work.

, You will know the patch is dry when it turns from a dark grey to a light grey.

, Mix enough to fill the patch twice.

, Scoop cement out of the bucket and place in the hawk. Use the trowel to spread the cement onto the wall. The brown coat must be level with the surrounding wall of the patch, so use enough mud to fill the patch in adequately.

, When the patch has been filled in with cement, use the darby and scrape down across the patch area. Wetting the darby makes the process work smoother.

, If any holes exist after running the darby across the patch, throw some cement in the holes and repeat the leveling process. You must now immediately begin the next part, floating.

, Use a swirling motion with the wet float to start leveling the wall. Be careful not to press too hard against the wall so that you dig into it, but use enough pressure so that you are effectively roughing up the surface of the wall.

, Make sure the outside edge of the patch is smoothed out onto the existing wall with the float. You may apply more pressure on the outside of the patch for this purpose.

, When the patch is roughed up and evened out with the area previously existing wall around it the job is complete. Make sure the patch cures before putting a finishing coat on.

, These materials include a bag of pre-mixed cement (with fibers), bonding agent, and water.

, A margin trowel for scraping the edges of the bucket. An electric drill and beater for mixing the cement. A wash brush is recommended for cleaning the tools after mixing the cement.

, You will want to fill it up about ¼ full with water.

, You'll want to add roughly 16 ounces.

, You can now fill the rest of the bucket with the pre-mixed cement.

, Mix the bucket with the electric drill and beater until the right consistency is met. You will know the cement is at the right consistency when it is not soupy, but it keeps its form fairly well. You may need to add some water, check the cements consistency.

Slide refrigerator back into position.",How to Clean Refrigerator Coils," Shut off the circuit breaker, remove the fuse or slide the refrigerator away from the wall as needed to remove the refrigerator's plug from the electrical outlet. Shut off water supply lines if equipped with ice maker or water dispenser.;
, There are two sets of coils for cooling appliances like refrigerators, they are called the evaporator3 and condenser1 coils. Overly simplified, the two coils are filled with gas and liquid respectively, and are parts of a complex ""circuit"" that has a compressor4 and expansion valve2 that perform the work. The gas filled evaporator coil is located in the space to be cooled, and performs the task by absorbing heat from that space. It is usually protected from damage and out of view inside the freezer section. The ""heated"" gas is compressed by the compressor, where it is further heated (hot to the touch) by the compression process. The heated compressed gas and liquid is passed through the condenser coil that is located away from the cooled space. This condenser coil is where some of the heat in the liquid is released to the ambient air. The cooled liquid is then drawn through the expansion valve by the suction of the compressor, where the liquid immediately boils off to a gas. This causes the temperature of the gas to drop significantly (well below freezing) in the evaporator coil. The process repeats until the thermostat in the space is satisfied. Because the condenser coil is exposed to the ambient air on the refrigerator, it requires regular cleaning. There are a few locations that the condenser coil may be found:



Older refrigerators have the coil (a grid-like structure often painted black) mounted on the rear of the refrigerator.
Newer refrigerators often locate the condenser coil at the bottom. It is likely that a fan (that may or may not be readily visible) will be directed at the coil to assist with heat dissipation. Use a flashlight to assist locating the coil and fan if needed. The coil will be accessible from one of two places:
Toe space panel. Remove the panel at the bottom of the front of the refrigerator and carefully slide the condensate tray out (if present, the condensate tray may contain water). A visual inspection upward into this space may reveal a flat condenser coil when located here.
Rear access panel. If not found behind the toe space, the refrigerator will have to be slid away from the wall further to work from behind. Disconnect water supply lines if too short to allow enough room to work. Remove the fasteners that holds an access panel in position. The condenser coil may be flat, but will likely be cylindrical in shape when located here.



, Seriously. Make sure the power to the refrigerator is disconnected.

, With a plastic crevice or brush attachment, carefully vacuum dirt and dust wherever it is seen. Use care not to damage the fins or coil. A breach created in the coil will allow the refrigerant to escape and will likely result in an expensive repair.

, If the fan is visible and accessible, cleaning it will help it move air across the condenser coil as designed. Dirt and dust, if allowed to accumulate on the fan blades, decreases airflow, affects balance and can contribute to early failure of the compressor.

, Use a narrow paint brush to gently remove stubborn dirt and dust from the coil and fan if able to get sufficient access.

, Plug the refrigerator back into wall outlet. Arrange any water supply lines and power cords so that they will not be kinked or crushed by the refrigerator."

Determine the type of material you are going to powdercoat and then select a suitable powder for the finish.,
Disassemble all threaded or lubricated interfaces before you begin, including anything you don't want coated.,
Clean the base metal thoroughly.,
Apply the powder to the object to be powder coated.,
Cure the metal at a temperature appropriate for the powder material you use.",How to Powder Coat1," Powdercoating is done with thermoplastic or thermoset polymer powder, and these materials are formulated for bonding with different base metals to give the best results.


See the next section for a detailed discussion of the differences between thermoset and thermoplastic coats. What's good for a car may not be good for a small trinket or decoration.;
, It sounds simple, but many people forget this step. The powder coat you apply will adhere to everything (if properly done) on your rig, making sealed surfaces, bearings, clamps, bolts and nuts, etc. useless after blasting., Using bead or abrasive blasting on hard metal, such as cast iron or steel, will remove mill and rust scale, dirt and foreign materials. Chemical solvent cleaning will remove any grease, oil, or paint, and light sanding can be done to finish preparing the surface. Aluminum, magnesium, and other soft alloy metals can be solvent cleaned and wire brushed, or sanded if needed.


For example, you might sand-blast whatever you want to powder coat until it's down to bare metal. This is the first step in the process. If you don't have access to a sandblaster, you can also use a wire wheel, bench-grinder, or even sandpaper. Just as long as you get the material down to bare metal.
The next step is to strip the metal of any remaining grime or gunk. You can achieve this by soaking the item in acetone (if the item is small enough) or by wiping it with an acetone-soaked rag.

, This is done using a ""gun"" or compressed air sprayer which electrostatically charges the powder material so that it sticks to the grounded base metal object receiving the coating. These guns are available from various suppliers, and cost as little as $100. For experimental purposes, you can apply the powder to a flat metal surface by dusting it directly on, and spreading it to a thin, even layer.


Make sure you have your electrostatic charge hooked up to whatever part you are coating. The powder you use won't properly adhere unless it's given a charge to hold onto.
After applying the coat but before curing, be careful not to brush or blow on the powder coat, as this will cause some of the powder to fall off, leaving you with a less precise coat.

, A conventional oven is suitable for this purpose if the metal is small enough to fit, otherwise, an infrared heat lamp or other flame less heat source needs to be used. Normally, the object is heated to 350° to 375° F (175° to 190° C) for about 10 to 15 minutes, and allowed to cool.


You can use a conventional oven to powder coat smaller items. Just be sure that you won't be using the oven to cook food after the powder coating. Once you've used an oven to powder coat, it absolutely should not be used for cooking.

Use thermoplastic coatings for items you might eventually remold, and thermoset coatings for items that will remain essentially permanent.,
Choose thermotype based on some of the features of the coat.,
Know the advantages and disadvantages of thermosets.,
Know the advantages and disadvantages of thermoplastics.",How to Powder Coat2," The main difference between thermoplastic and thermoset is the reversibility of the coat. Like their name implies, thermoset coatings cannot re-melt after undergoing an irreversible chemical bonding process. Conversely, thermoplastic coatings can remelt because no chemical process takes place.


Thermostat coatings are ideal for things like electronics and appliances because they need to withstand higher amounts of heat, which might cause thermoplastic coatings to melt.

, Thermosets and thermoplastics have different chemical properties, making them ideal for different uses. Knowing some of those properties can help you choose which type to coat with:



Thermosets are said to reinforce the structural integrity of an item, making them particularly suitable for heavy wear-and-tear. They also supply the item with superior chemical and heat resistance, as mentioned above.

Thermoplastics offer a mixture of strength and flexibility. They are commonly used for items such as plastic bags and even mechanical parts.

, Thermosets are often used to coat appliances because of the heat they can withstand.


Advantages: beautiful aesthetic look; cheap; added strength and stability; resistant to extreme temperatures.
Disadvantages: irreversible process means thermoset can't be recycled; more difficult to finish; can't be reshaped., Thermoplastics are used for many items, such as park benches, that require both plasticity and durability.


Advantages: high lubricity or tack; recyclable; able to remolded and/or reshaped; increased impact resistance.
Disadvantages: more expensive (usually); can melt off if overheated.

Understanding what a gasket or door seal is.,
Determine whether you need to replace the door seal at all.,
Consider repairing the gasket if it’s possible.,
Research the right gasket to buy.,
Prepare the new gasket while you’re removing the old one.,
Remove the gasket from the refrigerator door.,
Loosen, but do not remove, the screws that hold the metal retainer around the entire door.,
Pull the gasket out of the door to remove it once you have loosened the retainer screws.,
Take the new gasket, and install it.,
Use the hex head driver to screw the metal retainer in.,
Apply powder.,
Rub some powder around the hinge side corners of the door seal and where the seal slides.,
If this still doesn't prevent twisting, then wedge a screwdriver under the seal as you close the door, and leave it shut for an hour.

,
Close the refrigerator door, and open it several times to inspect the gasket.,
Rub petroleum jelly along the hinged side of the door if you see some gaps.",How to Replace a Refrigerator Door Seal," Every refrigerator has one. This is a gasket (or seal) that is made out of molded rubber.









The goal of the gasket is to keep cold in and to keep heat out of the refrigerator. Essentially, it seals the colder air in, and prevents air outside the refrigerator from entering it.
The reason this matters is because a bad or worn seal will allow cold air to leave the refrigerator, and warm air to enter it. This means that temperatures in the refrigerator could increase, and spoil food inside of it. It will also cost you more money in energy because of the cool air escaping.;
, If there are gaps between the gasket on the door and the refrigerator gasket, it’s not sealing correctly.One way to tell that you need a new gasket is if your refrigerator seems to be running more frequently, or you just think it seems like it’s losing cold air. You could also inspect the door gasket for condensation or blackish looking mold. If you see either of those things, you probably need a new gasket because the cold air is making warm air condense. If you see cracks or thinning of the gasket, it’s probably time for a new one.
You could also test the gasket with a dollar bill. Put the dollar bill between the refrigerator door and refrigerator, and close the door on it. Then, try to pull it out slowly. If you feel it drag slightly, your gasket doesn’t need replacing. If it slips out quickly or has moisture on it or mold, get a new gasket.
You will need to do one of two things: repair the gaps in the gasket or replace it altogether. Replacing a faulty seal will save you money by not wasting energy. It’s not very expensive to buy a new gasket. It just costs about $50 to $75, and it should only take about 30 minutes to replace. You will save energy, so it will pay for itself fast., Close the refrigerator door and look at the gaps. Inspect them. How big are they and where are they?


Use petroleum jelly on the gasket to fix small gaps. Simply pull the gasket away from the channel to expose a couple of inches (.05 meter) in the door corner. Cut small strips of weather stripping. Pack the corner with it by placing it along the channel of the door gasket.
Push the gasket back in the channel. Repeat the process, and pack other corners if you think that’s needed.
Close the refrigerator door again and look for gaps again. If this didn’t work, and you still see gaps, you will need to replace the seal.

, This will depend on the type of refrigerator you have, and what its model and identification information says.


Check the owner’s manual. If you can’t find your owner’s manual, go online and research what it says.
Go to a hardware store or manufacturer service center, and tell them the refrigerator information. Store personnel should be able to help you find the right gasket. Check the door seal size. Measure your door.
You could also research the gasket on the website of the manufacturer. Be aware that if the door liner beneath the seal is cracked, you will need a new liner as well as seal (gasket).

, It’s a good idea to put the new gasket in warm water for a few moments before installing it. Before you remove the old one, shut off the power to the refrigerator.








This process will make it easier for you to install the new gasket. You also might find it easier to level the refrigerator if it seems off balance. Some people even remove the refrigerator door to install the gasket, but this is not mandatory.You won’t need a lot of equipment, but you will need what is called a hex head screwdriver. You can find these at most hardware stores. If you are confused what it is, just ask a salesperson and tell him or her the purpose. You should turn the screwdriver counter-clockwise., Grab the bottom of it on the inside, and pull the gasket back. You want to be able to see the metal gasket retainer., You should use the hex head nut screwdriver to do this. Lift the edges of the seal to find the screws underneath that are holding in the plastic liner and door seal. Often, the screws hold in a plastic liner, which in turn clamps the door seal to the door.








, Once all of the screws are loose, the door seal should easily slide out from behind the plastic liner. Don't be too forceful when doing this step, since some plastic liners can be quite brittle and crumble if you are too rough. 







, Position one of its corners on the top of the refrigerator door. Push the lip of the new gasket over the metal retainer, and slide it behind the metal retainer and around the entire perimeter of the refrigerator door. The best method is to start in the top corners, and work your way around the door.








, You don’t want to tighten the gasket retainer screws all the way. You want them to be snug.








, Use a bit of baby powder or talcum powder to prevent sticking.

, This will help to prevent the door seal from twisting as it meets the metal of the fridge.

,, You are looking for any warped areas of the gasket. Repeat this process several times.








, Once the gasket looks like it is properly fitted, tighten the screws more. Alternatively, you can heat the door seal up with a hair dryer to fix the gaps. This softens the door seal and allows you to stretch it.

Repair any leaks.",How to Fix a Vacuum Cleaner,"

Is it not turning on?
Is it not staying on?
Is it vacuuming weakly or unevenly?
Is it leaving fuzz or other debris behind?
Is it tripping a circuit breaker?
Is it producing a noise or an odor as it runs?;
, If you don't have a circuit tester, try plugging in a lamp or radio that you know works. Yes, it's obvious, but without electricity, your vacuum cleaner isn't going to get any work done., Some vacuum cleaners have a device that stops the machine if it overheats. If your vacuum cleaner cuts out, unplug it, check your manual and wait for a period of time (perhaps 20 or 30 minutes). Then, check for obstructions or other problems, and carefully turn it on again.

Note that vacuums sometimes have a small in-line thermal fuse that's almost hidden between the switch lead and the coil of the motor. It's not easily noticed and has tape covering it. A common type is a SEFuse SF109e available for about $1-2 (US) each on line.

, If the machine operates but functions weakly (poor suction), or if the vacuum cleaner is leaving debris behind, or if you smell dust or a general burning sort of odor. Then check the vacuum cleaner again. If it functions satisfactorily, there is no need to proceed past this level.







Replace the bag and clean all filters.






Make sure the airways are clean. Clear any clogs in the hose using a broom handle or a bent coat hanger wire. Be careful not to pack clogs further in or punch through the hose with the wire.




 The belt connects the drive shaft and the brush roll.

Replace the belt(s). Make sure the belts are engaging the brush roll, the drive shaft, and any other moving parts, such as power-drive rollers. A slipping belt may produce a distinct odor, that of hot rubber and/or plastic.






Clean the brush roll and make sure it is spinning freely. Lubricate the bearings. Replace the bearings or the entire brush roll, if necessary. Brush rolls may be made out of wood, especially in older models, or out of plastic in newer models.

, One way is to turn on the vacuum cleaner and carefully look underneath. Never touch the spinning brush roll, and be sure to keep loose clothing, hair, etc. clear.

Some vacuum cleaners have an idler or switch that disengages the brush roll when the handle is up or when a switch is set for hard floors. Make sure that the switch is set for carpeting and that the idler engages when the handle is down.

, Use a multimeter to check continuity. You are looking for open circuits. Clean the contacts and replace any segment of this path that lacks continuity. Be certain to use the correct fuse. Reset the breaker(s).

From the plug to just before the switch.




 Testing continuity across a switch.

Across the switch when the switch is closed (in the 'on' position).




 Two types of fuse you may find in a vacuum cleaner.

 This hose connection powers the brush accessory on a canister vacuum.

Across any electrical connections made on the hose.
The connection between the cord and the rest of the unit if there is a spring-loaded cord re-winder. Because it moves, this can be a point of failure.

, Is there a short circuit somewhere? Is the motor going out? Correct any problems you find., It may not be economical to replace the entire motor (it can cost as much as a new vacuum cleaner), but you may be able to service certain parts of it., If they are worn, replace them.





 Pry open the brush housing.

Pry open the brush housing.




 The motor brushes.

Remove and replace the brushes, making sure to reconnect the electrical wires as you found them and re-close the brush housing.

, There are bearings for the motor and blower (often connected). There may also be bearings for the drive shaft and any powered drive wheels. Look anywhere that something is spinning (or should be).

Before dismantling the motor or removing the blower, see if there is any side-to-side play in the shaft. If there is, it is a pretty good clue that the bearings are shot.

, Replace it if you find any. The blower is generally attached directly to the motor. Any unevenness could cause an imbalance, which could, in turn, damage the motor or bearings.

This is one place where you might find a left-handed screw thread, depending on the vacuum cleaner design.

, Replacing wheels is not a big deal, but broken wheels can sure slow you down. Here are wheels on two different vacuum cleaners. You may have to remove caps or covers to access the wheel attachment points.

This wheel has an E-clip holding it on. Remove the metal E-clip with pliers. Replace the wheel, then the clip.






Replace this wheel by squeezing these tabs together until the whole wheel pops off. The new wheel should snap right in.







, If something has punctured the hose, remove it with pliers and cover the opening with electrical tape. Silicone sealant is another good choice."

Then use your vacuum with the crevice tool to vacuum the opening where the wheel goes., On the bottom of your Roomba, you will notice a rectangular flap, that should lift open. Under this flap, you'll find your cylindrical brush, which is likely to be very dirty. Lift out this brush., On either end of your brush there will be small bearings. (On many models, these bearings are yellow). Remove these bearings and set them aside. Then, using your hand, pull off any hair that has gotten tangled around the ends of your brush., Take out the iRobot Roomba bristle brush and slide it onto the end of your cylindrical brush. Pull the bristle brush down the length of your cylindrical brush in order to remove hair and debris. Remove the hair/debris from the bristle brush with your fingers, and repeat this process 2-3 more times.An iRobot Roomba bristle brush should have been included with your Roomba.
If you have misplaced this item, you can purchase one online for around $5.

, Below the the space that held the cylindrical brush, you will see a cylindrical rubber roller. This will slide out. Remove the (yellow) bearings, and pull off any dirt/hair from the ends., Using the brush attachment on your vacuum, go over all sides of the brush and roller to remove dust, dirt, and hair. Set the brush and roller aside, and switch to your crevice tool. Now vacuum the compartment where the brush and roller go, paying careful attention to the gray flap that seals the compartment., You do not need to remove the rear two wheels in order to clean them. Instead, push the left wheel down and use the crevice tool to vacuum around it. Repeat this on the other side., Using your Phillips screwdriver, remove the four small screws that hold the black bottom cover in place. These screws may be a bit difficult to remove. Then slide off the bottom cover and set it aside., Locate the four tiny screws that hold the rectangular motor unit in place, and carefully remove them. Pull the rectangular unit out of the Roomba (on many models this is blue). With the motor compartment removed, run your vacuum crevice tool over the inside of your Roomba.These screws are very small and delicate. Be careful not to strip the tops of them as you remove them, and set them in a safe place.

, Using a can of compressed air, carefully work to remove any dust or debris from the motor unit. Pay attention to any crevices and openings.If you do not have compressed air, you can go over the motor with your vacuum crevice tool. However, be very careful not to disturb any wires.

, Place the motor compartment back inside the Roomba and secure it with the four tiny screws. Then replace the bottom cover and secure it with its four screws. Pop the front wheel back in place. Next, return the bearings to the rubber roller and brush, and return them to the proper compartment (in that order),and close the flap. Then, replace the side-sweeper and secure it with a single screw. Finally, reinsert the collection tray."

,
Replace the brush roll.,

Replace or clean any filters on the vacuum cleaner.,

Check the hoses for clogs and obstructions.",How to Maintain a Vacuum Cleaner," A vacuum cleaner that turns on unexpectedly while you are working on it can injure you.Check to make sure your vacuum has a ground prong. If this is missing, DO NOT USE the vacuum. Contact your lead custodian for repair.
, A vacuum cleaner bag that is only 1/3 full may be too full to clean efficiently. Remember that the air must pass through all the collected dust and debris, so a full vacuum cleaner bag means that the machine must work harder, or that it will not clean as well, or both. Look for a line on the bag and feel with your hand to determine about how full it is.

If a working vacuum cleaner misses debris on the carpet or leaves behind fuzz where there was none, that's also a cue to check the bag.

, Read the directions on the vacuum cleaner, the bag, or in the manual. Regardless of the procedure, make sure that the bag is on all the way and secure, and that any clips or holders are in place.







Use the correct bag size and type for your machine.

, Most designs make it very easy to pop the bin out., Also called a beater bar, this is the spinning brush underneath that brushes dirt out of the carpets.







Look under the machine and locate the brush roll. Generally, it will be across the front of the bottom. If it is full of hair, thread, or other debris, it is time to clean it.











Remove the bottom plate. This cover may have clips or latches, or it may have a couple of screws holding it in place. Don't lose the screws.
Notice the direction that the brush roll goes in. Usually, there will be a belt on one side and a corresponding track or space on the brush roll for the belt. This will help you to identify the direction.











Remove the brush roll. Generally, it will pull out of a slot on either end, then slide out from under the belt.






Use scissors or just your fingers to clean the brushes. They don't need to be spotless, but you should remove any hair or string that is wrapped around the brush. Pay special attention to the ends near the bearings and to the area around where the belt engages. A seam ripper (you can get one at a sewing goods store) works very well to cut the thinnest of hairs and strings wrapped around the brush.

,

Spin the brush roll on its axle with your fingers, to verify that it spins freely. If it doesn't, you may need to clean out the bearings more thoroughly, lubricate the bearings, replace the bearings, or replace the entire brush roll (in ascending order of expense).













Remove any debris around and in the bearings. Before you take the bearings out, notice which way they went so you can put them back in correctly.
Remove the cap on the other end. Both caps are usually on one long axle, so you may need to hold the end of the axle still to remove the second cap. Clean and lubricate the bearing on the other end.
Replace both bearings in the direction that they were before and replace both end caps.

,

Remove any cover plates on the bottom, as you would to clean the brush roll.






Pull on the belt with your fingers. It should be very taut.
Compare the belt to an unused belt. If it is stretched out or narrower than the new belt, replace it.
Check that the belt is in the right place. If it has slid off the drive shaft on its own or shifted out of position, it is probably because it is worn and loose.






Look for cracks, unevenness, or melted or worn spots.
Replace the belt every 6 months to 1 year, depending on how much use your vacuum cleaner sees.
Remove the brush roll as above.
Slide the belt off of the pulley or drive shaft.
Slide the new belt on over the pulley or drive shaft.

,,







Put the brush roll back through the belt. It may be very tight.






Replace the brush roll in its slots. Make sure that the belt is still over both the brush roll and the drive shaft.






Replace the cover plates, reversing the process you used to remove them.

, Many newer model vacuums have filters on the exhaust air to catch particles that remain in it. Read your manual to find out if yours has these, and clean or replace them periodically if it does.







If the filter is made out of foam or plastic, you may be able to rinse it clean. Make sure it is thoroughly dry before replacing it in the vacuum cleaner.






If the filter is made out of paper or fabric, you may be able to shake or pound out the debris between replacements.

, It doesn't happen very often, but if you have lost suction, try pushing a broomstick gently through the hoses to dislodge any larger clumps of debris that are stuck. A hook made from bent coat hanger wire can also be used to pull out or loosen clogs.

Be careful not to pack clogs in even more tightly.
Handle a coat hanger wire carefully, or it could puncture the hose.

1-Choose your molds.,
-The smaller mold should nestle inside the larger with a gap of about 2 inches or 5 cm.,
- You can create your own mold by cutting two cardboard boxes, the inner and outer mold of your planter, to the size you want.

,
- Glass, plastic, cardboard and stainless steel are all common choices.,
- Spray the inside of your molds with mineral oil or spray lubricant.,
-Mix concrete in a tub or wheelbarrow.,
- Protect your hands with kitchen gloves while handling concrete.

,
-Feel free to add decorative glass, pebbles, shells, beads or other materials as you see fit, so long as you do not drastically alter the concrete mixes consistency.

,
- Pour concrete mix evenly into the bottom of the outer form mold, creating a base.

,
-If you want to add drainage you can embed drainage pebbles in the base now, or drill holes later (at least two days after the concrete has dried).

,
- Even and smooth out the concrete mix with a trowel.

,
- Press the inner form mold down onto the concrete mix until the base is at your desired thickness.,
- Pour concrete mix into the space between your molds.,
-When you reach the top of your planter, even off and smooth with your trowel.

,
- Lightly bounce your planter now, to help the concrete consistency (be careful not to break glass molds).

,
-Wrap the planter in plastic, and let it sit for about 36 hours.

,
- Test the strength of the concrete with a screwdriver or knife.,
- Slowly remove the inner form mold.,
- Remove the planter from the outer form mold.

,
- Smooth out the planter's surface with a rough brush or scouring pad.

,
- Allow the planter to sit for another week.

,
- Rub your planter with a wet sponge or cloth until its color darkens, once a day.

,
- After drying for at least two days, you can drill drainage holes in the base.

,Set the planter in the sun, pour your soil, and add your plants!",How to Make Concrete Planters," You will need an outer mold and an inner mold of same shape but different size.;
, The gap between molds will be the thickness of your planter's walls. If your planter will be any larger than 2 feet (0.6 m) by 2 feet (0.6 m), the walls should be 3 inches or 7.5 cm thick.

,, Styrofoam also works well.

, This will help you remove it later. If you use a glass mold, if you coat the glass in lubricant you may not have to break the glass when you remove the molds from the planter.

, Crack-resistant concrete is your best bet. Pour the desired amount of concrete into the tub or wheelbarrow, then add water and mix gradually, until you have consistency similar to cake batter. Follow the instructions on the packaging.

,,,,,, The base and the walls should be of similar thickness, though the base can be thicker than the walls (usually not the other way around).

, Tamp continually with a trowel and push the concrete mix along the edges of the mold to ensure smooth walls and avoid air bubbles.

,,,, If you can make an impression, the concrete is still too wet.

, If you used cardboard, you should be able to peel it off. If you used glass you might have to break it, though mineral coating or lubricant might allow you to salvage glass molds.

Dust the inside of the hose.,
Sanitize the hose with a vinegar solution.,
Allow the hose to dry for a day.",How to Clean a Vacuum," There is a lot of variability between vacuums. Before cleaning yours, read the instructions for directions on how to break apart and clean your vacuum., It can be hazardous to apply water to the vacuum when it is plugged in. None of these steps should be executed while the vacuum is plugged into an outlet, even if it is turned off.

, You will need to be able to reach around all the insides of the vacuum to clean it up. Remove the canister and take the filter out. Break down any moving parts that can be deconstructed., Open the canister and drop the insides into a garbage bag. Consider performing this outside or in the garage to avoid spreading dust or dirt around your house. You might need to shake the canister to help jostle some of the dirt out of it., Wet a microfiber cloth. Apply a little bit of all-purpose cleaner or vinegar mix to the cloth. Squeeze the cloth to remove all excess moisture., Use the cloth to rub down the outside and the inside of the canister. Wipe down all parts of the vacuum that are accessible, including the cord and the outside of the hose. Do not, however, apply moisture to the plug itself or any other electrified components.

, The filter is generally at the top of the canister and is one of the most important parts of the vacuum. Remove it from the canister and run cold water over it. Do not use soap. Let water run through it until no more dirt or grime is coming off., It is particularly important that you not reinsert components of the canister, like the filter, until they have dried. Putting moist objects in a confined space can encourage the growth of bacteria. Leave the vacuum out in the sun, if possible., The beater bar, the bottom part of the vacuum where dirt is sucked in, often accumulates dirt and hair. Use scissors to cut and remove any hair that is stuck in the bristles.This part in the process can be particularly unsanitary. Consider wearing disposable gloves.

, Apply rubbing alcohol to a cotton swab. Then rub the cotton swab over the beater bar to disinfect it. Rub the cotton swab over other parts of the vacuum that come into contact with the floor.


These areas are particularly susceptible to picking up dirt and disease because they are constantly coming into contact with dirtiest parts of your house.Try to avoid spreading alcohol on rubber pieces of the vacuum., For most models, you will need to use your hands to spin the beater bar around so that you can disinfect all sides of it. Some models will allow you to detach the beater ball, which will make it easier to reach all sides.Read instructions to see if your beater ball can be removed. It will make the process easier.

, Straighten out a wire hanger leaving only a slight curve at the end. Insert it into the hose and use the curved end to scoop out any clumps of dirt that are clogging up the hose. Be careful not to poke at the hose itself; you do not want to poke a hole in it., Wrap a broom or mop handle in dryer sheets. Use duct tape to firmly attach the dryer sheets to the stick. Put the stick inside the hose and maneuver it so that the dryer sheets rub gently against the hose, picking up dust.


Be gentle, so as to not break the hose., Tape paper towels to the end of a broom or mop handle. Wet the paper towels and apply a vinegar solution to them. Rub the inside of the hose with the paper towels to kill germs and reduce odor.For the vinegar solution mix one part vinegar to two parts water.

, Again, it is important that moisture does not get trapped in the canister. If you have sanitized the hose, allow it to sit in a warm spot for 24 hours to dry."

Choose small windows to make creating your art easier.,
Make your windows safe before painting.,
Beware of bugs to make sure your art is not eaten.",How to Make Garden Art with Old Windows1," You’ll probably find smaller windows easier to work with than large ones.


Junkyards and reclamation yards are a good place to start looking.
Ebay usually has some old lots of windows for sale by collection.
Or you could just start checking dumpsters in your neighborhood.;
, If you are using old windows, you need to be aware of some hazards such as splintered wood and nails sticking out.


Check your window carefully before handling it and be sure to use tough gloves.






Be very cautious handling glass, especially if any panes are broken.
Some panes may be loose.
It will be safer if you can make these secure by using a window sealant before you begin working with your window creatively.

, You need to be cautious of woodworms and termites if you are bringing second hand furniture into your home.


Look out for little holes and piles of frass (termite excrement).
Fumigation works best to get rid of them, or use a DIY chemical treatment, and seal up any holes.






If you leave the bugs in the wood, they will eat your art and possibly spread throughout your house.

Create a clear glass mosaic.,
Raise and treat your garden art to preserve it.",How to Make Garden Art with Old Windows2," Probably the simplest way to bring color into your garden is to take an old window frame and glue colored glass beads to it.


You should use glue such as E6000, which dries clear.






This can be displayed by standing it upright in a bed so that the sunlight comes through it.






Try anchoring it into the ground by attaching wooden stakes to the lower sides that can be driven at least 2 feet (0.6 m) into the ground for stability.






Silver or blue-tinted beads work well for giving the effect of bubbles.







, The joy of old window art is bringing lots of translucent color into your garden.


You can try to source an old window with colored glass in – or create your own.
Add a colorful mosaic to an old colorless glass window by gluing on a pattern of glass beads, transparent colored mosaic tiles or even sea glass gathered from the beach.






You can source colored glass receptacles, such as kitchenware, from thrift stores and smash these up to make glass shards.
You’ll need to get some glass glue and a grout – try following an online glass mosaic tutorial.
Home Depot can source a grout that works well – ask for 100% solids epoxy grout when ordering ahead.

, It can be fun to paint your own works of art onto blank windows.

Not all glass paint will survive out of doors and some will peel, so choose your paint carefully.






You may find it helps to wipe down the glass surface using alcohol before you paint.






Paints such as the Martha Stewart Glass range are said to be outdoor resistant.






Also try sealing using Polycrylic for added protection.






As some paints need to be baked in the oven to seal the paints, you can either try removing the glass pane from the window to do so, or alternately paint a separate bit of glass and simply glue this onto your old window pane.

, Creating a mini greenhouse can be a great place to store plants in a colorful way.


You’ll need 6 small window frames of the same size and shape for this.






Make them safe by removing protruding nails and resealing the windows where needed.






Using hinges or small wooden blocks, attach 4 of the smaller windows to each other at right angles. This forms the 4 sides of your mini greenhouse.






Then use hinges to add a peaked roof using the last 2 windows.






Put some plants inside to finish it off. Remember, it will get pretty hot inside so choose plants that like heat and keep them well watered.







, Remember, you don’t need to have glass in the frames of your old windows to use them in the garden.


In fact, empty panes will make a great place for birds to perch.






Try painting old window frames using distressed paint techniques.






Outdoor chalk paint also works well.






Hang these on chains on the edge of your porch, from a tree branch, or on a barn door.






A collection of frames painted different colors works well.







, An old window can be hung on a fence to create the illusion of a real window.


This works especially well if you replace the glass panes with mirror panels.






It also helps create a sense of space in a small garden.






You can make a nice effect if you use a window with shutters.






Try painting these in a color that complements your fence.






Try some paint distressing techniques to create an aged effect.







, You can use an old window as a planting display by adding a window box or ledge to your window and putting a planter in it or several plant pots on it.


Another nice effect can be achieved by taking some old metal food cans, making some drainage holes at the bottom using a screwdriver, painting them in bright colors and patterns, and nailing them to the window frame before planting in them.
This is a nice way to display plants against a colorful window frame.

, Take an old window (or picture) frame that is empty of glass to create a plant frame.


Attach a small hook to the center of the inner frame at the upper side.
Attach a chain to this and hang a planter from it – a small bucket or basket planter works well for this.
This is a neat way to display a trailing plant.
It works nicely if you paint the frame in a color that complements your planter, and its flowers and foliage.

, Gather a good collection of colorless cut glass plates and pot lids, decanter tops, and other clear glass items to create a glass mosaic.


Glue these to your clear glass window and fill in the spaces between them with clear glass beads or marbles.
The idea for this display is to make it colorless but emphasize the textures provided by the cut glass items you use.

, Since garden art lives outdoors, it’s best to protect it before leaving it out for extended periods of time.

Remember that any wood in contact with soil will get wet and may start to rot.






To preserve the life of your garden art, treat it with a wood preservative if it is in contact with the ground, or raise it on a pressure-treated wood block.

Buy a roll of concrete reinforcing wire.,
Cut a length a section large enough to form the body of the cage.,
Curve the wire into a cylinder and connect the ends.,
Cut the lower ring from the cage and insert it into the ground.",How to Make a Tomato Cage1," Pick up a roll of standard concrete reinforcing wire. This is type of wire mesh typically used for construction projects, though it also works marvelously for heavy-duty gardening projects. Concrete wire handles similarly to chicken wire, but is much sturdier and longer lasting. You can find concrete reinforcing wire at most home improvement stores and garden centers.The price of concrete wire will vary, but you might be better off shelling out a little more for more durable wire. You will make up the cost by not having to replace the cages as often.;
, Use a pair of wire cutters to cut roughly 5’ of wire from the role (about 12 squares in length). Make sure you wear gloves, eye protection and clothing with sleeves while cutting the metal wire. The edges of the wire spokes will be very sharp after you cut them, and it can be easy to slice yourself while molding the body of the cage if you’re not careful.Take proper safety precautions when working around sharp metal edges. Place the wire roll on the ground and hold it far away from your face while cutting.Store extra concrete wire for patch-ups or other future projects.

, Using your hands, simply curve the length of wire until both ends come together. This should be easy to do, as the wire comes in a roll and will want to curve in on itself naturally. Bend the spokes at the cut ends and hook them together to connect them. Your tomato cage will be approximately 2 feet in diameter, making it spacious enough to accommodate most larger tomato plants.Give the hooked ends an extra twist to make sure they stay secured.Make sure any exposed cut spokes are snipped away or covered.

, Now that the body of the cage has been assembled, stand it upright and cut away the horizontal ring on the lower edge of the cage. This will leave you with an unobstructed section of vertical spikes at the bottom of the cage that you’ll force into the ground to stabilize it. Insert the spikes into the soil around the tomato plant about 5” deep. You’re done!The open squares in the concrete wire will be small enough to contain overgrown foliage, but large enough to allow you to water and pick ripe tomatoes.
These cages are tough, lightweight and easy to remove and store.

"
"
Buy a metal livestock panel.,
Cut the panel to the right specifications.,
Use a wooden plank to help bend the cage.,
Plant the cage in the ground.",How to Make a Tomato Cage2," Find a store that sells farm and garden supplies and ask an associate about buying metal livestock paneling. Livestock paneling is a kind of thick, heavy metal grating designed to be rugged enough to keep smaller animals from getting into or escaping confined areas. It usually comes in sections that are about 16’ long and 4’ wide.Livestock paneling will be slightly more expensive than concrete wire or wood for making tomato cages. However, they will last considerably longer and will be in no danger of being uprooted or damaged by animals or the elements due to the paneling’s tough construction., Use a sturdy pair of bolt cutters to snip the paneling to the right dimensions to serve as the tomato cage. Measure a section to 6 grating squares widthwise and cut away the rest. Do the same for the length of the panel, counting about 9 squares down from the end and cutting all the way across. You should be left with a rectangular section of paneling 6 squares wide and 9 squares high.Use gloves and eye protection when handling the bolt cutters. The severed edges of the metal will be sharp.
Work in a flat, open space outside somewhere where the metal trimmings won’t get lost underfoot. Safely dispose of the unused trimmings when you’re finished.

, Take a spare wooden plank at least the length of the panel you cut. You will be using this to help you shape the cage. Place the plank across the length of the panel at the midway point, three squares down from the top. Stand on the plank with all of your weight to hold down the panel as you pull one edge up toward you. Bend the panel to a 90 degree angle to create an open cage that will contain the growth of your tomato plants.The thick metal bars of livestock paneling might be difficult to bend on your own. If possible, recruit an extra set of hands to help you provide leverage in shaping the cage.
These dimensions create a fairly large open-style corner cage. For a cage enclosed on three sides, measure the panel 9 squares wide and make an additional bend so that each of the sides is 3 squares wide., Cut away the horizontal bars at the bottom of the panel to create spikes that you can stick in the ground. Take a moment to make sure that each spike is straight. Stand the cage up lengthwise, spike-side down, and push it down forcefully into the soil around your tomato plants. The cage will protect and contain the growth of the plants on two sides, allowing the other sides to remain open for easy watering, mulching and picking.The cages will be slightly heavy, so the spikes should be insert 5-6” into the ground to help it hold steady.
If you’re using cages to support multiple tomato plants, position them so that the cage corners are facing each other. This will keep the tomato plants from growing unchecked into one another.

"
Buy the lumber for the cage.,
Cut the supports and rungs for the cage.,
Screw the assembly together.,
Place the cage over your tomato plants.",How to Make a Tomato Cage3," Visit a hardware or home and garden store to find the raw lumber required to fashion the wooden cages. For this project, you will need two 2x2x8’ boards, along with three 1x2x8’ pieces. The wood will require a few simple cuts to form the different parts of the tomato cage.Wood is generally cheaper and easier to find than other materials like concrete wire and livestock paneling.
Because it is an organic material, wood is less durable than metal. You should get plenty of use out of wooden tomato cages, but don’t expect them to last as long as cages constructed from metal wire or paneling.

, Cut each of the 2x2x8’ boards perfectly in half. You should now have four 2x2x4’ pieces. These will serve as the upright supports for the cage. Cut the 1x2x8’ boards into sections that are 18” and 19.5” long. You should have six of each of these pieces total. They will act as the rungs for the upright supports.Make all the necessary cuts first. Then, all that’s left to do is nail or screw the pieces together.
You will have some wood left over after cutting the 1x2x8’ boards. The leftover wood can be saved for future projects or used elsewhere in your garden.

, Using a nail gun or wood screws, attach three of the 1x2 rungs to two of the 2x2 legs to make a basic ladder construction. The rungs should be placed roughly 15” apart, starting at the top of the ladder and leaving space at the bottom for the supports to be driven into the ground. Repeat this process to craft the other side of the cage. Then, attach both ladders by securing three 19.5” sections of 1x2 lumber perpendicularly to the sides.The 19.5” sections will overlap the ends of the ladder construction, including the 18” rungs you attached previously.

, Position the wooden cage over a tomato plant. Press down firmly to mark where the legs are to go in the soil. Dig a small hole for each leg, about 4” deep. Set the legs of the cage down into the holes and fill in the space around them with loose soil. This process will result in a single tomato cage.If you’re planning on making multiple cages, take an assembly-line approach. Do all of your measuring and marking at once, followed by all your cutting, then screwing or nailing.
You can also drive the cage into the ground using a hammer or mallet, being careful not to damage the structure. It may help to sharpen the legs or cut them into points first.

Create a mold for your concrete flower pot.,
Coat the inside of the outer container and the outside of the inner container with cooking oil or non-stick cooking spray.,
Cut at least two or three pieces of 1-inch PVC pipe.,
Put on a pair of gloves to protect your hands from the concrete mixture.,
Pour 2 inches (5.1 cm) of the concrete mixture into the larger container.,
Place the smaller container carefully on top of the concrete in the center of the larger container.,
Finish adding concrete mixture to the space between the larger and smaller container.,
Allow the concrete to set for at least 24 hours, then remove the smaller container to reveal your concrete pot.,
Cover the concrete pot with a large piece of plastic and allow the concrete to set up for one week.,
Thump the bottom of your concrete pot lightly but firmly with the heel of your hand to dislodge the pot from the container, then slide the container from your concrete pot.

,
Clean the concrete mixture from the small and large container.,
Finished.

",How to Make Concrete Flower Pots," Use two identical containers, with one container slightly larger than the other. For example, use two bowls or two buckets, as long as the smaller container is at least an inch smaller than the larger container. You can also build square or rectangular containers from plywood.;
, For wooden containers, use a paste wax.

, The pieces of pipe, which will be used to create drainage holes in the concrete pots, should be 2 inches (5.1 cm) long.

, Mix a batch of quick-setting concrete, according to the directions on the package. Add concrete color at this point, if desired.

, Poke the pieces of pipe into the concrete, with 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) between each pipe. Smooth the concrete around the pieces of pipe, but be sure not to cover the pipe, as the pipes must be left open to create the drainage holes.

, Press the smaller container into the concrete until the bottom of the smaller container rests on top of the pipes.

, Bounce the container lightly on a hard surface to settle the concrete, then add more to bring the concrete to the top of the container. Smooth the concrete with a putty knife.

, Mist the concrete pot lightly with a spray bottle filled with cool water. Don't remove the larger container.

, Mist the concrete pot as often as needed to keep the concrete damp.

,, The containers can be used to make more concrete pots.

Know your budget.,
Do some research.,
Decide where you'll use the vacuum.,

Figure out the type of dirt that you'll clean.,
Go to your local dealer to test out the actual product before buying.,
Put it through its paces to see if there are any potential problems or manufacturing defects.",How to Choose a Cordless Vacuum," This step quickly narrows down your potential targets to models within your price range. More expensive vacuums have more features and feature newer batteries but there are lesser known brands that are cheaper and will work as well but they'll lack certain features so for the sake of meeting the budget you'll need to find a middle ground as you narrow down the list.;
, Find out the important features of each model you're looking at. Consider the weight, charging time, run time, type of filter, warranty, type of battery and whether it can be removed or not (this affects the long-term viability of the product - vacuums with integrated batteries have less service life than those with removable batteries) and unique features that it may have.

, Different models include stick versions or handheld. You have know exactly which part of the house your using this for - are you using it on your stairs, upholstery, chairs, ceiling? If you're gonna use it primarily on floors - get a stick vac so you don't stain your back bending over. If you're using it on other areas like your chairs, sofas or other though to reach spots - consider a handheld vacuum. There are hybrids available right now in the market like the Dyson DC44 or the Electrolux Ergorapido that convert from a stick to a handheld.

, The type of floor whether it is carpet, hardwood, tiled, linoleum, etc. If you have thick carpet, you'll probably need an upright because cordless vacs don't have enough pulling power to pick up dirt trapped underneath it.

, This plays a major part in selecting the type of vacuum attachment that comes along with a vacuum. If you're using it primarily to clean pet hair then you need something with a beater bar or brush roll, whatever you call it to pick up pet hair shed by your pets on upholstery and carpet. Supposed want something more robust that you can use as a shop vacuum - get something with an attachment that has large nozzle so you can pick up larger debris. If you're cleaning mostly dust, then get something that has brushes on its attachments to be able to better clean up statically charged dust that tends to stick on surfaces.

, You can test it in there and buy it online where it usually is cheaper.

, You may get a replacement if something is wrong. Take note that all appliances will have a percentage of their products that have some sort of defect - so its better to find it earlier than late.

Get a terracotta, clay, or plastic planting pot.,
Rinse your shells under cold water.,
Lay out your shells on the ground.,
Glue your seashells to the side of the pot.,
Apply sanded grout to hold your shells in place.,
Allow your seashell planter to dry overnight before using it.",How to Make a Seashell Planter1," Planting pots can be found at most major department stores or home and gardening stores. Plastic planting pots are the easiest to use for this project because the shells will adhere easier to the plastic than clay or terracotta, which require a hot glue gun to hold the shells in place.Spraying a spray cement sealer may also help your shells stick to your pot when using ceramic, clay, or terracotta pots.
Painting your pot allows you to create a different look for the spaces in between the shells, where the pot's color can be seen.;
, Rinse and clean your shells so that there isn’t any leftover sand or dirt in them. Once the shells are clean, leave them out in the sun to dry or wipe them down with a dry rag., Lay out your shells so you can get a visual for what they might look like on your pot. You can use any kind of shells and ones that differ in size and shape. Using different sorts of shells will make your planter more unique and eye catching.Try to think of different designs that you can create using different types and sizes of shells.

For instance, if you have long, thinner shells, you can arrange them in a star position.
A common seashell planter idea is to get shells of about the same size and cover the entirety of the pot.

, Starting from the bottom, begin to apply your seashells to the pot using a hot glue gun to hold them in place. Use your hot glue gun to put a dab of glue on the bottom of the shell then apply it to the pot. Once they are held in place, you’ll want to reinforce the shells by using a stronger glue, like Gorilla or super glue, to hold the shells in place for the long run. Drip the glue on the sides of the shell so that it adheres to the pot.

If you only use hot glue, then your shells will slide off when it gets hot outside.
Hanging your seashells upside down will prevent them from gathering water inside and attracting bugs., This is an optional step if you want to increase the longevity of your seashell planter and ensure that none of the shells fall off. Apply sanded grout that you’ve purchased from an arts and crafts store over the surface and in between the cracks of the shells on your planter. Allow the grout to set for 20 minutes, then use a warm rag to wipe down any excess grout on top of the shells or in between the cracks., If you don’t allow your glue to dry, the shells may come off your seashell planter. Once the glue on your planter is completely dry, you can place it outside in your garden, or inside depending on what kind of plant it is."

Find a suitable seashell.,
Fill your shell ¾ of the way with soil.,
Plant your succulent into the soil.,
Decorate your seashell planter.,
Place your miniature seashell planters on a shelf or windowsill.,
Hang your seashell planters with fishing line.",How to Make a Seashell Planter2," Look for a hollowed shell that is big enough to house a succulent plant and some dirt. Succulent plants don’t require as much water as other indoor houseplants and can thrive in a smaller habitat like the inside of a seashell.Look for larger clamshells or other seashells that are of a suitable size. Scour beaches and try to find a hallowed shell.

There are also online stores that sell hallowed seashells.You can also find man-made synthetic seashells online.

, You can use soil that you’ve found in the yard or fertilizer. Succulents thrive in loose soil that has good drainage. When choosing a soil choose things like coarse sand or perlite with potting soil to create good drainage.Make sure to fill your shell outside or over a sink so that you don’t make a mess.

You can also purchase succulent specific soils at most home and gardening stores.

, Use your finger, or a chopstick to create a hole in the soil. Place your succulent into the holes that you make. Place more holes for more succulents until you have a full arrangement within your planter. Once your plants are in the holes, you can put more soil to fill the remainder of the holes and hold your plants in place.When placing your holes, make sure to do so strategically so that your arrangement is aesthetically pleasing to you.

, While this step is optional, decorating your planter with paint or small gems is a good way to enhance its look and make it more unique. One method of painting your shell is to use watercolor paint. Mix colors together to create a tie dye seashell planter.Another method of painting is to use a metallic spray paint and spray the shells to give them a shiny, metallic look.Lastly, you can hot glue small gems or stones onto the surface of the shell to give it a more glamorous feeling., Because these planters are more delicate and are likely to get destroyed if placed outside, it’s probably a good idea to keep them inside your house. Find a place, like a window that leads to outside, where the succulents can get enough sunlight.

Allow the soil to dry out before watering your seashell planters., Find the small holes that are usually found in many shells and thread a fishing line through them in order to hang them. If there are no holes in your shells, you can drill small pilot holes using an electric drill.Hang the planters in areas that won’t obstruct people’s walking paths.

Good locations to hang your miniature planters include the porch or a shed.

Pick out the material you would like your trough to be.,
Consider making your own trough.,
Move your trough to its location.,
Make sure your trough drains well.,
Add a drainage layer to your trough.",How to Make a Rock Garden in a Trough1," You can buy a stone, metal or wood trough from the garden store; these tend to be fairly expensive. You can also use an old butler’s sink or metal tub from the reclamation yard. Remember that solid stone troughs will be very heavy, especially once full of soil and rocks.


Try to get a trough planter with drainage holes, or, if possible, drill drainage holes in whatever planter you are using.;
, You can make your own trough using hypertufa and a plastic storage tub or wooden crate as a mould. Hypertufa is a mix of cement (eg Portland cement) with peat and perlite; these materials lighten the mix and add texture. Usual proportions are 1:1:1. This material usually needs a little time to cure before it can be planted.


Hypertufa provides an aged stone effect but is usually a little lighter to move than a solid stone or concrete trough of the same size. Because of its texture, the hypertufa planter will acquire mosses and lichens on its surface over time. You can poke drainage holes in the trough base before it is dry.You can also use polystyrene fish boxes that are painted grey or covered with grout. This trough will be considerably more fragile than hypertufa.

, Try to move your empty trough to its final location ahead of planting as it will be very heavy once filled. It’s also a good idea to raise it slightly off of the ground as this improves drainage.


If you don’t have drainage holes this is less important. Remember the trough is really heavy so make sure it is very stable however you place it.

, Drainage is really important in a trough planter. Try to use a trough that has drainage holes. If you are using an old sink, the plug hole will provide drainage.


If you plan to build your own hypertufa one, poke some holes in the bottom while the mix is still damp.If you aren’t able to get a trough with drainage holes then try to improve drainage as best you can when filling it.

, Regardless of whether the trough has draining holes or not, you should try to put a drainage layer at the bottom of the trough before the soil goes in. Use several inches of broken pottery shards or gravel to make this layer.


Top this bottom layer off with another two inches of soil mixed with gravel.
Add free-draining compost; a good one to choose is compost mixed with horticultural grit.

"
"
Select your rocks to create the trough garden.,
Think about textures and the colors of your rock as you work.,
Pick out plants that will do well in the location that you have chosen to put your trough.,
Consider the “thriller, filler, and spiller” philosophy.,
Think about picking out plants that can survive the winter.,
Give your plants some space.,
Add a decorative mulch (optional).,
Maintain your rock garden.",How to Make a Rock Garden in a Trough2," The rocks you choose should be based on your personal preferences. The combination of one larger and one smaller rock works well, or consider using long, thin rocks placed in rows for another nice effect.


Consider using rocks of the same color and variety rather than a mixture; this can look more natural and harmonious. All the rocks should be buried so that half of the rock is covered with soil. Doing this will keep the rocks in place.

, You may wish to plant towards a single raised point, such as a tall rock or piece of driftwood arranged semi-vertically.


A slightly triangular effect also works well.

, Most rock garden plants (such as Alpines) favor sun. If you plan to place your trough in a shady site then you may need to choose shade-tolerant plants.


Plants like alpines and sedums, or Aubretia, work well in sun; consider planting ferns, begonias and small hostas in shade.

, Some gardeners swear by the rule ‘a thriller, a filler and a spiller’ for container planting. One showy plant to catch the eye and thrill it, a plant to fill out space and provide an attractive backdrop, and a trailing plant to spill over the edge and create an interesting organic shape.


Remember to plant trailing plants near the edge of your trough so they cascade over the side.

, Remember that if you choose only plants that disappear over the winter, your rock garden will look very sad for several months of the year.


Consider planting some evergreens such as the sedum Stonecrop or the alpine groundcover Matted Globularia (Globularia repens).

, Rock gardens aren’t usually covered in plants that are crowded together. Leave your plants some breathing room and allow the rocks to be visible.


They will need room to expand over time, especially if they are ground cover plants or creeping varieties.

, Once you finish planting your trough, consider adding an attractive inorganic mulch using something like pea shingle or shale. This sort of mulch will hide any bare soil between the rocks and plants and it will also stop the plant foliage from coming into contact with wet earth, which can cause the leaves to rot.


Some alpines are adapted to absorb heat from the rocks they grow on. Mulch also suppresses weeds; weeds can be a problem in a rock garden because of the gaps between plants.

, Rock gardens aren’t intended to be high maintenance. You may need to attend to weeding. It’s important that your plants don’t drown in their planter. If drainage is a problem in the trough, consider sheltering it during the wetter winter months.


Consider feeding the plants in the springtime. Many of the alpines and sedums used in rock displays are very drought tolerant. However, you should consider watering during dry spells, depending on which plants you chose.
If you are planting in shade, consider protecting plants such as hostas from slug and snail attack.

Ensure that you have access to an electrical supply if using a drill, and that all safety precautions are being observed.

You'll need 3 terracotta clay pots. Pot A should be the largest, Pot B of middle size, and Pot C the smallest. Pot C should be small enough that it can sit inside of Pot A without touching the sides.
A good rule of thumb is to keep about 2 inches between the diameter of each pot. Never have your smallest pot smaller than 10 inches.
Many terracotta clay pots come pre-fabricated with a hole in the base. This is ideal and actually preferable.;

Fill the planter box with minimal amounts of compost and potting soil.,
Plant seeds and watch them grow.

",How to Make a Planter Box," If you plan to make a planter box with more complexity, you may need additional tools to cut and assemble the planter box. This is a simple design for anyone beginning to learn how to make a planter box.;
, All sides of the boards should be inspected. The most attractive side is the surface you want on to be the outer side of the planter box.

, The holes should be 3/4 inch (1.91 cm) from the edge. The middle hole is centered with the board's width.


The 2 boards are pre-drilled so that when the screws are inserted the wood does not splinter when assembling the planter box. It is unnecessary to predrill the other 2 boards.

, The boards with pre-drilled holes are positioned on the outside of the corners. The screw will go through the pre-drilled hole into the adjoining board.

,,, If the box is too out of square, the wood can split because of stress on the corners.

, The bed can be moved to another location if desired.

, This step is optional if there is a desire for the planter box to be in a fixed position.

, The newspapers prevent weeds from emerging in the garden. Dead leaves or other materials can be used in place of newspapers.

, Mix the compost and potting soil while filling the box. The box should be filled with 1 inch (2.54 cm) of space between the mix and the top of the box.

Find suitable guttering.,
Clean the guttering.,
Paint the guttering.,
Drill a series of small holes down the length of the gutter.,
Select a suitable hanging spot.,
Attach the guttering to the chosen spot.,
Add soil.,
Choose suitable plants.,
Remember to water regularly.",How to Make a Hanging Gutter Garden," Even if you're not planning on tearing down your own guttering, you might be able to find someone who is. Ask around the neighborhood, put a request on Freecycle, Craigslist, or similar, or place a notice in a local community center asking for old guttering.;
, It should be free of dirt, grime, flaking paint, etc. before starting. You'll be adding fresh soil, so you don't want to contaminate it with any old soil harboring possible bacteria. Use a hose or a water blaster for a really close clean. Then scrub any stubborn parts with soapy water and a good scrubbing brush.


If you're concerned that the paint on the guttering might be lead based, it is best to not use it.

, This step is optional but ideally, you should do something to protect the guttering, especially if it is made of metal rather than plastic. Choose a color that matches the fence or wall and paint the outside of the guttering (not the inside where the soil will go).

, This will provide drainage of water from the soil after watering and rain.

, If you want to hang the guttering off the fence or garden wall, select a part of the garden that gets adequate sun and is nicely sheltered from wind. You might also select a house wall but only if this doesn't detract from the appearance of your home. (Also be aware that attaching items to your wall might cause leakage problems if not done carefully.) Measure up the space and cut the guttering to the right length before attaching.

, Screw the guttering lengths to the fence or wall. Drill holes through the guttering and align these with the fence or wall, and drill holes in the exact same positions. Then add the screws to keep the guttering firmly in place.


The exact type and method of attachment will depend on the material you're attaching to, as if varies between wood, brick, veneer and other surfaces. If you're not sure, simply ask at the hardware store for precise advice.
Try this alternative: Use the frame of a pallet and attach the gutter lengths to the frame, on the inside. This nifty invention can be propped up anywhere in your garden! See the image for general guidance.

, Use a suitable, good quality growing soil along the length of the guttering. Only fill about three quarters of the way, as the plants will need to last part for growing within the sheltered protection of the guttering. Add fertilizer if required.

, Obviously, guttering is shallow. Hence, you'll only be able to grow plants with shallow roots, like lettuce, radishes, strawberries, cacti and herbs. Many small annuals could be grown in this guttering style, and will brighten up the fence or wall.

, The shallow nature of these planters means that they tend to dry out a lot faster. You might want to consider adding a drip watering system if the watering effort becomes tiresome.

Take an old tire that is still mounted to the rim.,
Make zig-zag or scalloped cuts approximately eight to twelve inches from the rim on one side of the tire, depending on the size of the tire.,
Turn the tire inside-out.,
Once you've turned it inside-out, you should wind up with one very large section (which becomes the plant holder part of the planter) and one very small tire section (which becomes the base of the planter).,
At this point, if desired, designs can be painted on the outside of the large part of the planter.,
Put some dirt or fertilizer inside the large section of the tire.

,
Plant your little plants or flower plants in it.,Enjoy

",How to Make a Tire Plant Pot," This method will not work if the tire doesn't have a rim on it, as the rim is what holds it together.;
, (Note that these cuts are only on the flat part of the tire near the rim, not onto the area where the treads are.) Make the cuts all the way around the tire so that the tire is separated into two pieces, held together by the rim. Remember, do *not* take the tire off the rim.

, The easiest way to do this is to put the tire on a stump (or stool or something like it), with the cuts facing up. Take the outer part of the cut tire, and pull it out and downward to turn it inside out. It's hard at first, but once you get it going, goes fairly smoothly.

, The holes in the rim become the drainage holes for the plant.

, Tole designs work nicely on this.

Toss a set of vintage sheets over your couch to blend some vintage style in your otherwise modern home.Keep in mind vintage sheets may be expensive. You may not want to potentially damage them by using them as a cover. If you'd rather not damage vintage sheets, go for modern sheets with a vintage pattern.;
, Look for furniture that merges elements of both modern and vintage styles. This can be a mixing of colors, cuts, or materials to produce a piece that is both vintage and modern.For example, retro furniture was often curved while modern styles make use of materials such as leather and wood. Look for curvy chairs with wooden legs or leather seats.
If it's within your budget, you can have furniture remodeled to give it a vintage touch. You can, for example, add vintage upholstery to a modern couch.

, Many people love vintage tables in their homes. You may have inherited a vintage table from a relative or picked one up at a secondhand store. If you want to use it in your home, try pairing it with modern chairs. This will give your home a look that mixes the old and the new., Vintage desks are also a popular item for homes.

Select a support pole.,
Obtain some natural burlap.,
Cut your burlap into a long strip about 8-12"" wide.,
Plug in your hot glue gun and let it warm up.,
Take the second piece of burlap, if necessary to cover a long pole, and lay your glued pole on top of the burlap.,
Wrap and fold the burlap around the pole.,
Roll your pole up in the burlap, fairly tightly, and roll until it's completely rolled up.,
Take your selected twine, line, or wire and tie it about 1 or 1.5 inches from the top end of the pole.,
Take your desired plant and pot it into a larger pot if needed.",How to Make a Philodendron Pole," Go to a local nursery or lumber company and purchase a bamboo pole that's at least 3/4 inch in diameter. If you can't find bamboo, a treated 1 X 1"" piece of wood, or if you don't like treated lumber, a 1 x 1 of rot resistant cedar could also be used. If you grow your own bamboo, it doesn't have to be perfectly straight to work well, but do select a piece you've previously cut and dried.


Cut your pole to the desired length, about 4.5 feet long. Make a pencil or marker line about 8 inches from the bottom of your pole after cutting. That is to allow some room to press the finished product into the potted plant.;
, Go to a fabric store or crafting store and have them cut a piece of burlap for your project. For a 4.5 feet tall pole, you'll need about 1/2 yard. The burlap will work well for the project because the roots of the philodendron or pothos will grow into and be able to hold on to the loosely woven fabric, and it will look natural too.

, It's fine if its a little crooked on this step, as long as you cut fairly straight. Lay your pole on the straightest edge of the burlap, and place the pole on the burlap so that the burlap fabric extends 2-3 inches past the top of the pole. If your burlap is not long enough to extend all the marked length of the pole, then cut another piece that's also 8-12 inches wide and long enough to extend down to your 8"" mark with a couple inches of overlap towards the center.

, Place the shortest piece of burlap about 8"" from the bottom of the pole at your mark, and place your pole on the edge of the burlap. You will need to glue the edge of the burlap to the pole in several places about 6"" apart.


Be careful when gluing the pole to the burlap because the hot glue is HOT! You will need to use a pencil, skewer, or stick to press the burlap into the hot glue as shown, so that you don't burn your hands. Let cool a few minutes.

, Arrange this piece of burlap so that it's extending about 2-3 inches past the top of the pole. It also must overlap the first piece you put on for good coverage towards the bottom. Then place your pole so that it's at the edge and glue it into place as you did with the first piece. At the top, just fold the burlap so that the pole is inside the fabric, and glue it down so that it's folded over extending past the end of the pole. Let this cool a few minutes to set up the glue.

, At the top end of your pole, you will have a flap of burlap that you previously folded onto itself and glued. Take that piece and fold it down towards the bottom of the pole, encasing the end of the pole. Tack that folded edge down to the pole with glue, pressing it down securely with a pencil or skewer so you don't burn yourself, and let it set up a few minutes.

, You want it to be rolled up like toilet paper around a roll. It's desirable to have several laps of burlap rolled around your pole, not just one layer. When it's completely rolled up, secure the edge about every 6 inches with hot glue, again pressing down with a pencil or other instrument so that you don't burn yourself. Let this cool down for the glue to set up. Unplug your glue gun, you're finished with it now.

, Tie it into a secure knot. Then start wrapping the wire, twine, or fishing line around the pole in a spiraling downward direction. Spiral the tie material in the same direction the burlap is wrapped, and try to have your spirals about  1 to 1.5 inches apart, and spaced evenly down the length of the pole. Continue wrapping until you reach about an inch below the wrapped burlap and then securely tie it off using a knot. Cut your line or twine. You have completed your philodendron totem pole.

, Water to settle the plant into the soil. Take your completed totem pole and press it gently into the center of the pot, trying to avoid stems and roots. Secure your plant, one vine at a time, to the pole, winding the plant gently around the pole. Cut a piece of jute twine about 6 inches long, and tie the vine to the pole loosely, about 2 or 3 inches from the end of the vine. Continue until your plant is wound around the pole as desired.

However, middle tiers may have less space and require especially small pots.Plain terra cotta pots might look out of place in your shower caddy garden. With a little bit of primer, paint, and a paintbrush, you can add neat designs.
You may want to verify that your pots fit in your caddy by arranging them in it while they're still empty.;
, Remove your plant from its original container. Loosen the root ball gently with your fingers to stimulate the roots so the plant is ready for its new pot. Fill the pot ¼ of the way with soil, add the plant, then fill the rest of the pot with soil.


The plants you have chosen for your shower caddy garden may have specific soil requirements. However, generally, regular potting soil should be sufficient.
Use your fingers to press down on the soil to ensure there are no air pockets. These can be harmful to the health of the plant.Some popular ideas for plants to use in your shower caddy garden include aloe vera, bamboo, begonias, ferns, cast iron plants, dracaena, ivies, philodendron, and more., Your plants likely came with a tag that has care instructions on it. On these instructions, you should find a description of the kind of light your plants need. Place the caddy garden where it receives enough light.If your plants didn't come with care information, look this up online with a keyword search for the plant name.
If you don't know the name of the plant(s) you've used, snap a picture with your cell phone and ask a master gardener or knowledgeable employee for help identifying it at your local nursery, florist, or home and garden center.

, Once your caddy is securely hung, arrange your potted plants in it. Taller plants should go on the highest shelf, which generally has the most space for vertical growth.For the most visually pleasing shower caddy garden, you may want to hide or disguise your pots with sphagnum moss or paper mulch. Line the sides of your caddy so the pots are hidden behind it.
You may want to use a heavy duty wall hanger or a specially designed, heavy weight suction cup to hang your caddy. Your potted plants may be too heavy for the fastener the caddy came with.

Paintings, pictures, photos and sculptures can all enhance the home environment. Fill up a bland wall, cover a boring mantelpiece and strategically place an three-dimensional item on the coffee table. These will create warmth, add color and serve as excellent conversation starters.;
, Encourage people to want to come in and sit down by using comfortable seat cushions, large pillows and cozy throws. Dress up a cool sofa with a warm blanket in the wintertime and remove it in the summer. Always think of comfort as the top priority.


A few large floor cushions and beanbags will always be welcomed by those who like lying on the floor––kids, pets, flexible adults and dreamers will all take the opportunity to use these pieces!

, There are many ways to create a deliciously scented home, depending on your preferences. Here are just a few:


Use scented candles. Candles provide a sense of warmth and comfort. They add a deep glow to the area they're in, helping to add ambiance. Choose candle colors to match the room and scents that you love the most. Candles can be placed on a shelf or mantelpiece.
Place potpourri in your room. Make your own or purchase some, in scents that you like. This can be placed in any room, but try to match the season, such as spicy scents for autumn and winter, floral scents for spring and woodsy or citrus smells for summer.
Use room sprays. Make your own or purchase them, and use whenever you feel the room needs a scent lift. Try to find the ones made from basic natural ingredients if purchasing them; chemically produced scents don't have the same pleasant smell to the nose.

Use the stove to send forth delicious scents. Bake a cake or bread, heat up coffee, cook spices in a saucepan. All of these will send forth a heavenly scent into your home.

, Enliven your home with the beauty and freshness of plants growing in containers. Choose plants that thrive indoors; even better, look for plants that also benefit you, such as cleansing the air or eating the indoor insects.


If you'd like your plants to be fixing your indoor air, check out How to use indoor plants to remove harmful chemicals.

, For every seasonal event you enjoy and participate in, get right into the spirit and decorate your home with the relevant decorations. Whether you celebrate Christmas, Hanukkah, Eid-Al Fitr, Halloween, Easter, Diwali, July 4th, national days, the Chinese New Year and so on, there are decorations for every event. You can also celebrate other things you care about, such as family togetherness, your love for animals, a sports event or personal celebrations such as birthdays, graduations and achievements.

Displays of collectibles. Always an interesting curiosity to encourage conversation, exclamation and interest.
Jars of 'things.' Jars of things (candy, beads, letters, etc.) make your home feel interesting.
Paper scraps. Have a pin board of all the lovely bits and pieces of paper paraphernalia that have piqued your interest.
Keep some favorite old toys on a shelf or in a glass-fronted cabinet. These can represent the children (and adults) at different stages of their life, and make for wonderful conversation starters as well as being nostalgic reminders.

, Bookcases with lots of interesting books are a feast for the mind. Guests will be intrigued and keen to pick them up and read the prefaces. Book collections can tell a lot about the inhabitants of the home and are definitely a great source of conversation.

, Although the teapot might seem like an unusual suggestion, they make your house... cuter! They also have a functional purpose in suggesting that it's time to sit down and share a cup of tea, a conversation and some fine time together. Of course, you can include some coffee pots too, if you like.

Layer a tier of your caddy with loofah mesh.,
Cover the roots of your orchid in the loofah netting.,
Insert the orchid in the shower caddy.,
Add more plants to your shower caddy, if desired.,
Fill your shower caddy with orchid bark.,
Hang your caddy and enjoy your air plant garden.",How to Make a Shower Caddy Garden2," Use a pair of scissors to cut the loofah so that it can be opened up to line the inside of a caddy tier. If you plan on using multiple tiers, you may need more than one loofah.


The lining of loofah mesh will hold the orchid bark inside the caddy. This will prevent it from falling out of the caddy and spreading around your home.
You can use other materials in place of a loofah to line your caddy tiers. However, plants that receive most of their nutrients from the air, like orchids, need to be able to breathe. A mesh material is preferred., Cut another segment of mesh from your loofah. Take the orchid from its pot carefully and wrap it in the mesh. Wrap it gently but firmly. A firm wrapping will help the orchid stay in place., In most cases, you should be able to tuck the loofah enmeshed orchid into a corner of the caddy. It should be stable and upright. If not, insert a small pole in the caddy and use a piece of twine to attach the plant to the pole and stabilize it.

, At this stage, feel free to add more plants that receive most of their nutrition from the air to your caddy in the same fashion as your orchid. Some varieties you might try include mosses, bromeliads, rhipsalis, and more., You may need to use your hands to hold the loofah lining in place, but once you start filling it with bark, the bark should help stabilize the loofah material. If the plants or loofah material are loose, use wire or twine to attach them to the caddy.


In most cases, after some time passes, the plants will become established in the shower caddy garden and will need less support. When this happens, feel free to remove the ties/pole., Generally, plants like orchids do best in a well-lit place. Soap and shampoo can also be unhealthy for these sensitive plants, so be strategic in the placement of your caddy.


For the first few weeks, you should water your caddy every other day. After that, you should be able to decrease the frequency of watering to once or twice a week."

Layer the bottom of caddy tiers.,
Add dirt and plants to the caddy.,
Hang the caddy and enjoy.",How to Make a Shower Caddy Garden3," This will only work for caddies that have at least one basket tier. Use sphagnum moss to line the bottom and sides of the basket(s). Then use a cutting tool, like shears, sturdy scissors, or a utility knife to cut the moss to fit the shape of the basket.


You might find that sphagnum moss clashes with the existing decor of the place you plan to hang your caddy. In this case, consider using black paper mulch instead., Fill the lined caddy ¼ of the way with potting soil and then arrange your plants in the basket. Taller plants should go in upper baskets, where there is more vertical room for growth. Then fill in the remainder of the planter with soil.


Some plants may have specific soil requirements. Check plant care instructions to ensure you are using the correct soil.

, Because the entire basket of the caddy will be filled with soil and plants, it will likely be quite heavy. Due to this, your caddy may require special wall hangers or fasteners able to hold the heavy weight.


Place your caddy in a place where your plants will receive the amount of light necessary for ideal growth. This information should be on the plant care instructions.

Make it charming and unique.,
Find inspiration in what you love.,
Look at design magazines.,
Use colors to your advantage.,
Add art.,
Provide inviting seating.,
Encourage conversation with furniture placement.",How to Make Your Home Seem Welcoming1," One way to make a place comfortable is to match it to your personality. When a friend walks into your house, they should be able to see you in the design, and if they can, that is welcoming in itself. It will be familiar to them because they know you. Plus, creating an enjoyable atmosphere is welcoming, too.For instance, if you have a bright personality, that should be reflected in your decorating. Use splashes of bright colors throughout your space.
Similarly, if you have a quieter personality, maybe your style will be a bit more subdued, cozier, with jewel tones and throw blankets everywhere.;
, Whether you love baking, traveling, or gardening, you can use that as the basis of your decorating style. Your interests should be a part of your home and style. Of course, you don't have to create a ""theme"" necessarily. However, if you love to travel and fell in love with certain area, for instance, you can use that as inspiration for your style.For example, maybe you loved visiting France. You can use a sort of French bohemian look to develop your style, with lots of curtains, plushy throw pillows, and soft rugs.

, One way to figure out what you love is to look at what other people have done. You'll hate some designs and love others. Try tearing out designs you like to help you create your own look that screams ""you."", Color can help set the tone for your design. For example, warm colors like reds and oranges can make a space feel more inviting by creating a cozier feeling. Blues, greens, and purples, especially in lighter shades, can help create the illusion of more space.Remember, you can add color in all sorts of ways. You can paint a single wall, add curtains, and use colorful pillows, rugs, and throws. You can also paint dull furniture a vibrant color., Artwork on the walls comes in all varieties. You can use framed photographs or posters, or you can opt for using original paintings by local artists. You can also paint a mural on the wall yourself. Either way, having art can help bring a room together.Art isn't limited to what goes on the wall. Think about pieces like sculpture or mobiles. These types of pieces can be whimsical and unique.

, When a guest enters your home, they should feel welcome to sit down. Provide good seating that's comfortable. You don't want it too soft, as sinking too far into something can make a guest feel uncomfortable. However, a guest should be able to sit several hours, so the furniture should be comfortable enough for them to do that.Think about comfortable couches that have a bit of firmness to them or dining room chairs that have padding and a comfortable back.

, When arranging your furniture, think about how it will affect conversation. If you're 20 feet (6.1 m) away from each other on couches, that doesn't make for good conversation. Similarly, you don't want to sit on top of each other. You need to find a good balance.Plus, you don't want things like furniture or decorations blocking people off from each other, as that can destroy conversation.
Also, try to have furniture facing each other, so guests don't have to swing their bodies around to talk to each other.

Create a focus in the room.,
Keep clutter out of sight.,
For things that you regularly use, still keep it out of sight as much as possible.,
Select beautiful, meaningful things and use them to give the home a soul.,
Keep things clean.,
Keep it simple.,
Ensure your house is always airy and well-lit, preferably with natural light and in the evening with a soft warm glow.,
Wires.",How to Make Your Home Elegant," Selecting a color palette of perhaps 2-3 main colors and 3-4 complimentary colors. For example, you might choose as main colors cream, brown and green. The complimentary colors could be a few shades lighter or darker from ""cream, brown and green"" such as champagne, ivory, beige and pastel green. Stay away from harsh colors or any color that heavily contrast other colors, unless you are aiming for contrast for a particular feature or reason.;
, Main items include major furnishings such as shelves and sofa, plus the room itself, in the form of paint and carpet.

,, This central point or feature should be the thing that draws the eye or starts conversations when visitors enter. It might be a very elaborately framed mirror, an eye-catching painting, an unusual couch, a wall of pictures. Let just one thing be the sole attraction of the room and everything else blend and support it.


When there is too much going on in a room, it becomes busy, creating a stressful, rather than unified, look.

, Clutter includes the mail, shopping catalogs, and anything else that is not either pleasing to look at or serving some immediate purpose. Set rules about how there should only be five items on the table or any counter. Don't let anything dangle or have too many display items and trinkets.

, Try to group things together. For example, keep remote controls in a beautiful basket so that only one item will be seen on the coffee table. Keep magazines in an opaque holder where one can easily access them on the sofa but you can only see the number of magazines when you look from the top. On your make-up table, only display favourite perfumes and gather all your cosmetics into a basket. The idea is that you have easy access but maintain a unified, simple look. Choose cabinets, bins, or baskets that cover and contain. If you choose glass cabinets, plan to keep the contents in order. Clutter only interrupts the flow of the space.

, A beautiful, elegant home is one that shows that it is loved and well thought of. Stay away from zen looks, or overly minimalistic kind of decorating. Those belong to corporate offices where there is a very sharp, 'switched on' feel as opposed to a relaxed, cosy, warm environment. The key is stringent selection. Depending on the space you have, select a couple of favourite things that gives you great memories or might be a lovely conversation-starter—things that you'll love to share with others. Perhaps you might display a beautiful vase of freshly-picked flowers in your garden that might be the centre piece of your dining table, some unique treasures collected on your travels, or works of art that you or a friend have done.

, Draw up a system for housekeeping and refer to it until it becomes automatic. Write daily, weekly, fortnightly and monthly tasks.


Pay attention to rubbish—never leave it till it's overflowing.
If you cook a lot, ensure that the smells don't stay and spill out to the other rooms and keep your home smelling nice.
Avoid getting stains and remove the ones you get. With clutter out of the way, you will be wonderfully surprised how much easier housework and maintenance gets.

, Stick to a few selected styles and avoid anything that looks too opinionated, complicated or that might be rude.


Avoid posters of celebrities. Use posters only if they are elegant and can be elegantly framed)
Use joke and novelty items sparingly, if at all. This includes things like joke calendars and novelty appliances (telephones, kettles).
Avoid items emblazoned with advertising or brand names.

, Lighting in a home makes and breaks the quality of elegance. In reading areas, make sure that there is enough light. Choose lamps that make sense, fit your style and theme, and aren't too gimmicky. If in doubt, choose simple designs.


Pay attention to wires and ensure they are hidden as much as possible. Otherwise, place them near sockets in order to prevent someone tripping over them.

, In our modern day and age, we use more appliances than before, and the wires and connections don't make for attractive.


Go wireless wherever you can. #*Choose items with inbuilt wires and places to wrap up cords.
Conceal cords, being sure to handle electrical wiring safely.
Run wires and cables as neatly as possible by bundling them, tying them along the underside of furnishings, etc.

Make a simmer pot.,
Bake a seasonal pie.,
Craft pumpkin cookies.,
Make candied apples.",How to Make Your Home Smell Like Fall1," There’s nothing that can fill your home with the scent of fall quite as well as a well-crafted simmer pot. Use aromatic herbs, spices, and fruit to create exactly the aroma - and atmosphere - you’re hoping for. For instance, mix 1 quart of water, 4 bay leaves, 1 thinly-sliced orange, a sprig of fresh rosemary, and a vanilla bean in a saucepan. Heat the concoction on medium high until it begins to simmer, and lower the heat so that it’s just hot enough to keep simmering.If you want the simmer pot to last more than 15-20 minutes, you’ll likely have to add a bit of water periodically.
Use 1 or two teaspoons instead of a vanilla bean, if necessary. If you do use a vanilla bean, you can dry it out and reuse it a few times.
If you want to keep a simmer pot going for more than an hour or two, use a crock pot. After achieving a simmer with a higher heat, reduce the crock pot’s heat to low.
Other great ingredients to include in a fall-themed simmer pot are sliced apples, cinnamon sticks, dry star anise, fresh or dry ginger, cardamom pods, coves, and/or dried orange peel.;
, If the scent of dried leaves isn't on your mind, you’re likely thinking about apple pie. Of course, there are a handful of equally enjoyable fall dishes, especially desserts, that will smell so good you’ll end up hungry. Anything with cinnamon, apple, and vanilla will smell especially seasonally appropriate.Don’t forget about pumpkin pie or pumpkin bread. In fact, baking with anything that has cloves, nutmeg, will fill your home with familiar fall scents as well.

, From pumpkin chocolate chip to pumpkin whoopie pies, there are plenty of different cookie recipes that are sure to get your house smelling like freshly-baked fall treats. Look online for hundreds of free recipe options. Pick one with with oatmeal and/or cranberry to increase the nutritional value of the cookie and provide a more complex aroma.Pumpkin spice cookies are another good option, and contain plenty of particularly potent fall aromatics, such as cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg.

, Candied apples will not only bring the scent of fall to mind, it may bring back childhood fall memories as well. To make your own caramel coating, cook 1 cup butter, 2 cups brown sugar, 1 cup light corn syrup, and 14 ounces of sweetened condensed milk on a stove at medium-high. Stirring non-stop, turn the heat down when the caramel boils, and use a candy thermometer to maintain a temperature of 250° F (120° C) for roughly 30 minutes.To test whether the coating is ready, drop a teaspoon into cold water. It should form a hard ball of caramel if it’s ready. Add 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract once cooking is complete.
Carefully dip apples previously pierced with craft sticks into the caramel. Allow them to cool on wax paper, but not before adorning with your favorite toppings, such as pecans or crushed pumpkin cookies.
If you struggling to choose between desserts, just bake caramel apple flavored cookies."

Agitate the concrete to get rid of bubbles.,
Protect your mold while it dries.,
Remove the mold.,
Sand blemishes if desired.,
Fill the bowl with sterno cans and fire glass or stones.",How to Make a Tabletop Fire Bowl," You’re going to be mixing and sanding concrete to make your bowl, so work outside if weather permits. Otherwise, pick an air area with strong air circulation. If necessary, set up fans and/or open windows to improve airflow., Drape a dropcloth, tarp, or similar covering over your worktable. Do the same for the floor or any other nearby surfaces that may potentially get dirty from your project. Then secure your covering(s) in place with duct tape. This will make clean-up a cinch., Wear work gloves to protect your hands. Also wear safety goggles to protect your eyes. Additionally, wear a dust mask, even if air circulation is strong, since mixing and sanding concrete will still introduce a lot of particles into the air., You’re going to need two bowls of different sizes in order to cast your mold: one to shape the fire bowl’s exterior, and a smaller one to shape its interior. First, pick one that matches the size you have in mind for your fire bowl. Then choose a smaller one that will fit inside the first. Also make sure that the smaller bowl is:Wide enough to fit a sterno can, with ample space left over between the can and the bowl’s rim to fill with fire glass or stones.
Deep enough so that the top of the sterno can is below the bowl’s rim, in order to contain spills.
Roughly half the size of the larger bowl to ensure that the fire bowl’s walls will be sufficiently thick.

, How much concrete you need will depend on the size of the bowls you chose (as well as how many bowls you intend to make). Err on the side of caution and purchase a larger bag of concrete mix than you think you’ll need. Follow the brand’s instructions on how much water to mix that particular formula, and in what increments.ShapeCrete and Quikrete are two popular brands for small DIY projects., Now that you’re concrete is mixed, ensure that you’ll be able to easily remove it from its mold before you pour it in. Spray the interior of your larger bowl with non-stick cooking spray. Then do the same with the exterior of the smaller bowl. Lubricate them now so that concrete won’t cement with them as it dries., Use a trowel to fill the bottom of your larger bowl with wet concrete. As you do, flatten the concrete so it’s nice and flat. Once the bottom is covered, use a level to make sure the flat surface is level., Once the concrete in the larger bowl is flat and level, set the smaller bowl on top of it. Judge its depth within the larger bowl. If its rim stands higher than the larger bowl, remove it, empty some of the concrete, and try again. If, on the other hand, the smaller bowl is still too deep inside for your taste:Take the smaller bowl out and add more concrete. As you do, just remember that you want to keep the concrete flat and level. Also check the smaller bowl’s exterior to make sure it’s still coated in cooking spray. If it isn’t, clean off any concrete and spray it again., Once the bottom layer of concrete is the right height, center the smaller bowl on top of it. Then begin filling the gap between the two bowls with more concrete. Depending on your taste, you can fill the gap all the way up to the smaller bowl’s rim, or you can quit sooner to ensure a higher wall between your fire bowl’s flame and its surroundings., Once the gap is filled to your satisfaction, lift the larger bowl and drop it on the ground or your worktable from a height of a few inches or centimeters. Force any bubbles or other gaps that may have formed within the concrete to collapse. Then, if needed, add more concrete to the rim of your fire bowl to correct any flaws., Place weights inside the smaller bowl so it’s less likely to move in case something bumps into your mold while it dries.Prevent any foreign elements from settling into the wet concrete by covering it with a dropcloth, tarp, plastic, or any other protective covering. Then follow the concrete’s directions regarding how long you’ll need to wait for it to dry., First, turn the bowl upside down.Then give the larger bowl a couple of soft taps with a rubber mallet to loosen it from the concrete. Pull the larger bowl off the fire bowl. Then turn the fire bowl right-way up and pull out the smaller bowl., If you like the look of a rough bowl, feel free to skip this step. Otherwise, give the fire bowl a look over. Use 60- to 80-grit sandpaper to smooth out any flaws.For an even smoother finish, repeat with a finer grit, like 150., First, center one or more sterno cans within the fire bowl. Fill the gaps between those and the bowls’ wall with fire glass or stones. If you want to hide the cans under a layer of glass or stones, place a grill grate on top of them, then layer your glass and stones on top of that to keep them from falling into the sterno cans.If you’re layering glass or stones directly over the flames, be sure that they are safe for such use. Ask staff at your local garden center which types of stone are best for this best purpose.
If you’re unable to find a grill grate that will fit inside your fire bowl, you can fashion your own out of metal hardware cloth.

Remove the old trim.,
Install directly over the existing trim.,
Use adhesive to hold the blocks in place.,
Fasten the blocks.,
Finish the blocks with spackle and paint.",How to Install a Plinth Block at a Door1," Installing plinth blocks will be easiest if there’s nothing to get in the way. Score the edges of the casing where it meets the wall with a utility knife, then pry it up using a pry bar or putty knife. You can either replace the entire casing this way or carve out the lower section of the trim to make room for the blocks.If you choose to remove the casing completely, you’ll need to replace it with new trim that lines up properly with the plinth blocks.
Make your cuts carefully to ensure that the edges of the trim above the plinth block come out even.;
, Alternatively, you can fit blocks over the trim that’s already in place. Just adjust the width and thickness of the paneling accordingly when you measure and saw. In this case, your plinth blocks will be more like a facade, and probably only need to be cut about half as thick as they would be if you were embedding them into the casing.You'll have the most success installing plinth blocks over trim that's perfectly flat, without any grooves, contouring or other detailing that will make the blocks difficult to fit.

, Spread a thin layer of construction adhesive to the backside of the block, then carefully line up the edges with the trim. When the blocks are perfectly aligned and in the right position, slide them into the blank slots you cut into the casing. Keep applying pressure to the blocks until they’re glued down securely.If you accidentally misalign the blocks on the first attempt, pull them off from the corner and try again with a fresh dab of adhesive.

, The adhesive will keep the blocks right where you want them, but it won’t be strong enough to hold them permanently. Once you’re satisfied with the position of your plinth blocks, nail them down gently. It may help to pre-drill the blocks with holes that match the size of the nails you’ll be using.It’s important that the nails be slightly recessed so that you’ll have room to plug them later.
Nail into the solid framing behind the trim whenever possible. This will provide greater security and keep the blocks from coming loose., Once the blocks have been fitted and fastened, all that’s left to to do is blend them in with the rest of the casing. Fill in the nail holes with a small amount of caulk or spackling, then brush on a coat of primer before painting the blocks to match the trim. Enjoy the sophisticated look of your new molding!Sand the spackling after it dries to make the surface of the blocks smooth and level.Applying a few strips of painter’s tape to the wall around the door jamb will allow you to work your brush all the way into the edges of the blocks.

You don't want anything that will knock your guests over. In fact, scents that are too strong can cause problems for some guests if they have allergies. However, a soft scent can make it feel warm and welcoming. Try something like vanilla or cinnamon to make it seem like home.To add scents, you can use wax warmers, candles, diffusers, or plugins.

, Light is important in setting the mood. Natural lighting creates a warm glow, so when it's still light out, make sure to let the light into your home. Draw back the curtains, or use sheer white curtains so that your home will feel open and airy.Create intimacy with electrical lighting. Overhead lights can be harsh and uninviting, particularly when you have guests over. Instead, use a variety of lamps, track lighting, and/or recessed lighting to create a comfortable atmosphere.Candles or a fire can also make your home feel cozy and inviting, particularly in the winter.

, Plants add a natural feel to your home, making it feel more comfortable. They literally give the place life, and green puts people in a good mood. Just make sure you remember to water your plants, so they look fresh and happy. Nothing is sadder than a brown, wilted plant in the corner."

Think like a guest.,
Tell guests they are welcome.,
Don't forget to clean.",How to Make Your Home Seem Welcoming3," When a person comes in, they're going to want to know several things, such as where to set there belongings down. You should make that as obvious as possible by having a place right by the door where they can put their things. It also helps to give your guest a small tour when they come in, so they know where the bathroom is, where they can get a drink of water, and so on., One way to make guests feel welcome is to simply offer a welcome to them. Let them know that they are free to wander about (if they are), and invite them to ask for anything they need, as well as help themselves.For instance, you could say, ""Welcome! We're so glad you're here. Feel free to make yourself at home and get anything you need, but don't be afraid to ask, too.""

, While your home doesn't need to pass the white-glove test, a reasonably clean home makes guests feel more welcome. If you haven't cleaned, your guests may feel like that you haven't prepared for them, making them feel unwelcome.However, a perfectly clean (sterile) home can seem uninviting, too, as guests may not feel they can relax and be themselves.
One way you can ""clean"" is to put away clutter. Have functional, pretty organizers around to make it easy on yourself.

Make your own fall-scented candles.,
Make an essential oil spray.,
Mix a fall-scented blend for your diffuser.",How to Make Your Home Smell Like Fall2," For a sustained, powerful aroma, make a custom candle. Choose a mason jar or other fire safe container. Go to a craft supplies store for some smokeless candle wicks and flaked soy wax, and make sure your kitchen is stocked with a tablespoon of vanilla extract, another of cinnamon, and ½ a tablespoon of ground clove.Use a microwave and start melting your wax by heating one cup on high for two minutes. Once the first cup is melted, add a bit of wax in one minute increments until you have sufficient melted wax for the container that will hold your candle. If you’re using a standard mason jar, you’ll need two cups of wax overall.
Once the wax is melted, add the vanilla and spices. Mix well, ideally by stirring with a disposable skewer.
Wrap the end of a candle wick that will be exposed around a thin item that can bridge the opening of your candle’s container. Allow the metal-tipped end to dangle to the bottom of the container.
Pour the melted wax into the candle container while adjusting the wick to keep it in the center of the wax. Allow the candle to sit at room temperature for at least 4 hours to set.

, You can make a spray that can instantly fill a room with the fall scent of your choosing. For an especially woodsy option, start with 3 tablespoons of either vodka, ethyl alcohol, or witch hazel. Add 10 drops each of the following oils; juniper, sage, bergamot, and cinnamon. Add these ingredients to an 8-ounce spray bottle and fill the bottle the rest of the way with water.


Always shake the bottle well before using.
For a similar option, but sweeter-smelling option, go with 10 drops each of cedar wood, rosemary, orange, and clove oils instead.
Avoid spraying your aromatic mist on anyone’s skin, or in front of anyone’s face.

, If you have an essential oil diffuser, there are several great blends you can make to produce fall aromas. For example, use 3 drops of cardamom and 1 drop each of clove, cassia, and ginger essential oils to make a spiced Chai-inspired scent. For a more cool-walk-in-the-woods approach, use 3 drops of eucalyptus, 2 drops of juniper berry, and a single drop of sage essential oil.To get the scent of apple pie emanating from your diffuser, add 2 drops each of clove, ginger, and cinnamon bark oils. Add a drop of nutmeg too, for an even sweeter aroma.
While classic cone or stick incense can provide fall-inspired aromas as well, essential oils are safer, healthier, and will better disperse aroma in your home.

"
"
Open your windows.,
Make a custom potpourri.,
Build a fall scented wreath.,
Use scented soaps.",How to Make Your Home Smell Like Fall3," Even if it’s a bit cold to leave your windows open, it’s worth opening them up for fifteen or twenty minutes as soon as you get home. You’ll carry the crisp, aromatically comforting scent of fall into your home with you, and circulate the air in your home in the process., Another way to bring the scent of fall indoors with you is by bringing some natural items in from outside and arranging them in a potpourri. Homemade options are usually preferable to store bought blends, as you can customize not only a specific scent, but a particular level of potency. Go with larger portions of larger items, and smaller amounts of the more potent (and usually more colorful) ingredients.Large items that are great to make up the majority of a potpourri include pine cones, dried apples and oranges, cinnamon sticks, and nuts.
Good small, aromatic ingredients include cloves, rose hips, juniper berries, and bay leaves.
After selecting your ingredients, place them all in a large jar or bowl and gently toss them. This will blend them together in a visually appealing way, and encourage items to give off scent.
For added potency, add a few drops of an essential oil before tossing your potpourri. Good options include cedar wood, clove, cinnamon, orange, or pine oils.

, As a more visually compelling alternative to potpourri, you can arrange many of the same ingredients into a wreath. The hard part is making the inner form. You can buy a foam ring from a craft supplies store, or make a core yourself. To make your own, get branches of juniper and rosemary and arrange them in a long, thin bundle. Tie the arrangement into a tube with twine or fishing line and fasten it into a circle.Once you have a base, you can glue or tie on anything you want. Rose hips, bay leaves, and cloves are great options, as well as pine cones and large colorful leaves.

, You don’t have to bake to get aromas of pumpkin, cinnamon, and apple in your home. In fact, one of the easiest and quickest ways to get these scents in your home is by purchasing the corresponding soaps. Place a bottle of the scent you favor at your kitchen sink, and in your bathroom.For a natural air-freshener, place a sachet of homemade fall potpourri in the bathroom as well.

Cut your raw wood to the appropriate size.,
Rout or add other details to the block.,
Make any last adjustments as needed.,
Mark the edges of the plinth blocks.",How to Install a Plinth Block at a Door2," Keep in mind that a plinth block is there to offset the rest of the trim around the door, so it needs to be slightly larger overall. Measure (and re-confirm) the trim dimensions and add ½” to 1” (1.25 to 2.5cm) to each. Use a table saw to cut the wood, making sure the edges are clean and precise.Materials like 5/4 trim or MDF paneling are typically recommended for molding projects.
It may be necessary to glue two or more pieces of wood together to achieve the desired thickness.

, If you have access to a handheld or table-mounted router, you can use it to etch shallow grooves or other embellishments into the upper section of the plinth blocks. Otherwise, a planer or bevel will be useful for creating sleek, angled edges. Feel free to get as elaborate or as minimal with your plinth blocks as you like.Hold the blocks firmly in place with a vice or table clamp to avoid making any sloppy mistakes.Routing and other decorative elements don’t offer any enhanced function—they’re simply there to improve the look of the molding.

, Clean up the edges of the freshly cut panels. It will be helpful to perform a quick mockup with the loose blocks to gauge whether the dimensions are correct in relation to the door jambs. If necessary, saw the blocks down another ⅛” to ¼” (.3 to .6cm) until they match the width of the trim without looking too bulky.

Smooth out rough spots and imperfections using a sheet of low-grit sandpaper.When adjusting the height, always make follow up cuts to the bottom of the block so you don’t interfere with the routing or beveling.

, Notch the blocks with a pencil to indicate the reveal (the small lip that protrudes from the casing), the top and bottom and which side of the doorway they should go on. This will make it easier to keep the separate components organized and assemble everything efficiently when the time comes.In most cases, plinth blocks should be wider and deeper than the casing by at least ⅛” (.3cm).Don’t worry about marking up the blocks too much—you’ll be painting over them before the project is finished. Make whatever notes will help you install the blocks with precision.

"
"
Measure your door casing.,
Buy precut plinth blocks that fit your trim.,
Decide on a style for custom plinth blocks.",How to Install a Plinth Block at a Door3," Unless you’re putting in new trim from scratch, the plinth block will fit right over the casing you already have in place with little difficulty. Stretch your tape measure across the bottom of the door jambs horizontally, then measure the depth of the trim to where it meets the wall. Write these dimensions down so you’ll be able to refer to them later during the fitting and installation phases.As the old saying goes, “Measure twice, cut once.” If you want your plinth blocks to fit naturally, it’s essential that you take down your measurements as accurately as possible.

, Most home improvement stores sell prefabricated plinth blocks that can easily be installed over your door’s existing trim. For many people, purchasing readymade blocks will be the simplest option. These blocks tend to come in standard sizes, so there will be no need to do a lot of guesswork if your home is already outfitted with a conventional trim style.Talk to a store representative or contractor if you have any questions about how to install plinth blocks in your home.
One downside of using prefab plinths is you’ll be limited in your style selection. Most commercial blocks will either be of Victorian influence or feature basic routing or beveling., If you’d rather fashion the plinth blocks yourself, you’ll have more say over the look of the finished product. Think about how subtle or ornate you’d like the moldings to be, then settle on a specific design that matches your sensibilities. Your blocks might utilize smooth, angled edges, a grooved face or simply stand out in relief from the door jamb.Ideally, the style of your plinth blocks should go with the rest of your home’s trim and general decor.Unless you’re an experienced woodworker, it will probably be a good idea to stick to simple shapes and designs.

Hot glue a Styrofoam ball to the top of a glass or crystal candlestick.,
Get a bouquet of mini silk roses and snip the flowers off.,
Poke a rose into the top of a Styrofoam ball.,
Add more roses in a ring around the first one.,
Continue adding roses in rings until you reach the bottom of the Styrofoam ball.,
Wrap a ribbon around the middle of the candlestick.",How to Make Rose Centerpieces1," Cover the top of the candlestick with hot glue, then quickly press the Styrofoam ball into the glue. You can use any size Styrofoam ball you want, but something around 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) would be ideal.Keep the ball proportionate to the candle stick. The smaller the ball, the shorter the candle stick should be.;
, Leave a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) long stem on each rose.If possible, use a pair of wire cutters to do this. Many silk flowers have wire inside the stem, which can ruin a good pair of scissors. If you cannot find wire cutters, use a pair of sturdy scissors you don't mind possibly ruining.

, If the rose is very loose, pull it out, add a drop of glue into the hole, then push the rose back in.You want the base of the rose touching the Styrofoam ball.


You can use tacky glue or hot glue.

, Make sure that all of the roses are touching one another, including the one in the center. Once again, if any of the roses feel loose, secure them with a drop of hot glue.

, When you are done, the entire ball should be covered in roses. Make sure that there are no gaps or bits of Styrofoam showing.

, Tie the ends of the ribbon into a large bow. For that final touch, snip the ends of the ribbon at an angle. A satin ribbon would work the best, but you can also use a sheer ribbon as well. It can match the color of your rose ball, or it can be an accent color instead, such as silver or gold.

Determine if the water pump is the actual problem with your machine.,
Locate the model and manufacturer information to find a replacement water pump.,
Remove the machine to a location where it is easily accessible.,
Turn the washing machine on its side so you can access the motor and water pump assembly on its bottom.,
Remove the discharge hoses from the water pump by squeezing the clamp with pliers and pulling away from the fittings.,
Remove the spring clamps that hold the pump in place.,
Pull the pump away from the motor.,
Compare the replacement pump with the new one, to make sure they are identical.,
Slide the pump into the position you removed the old one from, then slide it onto the coupling shaft on the base of the motor.,
Make sure the new pump slides all the way up against the motor base, so the stabilizing arms rest against it, then replace the spring clamps to secure it in place.

,
Replace the hoses and clamps onto the new water pump and secure the clamps.

,
Reinstall the washing machine and test it to make sure you don't have any leaks.

",How to Replace a Washing Machine Water Pump," Supply hoses, fittings, drain hoses, and the washing machine tub can all be the source of a leak, and water failing to be discharged from the tub during the spin and rinse cycle can be caused by a failed water pump coupling or other problems.;
, You may find a replacement part at a local appliance repair shop, or search online for suppliers.

, Taking it out onto a patio or driveway will allow you to get to the part you need to change.

, The Whirlpool machine in the illustrations is easiest to work on if it is laying on its left side facing the machine; other machines may be configured differently.

, The hoses are soft and flexible, so it should be easy to slide them free if the clamps are loosened sufficiently.

, You can either pull them from underneath the pump with needle nosed pliers, or pry them off by inserting a flat bladed screwdriver between the clamp and the base of the pump and then twisting it. The rear clamp is identical to the front, but since it is difficult to see, you have to remove it by feel.

, The coupling will usually slide free without any problem, if it doesn't, it may have a snap ring or other device locking it in place. You may have to twist the motor and pump slightly on its suspension to give you enough room to remove the pump.

, If anything seems out of place or incorrectly sized, your new pump probably will not work.

, If the pump doesn't slide on easily, you will need to rotate either the shaft or the pump impeller so it will.

Soak a block of green floral foam in water overnight.,
Put the foam block into a vessel.,
Get an assortment of roses and put them into a bucket of water.,
Cut about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) off of each stem.,
Poke the roses into the foam.,
Add some finishing touches.",How to Make Rose Centerpieces2," This will help keep the roses stay fresher longer when you stick them into the foam.There are several different types of floral foam. Make sure that you get the kind meant for fresh flowers. You can find it in the floral section of an arts and crafts shop.


Do not use regular white Styrofoam for this. You need the foam to be able to soak up water so that the roses stay fresh.
Be careful when handling this type of foam. It is very soft when dry and easily dented.

, You can use a fancy bowl, planter, vase, or even a pedestal meant for pillar candles. It should sit below the rim of your bowl, planter, or vase.If the foam is too big, cut it down to the right size and shape.


If you are setting the foam down onto a pedestal, cut it down to a rough dome or orb shape., You can use roses in all one color, or you can experiment using different colors. You can also get different shades of the same color for an ombre effect.Plan on using about 48 roses.If you plan on using multiple shades or colors, put them into separate buckets. This will make sorting through them easier.Consider using fragrant roses. This is a small detail that often gets overlooked but will add a nice touch., Use a clean pair of garden shears and cut the stems at an angle.It would be a good idea to cut off the leaves and thorns as well.


If your foam block is very small, you may want to cut the stems down to about 3 inches (7.63 centimeters).

, Insert them close enough so that the blooms touch.Keep adding roses until the foam is no longer visible. You don't have to poke the roses all the way down into the foam.


If you are sticking the roses into a bowl, planter, or vase, consider sticking them in as different depths to create a dome-like effect.
If you are going for an ombre effect, start with your lightest color, then move on to the darkest.You can arrange it in stripes or rings.

, At this point, your centerpiece is done. You can move it to the table, and leave it as is, or you can add some more touches to it. Here are some ideas:


Arrange short, votive candles around the centerpiece.Scatter glass gems or metallic confetti around the centerpiece.
Tie a satin or sheer ribbon around the base of the vessel.

"
"
Get a tall, glass, cylindrical vase.,
Trim a rose down until it is about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) shorter than the vase.,
Insert the rose into a frog pin.,
Place the rose into the bottom of the vase.,
Fill the bottom of the vase filler.,
Fill the vase with cool water.,
Place a floating candle on top.,
Place the vase on your table.",How to Make Rose Centerpieces3," You can also use a square vase instead. You will be placing the entire rose inside the vase and then filling the vase all the way with water. Try to get a vase that is at least 12 inches (30.48-centimeters) tall. This will make your centerpiece look more elegant.


Consider wrapping a crystal trim around the base of the vase.You can find it in the sticker or scrapbooking section of an arts and crafts store.

, You will need the extra space inside the vase for the floating candle. If the rose is too tall, it will stick out of the water/vase and ruin the effect. You can trim off the leaves or leave them on.


Cut real roses with clean garden shears. Cut silk roses with wire cutters.
If you chose to leave the leaves on a real rose, rinse them off under cool water. This will get rid of any dust that might muddy up the water.

, A frog pin is a coin-sized metal disk with pins sticking out of it, like a hairbrush. You can find them in the floral section of an arts and crafts store. Try to wedge the rose's stem between the pins rather than straight into them.Consider adding a few more shorter roses into the pin.
A frog pin is not absolutely necessary, but it will help keep the rose secure. If you cannot find a frog pin, you will have to add more vase filler later on.

, For an added effect, consider turning on a submersible LED light, and adding it into the bottom of the vase as well.Make sure that the LED light is meant for being used in underwater floral arrangements. You can find them in the floral department of an arts and crafts shop.

, Scoop the filler out of the bag with your hands, then carefully spread it across the bottom of the vase. This will prevent the filler from damaging the rose's petals. Keep filling the vase until the frog pin is covered.


You can use tiny acrylic pellets or crystals, of glass gems or marbles.
If you weren't able to find a frog pin, fill the bottom of the vase with 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) of vase filler, or until the rose stands up on its own., Stop when you are about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) away from the rim of the vase. The entire rose, including the bloom, should be submerged under water.

, Make sure that the bottom of the candle does not bump up against the rose. If it does, add more water or trim the rose down. You can use a regular round candle or a rose-shaped one.

, Consider scattering acrylic gems or metallic confetti around the vase. You can also make a few more vases that are taller or shorter than the one you just made.

Maximize natural lighting.,
Select nature-inspired wallpaper.,
Paint the ceiling white.,
Use light colors.,
Choose patterned fabrics.,
Furnish sparingly.",How to Give a Room a Tropical Theme1," Use windows to your advantage by hanging white or translucent curtains to let as much light in as possible. Light will not only give the space a more natural feel, but will also make the room appear larger.Keep everything open and airy.


Sheer draperies are ideal for letting light into a room. Venetian blinds also give you control over the amount of light allowed into the room.;
, Wallpaper that appears to be made of wood or bamboo will remind people who enter the room of palm trees and other plants that are typically found in tropical places. Decorate one or two walls with the wallpaper, and coat the other walls in a solid, neutral color.

, A dark ceiling can make a room feel cramped and tiny, whereas a white ceiling will brighten and open your space. The illusion of high ceilings will help your room feel more like a tropical destination., Light colors and whites reflect natural light better than darker colors. Try to find furnishings in cool colors, such as blues and greens for your bedspreads and sheets. Cool colors are soothing, so they will reflect the relaxed environment of the tropics.Dark colors can serve as accents, but refrain from painting an entire wall in a dark shade.

, Light fabrics, such as linen and cotton, can brighten a room. Find fabric with a hibiscus flower pattern to make the environment even more tropical. Use tropical patterns to cover throw pillows and lamp shades. Blankets with floral patterns would also make a cozy addition to your personal paradise., Include only the most necessary furniture to avoid a room with a cluttered appearance. With fewer pieces of furniture, you will have more space to move around. For best results, choose simple furniture with smooth lines and light coloring.

Choose a color scheme.,
Divide the room with rugs.,
Choose a focal point.,
Arrange furniture around the focal point.,
Add additional seating.,
Address other needs.,
Arrange the lighting.,
Finish with additional decor.",How to Furnish a Den1," It's your den, so choose colors that make you relaxed. Keep in mind that dark walls make a room look smaller, which may make a small den feel cramped. A large den, on the other hand, might benefit from the coziness of dark wall paint.


If you're not sure what to choose, go with a neutral color for the wall paint. Cream, light gray, or light brown are unobjectionable and work with most furniture.
If the walls are already painted and you're not sure which colors they go with, get white or light-colored furniture. You can easily add color later with cushions and throws.
Bright, fluorescent colors are harsh on the eye, especially reds, oranges, and yellows. Even in a bright, high-energy den, keep these to pillows and throw rugs, not entire walls and couches.;
, If you have a large, open plan den, start by deciding how to divide it. One easy way to do this is to lay down one rug for each area of the den. For instance, lay down one rug where couches will surround it, and another where the game table will go.


Thick, plush rugs make the den more comfortable and luxurious.

, Each room or area of a room should have a focal point to design around. For a den, this is usually a television or fireplace. If you don't have any large objects like this, choose a wall and make it stand apart with a different color, heavy curtains, or large wall art.

, Arrange seating so it faces the focal point, but place it in a semi-circle or rectangle to encourage conversation. L-shaped couches work great here. Provide coffee tables or side tables within reach of each seat.

, Assuming there's room, keep a couple comfortable chairs or a small couch arranged away from the focal point, for people who prefer solitary activities such as reading.

, You might need a television, bookcase, or gaming table, depending on what you use the den for. For extra fun, install a movie projector or a minibar.

, Place a lamp about every ten feet (3 meters) throughout the den, or next to any reading seats. Keep the overhead lighting warm, and consider installing a dimmer switch. Harsh overhead lighting kills any sense of comfort.

, To add more color and coziness to the room, add pillows and decorative objects. Decorative glass jars, candles, and flowers are all good ways to add color. For a more austere look, go with a small number of objects all in the same shade.


Decorate the walls as well. Wall hangings, paintings, or photographs add character to the room.

Decide if you want a top-load or front-load washer, and narrow your search to include only washers that fit your preferred loading location.,
Determine how much space you have in which to store your washer and dryer.,
Check your dryer hookups to determine if your home is set up for a gas- or electric-powered dryer.,
Make a list of the features that you require in a new washer and dryer.,
Talk to a salesperson or review online shops to narrow your search down to several models that meet your needs.

,
Talk to friends and family about the brands and models you are considering.,
Gather several price quotes once you have decided on a washer and dryer.",How to Buy a Washer and Dryer,"


Advantages of top-load washers are that they are significantly lower in cost and easy to load. Top-load washers also complete wash cycles in less time than front-load washers. However, top-load washers are not as energy-efficient as front-load washers, and they require more water. They also hold smaller loads and generally do not clean as thoroughly.;
,


If you are working with a very small amount of space, you may choose to narrow your search to only include stackable washer and dryer sets. These can fit in most large closets, and are commonly used in apartments, condominiums and small homes.

, Make sure the dryer you select is compatible.

, You can also make a second list of features that would be nice to have, but aren't mandatory.


Available features include automatic dispensers, automatic temperature control, extra rinse cycle, touchpad controls, porcelain lids, stainless steel drums, steam settings and time delay.

,, See if they have recommendations or warnings. You can also read consumer reviews to help you determine which washers and dryers offer the most value.

, Ask retailers if they are offering sales, promotions or special financing. Make your purchase at the retailer that is willing to provide the best deal.


If you are financing your purchase, remember to ask about the costs of annual fees and interest. If your washer and dryer costs less at one store, but the financing plan charges high interest, then you may be able to save more money by paying a larger amount up front at a different store and spend less in interest over time.

Accessorize with bamboo.,
Hang a net-like canopy over your bed.,
Use mirrors.,
Decorate with seashells.,
Use plants as decor.",How to Give a Room a Tropical Theme2," Border your ceilings with pieces of bamboo, and lay a couple of bamboo throw rugs on the floor. Use bamboo to accent lights, wardrobes, and chairs for an added tropical effect., This will give the room a more tropical feel, as many tropical rooms and resorts use canopies both as mosquito netting and as protection from the hot sun. Canopies also allow for a romantic and playful atmosphere., In order to make a room seem more spacious, group mirrors together. Mirrors reflect light instead of absorbing it, so hanging them strategically, such as on their side, can trick the eye into making walls appear longer., Place seashells on dresser surfaces and on your bedside table. When you go to the beach, find shells that catch your eye and display them in your room to bring the seashore home. This way, people will instantly think of paradise upon seeing your space.

, Gather tropical plants, place them in flower pots, and scatter them throughout your room. Not only do plants provoke thoughts of paradise, but they will also help your health. Plants ease breathing and increase the humidity in the room, which can help fend off colds, sore throats, and dry skin."

If the result looks gloomy or harsh, hang patterned curtains along one wall, or add a solid color throw rug in front of the couch.

, Even a den with a more masculine design needs a little shine and lightness. Keep the thick rug and soft couch, but add a glass and metal coffee table. Keep a minibar underneath a thin, tall legged side table, and hang metal wall art as a focal point.

, Position enough seats for the whole family, in a circle around a fireplace or television. Include activities for everyone: games, books, television, and music. Make the space a little warmer with light-colored throws over the couch, and a bookshelf with decorative knickknacks between the books.

Measure the space you have.,
Note whether your dryer will need to be powered by electricity or gas.

,
Look for units labeled as stackable.,
Consider your own height.,
Save water and electricity with a front loading washer.,
Look for a unit that includes a moisture sensor in the dryer.,
Consider the additional features that are important to you.,
Shop around for the best prices and selections.,
Inquire about warranties.,
Research consumer reviews online.",How to Buy a Stackable Washer and Dryer," Use a tape measure to get the length and the width of the space where you will keep your stackable washer and dryer, to make sure you buy one that fits. Most models are from 24 to 27 inches (61 to 68.6 cm) wide, and from 70 to 75 inches (177.8 to 190.5 cm) high.;
,, Any compact washer and dryer can be purchased separately and stacked on top of one another, but that may not be safe. Make sure you select a model that is labeled as stackable. Washers are typically on the bottom of the unit, with dryers on the top.

, When buying a stackable washer and dryer, make sure you can reach the dryer. Practice opening and reaching into the dryer to make sure loading and unloading laundry will be easy. If you cannot find a stackable unit that you can reach, consider getting a small stool to help you reach into the dryer.

, Stackable models come with washers that load in the front of the machine, or on top of the machine. Front loading washing machines spin faster, which takes more water out of the clothing and linens, cutting down on drying time.

, The sensor detects the amount of moisture in the load, and will shut off automatically when the load is dry. The price will be higher than models with a thermostat sensor, which will measure air temperature in the drum of the dryer. However, the moisture sensor will save energy and help protect your laundry from extra wear and tear.

, If conservation and green energy is important to you, choose a model that has an Energy Star rating. If you like to do a lot of small loads of laundry, make sure you select a model that has low settings as well as high or heavy-load settings. Other considerations that depend on your preference include the placement of the lint screen in the dryer, the buzzer or bell that alerts you that the drying is complete, the simplicity of adding detergent and bleach to the washer, and how noisy the machine is when it is running.

, Stackable washers and dryers can be purchased in home appliance stores, major department stores, and at home improvement centers and warehouse chains. You can also find deals online, at major retailing sites. If you are on a budget, consider checking Craigslist in your area for a used model.

, Most stackable washer and dryer units come with a standard 1 year warranty. Extended warranties are often available, but they can be expensive.

, Before you buy a stackable washer and dryer, look for reviews provided by customers who currently own one. Best selling brands in stores and online include Kenmore, General Electric, and Whirlpool.

Empty the lint screen.,
Unplug your dryer.,
Move your dryer.,
Remove the tube.,
Vacuum out the vent.,
Put everything back in place.",How to Clean a Clothes Dryer Vent1," To start, empty out the lint screen the same way you would after doing laundry. You should do this each time you do laundry. When cleaning the vent, check the lint screen first and remove any small amounts of lint. It's always good to start with a clean lint screen when cleaning your dryer., Never start cleaning a dryer vent while the dryer is still plugged in. This can be very dangerous. Find where your dryer's cord is plugged into the wall. Disconnect the plug., The dryer vent is found behind the dryer. You will need to pull your dryer away from the wall to clean your vent. Sometimes, very heavy dryers cannot be moved. It may also be hard to move a dryer if you have limited space in your laundry room. In these cases, you may need to hire professional cleaners.If your dryer is very heavy, find someone to help you.

, The dryer vent is a hole that runs through your wall. There will be a tube connecting the dryer to the vent, attached to the wall with screws. Use a screwdriver to remove the screws. Then, remove the tube from the wall so you can access the vent.The type of screwdriver you need varies. Examine the screws to see if you need a Phillips or flathead screw driver.
Keep the screws in the same place. You will need them later to reattach the tube.

, Take your vacuum cleaner's nozzle attachment. Vacuum out the vent that runs into the wall, sticking the nozzle into the vent as far as it will reach. Then, vacuum out the tube running into the dryer, again vacuum the tube as far as the nozzle reaches. You should remove a great deal of lint this way.If you do not have a vacuum cleaner, use a flexible dust brush with an extendable handle. You can also use compressed air to blow lint out of the dryer vent.

, Reattach the nozzle running from the dryer in the wall by placing the screws back in place. Then, slide the dryer back into place. Plug the dryer back in. Your dryer should be ready to use now and, as the vent is clean, you should see a noticeable improvement in drying times."

Look for HVAC specialists in your area.,
Budget for cleaning.,
Schedule a cleaning time.,
Get any diagnostic tests recommended.",How to Clean a Clothes Dryer Vent2," In some cases, it's difficult to clean the vent yourself. You may not be able to reach the vent, for example. Also, you can only clean so deeply without professional help. If your dryer is not adequately drying your clothes after you've cleaned the vent yourself, hire professionals. You need HVAC specialists, which are cleaners who specialize in dryer vents. Look for cleaners online or in your local yellow pages.As most homeowners need to have their dryer vents cleaned professionally on occasion, ask other homeowners in your area for recommendations.

, Professional cleaning services can be somewhat pricey. In general, professional dryer vent cleaning can cost anywhere from $89 to $179. Figure out roughly how much you can afford to spend on dryer vent cleaning. Call up different companies and ask for an estimate. Find a company that's within your price range.Do not put off cleaning your dryer vent for too long due to price. Dryer vents should be cleaned at least once a year or they could pose a fire hazard., Once you've found a company, call them up and schedule a cleaning time. You will probably have to be home during the cleaning to show cleaners where your dryer, outlets, and fusebox are. Find a time that works for you to have the cleaners come in an treat your dryer vent., Diagnostic tests are used to assess how well your vent was cleaned. They may also determine whether gas from the vent is escaping into your home and check for gaps or holes in your dryer vent. Depending on things like your home's age, the cleaners may recommend diagnostic testing. Talk to the cleaners about potential tests to see if they're right for you.Diagnostic tests may cost extra, so keep this in mind when budgeting for professional cleaning.

Learn the signs your vent needs cleaning.,
Keep the floor around the dryer clean.,
Limit the use of dryer sheets.,
Stick to brief dry cycles.",How to Clean a Clothes Dryer Vent3," You should clean your dryer vent promptly when it shows signs of needing cleaning. Clean your dryer vent if you notice any of the following:Clothing not drying during a dry cycle
Very hot clothing after a dry cycle
Excessive heat from the dryer
Larger amounts of lint in the lint tray than usual
Excessive odor from dryer sheets

, During regular cleaning, sweep up any lint or debris found around the floor of your dryer. Your dryer vent will suck up dirt and debris from the floor, which can get the vent dirty faster. Regular sweeping helps maintain a clean dryer vent., Dryer sheets can make your clothes smell fresher, but can also contribute to built up lint in a dryer vent. In general, opt against dryer lints when possible. Fabric softener should also only be used in moderation, as debris from fabric softening can clog a dryer's vent., Do dry cycles in 30 to 40 minute intervals. This allows for better air circulation. Poor air circulation can cause the build up of dirt and debris in the dryer vent."

Unplug your washing machine.,
Remove the agitator cap.,
Unscrew the bolt holding the agitator down.,
Re-install by reversing the steps above.",How to Remove a GE Washer Agitator1," Removing a washing machine's agitator is generally a simple, easy procedure with minimal risk of danger. However, accidents are possible even during the most routine acts of maintenance, so, just to be safe, disconnect your washer from its power supply before beginning. Doing this ensures that you won't accidentally be shocked or injured if the ""on"" button is somehow pressed accidentally.


Though injuries from washing machines are very rare for adults, they are, in fact, possible and can be quite serious. However, it's important to keep in mind that most washing machine injuries occur when the machine is full of clothes — in other words, during normal use.;
, Many models of GE washer have agitators that are mounted in place with a single metal bolt (specifically, compact washers 1996 and earlier, regular 1992-1995 models, and handwash agitator models). To remove agitators on these models, this fastening bolt must first be removed. To access the bolt, remove the cap at the top of the agitator — this can usually be done either by hand or by prying with a screwdriver.


Take care if the cap is glued down. Bolt caps that are glued in place are usually fairly fragile. If bent during the removal process, they may require special glue from the manufacturer to replace.

, Once you remove the cap, look down into the barrel of the agitator. You should see a metal bolt or nut holding the entire agitator housing in place. Use a ratchet (with an extender) to unscrew and remove this.


Note that, in some cases, you may see large flathead, hex head, or #20, #40, or #50 torx screws rather than a standard hex nut or bolt. In these cases, use the appropriate screwdriver or socket.
When you're done, simply lift the agitator up. It should come out of the machine freely. If it doesn't, it may be stuck in place with accumulated soap or other washing chemicals. In this case, see below for more information.

, For bolted agitators, re-installation is usually quite simple. Place the agitator back in the wash compartment, replace the bolt or screw, re-tighten it, and replace the agitator cap. At this point, your maintenance is complete! Plug your washing machine back in and test the function of your agitator to ensure it's working properly.

Open the wash compartment.,
Pull directly up on the agitator.,
Take the opportunity to lubricate the shaft.,
If the agitator won't come off, call a repairman.",How to Remove a GE Washer Agitator2," Many older models of GE washing machines (specifically those made before 1992) have agitators that aren't secured in place with a bolt.This means that you don't necessarily need any special tools to remove the agitator, though you may if chemical buildup has caused it to become stuck in place. In this case, see the section on ""stuck"" agitators below.


Before beginning, for your safety, be sure to unplug the machine as above.

, Brace yourself firmly against the washing machine and pull directly upward on the agitator. With some force, the agitator should come off of its mounting, exposing the drive shaft underneath. Avoid twisting or jerking the agitator from side to side.


Don't hurt yourself by straining too hard to remove the agitator. See below for more information on how to handle a stuck agitator.
If you're having trouble, you may also want to consult GE's online database of product manuals for more information., Older models of washing machines usually have a metal shaft under the agitator that requires occasional lubrication to keep the motion of the agitator smooth. As long as your have access to the shaft, ensure it stays in good working order by using a small amount of petroleum jelly (often called by the brand name Vaseline) to lubricate it.


For most models of washers, lubrication is recommended twice each year.

, The agitators in many models of washing machine (particularly more recent ones) aren't designed to be removed normally — instead, they require special tools or techniques that only trained service people have access to. In these cases, you may not be able to remove the agitator even if there is no obvious bolt holding it in place, so your only option is to enlist the help of a mechanic.

Ensure that the agitator isn't bolted down.,
Cover the bottom half of the agitator with hot water.,
Fasten a loop of strong rope around the agitator.,
Position a sturdy 2x4 under the rope.,
Use the 2x4 as a lever to pull the agitator off.",How to Remove a GE Washer Agitator3," Over many years of use, water, soap, and other washing chemicals can sometimes harden around the base of the agitator, essentially ""freezing"" it in place and making it very tricky to remove (if not impossible).Luckily, in this case, it's often still possible to remove the agitator by using a sturdy 2x4 plank as a simple lever. However, if this method is used to ""force"" an agitator that is bolted or otherwise fastened in place, it can break the agitator and even cause damage to the inner machinery of the washing machine.


For this reason, it's extremely important to ensure that the agitator is not bolted down before attempting this method. Remove any bolts holding it in place as directed above and ensure that the agitator for your model of washer can be safely removed before beginning.
If in doubt, contact a mechanic — the price of a repair is usually minor compared to the price of replacing a broken machine.

, To begin, fill the washing compartment with about six inches or so of hot water — enough to completely cover the bottom of the agitator. This will help loosen any built-up soap and chemicals, making removal slightly easier.


To be clear, you don't want to start a wash cycle with hot water. You only want to add hot water to the washing compartment. Attempting maintenance on your washing machine while it's ""on"" is always an unwise idea.

, Grab a strong piece of rope about five feet (one and a half meters) long. Fold it over on itself at its midway point and loop it through itself to fasten it between the fins on the agitator neck. Give it a firm upward yank to tighten it and ensure it's secure.


In a pinch, you can also use an old dryer belt for this task., Grab a 2x4 plank about five feet long. Loop the ends of the rope over the 2x4 and tie them securely in place around the wood so that they won't slip.


To protect the finish on the edge of your washer from the pressure of the 2x4 in the next step, put a folded towel underneath it.

, Start putting firm pressure on the end of the piece of wood outside the washer. This will raise the end over the agitator, pulling it directly upward. Gradually increase the downward pressure on the lever until you are able to lift the agitator out. Beware — this can require quite a bit of force, especially if your agitator hasn't been removed in years.


If you can't remove your agitator this way, call a mechanic. Using extreme amounts of pressure to push down on your lever is a sure-fire way to injure yourself, damage your washer or both, so play it safe.

Disconnect the dryer from the electrical supply.,
Move your dryer to an area where it will be easy to access the rear of the machine if possible.,
Check the outside of the machine near the top for any exposed fasteners.,
Remove any fasteners, either at the lint screen access, or the top rear of the dryer, putting them in a safe location for reuse when putting the machine back together.,
Pry the front of the top of the dryer up with a large flat-bladed screwdriver to disengage the snaplock that holds it in place.,
Unplug the electrical wires at the front of the dryer that connect to the door safety switch.,
Lift the top of the machine at the front, allowing it to hinge back on the rear of the machine.,
Prop up the top of the dryer with a chair or other item so it is supported while you work on the drum and belt assembly.,
Lift up on the front panel of the dryer.,
Hold the front edge of the dryer drum, and remove the front panel entirely, placing it to the side.,
Pull the dryer drum forward while balancing its weight, and remove it from the dryer housing.

,
Take the old belt and any information from your dryer to an appliance parts supplier to match it for a replacement.,
Clean any lint, trash, or other debris from the dryer's housing.,
Wrap the new belt around the drum when you are ready to reinstall it.,
Lay down in front of the dryer, and look underneath the drum to the belt tensioner and the electric motor that turns the drum.,
Slide the front cover up to the front of the drum, removing any support blocks from underneath the drum when you do so.,
Replace the screws removed to take the front panel off in the reverse order they were removed in, making sure you plug in all electrical connections as you do so.,
Replace the dryer in its usual position, and reattach the dryer vent ductwork.",How to Change a Clothes Dryer Belt," The easiest way to do this is to simply unplug it from the receptacle. This will prevent accidental electrical shocks and burns.;
, This means disconnecting the vent duct and unplugging the electrical power if not already done. If the dryer is ducted in with solid metal pipe, or hardwired into the home's electrical power, you may need to reconsider doing this job yourself. Do not attempt to loosen or disconnect the gas pipe (from any gas appliance) in order to move it. Even a slowly leaking gas pipe is a very dangerous condition that will eventually ignite with potentially deadly results.

, Most dryers built in the last 20 years have hinge-like clips on the rear, and snaplock fasteners under the top to make removing the top easier. Check at the lint filter access door for additional fasteners, usually counter-sunk phillips type machine screws.

, Most dryers body screws are either 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) or 5⁄16 inch (0.8 cm) machine screws, so a nut driver of the right size will make this job easier, but even a pair of common pliers will do in a pinch.

, Be careful not to twist or pry in such a way that the screwdriver slips and scratches or chips the finish. Once it is free of the locking ring, you can lift the cover high enough to see the top of the dryer drum. You should see a narrow reinforced rubber belt wrapped around the drum. If it is missing or very loose, you will need to proceed with replacing it. If it is still in place on the drum, you may have a problem with the electric motor which turns the drum or the electrical switches that control the dryer's functions instead of a belt problem.

, There is usually a plug connector on the wiring harness to make servicing the drum area easier, but if there is no apparent removable connector, you may have to cut these wires and reattach or splice them when you reassemble the machine.

, Watch the wires from the timer and machine controls so that they do not tear loose from their terminals or snag on a sharp metal edge when doing so.

, You may find a volunteer to simply hold the top up, but fitting the belt onto the motor and around the drum can take time, so having something to support it will make the job easier.

, There are usually two friction type clips that fit a slot on the front panel, securing the bottom of the panel to the sides of the machine, and lifting this part will allow it to be removed so the drum can be taken out. If lifting does not free the front panel, check underneath the machine for concealed screws or other fasteners. If none are located, try prying the front free.

, Now you are ready to slide the dryer drum out of the dryer housing. If the old dryer belt is still attached, you will need to slide it off the drum so the drum can be removed, or cut it and simply pull it out.

,, Some dryer manufacturers do not have aftermarket replacement parts suppliers, so you may find you have to locate a dealer for your particular brand of dryer.

, If the lint filter ductwork is removable, now may be a good time to do so and clean it, as well. Wipe down the drum rollers and guides while you have the drum removed as well.

, Observe the drum, you should see a mark where the old belt fit the drum, and make sure the new belt is set at the same location. Slide the drum back into the machine, and support the front of the drum to hold it in position.

, Fit your new belt through the tensioner and around the pulley on the motor, making sure the traction grooves are facing the pulley in the correct fashion.

, Push the front completely in, lifting it over the latches and allowing it to drop onto them to secure the bottom in position. Push the top in, making sure the seals fit inside the drum snugly, without damaging them. These seals are usually felt, or some other soft material, and are held in place with an adhesive.

, Let the top of the dryer drop down into position, and press at each corner to engage the snaplocks. Check to make sure all additional fasteners are replaced and tightened snugly.

, Make sure this ductwork is clean inside, since lint bypassing the lint filter can eventually stop the duct up. Plug the dryer back into its receptacle and turn it on to test it.

Begin the task by clearing the room of any furniture and covering the floor with a drop cloth.,
Spot-treat any holes, gashes, or other blemishes in the wall with spackle or joint compound.,
Prepare the walls for painting by sanding.,
Clean the walls to remove any dust or residue.,
Apply joint compound to any grooves in the paneling.",How to Paint Wood Paneling1," Canvas drop cloths work best, but they can be more expensive; if you need to use something else, tape down some rosin paper instead.Don safety goggles and a face mask. A face mask will help to filter out some of the paint fumes, while safety goggles will prevent dust and other residue from getting into your eyes during the sanding process.;
, Grab a putty knife or a trowel and hit any uneven surfaces with joint compound, smoothing it out with a putty knife. You may need to apply two coats of compound, as it shrinks when it dries, so it's better to apply thick and sand down later than not applying enough.

, Use a fine-grit sander to go over all the wall surfaces. The best implement to use is a random orbital sander, although you can use sandpaper and a little bit of elbow grease if you're in a pinch. Reach hard-to-get-to areas with a pole extension or a ladder.


Don't skimp on the sanding. Proper sanding will help do several things:
It will help to remove any protective coating on the paneling that could interfere with the adherence of the paint.
It will increase adhesion of the paint to the surface.
It will increase the smoothness of the final surface.



, Dust or residue is the enemy of primer and paint; any residue left over will mar the final look of your paint in addition to making the surface rougher.


Clean with TSP (tri-sodium phosphate) or a TSP substitute. Rinse the TSP off with a clean cloth and allow a few hours for the walls to dry.

, This will make it easier to create a smooth surface for the painting. Smooth the compound with the trowel and allow it to dry. If necessary, use the sander to smooth the joints until they are level with the surrounding panels. Wipe with a dry cloth to remove any residue left by the sanding.

Take your time to prepare the wood for painting.,
Remove any old paint from the wood as necessary.,
Fill all dings and deep gouges with quality wood putty, if possible.,
Sand the surface of the wood with coarse sandpaper and finish off with fine sandpaper.,
Clean off any dust or wood residue with a clean towel.,
Tape off any parts of the wood that you don't wish to paint.,
Prime the wood.,
Choose your type of paint.,
Choose a kind of sheen for your paint.,
Whatever kind of paint you choose, use high quality paint and brushes.,
Load your paintbrush with paint.,
With a loaded brush, start from the top of the wood and move down.,
Use an unloaded brush to pull the tips across the paint.,
Wait for the paint to dry fully before repeating the process one to two more times.,
Determine if you need a sealer or clear topcoat to preserve the paint on top of the wood.,
Prep the surface of the painted wood by lightly sanding and vacuuming off any paint residue.,
Apply up to three coats of sealer or topcoat of polyurethane, depending on your preference and topcoat directions.",How to Paint Wood," This is probably the most overlooked part of painting wood, and in many ways is the most critical. Your work is only as good as the canvas upon which your creation takes life. Paint will not fill in cracks, dents, holes or other imperfections in the wood and keep them hidden after it dries. In fact, those imperfections will probably be even more apparent.;
, If the wood you want to paint has paint already on it, you’ll want to remove that paint before adding a new coat. Take a putty knife and scrape away as much paint as you can without getting too persnickety about coverage; don’t worry, you’ll sand away smaller flecks of residual paint before the preparation is done.


Unless the existing surface is an oil based stain or finish, do not use chemical strippers. Scrape as much off as possible and then use a trisodium phosphate (TSP) solution to clean off the rest of the loose paint and grime. Rinse well.
If your wood is treated with a stain or a finish, apply TSP to the wood. Instead of trying to remove the stain or finish entirely, focus on cleaning and sanding it (more on sanding later) in order to give the paint a porous surface to adhere to.

, Use a flexible putty knife and fill in all the areas needing attention. It is better to use too much in this step than not enough. You will sand down the area after it dries and hardens, so it doesn't need to be perfect at this step.


Use regular spackle or joint compound to fill in small or shallow scratches. Wait to dry completely before sanding.
Caulk areas of long and deep cracks. Use a tiny bead of caulk, smoothing it out well. Wait to dry completely before sanding.

, Start by sanding down the area where you've used putty or filler before moving to the rest of the surface for an even feel. Use a fine grade sandpaper for this work sanding the wood with 80 to 100 grit sandpaper, making sure to remove any paint that’s still on the surface. Finish off with fine 150-grit or higher to smooth out the surface and get it ready for priming. Remember to work the sandpaper with the grain of the wood, not against it, and to keep power sanders moving.


Sanding tools:Random orbital sander: Powerful but expensive, requires sanding disks.Sheet sander: Less effective, but cheap and uses regular sandpaper. Best on flat surfaces.Sanding block: Very labor-intensive. Not recommended except on small projects or for finishing touches.
, If you have a vacuum, vacuum off the wood thoroughly, followed by a sweep with a damp cloth. If you don’t have a vacuum, wipe off the dust or residue with a dry cloth, finishing off with a damp cloth. Wait for the wood to fully dry.


Paint or primer won’t adhere properly to dirty surfaces. Paint does its job best when the surface that you apply it to is clean.

, If you want a section of the wood to remain unpainted, or you want to paint a section of the wood a different color, you'll want to use tape to cover the parts of the wood you don't want to paint. You can get specially-treated tape designed for latex paint, like Frog Tape, at most hardware or home repair stores. These kinds of tapes adhere to wood well and are designed to minimize paint seeping into the pores of the wood.


If you want to leave parts of the wood unpainted, you'll want to tape off at this stage of the prep. If you want to paint the wood different colors, you'll want to tape off after you've primed all the wood and painted specific sections.

, Primer helps paint achieve a uniform, rich look on top of wood. Apply several coats of primer for the most even look in your final product. If priming raises the grain of the wood, consider sanding with a fine-grit sandpaper before the final coat of primer.(Be sure to wipe off excess residue before applying the final coat of primer.) Follow instructions on your primer when calculating time between coats as well as the number of coats.


Which color primer should you use? Use grey primer for darker coats of paint and white primer for brighter coats of paint.Should you use oil-based vs. latex-based primer? For many years, professionals instructed painters to use an oil-based primer on wood and follow it up with latex-based paint. That logic is slowly being turned on its head. Oil-based primer adheres to wood better, but it's also less flexible than latex primer, which means it's more susceptible to cracking.Especially if you are painting wood outdoors, latex primer is probably your best bet. Unless the type of paint you want to use specifically requires oil-based primer, use latex-based primer for most cases.
Should you use a spray primer or brush-on primer? It's mostly a matter of preference. Spraying is easier and faster, but it usually requires several coats to get good coverage. Brushing is slower and more painstaking, but creates a thinner, more even layer of primer onto which to paint.

, Most home paint jobs today rely on latex (water-based) paint. Aside from a handful of scenarios, this is probably the type of paint you want to use when it comes to wood.


Alternatives and additions:Oil-based paint: a durable coat good for heavily used items. Dries slowly, leaving fewer brush marks.Conditioner or Extender: Add this to latex paint to slow down drying and reduce brush marks.
, Sheen, or gloss, is the amount of light reflected in your paint. High-gloss paints will appear to shimmer when exposed to light, while matte paints will absorb light and hide imperfections. When choosing a paint, look for descriptions of sheen and buy accordingly.


Common types of sheen:Flat: non-reflective finish good for hiding imperfectionsMatte: very slightly reflective. Easier to clean than flat but not as much as more reflective paints.Eggshell, Satin: increasingly more reflective. These tend to vary greatly by manufacturer.Semi-gloss, Gloss: the most reflective and durable sheens.
, It doesn't help to be cheap with paint; any savings you get by choosing cheaper paint will be sunk when the paint under performs and you need to buy supplies for a whole new project.


Some people might be tempted to use a foam brush for their projects, but foam brushes give the painter less penetration and more air bubbles than bristle brushes. A high-quality bristle brush should blow a foam brush out of the water.

, Submerge about a third of your paintbrush into your chosen paint. Tap the paintbrush on the side of the paint bucket, turn the paintbrush 180°, and tap the other side of the paintbrush against the bucket. You should have a fully-loaded paintbrush with just the right amount of paint for good coverage.

, Brush evenly using somewhat shorter strokes. Repeat this three to four times until one segment of your wood is fully covered. Try not to let the paint stand very long between coats.

, This process is called tipping, and it helps you get good coverage while minimizing brushstroke appearance. The brushstrokes will flatten out as the paint dries, which is one of the reasons why slow drying paint is important.

, Depending on the paint you're using, as well as the finish you want to achieve (some people want the grain of the wood to stand out; others don't), you probably want to apply more than one coat. Before the final coat of paint, work over the dried painted surface lightly with a very fine sandpaper. This will give your final coat a nice surface to grip onto.

, Many paints nowadays contain protectants that safeguard the paint against water and wear, for example, meaning you don't have to spend extra time applying protectants to your dried wood surface. Some people, however, may want to add an additional layer of protection between the wood and the weather, especially if the wood will be outdoors.


Certain kinds of sealers or topcoats may not interact well with certain kinds of paints. Latex-paint, for example, is meant to breathe and dislikes some sealers. If you are unsure whether you need to seal your paint, or what sealers work with which paints, ask a representative at a local paint or hardware supply store.

, Prepping the painted wood in this way should not visibly affect the sheen of the paint or the evenness of the tone.

, Wait for the sealer or topcoat to dry, and sand if instructed. Repeat until the desired consistency is achieved.

Remove everything from the room.,
Cover the floor with plastic sheets.,
Paint the ceiling first.,
Wait until the ceiling paint has finished drying.,
Cover the ceiling near the wall with painter's tape.,
Place one end of the first strip in the corner of the ceiling, right where the ceiling meets the wall.,
Slowly drag the tape along the length of the ceiling in a straight line, pressing it down firmly until it lies flat against the ceiling.,
Repeat the taping process with as many strips of tape you need.,
Pour 1 or 2 cups (250 to 500 milliliters) of wall paint into a small bowl.,
Dip a small angled brush into the paint.,
Lay your paintbrush flat against the wall, starting at a corner of the room.,
Drag the brush down 2 inches (5 centimeters) from the top of the wall.,
Use the brush to paint along the entire perimeter of the room.,
Proceed with painting the wall as usual, but allow the paint to dry before removing the tape.",How to Paint Walls Near a Ceiling," Anything hanging on the walls should be the first to go, but everything that can be removed should be, including other decorations, furniture, electrical switch plates, and phone jack covers. Even though you may not bump into these items as you paint the upper wall along the ceiling, you will need to remove them later in order to paint the rest of the wall. Moreover, paint could drip onto these objects as you paint the upper wall. For these reasons, you must remove them first before applying any paint.;
, You will not be working with a lot of paint all at once as you work on the area of the wall near the ceiling, so your odds of dripping paint onto the floor are not as high as they will be when you paint the rest of the wall. Even so, some risk still remains. Play it safe by protecting your floor before you break any paint out.

, If you are painting your ceiling as well as your walls, you should paint the ceiling first. Painting the ceiling is more difficult, and you are more likely to make errors than you are while painting the walls. Additionally, paint from the ceiling may drip down onto the walls. If you painted the walls first, the area nearest the ceiling would likely need to be redone after you applied ceiling paint.

, You will need to apply tape to the ceiling, and partially damp paint is more likely to come up than dry paint. Depending on the brand and type of paint you use, you may need to wait anywhere from a few hours to overnight before you can start work on your walls.

, Apply the tape in 2- to 3-foot (2/3- to 1-meter) strips. Strips longer than this may be difficult to work with.

, Press down on it firmly until it lies flat against the ceiling.

, There should be no pockets of air. Otherwise, you run the risk of paint seeping beneath the tape and onto the ceiling.

, By the end, your entire ceiling should have a ring of tape around it, directly where the ceiling and wall meet.

, Using a standard painter's tray will only make the task more difficult, since these trays tend to be bulky and may be difficult to maneuver while standing on a ladder. A small bowl, in contrast, can easily be held in one hand, and a few cups of paint are all you will need to start with.


If you do need more paint to finish the space around your ceiling, you can refill your bowl when you step down to move your ladder.

, Most of the paint should be on the bottom 1/2 inch to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) of the brush. With a bulkier brush, excess paint from the top edge of the brush could rub against the ceiling as you move along the wall. A flat painter's brush that angles in will allow you to apply paint to the surface of the wall without accidentally applying paint to the surface above your brush.

, The bottom edge of the brush should just barely touch the painter's tape to ensure that the paint extends up to the highest point of the wall.

, Applying paint with a paintbrush is more time consuming, but also more accurate. Painting 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) down gives you a little breathing space later on, making it easier to paint the rest of the wall using a roller without needing to get too close to the ceiling.

, This process is often called ""cutting in,"" and even professionals use it to safely apply paint to the tight area of your wall where it meets the ceiling. When you finish, you should have a solid 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) line of paint along the top of each wall.

,


As you paint the rest of the room, only allow the roller to reach as high as your initial 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) strip of wall paint. Do not push or drag the roller all the way up to the ceiling.
After your entire wall dries, you can remove the painter's tape. Removing it beforehand could smear the paint on your wall, ruining your efforts at keeping paint off the ceiling.

Prime the paneled walls.,
After allowing the primer to dry, sand it down briefly with fine-grit sandpaper.,
Begin the painting process.,
Apply a second or third coat, if necessary.,
Finished.",How to Paint Wood Paneling2," Tape the edges around window and door frames as well along the ceiling; then begin applying a coat of primer. The primer will provide a clean and light palette for the space, making it easier to cover the paneling completely with one or two coats of paint. Allow the primer coat to dry for at least a few hours or overnight for the best results.


Mix and aerate the primer adequately before applying to the wood paneling. Using and up-and-down circular motion, mix the primer so that it distributes more evenly when you apply it to the paneling.
Use a primer specifically designed for wood for best results. Many wood primers are water-based, meaning that they dry relatively quickly (2 to 4 hours). This gives you less time spent on the job.

, You can use a sanding tool for this, but you don't want to overdo it, so you might be better off just sanding by hand. Sand lightly but evenly for better adhesion when you finally cover with paint.


Remember to rub off any sawdust or residue after sanding with a tack cloth or a clean brush. Sawdust and grime are the enemy of a polished, professional look.

, Use a brush to cut in around windows, doors and the ceiling. Once the edge work is done, begin painting the walls using brushes, rollers or paint sprayers. Apply an even coat and allow it to dry for a day or so before evaluating.

, Depending on the tone of the paneling and the effectiveness of the primer, two or three coats will normally be sufficient to create the look you want. Inspect the paint and make sure it is completely dry before moving furniture back into the room.


If you really want an even, smooth look, use fine sandpaper and terry cloth to hit the coat of paint before you apply another coat.

, Inspect your lovely new wood paneling and congratulate yourself. You made an easy project look, well, easy!

Determine if you’re going to paint your trim indoors or outdoors.,
Gather all your supplies.,
Sand down the trim.,
Repair any damage done to the trim.,
Tape off the trim.,
Prime the trim.,
Add your first layer of paint.,
Add a second layer of paint.,
Re-install the trim or remove your tape.,
Caulk around the edges of your trim.",How to Paint Trim," The process of painting trim is generally the same whether or not you do it indoors or outdoors. However, there are a few pros and cons to each:


If you paint your trim outdoors, you’ll have to remove it from your house, which takes a bit of time. However, you’ll generally end up with better, cleaner results and you won’t have to be bending over while you work.
If you paint your trim indoors, you don’t have to take extra time to remove it from the walls. However, you’ll be forced to bend over and stand on ladders to paint it, and you’ll be required to tape off the walls and floors.;
, To prepare your trim, you’re going to need fine-grit sandpaper (80-grit, 100-grit, and 120-grit), spackle, a putty knife, paint primer, caulk with a caulking gun, and painters tape. For painting, you will need a few high quality paintbrushes proportionate in size to the trim you are painting, foam rollers, and a durable paint. You may choose to use a sealer to finish the trim at the end, as well.Although you may spend more at the start, it will be worth it to buy quality materials for your project. Your trim will look better and last longer if you do.
You’ll need to calculate the amount of paint you need based on the total space of all the trim you’re painting. Ask for help with this at a local home center, if necessary.

, Sanding trim will help to remove any oily coating on the wood that might prevent your paint from sticking, and will give a clean, smooth base for your new paint to be applied to. Sanding is an especially important step when you are painting over old trim that is previously stained or painted, or new trim that has a glossy sealer over the top. If you’re working with trim with many layers of paint, start with an 80-grit sandpaper and smooth down the wood. Move to 100-grit sandpaper after that, and finish with 120-grit sandpaper for a smooth base.


If you’re working with trim that is relatively free of stain or paint, you can start with just 120-grit sandpaper.
You’ll need to take extra time to sand down sections of trim that have curves or decorative edges.

, This step applies primarily to old trim that you are painting over. Many times there are dings, dents, and holes in old trim, all of which should be repaired prior to painting. Use a bit of wood spackle and a putty knife to fill in and seal over all these damaged areas. Follow the package directions for application, as it may vary depending on the brand you purchase. Allow the spackle to dry completely for several hours before moving to the next step., If you’re painting your trim indoors, you will need to use painters tape to block off the walls and floors prior to priming. Carefully spread it so that all visible areas adjacent to the trim are covered by the tape.

, Pour your primer into a painting pan or bucket, and remove any packaging from your paintbrushes. Work slowly along your trim, adding 1-2 coats of primer to it; this will cover up the woodgrain and underlying color, giving you the best foundation for your paint. Avoid slopping on thick layers of primer, as this will take longer to dry and the strokes/drips will show up under your paint job later., Your first layer of paint is most important, because it will sent the stage for any brushstrokes that might appear in the final product. Realize early on that patience with the first coat of paint will greatly improve the overall look of your trim when completed. Start by pouring your paint into a tray or bucket. Saturate your brush with paint, and wipe off any extra that might be dripping. Start in the center of the trim, and brush back and forth in the same direction, horizontally. When you’ve finished painting a piece of trim, use a foam roller to go over the top of the paint to reduce the appearance of brushstrokes.


As you add paint along the rest of the trim, spend time blending the edges of different paint patches together so as to reduce the appearance of brushstrokes.
If you’re painting your trim indoors, you’ll need to ‘cut in’ the trim - meaning, carefully paint along the edge where the trim meets the wall/floor. Paint the center section of the trim after the edges.
Wait several hours (or days, if using oil paint) for your first layer to dry completely before moving onto the second coat.

, The goal of the second layer of paint is to smooth out the color and fill in any patchy brush stroke areas. Work along the trim, using the same painting technique as you did for the first layer. You should paint all of the trim with a second coat, even if the first coat looks like it covered everything. Simply filling in patchy areas may seem like a good shortcut, but it will typically leave you with a blotchy end-job. Use your foam roller to smooth out any visible brushstrokes along the trim, when you’re finished.

, Depending on whether you decided to paint your trim indoors or outdoors, what you do now will vary. If you worked outdoors, you’ll need to bring your trim back in and reinstall it in its original location. If you painted your trim indoors, you will need to remove all of your painters tape along the floor and walls, and any other protective plastic you might have laid down.

, Caulking is a final step many people overlook, but which makes a serious difference in the appearance of your trim. Caulking will seal any gaps between the trim and the wall, both protecting it from damage and giving it a more finished look. Carefully spread your caulk around the seam between the trim and the wall. Use your finger as you go, to spread the caulk into the crevice and seal the gap more evenly. Use a damp rag to clean the nozzle on the caulk gun to prevent it from clogging, and to wipe your dirty hands on.You should always use a caulk that is close in color to your trim - typically white. The idea is that the caulk will blend in seamlessly.
Wait for the caulk to dry several hours before returning furniture to its original locations.

Prepare the room for painting as you normally would.,
Choose a semi-gloss alkyd paint.,
Test a alkyd primer on a small portion of the wall.",How to Paint Textured Walls1," Cover the floors and furniture, fill any small holes, remove outlet covers, tape off the trim and cut in the corners with a brush.;
, This type won't be as readily absorbed by the texture as latex. Alkyd paint is also easier to clean, which is important on textured walls because they attract more dirt. Don't paint a textured wall white.

, A test is necessary to confirm the water-fastness of the texture. If the texture starts to soften and fall off, you will have to use an airless paint sprayer to paint the walls. If the texture holds up, you can use a brush or roller.

Let the stucco rest for at least 60 days if it is new.,
Inspect the stucco surface.,
Pressure wash the stucco using a pressure washer.,
Allow the stucco to dry after it has been pressure washed.

,
Fill any cracks in the stucco.,
Repair damaged areas by replacing the loose stucco, washing the damaged area and applying patching compound after the surface is dry.

,
Select and purchase the paint that you want to apply.,
Mask the areas that you don't want to paint and cover the floor to protect it from possible drips and spills.

,
Pour the paint into a paint bucket that is large enough to dip your roller in.

,
Paint over the stucco exterior using a roller.,
Use a masonry brush in the following ways to finish the job.",How to Paint Stucco," The stucco needs at least 60 days to settle and dry completely.;
, Look for any areas that are peeling or staining. You may want to mark these areas since they will need extra attention when you are painting over them.

, This will remove dust and dirt and also remove any loose paint from previous paint jobs.


Set the washer to use low pressure (1200 to 1500 psi) and use a wide spray tip.
Distance the spray tip approximately 12 inches (30 cm) away from the stucco exterior to give it a light and even wash.
Wash from top to bottom when working on a vertical surface such as a wall.
Angle your spray away from window and door frames to prevent water from entering the frames and causing damage.

,, You can use caulk for small hairline cracks but will need to fill the larger cracks with a thick sealant since it will hold its place more firmly.

,, You should consider the following points when selecting masonry paint.


Color: of course the paint should match the color you want.
Flexibility: the paint should be able to stretch to adjust to temperature changes.
Dirt and mildew resistance: to minimize cleaning and maintenance requirements.

,,,


A lamb's wool roller is ideal because it holds its shape without splatters.
Use 1 inch (2.5 cm) nap thickness if the stucco surface is smooth. For rougher surfaces the nap thickness should be 1.5 inches (3.8 cm).
Apply 2 coats to give a thick film of paint and fill more pores.

,


Paint the border areas around windows and doors that the roller was unable to reach. You can paint with much more detail when using a brush.
Cover the deeper pores in the stucco using the paintbrush. The brush can reach the deeper areas that the roller could not.

Choose a wide, soft brush, called a wall brush.

,
Paint diagonally first in one direction, then the other.",How to Paint Textured Walls2,", This will help ensure that paint covers every part of the textured wall. It also hides the brush strokes.

Choose a good 9-inch (23 cm) lamb shearling roller cover with a 3/4-inch (2 cm) nap.,
Fully load the roller with paint.,
Cover the wall in overlapping vertical strokes.,
Check for areas that have too much paint on them.",How to Paint Textured Walls3," If this fails to adequately cover the texture, switch to one with a 1 1/4-inch (3 cm) nap.

, Dip the roller in the paint several times and rake it over a screen to distribute and take off the excess paint.


Don't dip the roller into the paint so far that paint enters the hollow center. This will leave drips of paint on the walls.

, If this doesn't do an adequate job, roll the paint on in a ""V"" pattern, then follow up with vertical strokes.


Because of the amount of paint that the roller will hold and the increased possibility of splatter, use the roller more slowly than if you were painting a smooth wall.

, Remove the excess with a dry roller.

Patch and fill holes in the house.,
Caulk and seal any windows or openings to prevent air and water from leaking in.,
Use a paintbrush for better control and better precision.,
Start at the top of your house and work your way down.,
Don’t start painting if it might rain.,
Follow the shade.",How to Paint the Exterior of Your House," It is important that you spend some time washing the dirt and grime off the exterior of your house before you start painting. If the exterior surface of your house is free of paint-repelling soil, the primer and paint will adhere better, making the paint last longer. Most of the time, a simple wash with a hose, a pump sprayer and a scrub brush is sufficient, but if you decide that you would prefer a professional to help you, a power washer in the hands of a professional can provide a superior clean.


It is not recommended that you use a power washer on your own unless you are familiar with them because they can cause damage to house wood siding and house trim if used incorrectly.;
, Before you paint the exterior of your house, scrape off any bubbling, flaking or blistering paint. Painting over this could cause future problems for your new house painting project. Strip these parts right back so that they no longer present a problem.

, The goal when painting the exterior of your house is to have the cleanest and most beautiful exterior you can. Sanding will help by smoothing out any bumps or lumps that can look strange under a fresh coat of paint.

, The goal here is to repair any damage that could worsen over time, which may require a future painting of your home. Be sure that you repair any rotten wood, fix any dents and replace damaged pieces of your home that might get worse in the future.

, This may be the most important part of the prepping process. It's important to have a well-maintained, beautified, non-rotting wood house, but it's just as important to make sure that the windows, cracks and openings aren't leaking air or letting in water, which can ruin the interior of your house. Depending on the severity of the deterioration, you can even resort to using a heavy duty, professional grade, industrial caulking.

, Paint sprayers can be messy in an unpracticed hand. Alternatively, you could use a mini-roller to go along your siding a little faster. Except for siding, brick and large doors, try to avoid using rollers as they don’t cover as well, and it is harder to be as precise as a paintbrush.


Take good care of your paintbrushes. Wash them out after every painting session, without fail. That way, they'll stay in great condition for much longer.

, This serves two purposes. First, it allows you go down the ladder instead of up as you work, preventing potentially life threatening falls. Also, when prepping/scraping the paint off, you will have debris falling on the bottom areas that you just painted. Second, painting from top to bottom prevents messy drips and missed spots. Ideally, you should also start painting from the left side and work your way right because you are more likely to see any missed spots.

, Whilst latex paint is fairly steadfast once it’s dried, a good rain while it’s still wet can wash the paint away. It's better to wait until the rain is no longer in the forecast than trying to paint on a rainy day and have to start all over again later.

, When you are painting the exterior of your home, you would be wise to follow the shade from your house and avoid the sun. As the sun moves around your house, try to avoid the sun as much as possible because you may become overheated with the sun beating down on you, and painting in direct sunlight (depending on the heat of the day) is not good for the application process and can cause bubbling/adhesion issues. By moving with the shade, you minimize these potential problems.


For example, if it is sunny in the morning on the east side of the house, rather paint on the west side of the house.

Begin your preparation with a power washer.,
For larger structures, scaffolding may be preferable to ladders.

,
Scrub all mold with bleach and water and water only, then rinse bleach.

,
Set all nails with nail set.

,
Screw all loose siding, trim and accessories.

,
Sand all loose paint.,
When you sand loose paint, use a painters mask to avoid breathing fine paint dust.,
To seal rusted nails drain pipes etc.,
Break painted-in windows and repair window glaze by removing loose and patching.,
Put paint into a 5 gallon (18.9 L) bucket with a roller screen, in combination with a hook, to hang it from ladders and scaffold, and as a catch if it should slip.,
Do filling.,
You must use paint over the entire exterior surface with exterior primer before you paint.,
Choose paint.",How to Paint the Exterior of a Wooden Structure," Although it can be effective at cleaning, this must be done very carefully and not at close range, or it can damage siding and drive water into the wood and walls. The first opinion on this, overruled by the contributors, is that you do not power wash unless you plan to let it dry for at least a month. You do not want to paint over wet wood. Take your choice.;
,,,,, The Makita 5"" disk sander is ideal. Never use paper disk sandpaper, as it doesn't last long and is hard to control. Use hard board sanding disks usually 80, 100 or 120 grit, depending. You can sand very lightly with outer one inch of board, and no sanding grooves will show. Used correctly, this should last half, or most of the day.

, Older paint has lead in it and it can give you lead poisoning. One advantage of the scrubbing is that it reduces the dust that you breath.

, use Red Mercury. However, this is poisonous; wear mask with filters specifically for the chemical.

, Redwood window sills may need to be sanded to wood and fiber glassed with Redwood compatible epoxy. Use some mix of Linseed Oil on dry rot and overly dry wood. You can also use fiberglass to seal overly damaged dry rot. Primer with oil base primer. Never use water base primer outside as it will not hold up on wood.

, All tools can be equipped with hangers. Roll on the paint with a long nap roller for speed, best quality, and then painted out with brush. A three and one-half inch acrylic angle brush is light, easy to use, and can be used for nearly every application. A brush holder can be bought which hangs on the bucket. Spray painting is faster, but will never do the job of hand application, since the paint is usually thinned for the gun. Beware of contractors who use the cheapest materials, and the fastest means to save labor costs. Often they charge the highest prices and do the cheapest job.

, Fill will stick better to paint, than raw wood. Fill all nail holes or anything up to one or even two inch diameter with 'Dap 33', oil base window glaze. The only thing ever used before someone decided to make money on unnecessary substitutes. Allow the surface to glaze over for more than one day before painting. You can also use fiber glass filler for large holes. Use elastomeric, paintable caulk, the most long lasting that you can get, for most vertical joints, cracks, some knot holes. Seal up vertical framing like windows and trim. Do not caulk overlapping horizontal ship lap, and use a cutting tool to open already sealed, although this is tough and may not be necessary. The theory is this allows breath-ability.

, If you do not use exterior primer, the ""oxidation"" on the old paint will burn the new paint and between 1 and 2 years it will peal off. If you prime with exterior primer, the paint will last over a decade. I painted 2 homes and a duplex in 2000 with an expensive exterior primer and in 2010 I still do not have any peeling.

, Lighter paint reflects the sun; darker paint absorbs it, and tends to break down faster. Best to use 2 coats of only '100 percent acrylic', over oil base primer. Exterior latex will not last. Two coats will last longer than one. A good paint job should last ten to fifteen years. Usually like everything, the best paint costs the most money. Use big-brand, and do not buy paint from chain hardware and discount stores, since they tend to be primarily interested in profit.

Determine if your concrete house needs waterproofing.,
Prepare the walls for the coating you have selected.,
Thoroughly clean the surface of your concrete before waterproofing.,
Use a liquid membrane for quickness and economy.,
Use a self-adhering sheet membrane for consistency.,
Try out EIFS, or exterior insulated finish systems.,
Try using cementitious waterproofing.,
Opt for sodium bentonite if you want to use a non-polluting, ""green"" method of waterproofing.,
Know which walls to apply waterproofing to.,
Apply the finish system you have selected to the wall according to the manufacturer's directions.,
Apply a suitable roof sealer to your roof if you have a cast in place concrete roof.,
Remember to allow for proper drainage in addition to waterproofing measures.",How to Waterproof a Concrete House," Core-formed concrete, precast concrete panels, and ICF, or Insulated Concrete Form wall construction is essentially more waterproof than most other construction methods to begin with, meaning that it rarely needs additional waterproofing attention. That being said, the exterior walls of pre-fabbed concrete are often coated more for appearance than for weatherproofing.


If you think your structure may need waterproofing, get a general contractor you trust to give you advice. He may suggest applying a liquid membrane and not much else, or suggest filling up any cracks or joints, instead of staging an elaborate waterproofing production.;
, If you do decide to go ahead with waterproofing, nearly any technique you use will require your concrete walls to be in good standing. This means:


Caulking — to fill any expansion joints or larger cracks up to 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm), with a good quality polyurethane caulking.
Concrete patching — to fill any joints larger than 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm), making sure the concrete patch is completely dried before proceeding.
Grinding — to smooth out any rough, uneven concrete so that your waterproofing membrane or slurry has an even surface to adhere to.

, With a stiff brush, some TSP (trisodium phosphate) and some water, wash away any loose material, oil, or dirt still clinging to the concrete. Most membranes like a clean surface to adhere to. Let dry before proceeding.

, Liquid membranes are usually polymer-based coatings that can be sprayed, troweled, or rolled onto concrete directly. They have the advantage of being quick to apply and are relatively low in cost. Follow manufacturer's instructions on how to apply.


The disadvantage of liquid membranes is that they don't offer even coverage. Even if you shoot for 60 mm of coverage, the minimum recommended thickness, it's hard to achieve that consistently.

, Self-adhering sheet membranes are large, rubberized asphalt membranes that you peel and place directly onto the concrete. Sheet membranes boast even thickness, but are more expensive (in both parts and labor) than liquid membranes, and can take some time getting used to.


Self-adhering sheet membranes are extremely sticky. You need to be very diligent about peeling the membrane to expose the sticky side, because it will stick to anything it comes in contact with, and it's virtually impossible to un-stick it once it is laid.
Be sure to pay special attention to how sheet membranes overlap, as improper installation can result in the possibility for leakage. Make sure that lap joints are properly cut and that a bead of mastic is run down every lap joint that's spaced within one foot of a corner.Sheet membranes need at least two people to install. Installing them by yourself is a sure recipe for a poor job and create a lot of needless frustration for yourself.

, EIFS offers a durable, attractive, and fairly simple coating to the outside of concrete walls, doubling as insulation and waterproofing.For a stucco-like finish, an EIFS finish coat can be applied directly to the concrete, filling any voids, floating out minor irregularities, and creating a good moisture resistant surface.


EIFS are applied with a trowel, and comes in 5 gallon (18.9 L) buckets premixed and tinted to your preferred color. Float it off with a Styrofoam block or rubber float to create a uniform surface and texture. Other EIFS products may be sprayed, brushed, or rolled on with a paint roller.

, Cementitious waterproofing, aside from having a moniker that takes a mouthful, are easy to mix and easy to apply. Buy them from your local masonry supply store. Mix them with an acrylic additive for a better bond, and then apply with a long-handled brush for ease. The one downside to cementitious waterproofing is that it doesn't have any elasticity, making it prone to cracking over longer periods of time.

, Sodium bentonite is used in a lot of city dumps to prevent liquids from leeching into the underlying soil. It is essentially clay, and will act as a good waterproofing agent if you're concerned about leaving a human footprint. Bentonite also has the advantage of being able to cover smooth as well as coarser surfaces.

, Deciding which walls to waterproof and which ones to forgo can save you time, money, and headache. Here's a water-clad rule for which walls to waterproof: Waterproof any walls with soil on one side and habitable space (including crawl space) on the other. Here are some other tips to consider:


If the site or the area is especially wet (think Seattle, or the jungle), you may want to waterproof all walls.
Extend the waterproofing at least 1 foot (0.3 m) from any wall or surface that does need waterproofing to any that doesn't. You want a little bit of a buffer, just to be sure.

, Depending on the method of waterproofing you use, the manufacturer will have different suggestions and best practices. Consult the instructions of whatever product you are using, or consult a GC, for best results.

, This is an unusual situation, but there are homes with cast in place concrete roof systems, and typically, roofing cement and fiber reinforced roll roofing is applied to the roof to prevent water intrusion.


If the house doesn't have sufficient slope to allow water to drain off the roof in a rain event, you may have to apply tar or a synthetic waterproofing membrane directly to the concrete, or use a seamless rubber roofing system. These products are more suitable for professional contractors to use.

, Waterproofing won't do much if the water that jets off the walls doesn't have a good place to drain to. Consult with an expert about building a perimeter footing drain, an under drain pipe system, or even a sump pump for heavy-duty water relocation. If it's a concrete basement you're trying to drain, consult this article.

Reinstall the hardware.",How to Paint Veneer," Sanding and painting are dirty jobs that create lots of dust and fumes. For painting projects that are small and easy to move, transfer them to an outdoor location where you can work.


A garage or shed is also a great place to work if the weather won’t allow you to paint outside.;
, When you have to work inside, protect yourself from fumes by opening windows and doors to let fresh air in. You should also open vents to let the fumes escape, and turn on ceiling or stand-up fans to keep fresh air circulating.

, Protect the floor and the area around your workspace by laying down a drop cloth or large piece of plastic sheeting. If the object you're painting is too large to move, arrange the drop cloth on the floor around it and secure the sheet in place with painter’s tape.

, Veneer is most often found on furniture and interior decoration items, and these pieces sometimes have hardware like handles, hinges, and brackets. To protect these items from paint, remove them before you start the project. Most hardware can be removed with a screwdriver.After you remove the hardware and screws, store them together somewhere safe where they won’t get lost or forgotten.

, Some veneer surfaces are attached or adjacent to other surfaces that you may not want to paint. For instance, if you're painting a desk but don’t want to paint the legs, you should protect the legs.


To cover small areas, use painter’s tape to seal the area. For larger areas, cover the surface with plastic and tape the plastic in place.

, Before you paint the veneer, you have to fill in any areas where the veneer has been chipped, gouged, or dented. Remove any loose chunks of veneer and sand down the edges around each hole. Fill each hole with wood filler, and then smooth it out with a putty knife. Make sure the hole is completely filled in with putty.Let the putty dry completely before proceeding.
Follow the manufacturer’s directions regarding drying time. Depending on the depth of the holes, drying time could take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours.

, Paint won’t properly stick to a surface that’s covered in dirt, grease, oil, or grime. To ensure the paint has a clean surface, wipe the area with a degreasing cleaner, such as ammonia-based cleaners, denatured alcohol, or ½ cup (4 ounces) of trisodium phosphate mixed with ½ gallon (1.9 L) of water.Use a clean sponge or non-abrasive scrubbing pad to scrub the veneer surface with the degreaser.
After cleaning, wipe the area down with a clean damp cloth to remove leftover degreaser.
Let the surface dry completely.

, Outfit an orbital sander with 220-grit sandpaper.Sand the veneer to smooth out the wood filler, even out the surface, and gently scratch the veneer. This will give the primer something to stick to.


You can use a sanding block to sand small areas, but an orbital sander will make the job go much faster.
Use a sanding block to reach crevices and hard-to-reach areas.

, Before you start painting, it’s important to remove all traces of dust and particulates that were created by the sanding. Vacuum the piece and the surrounding area to remove excess dust, and then wipe the piece down with a slightly damp cloth.Give the surface some time to dry before priming.

, Because veneer is wood, you have lots of options when it comes to paint types. Typically, you'll start with a primer that matches the paint type, then paint the surface, and then finish with a protective clear coat, varnish, or sealant.


Popular paint types for wood include oil-based enamel paints, water-based enamel paints, chalk paint, milk paint, hi-gloss enamel, stains and varnish, and acrylic paint., Stir your primer and fill the reservoir in a paint tray. Start by using a brush to prime nooks, edges, corners, and cracks. Then, saturate a roller with primer and roll off the excess on the tray. Apply a thin and even coat of primer to the rest of the veneer surface.Once the primer has been applied, let it dry for at least three hours before applying your first coat of paint. Check the manufacturer’s instructions for exact drying time.

, Once the primer has had time to dry, you can apply the first coat of paint. Stir the paint and fill the reservoir of a clean paint tray. Use a clean brush to paint inside cracks, get into corners, and paint edges. Switch to a roller to paint the rest of the veneer. Apply a thin and even coat of paint to the entire surface.Once the first coat of paint has been applied, let it dry before deciding whether you have to paint a second coat.
If a second coat is required, follow the manufacturer’s instructions for drying time between coats.
Depending on the type of paint, you may have to wait anywhere from two to 48 hours between coat applications.

, When the final coat of paint has dried, use a clear coat, varnish, or sealant to protect the painted veneer surface. Fill a clean paint tray with clear coat. Use a brush to access cracks and corners. Use a roller or foam brush to apply a thin and even layer of clear coat to the rest of the surface.Varnish or clear coat is especially important with furniture that gets used often, such as desks, dressers, and tables.

, To remove the tape, pick off an edge with your fingernail. Pull the tape toward you at a 45-degree angle to the ground. Use a razor or knife to cut away any paint that’s stuck to the tape before removing the tape.


It’s important to remove the painter’s tape when the project is still wet. Otherwise, paint may dry to the tape and peel off with the tape, ruining your project., Your paint may be dry within a few hours, but it could take a couple weeks to cure properly. Curing is the hardening and strengthening process, and you don’t want to put your painted veneer into heavy use until the paint has had time to fully cure.


Curing time may take anywhere from a week to 30 days. Check the manufacturer’s instructions for the complete curing time of the paint you chose.

, After the paint has had time to cure, use a screwdriver to reaffix the hardware that you removed before painting. Once the hardware has been reinstalled, you can return the piece to its original place and use it again as normal.

Pour approximately 1 gallon (3.79 L) of water into the concrete mixer.,
Open the cement mix bag from the top and pour the entire contents into the cement mixer.

,
Plug in and turn on the concrete mixer to begin mixing the powder cement mix and the water together.,
Turn the concrete mixer off before pouring and leaving the machine to continue with the cement portion of your construction.

,
Pour the mixed cement into the wheelbarrow to transport to the desired construction site.,
Shovel the cement from the wheelbarrow to the necessary location for your construction.

,
Repeat the previous steps to mix the appropriate amount of cement for your construction needs.

",How to Use a Cement Mixer," Be sure to use the correct amount of water per the cement mix instructions given by your specific mix label. If there is too much water added, the cement mix will come out too thin, become unmanageable, and not dry properly. If there is not enough water, the mix will become too thick, it will not combine thoroughly, and will become unusable.;
,, If you are working in an area that is does not have power outlets nearby, you can use a generator to run your electric equipment or take the green approach and use a solar powered cement mixer. Allow the mixer to continue mixing until all of the powder is thoroughly mixed with the water and there is no cement mix dust left. Leave the cement mixer on as long as necessary to keep the cement moist and manageable. Because the cement mixer's drum is constantly rotating and the mix is continually moving, it will not able to settle and begin drying leaving it pliable.

,, Most cement mixers will tip and turn to the appropriate location in order to do this with ease.

Measure the area where you will stencil concrete to determine how long your forms must be, and how many pieces you need to cover the surface's width.,
Cut the stencils from the roll before you pour the concrete so you can place them quickly once it is formed.,
Block off the space where you will install the concrete surface.,
Pour the concrete, then screed and float it to the right level.,
Mark the center line of the concrete surface with tape.,
Lay out the lengths of stencil, starting from the center and working toward the edges.








,
Use a trowel or stencil roller to fix the stencil to the concrete to create a raised pattern.








,
Tint the exposed concrete with a color hardener.,
Apply a release agent according to the manufacturer's instructions.








,
Remove the stencil when the concrete is dry enough that the form does not adhere to the surface.,

,
Clean away the finer debris.,
Put down 2 coats of sealer according to the manufacturer's instructions.",How to Stencil Concrete,"






;
,









Stencils that are not symmetrical, such as those that mimic stone, repeat every so many inches and line up when placed side by side in the right spot.
You have the choice of cutting symmetrical stencils to align, or you can offset them.

, Cover existing flooring and structures.








,









You can use self-floating concrete to expedite this process.

,









Locate the center by measuring from the edge of the concrete surface.
Have two people, one on either side of the surface, place a length of tape through the center to the edge.

,,,









Sprinkle a color hardener over the exposed areas.
Use a bull float to float the color to the edges of the form.
Use a trowel to close the surface, or apply a decorative finish using a roller, wood, sponge or cork.
Follow the manufacturer's instructions – you may have to apply 2 coats.

,,









As you remove the stencil, you'll also pull up concrete chips and dust around the edges.

,,









For smaller surfaces, apply a muriatic acid solution to the concrete and scrub the sand away with a brush.
You can use a buffer to clean large surfaces once the concrete has had time to cure.

,









The first, lighter coat should be 15 to 20 percent acrylic.
The second, heavier coat should be 25 to 35 percent acrylic.

Remove everything from the room that you wish to seal.,
Pry the molding or baseboard from the walls using the aid of a pry bar or putty knife.,
Sweep up any debris that remains on the floor.,
Open windows and doors in the room so that it is well ventilated.

,
Degrease the concrete floors using a degreasing product.,
Scrub any particularly oily areas with a wire brush to help the excess oil emerge from the concrete.

,
Rinse the concrete surface by mopping.,
Allow the entire surface to dry completely.,
Fill any cracks or crevices with quick-drying concrete filler.,
Let the concrete filler dry for several hours as directed on the packaging.

,
Pour a small amount of concrete sealer into a painting tray.

,
Apply the sealer evenly to the floor.,
Give the sealer the proper time to dry.,
Nail the molding and baseboards back into the base of the wall and return the furnishings to the room.

",How to Seal Concrete Floors," This isn’t a project where you can segment the area.;
, Insert the pry bar or putty knife gently and pull slowly so not to crack or break any of the baseboard or moldings.

, Dirt, dust, dead bugs, nails and other materials need to be completely removed in order to prep the concrete floors for sealing.

,, The degreasing product will lift any oils that have soaked into the concrete floor over time. Simply mix the solution as instructed on the package (usually by diluting in a bucket of water) and spreading across the concrete floor using a brush or mop.

,, Simply use clean water and mop and squeeze repeatedly until the degreasing product and any dirt and debris has been removed.

, This process may take up to 24 hours. You may accelerate this process by placing dehumidifiers and fans blowing onto the concrete surface.

, This will ensure that you have created a completely level surface before sealing. Simple squeeze the filler into the cracks and smooth with a putty knife.

,,,


Use a paint brush to first seal around the edges of the room.






Use a paint roller with an extension pole to apply the sealer over the rest of the floor. Work from one corner of the room toward an exit so that you do not box yourself in.







, Usually about 12 to 24 hours. Again, this process can be aided by fans or dehumidifiers.

Clean the concrete.,
Tape off the area around the concrete.,
Apply the concrete stain.,
Seal the concrete.",How to Stain Interior Concrete," If the project involves staining a concrete floor, that means all furniture and area rugs are removed from the space. For concrete counter tops, remove all items from the counter top, and place them in another room or at least in a distant area of the same room, covering them with a drop cloth.;
, The idea is to smooth any rough spots and leave a more or less uniform face to the concrete. The sand will also remove any finishes that may already be on the surface, making it easier to stain the concrete.

, Sweep the area or use a shop vacuum to remove any loose particles. Then use the mop to apply a cleaning product that is especially formulated for use with concrete. Most brands of concrete cleaners will apply easily with a mop or a soft brush. Allow the concrete to dry before proceeding.

, When staining a concrete floor, this means using painter's tape along the baseboards of the room. If the project is staining concrete counters, use the painter's tape and butcher paper to protect the wall surface behind the counter.

, Mix the product in a basic pump style garden sprayer. Pump the stain onto the concrete using even strokes to make sure the surface is complete coated, but without creating any puddles. Allow the first round of spraying to set, and then look for any areas that are lighter than you prefer. Administer a second and even a third coat of the stain to create the look you want.

, Once the stain has set to your liking, apply a concrete sealant to the surface. A paint roller made with synthetic fiber rather than cotton fiber will make it possible to apply the sealant evenly and avoid streaking. Allow the sealant to set before attempting to move any furniture back into the area.

"

Get your supplies ready.,
Clean the surface of the concrete thoroughly.,
Patch or repair any defects in the concrete.,
Before applying the sealer make sure to stir it thoroughly but do not shake it.,
Apply the sealer with a roller or sprayer in an even pattern, making sure to avoid puddles.,
Allow the sealer time to dry before using the concrete surface.",How to Seal Concrete," You will need a broom or blower and a good concrete cleaner. For applying the sealer you will need a roller, a garden pump sprayer, or a pneumatic low pressure sprayer. You will likely want to have a good pair of rubber gloves and wear eye protection.;
, Use a good cleaner that will remove any oils, stains, or grease. Use a stiff bristled brush or broom to scrub the surface and rinse it off with a hose. For the best results, use a power washer. Before applying the sealer make sure the concrete is dry.

, Doing so after cleaning the surface makes for a smooth even substrate for the sealer to adhere to.

, Shaking the sealer may cause bubbles which can adversely affect the appearance of the sealed surface.

, This is especially important if you are using a sealer that will add color or sheen to the concrete. Make sure you complete the entire project at one time.

, This will vary according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

Once the previous step has completely dried, apply a professional grade sealer, such as CSS Emulsion.",How to Stamp Concrete with Elite Crete System's Concrete Solutions," The goal here is to remove any foreign particles in the pores of the substrate and also to remove any loose concrete.
, It is important to use a plastic sprayer as the muriatic acid will corrode metal sprayers., You should hear a light fizzle after you have applied it., The acid then ammonia wash will neutralize the ph of the concrete and also open the capillaries of the surface.,,,, Be sure to remove any puddles before apply base coat. All tool joints and expansion joints must be honer. Failing to do so may result in cracks showing on the surface some time in the future.

It is important that the first base coat is entirely dry before proceeding to this step. Once the base coat is dry you will wet the surface and apply the bond coat in the same manner as you applied the base coat.

,,, This should spread to approximately 9 to 10 m2. Use a trowel to fix the edges and a magic trowel or squeegee on a pole to fix the gauge rake application lines.

The Texture-Pave now needs to begin to cure. The amount of time this takes depends on the environmental conditions on the day, this can be anywhere from 15 minutes to 45 minutes. You can test the hardness by very lightly placing your thumb into the Texture pave no more than a few millimetres. If you can leave a mark and barley any sand sticks to your thumb you can proceed to the next step.

Procure an aluminum trash can.,
Cut draft holes into the trash can.,
Prepare the ground where you will place the garden incinerator.,
Place bricks underneath the incinerator.,
Fill the trash can with yard waste.,
Burn the yard waste in the garden incinerator.",How to Make a Garden Incinerator," The best vessel to use as a garden incinerator is the classic circular aluminum trash can that has been largely supplanted by the wheeled plastic varieties. These cans be often be purchased from home improvement stores, but used ones will work fine for use as an incinerator.;
, The can will need holes into which fresh air is drawn to feed the fire. Drill a series of holes around the circumference of the trash can, a few inches up from the bottom. These holes should be about 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter. They can be drilled using a jigsaw fitted with a metal-cutting blade or with an electric drill fitted with a hole saw bit.

, The incinerator should be located in an area with few combustible materials. This is best accomplished by finding an area of ground covered in soil, rather than with plant growth such as grass. Make sure to place the incinerator a safe distance from your house as well.

, Place a handful of bricks in a single, circular layer that will fit underneath the trash can and support it. This additional air space will keep the incinerator from heating and killing any nearby plant life, as well as providing additional circulation to feed the fire.

, After setting the trash can onto the bricks, fill it loosely with yard waste. Do not fill it more than halfway to the top. Filling your can with a majority of carbon-rich materials (such as dried leaves and dried stems) will increase the efficiency of the burn. The yard waste should also be dry to the touch before burning.

, Light the yard waste with a match and allow it to burn. If for any reason you need to stop the fire, you can place the lid onto the trash can, which will choke the fire out. Under no circumstances should you leave your garden incinerator unattended. When the fire has completely died, you can use the ashes of your yard waste as a soil amendment.

,
Allow it to dry.,
Wash the surface of the cement every year with a heavy duty cleaner.",How to Stain Concrete," Stains tend to pick up and accentuate flaws in the surface, just like wood stain does with wood knots. Keep in mind that staining is not the same as covering.


You may consider laying new concrete, if the surface is cracked and deteriorating. Hire professionals to pour the concrete.;
, Cement stain is semi-transparent and color is added and mixed just as it is with traditional house paint.


You can also buy acid stain; however, it can be more difficult to apply yourself than other concrete stains. It will also take longer to apply because you must neutralize the stain after it sets.
You can choose 2 different colors of concrete stain to create a marble effect. Use a lighter color as your base coat, and a darker color on the second coat.

, You should always test the color before applying to an entire section of concrete.


Clean the section of concrete with an industrial washing product, like TSP. Apply the stain according to package directions, usually by wetting the concrete and applying with a roller.

,, One gallon of paint will cover 200 to 400 square feet. Buy enough to do 2 coats, if you want darker, more even coverage.

, Work in 4 x 4 foot sections.

, These will show through the concrete stain.

, Move on to the next section, working across the section of concrete you need to clean.

, You need to be careful not to track on any dirt, or the stain will not be even.


Consider setting up tape or barricades during the cleaning and staining process, if you are near a public area, such as a sidewalk.

, Tape it down with painter's tape, if possible.

, You can also apply with a roller, but the paint sprayer will apply even coverage.

, Days without wind are also best for using paint sprayers.

, It should be a mist of water, light enough so that water does not gather and run, leading to an uneven application.

, Spray sections of 4 feet (1.2 m) by 4 feet (1.2 m) and then move on to the next section.


If you are using 2 different colors to create a marble effect, do not wait to apply the second coat. You can apply it immediately after the first coat.

, This is usually 24 hours.

, If so, wet the top of the stain with water and apply a second coat just as you did the first.

, Check the surface for any sections that were not fully covered. Spray them by hand.

,, Choose a time when the concrete patch is shaded.

, Use a roller with a very long handle for floor application.

, Move in 1 direction. It will be white when it rolls on, but it will dry clear.

,,, Your surface is ready to use.

, Apply new coats of sealer every 3 to 4 years.

Protect the succulents from extreme conditions.",How to Grow a Miniature Succulent Garden," You can find most if not everything you need to start your own miniature succulent garden in the garden department of your local home improvement store. This project requires at least one compact container, a few ounces of natural gardening soil, some small potting stones or pebbles and your choice of succulent plants.The average price for succulent seedlings, gardening soil and a basic planter will most likely be between $30-50.
With all your supplies in place, you can put together a miniature succulent garden in as little as 15 minutes.;
, When most people think of succulents, cacti are what spring to mind, but there are lots of other varieties to choose from. Some of the most popular if lesser-known succulents include Echeveria, aloe, cotyledon, sempervivum and agave. Choose plants that you think will be a good fit for the type of garden you have in mind.It may be worth considering factors other than just looks, as well, like the climate you live in, accessibility to sunshine around your home and how much time you’ll be able to devote to caring for the plants.Browse the succulent selection at your local greenhouse or plant nursery for even more options.

, The exact size of your succulent garden is up to you, but in order for it to meet the “miniature” description, it should probably be able to fit in something no larger than a household planter. Ceramic bowls and dishes are one more attractive option, or you could keep things simple and go with a basic flower pot. Think up some clever, unorthodox containers planters for your succulents. Miniature gardens in mason jars or fish bowls will look charming displayed throughout your home, while outdoor arrangements could be created in an unused bird feeder, wheelbarrow or even a pair of rubber gardening boots.Whatever container you settle on should encourage proper water drainage or evaporation and provide enough space between individual plants so they don’t smother each other.

, If you wish, you can lend your garden some extra visual appeal by ornamenting it with tiny statues, figurines, trellises or other novelties. This sort of flair doesn’t typically cost much more, and can be used to break up the monotony of a sea of green plants and black soil if you’re starting a garden for aesthetic purposes.Those who aren’t inclined to buy a lot of knick-knacks for their gardens can still spruce them up with found objects like seashells or wood carvings.

, Start by sprinkling pebbles into the container you’ve selected. The pebbles will provide a foundation for the potting soil and also help drain excess water which can cause succulents to die off or rot. If your planter features holes for drainage, make sure they’re not covered up by larger stones.For best results, this initial layer of stones should be at least an inch thick.When working with stones of various sizes (like those you’ve gathered yourself), put the larger stones in place first, then fill in the gaps between them using smaller rocks and pebbles.

, Shake a few ounces of soil into the planter over the pebble base. Break up the soil to keep it from clumping and becoming too dense. The soil will need to be at least an inch thick in order to hold most succulents securely and allow them to take root.Use a spoon to funnel the soil into containers with smaller openings.
Consider mixing in some sand with your potting soil. This will keep the consistency light and well-ventilated, which is beneficial to the growth and survival of succulent plants., Formulate some ideas about what you might want the general configuration of your succulent garden to look like. For instance, you might arrange tufts of senecio around a sweeping mound of kalanchoe or jovibarba, accented with brilliant Adenium blossoms. Let your imagination run wild—the layout of your garden should be a unique showcase of your personal sensibilities.Placing a few different types of succulents in close proximity will create a look of eye-catching diversity.
Plant “filler” succulents like aptenia cordifolia around the edges of the planter to act as a natural perimeter and fill out the appearance of the garden.For succulents with beautiful coloration, try ruby ball cactus, Epiphyllum, Echeveria or Queen’s Tears., Remove the plants from their existing containers carefully, brushing away any clinging soil until you expose the root ball. Use the tip of your finger to burrow into the potting soil and carefully place the succulents in the holes you made, making sure the root of each plant is nestled down deep. Pat the soil around the bulbs or stems lightly to anchor the plants.Let your succulents sit above the rim of the planter, rather than deep down within it. This will create much-needed airflow between the plants and keep water from pooling around their base.If you’re growing your succulents from cuttings or leaves, place them directly on top of the soil in rows and water them using a spray bottle., Once you’ve gotten your succulents where you want them, scatter more pebbles and larger rocks over the uppermost part of the soil. The added weight of a second layer of stones will hold the plants in place and help distribute moisture more evenly when you water them. After you’ve covered the topsoil, stick in whatever accessories or decorations you please and call it a day!A second layer of stones will also help protect against wind and water erosion.
Accent your garden with colorful glass beads or gemstones. They’ll provide the same function as pebbles, but with a more elegant and personalized appearance.

, These plants love hot, dry weather and do best when left someplace where they can bask in the sun. Make room near an uncovered window if you’re cultivating your succulents inside so that they can receive ample sunshine. If you plan on leaving the miniature garden outdoors, situate them where other plants and objects won’t obstruct their primary light source.A good rule of thumb is that succulents should get around six hours of sunlight per day.
Avoid exposing your garden to too much direct heat. Hours and hours of direct sunlight, especially in the warmer months, can be stifling even for succulents.

, As with all plants, succulents like cacti, rosularia and Aeonium need regular watering. However, they won’t require as much moisture as less hearty seasonal plants. When your succulents are young, start them with half a cup of water every few days. Pour the water in a slow trickle all around the outer area of the planter, and stop when the soil beneath the stones just begins to glisten.Ween succulents off moisture in the colder months, reducing the frequency of waterings to once every couple of weeks.Let the soil dry out completely in between waterings. While this may seem foreign to many horticulturists, most succulents favor a desert-like setting and are naturally equipped for dry spells.

, Add a small amount of nitrogen-rich fertilizer to the topsoil periodically to keep your succulent garden healthy. A good fertilizer will provide the plants with vital nutrients that will allow them to continue growing and thriving. This will be especially helpful when your plants are young, or if you live in an area with poor growing conditions.Mix a small amount of fertilizer or organic compost into the potting soil when you first plant the succulents. Spread on another thin layer every few weeks as the plants continue to grow.
Make sure that the fertilizer you apply has been approved for use with succulent species of plants.

, While they’re known for their remarkable survival skills, succulents are not invincible. Accidental overwatering from precipitation can damage or kill them, as can wild shifts in temperature. Furthermore, outdoor succulent gardens will need to be safeguarded against wind erosion and interference from natural pests like mice and predatory insects.Check your succulents weekly for signs of blight, disease and over or underwatering. The roots and stems of succulent plants that have been overwatered will become soggy and mushy, while thirsty plants quickly dry out, shrivel and lose color. Blights can manifest in many different ways, but most often appear as discoloration, mold growths or wound-like defects.Bring the plants inside if you’re expecting prolonged periods of rain or frost, or destructive weather events like tornadoes or hailstorms.

Consider the weight of the object hung by the hook.,
Determine installation hardware to be used, based on support material.",How to Install a Swag Hook1," If swag hook should fall, will someone get hurt or will an expensive piece of furniture, etc. be damaged? If a plant, consider how much heavier it will become after watering, and if over watered, will the overflow damage electrical / electronic devices below?

, A typical hook will have a threaded hole, and be provided with inserts that thread into this hole. One insert will be threaded with fine threads on one end, and wider threads and a point at the other end. This insert is designed to be used when screwed directly into wood or plastic anchor (some times called a ""molly"") that has been pressed into a drilled hole in brick, concrete, etc. (not wallboard!). An other insert is a 2 or 3 (or longer) inch threaded rod - threads running the entire length, lacking a point. It is works with a spring loaded wing-like nut, and is called a ""toggle"" (or sometimes a ""butterfly"") nut. Many manufacturers include them for different uses and identify them for use in wallboard. They are actually designed for use in hollow walls constructed of durable materials such as cinder block. They have better success when used in vertical wallboard installations for light loads, but use in ceilings should be discouraged except the very lightest loads.

"
To support a fixture or plant from a ceiling, the only method for safely installing a swag hook should be apparent as the type secured into wood.,
Locate wood strapping or joists in the ceiling nearest the desired location with a commercially available stud finder.,
Select a drill bit small enough that the resulting hole will be smaller than the thickness of the pointed end insert.,
Drill in the center of the strapping where found previously with the stud finder to a depth just longer than the pointed end threaded portion of the insert (approx 2"").

,
Thread the non-pointed end insert into the swag hook.

,
Twist the swag into the freshly drilled hole until the flange or base of the hook is pressed tightly against the ceiling.

,
Once secured fully into the ceiling, apply downward pressure (greater than the weight of the fixture / plant) on the hook to test the ""pull out"" strength.

,
If the swag pulls out - verify the location of the strapping with the stud finder again and drill another hole with a smaller drill bit nearby and reinstall the swag.,
Additional swags used to support the chain and power cord of a light fixture may be supported with the toggle bolt anywhere desired - as this weight is a small fraction of the fixture.

,
Check for the presence of strapping or joists with the stud finder where additional swags are desired.",How to Install a Swag Hook2,";
, Follow the instructions included for proper use.

, This is done by holding the threaded insert behind the drill bit - the threads should be fully visible from behind the bit. Select a smaller rather than larger bit. It is most important that not too much material be removed from the hole so that the threads can ""grab"". Larger holes provide less gripping strength than smaller holes.

,,,,, Repeat until the swag does not pull out.

,, If present, repeat the above procedure where needed.

"
"
If no studs (wall installation) or strapping or joists (ceiling) are present, the toggle method can be used.,
While holding the wings against the threaded rod, determine the diameter of a hole that would be required to push the toggle nut through.,
Drill into the ceiling only deep enough to penetrate the wallboard.

,
Squeeze the toggle nut wings against the threaded rod, and press the toggle nut into the hole completely.,
Twist the swag until the flange or base is firmly pressed against the ceiling.

,
Repeat for as many swags as needed.

",How to Install a Swag Hook3," This method requires that the threaded rod be installed into the the swag, and the the toggle nut is spun only so far that the threaded rod protrudes out of the end by about two or three threads. The toggle nut should be installed so that the wings can be depressed against the threaded rod (towards the base of the swag hook). This same method is used to suspend objects from hooks in the ceiling. When using this method for ceiling installations, only the lightest loads or ornamental type loads should be considered, as this support method is the least robust.

, Holes 1/2"" or greater are not uncommon.

,, Press the swag against the ceiling to ensure that the wings have popped open. Twist the swag hook clockwise while gently pulling downward.

,,"
"
Hang the fixture / freshly watered plant on the swag hook - keeping hands just underneath it - so it may be caught should the load prove greater that the capacity of the swag hook hardware or mount method.

,
Once satisfied the load can be safely held, connect any chain / power cord through any additional swags.

,
Check the swag regularly for indications of impending failure (bulging or cracking of ceiling around hook), and if found, take corrective action at once.

Choose your swing.,
Choose between steel chains or rope.,
Give your swing lots of space.",How to Hang a Porch Swing1," There are several types of swings available. For instance, you might choose a wicker porch swing, a metal porch swing, or a wooden porch swing. You can get porch swings in a rainbow of colors, so choose a color that suits your porch and pleases the eye.There is no functional difference associated with the different types of colors or materials of the porch swing. Your choice of swing is entirely based on your personal preference.;
, Chains of stainless or galvanized steel are the most common option. However, if you’d rather have a hanging porch swing with a more rustic look, you could use marine-grade braided nylon rope or polyester rope.Your ropes or chains will likely need to be at least seven feet long.
If you use rope, ensure it is at least ¾’’ (19 millimeters) thick.
Whatever you choose, ensure you obtain two equal lengths of each, one for each end of your porch swing.
If you choose to hang your swing with rope, check it regularly for signs of wear like fraying threads.

, You should plan on your porch swing moving through an arc that extends through about four feet of space. In other words, hang your porch swing at a spot with at least three feet of space in front and in back of it. Use a measuring tape to determine where your porch swing would fit best.If you’re hanging a prefabricated A-frame porch swing, you won’t need to look for beams and joists in your porch ceiling, but you will still need to ensure your porch is deep enough to accommodate the A-frame. Compare the frame’s depth against your porch’s before purchasing.

Buy secondhand supplies.,
Find sites to trade items.,
Look online.,
Get supplies from low-cost department stores.",How to Design a Nursery on a Budget1," Many secondhand supplies are quality. Thrift stores and garage sales often sell items that have only been used minimally. While you may want to err on the side of caution and buy new for things like cribs, other items can easily be purchased secondhand. Things like furniture, a changing table, and even some decorations can be secondhand.Be on the lookout for flyers for garage sales. You can also hit up established thrift stores in your area.
Always examine a secondhand item closely for damage before purchasing it. Some things can be easily fixed, however. A dresser with chipped paint, for example, can easily be repainted at home.;
, There are many websites specifically designed to swap items with others. You may be able to find the nursery items you're seeking here. Create an account on websites like Swap.com, FreeCycle, and ThredUp.com.Go through your home and look for items you no longer need or use. Chances are, there are many things you planned to give away, donate, or sell. These can be traded for baby or nursery supplies.
Make sure to pick high quality items of your home. People will not be happy with you if they don't receive good items in return for a trade. Choose items that have minimal damage and that you have not used much over the years. For example, try trading the extra chair at your dining room table no one ever uses.

, You can often find cheap deals online. This does not just mean secondhand items. Websites like Overstock.com sell name brand items for cheaper prices, for example. You can also sign up for e-mail lists for stores you love to wait for online sales. Sites like Craigslist and eBay often let you purchase items for cheap.Practice basic safety if you meet up with someone online to make a purchase. Meet in a public place and, if possible, bring someone else with you.

, Not everything you purchase needs to be a name brand. While you should invest in quality items for supplies like your child's crib or changing table, go for low-cost department store items for other nursery supplies. A low-cost lamp, dresser, or bookshelf will likely hold up fairly well. You can save some money by shopping at somewhere like Target or Walmart to get these kinds of items."

Attach the swing hooks.,
Drill screw-eyes into unfinished porch ceilings.,
Use eyebolts in homes with finished ceilings.",How to Hang a Porch Swing2," If your porch swing didn’t come with swing hooks, you’ll need to attach some. The precise location where you’ll need to attach the swing hook depends upon the design of your porch swing.Generally, you should locate the point where the vertically-oriented front of the armrest intersects with the horizontally-oriented front-most edge of the actual seat. Install one swing hook facing out from the side of the porch swing, then install another at the corresponding point on the opposite side of the swing.
Place the next two swing hooks on the porch swing at two points located at the same height as the swing hooks you’ve already connected, but place them toward the rear of the seat where the seat intersects the back.
Drill pilot holes before screwing the swing hooks into the porch swing itself. Use a drill bit with a diameter just a bit smaller than that of the pointed end of the swing hook to drill your pilot hole. This is an important step that can prevent your porch swing from splintering.
When you’re ready, screw the swing hooks into the porch swing by hand.

, The screw-eye is a metal loop. After installing two screw eyes, you’ll loop the rope or chain attached to the arms of the swing into it. Drive your screw-eye into a thick beam or joist at the place you wish to locate your porch swing.Locate a thick beam or joist (at least two inches wide and five inches thick) that can support a screw-eye.
Once you’ve located the joist or beam where you wish to install your porch swing, drill a pilot hole into it with a drill at the point from which you wish to hang the porch swing. This is an important step that can prevent your beam from splintering.
Turn the eye-screw into the hole as far as it will go, then pass a screwdriver through the circle of the eye-screw so that its central point is just below the hole into which you drove it.
Place one hand on the handle of the screwdriver and place one hand on the other end of the screwdriver. Push up hard with the screwdriver against the eye-screw to jam it tightly into its hole.
Install another screw-eye in another joist or beam at a distance from the first that is roughly equivalent to the length of the porch swing.
Use screw-eyes with a four-inch shaft and a socket with a diameter that can accommodate the rope or chain you’ve selected to hang your porch swing.

, In homes with finished porch ceilings, you won’t be able to use a screw-eye. Instead, you’ll use an eyebolt. Cut away part of the roof above the porch swing to access the joists and beams that can support the eye-screw.Predrill a hole through the joist. The drill tip should come out straight through the ceiling of your porch.
Slide a six-inch machine-threaded eyebolt up through the porch ceiling and have a friend on the other end (on the porch roof) secure it with a nut.
Install another eyebolt in another joist or beam at a distance from the first that is roughly equivalent to the length of the porch swing.
Repair the roof when finished.
This technique is most common in older homes.

Hang the swing.,
Test your swing.,
Attach comfort springs.",How to Hang a Porch Swing3," Connect a rope or chain to the front swing hook, then loop it up through the corresponding eyebolt or screw-eye on your porch ceiling. Connect the end of your rope or chain to the second swing hook on the same side of the porch swing that you connected the other end of your rope or chain.For instance, if you’re facing your porch swing and attempting to hang it, connect a chain to the front-left swing hook, loop it through the eyebolt, then connect the end that passed through the eyebolt onto the swing hook located at the back-left of the swing porch.
Repeat on the opposite side.
If your porch swing is heavy, have a friend help you lift the porch swing up to the height at which you wish to hang it before attaching it to the ceiling.

, Give it a push. If it moves properly back and forth, you’ve succeeded in hanging your porch swing. If you find that one end is not quite even with the other, leading to an off-kilter appearance, adjust the chain’s location on one or the other sides.For instance, if the right side of your porch swing is lower than the left, you’ll need to shorten the length of chain connecting the two swing screws on the right side.
Alternately, you could extend the length of chain between the two swing screws on the left side so that it sits lower.

, For an extra-smooth porch swing experience, attach comfort springs to each eyebolt or screw-eye, then attach your chain to the end of comfort spring. The comfort springs provide a bit of bounce on your porch swing and make its motion more fluid."

Choose stripes for the wall.,
Create one focal point.,
Encourage DIY decorations.,
Use toys as decorations.,
Go for decorative storage.,
Use personal decorations.",How to Design a Nursery on a Budget2," Stripes are a simple, baby-friendly design that are easy to create yourself with some paint and paint strips. Lay the paint strips over the wall to paint on your first shade. Let this shade dry completely and then fill in the bare spots with your second color. This is a quick, easy, low-cost design that works great for a nursery., The busier you make your decorations, the more expensive they'll be. Focusing in on a single focal point can save you money. Instead of having many decorations spread across the room, pick something like a large area rug for the center of the room. This will draw attention to a single spot in the room, making it look decorative while saving you money on excess decorations.Look for cheaper items for your focal point as well to save even more money. Check secondhand stores and discount websites to find the centerpiece you want.

, If you don't have a lot of money to spend on professional supplies, decorate on your own. Even if you're not artistically inclined, things like stencils are easy enough to use.If you want a decorative dresser, for example, buy one secondhand. Paint it yourself and then stencil on the designs you want.
Use chalkboard paint. You can use colorful chalk to draw any designs you want. As your baby gets older, they'll be able to experiment with painting and drawing on the wall.

, When you're having a baby, you may receive a lot of toys your baby is not old enough to use. While you're waiting for the toys to be safe for your baby, use them as decorations. This will save you money buying knick-knacks for shelves and drawers.Fill in bare spots in your bookshelf with stuffed animals. For example, a stuffed owl could be placed on the bookshelf.
Place things like figurines, plastic dolls, and action figures on mantels and dressers.

, You can save on buying decorative items by doubling up and making your storage devices decorations. Go for things like decorative baskets, shelves, and floor storage. This can spruce up the room and add a splash of color without making you go over-budget on expensive decorations.You can also paint duller items in your nursery. For example, a yellow dresser can brighten up a room. Try painting a neutral-color piece of furniture in a bright, kid-friendly shade.

, Your decorations do not have to come from a store. You can fill the nursery with personal decorations. Hang up family photographs. If you have other children, have them make artwork for the new baby.Feel free to get creative. Make a collage, for example, of family photos.
Arrange family photos and mementos in a frame, using decorative paper for the background.

Opt for minimal crib bedding.,
Use a bookshelf for a dresser.,
Look for pieces you can keep long term.",How to Design a Nursery on a Budget3," You don't need to splurge on fancy bedding for your baby's crib. You can stick to plain colored sheets and blankets over decorative colors, which may be more expensive. If you can't afford a large printed blanket, go for four smaller printed blankets.Make sure any bedding you get is baby safe. You can save money by foregoing things like extra decorations while still buying from a reputable company.

, Dressers can be pricey, but many stores sell bookshelves for relatively cheap. If a dresser is out of your budget, get a bookshelf instead. Fold and stack your baby's clothing in this shelf.If you want a little more organization, invest in baskets and storage bins. You can use these to separate your baby's toys and clothes.

, You can save money by thinking ahead. Do not buy items exclusively for a baby's room. Look for items that will age along with the child. For example, a dresser with cutesy cartoon animals may not fit in a nine-year-old's room. However, a brightly colored dresser with something like stripes or polkadots will still be acceptable as your baby gets older."

Have fun watching your garden grow!",How to Build Raised Vegetable Garden Boxes1," When you have decided the place, position the box, and dig out holes for the corner post. These posts can simply be placed on top of the soil or they can be rooted in the ground several inches or more. This is up to your preference. Just plan ahead;
, Use 4x4 pieces of lumber. These will be used for the corners of the boxes. Cut them to be at least the same height or several inches deeper than the box. If your boxes are going to be longer than 8', you will want add to center posts on the long sides.

, Using 2x4s, cut boards for the two long sides, equal to the distance from the far edge of one corner post to the far edge of the other. Cut the short end boards to be equal to the distance between the far edges of the posts, plus the ends of the long side boards.

, Use outdoor appropriate screws; 1""-1 1/2"" or decking screws work well. Drill through the boards directly into the posts.

, Once the box is set, line the box with 1/2"" hardware cloth to keep out pests and varmint. Staple or screw the hardware cloth to the sides.

, Next, place some weed cloth on top of the hardware cloth. Staple that to the sides of the box. This is to keep the weeds from growing from below.

, Bring in some planting mix for soil. It is usually measured in cubic feet. Use a wheelbarrow or park close to the box and start filling it up. Stand on it to pack it down. Leave about 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the top.<

, Make sure to fertilize the soil or rotate types of plants in the boxes to keep the soil fresh. Plan to grow plants that suit the season of the year as well.

Decide how you want to cover your gazing ball.,
Obtain a bowling ball or round light cover.,
Clean your gazing ball.,
Apply two coats of white paint primer.,
Apply two coats of a spray paint of your choice.,
Glue your materials to the surface of the ball.,
Place your gazing ball in the garden or on a stand.",How to Make a Garden Gazing Ball1," You can cover your gazing ball with a variety of things including pennies, glass marbles, gems, or crushed tinted glass. Decide on what would go best with your landscaping and garden, and choose a material that compliments it. Make sure to consider the material's colors when creating your gazing ball.


If you’re going for a lighter, colorful garden, turquoise glass gems make the perfect material.
Lighter weight materials like coins or gems may be easier to attach to your gazing ball.
If you’re going for a more rustic look, try finding flat stones in your garden.;
, Go to a department or thrift store to try to find a globe light cover. Some light covers will come with a fixture that can double as a gazing ball stand. If you can't find a round light cover, you can find an old bowling ball at a thrift shop, garage sale, or a bowling alley., Use soapy warm water to clean your round light cover or bowling ball. Use a rag or sponge and then thoroughly rinse and dry it off. You can also use rubbing alcohol or water and vinegar to wash your bowling ball., Spray paint primer will improve the spray paint’s cohesion and will help bring out the vibrant colors in your spraypaint.Apply two light coats of primer instead of one thick coat. Once you're done spraying your primer, allow it to dry.


Drying should take around an hour.
Two light coats of primer will prevent your paint from dripping later on.

, When considering what color to paint your gazing ball, determine the color and type of materials that you are using to cover it. Use a color that will blend in with the materials that you will attach to your ball. Do not use colors that clash or that stand out. Once you’re done painting your ball, allow it to dry before moving onto the next step.


For example, dark blue and purple stones look best when your orb is painted black.Brown may be good color for a gazing ball that uses stones from the garden.

, Because you’re gluing heavy stones to a smooth object, regular glue is not suitable for this step. Use a strong adhesive like epoxy or super glue and attach your covering materials to your ball.Apply the glue to the flat side of the material you’re using and press the material against the ball.


Work from one point on the ball and make a full ring around the ball if you want to keep your lines symmetrical.
When going for a rustic or artistic look, you can lay your stones asymmetrically.

, Allow the glue to dry thoroughly before putting it outside. Try to find a place in your garden that will accent the plants and flowers around it. If you used a lighter material like a round lamp cover and want to place it on a stand, you should attach it to your base using an adhesive, so that it doesn’t fall and break.

Take precautions before you start.,
Store properly.",How to Use Cement Additives1," Most cement additives are non-flammable and non-hazardous in normal use but sensible precautions should be taken when using them in much the same way as when using cement which is an alkaline product.


Avoid skin contact as much as possible. If contact does occur or if liquid is accidentally splashed in the eyes wash out thoroughly in clean water. You should wash anyway after using cement and additives, before eating or allowing hand to mouth contact.
Should any liquid be swallowed, seek medical advice immediately

, All additives should be stored in a frost free place within the temperature range 5° - 30° C.

If you’re looking to save money, you may be able to find a ball for as low as $5. Look for bowling balls that have the holes closer together so that they are easier to hide., Use soapy warm water, glass cleaner, or rubbing alcohol to clean the surface of your ball. If you don’t wash your ball, dust and debris will get caught under the paint and ruin its smooth finish. Dry your ball with a rag or cloth once you get all of the dust off of it.

, Prime your bowling ball in paint primer to help the spray paint to adhere to the ball. A latex primer may be the best type of primer you can get for a bowling ball because it will prevent cracking and peeling of your paint.If you’re keeping your garden gazing ball outside, do not skip the step.

, Go to a craft store or look online for chrome colored metallic spray paint. Before you begin spraying, make sure to lay down a tarp, shower curtain, or large trash bag so that spray paint doesn't get on the floor.


Spray paint your ball outside.
Wear protective face gear so that you do not inhale spray paint., Putting your gazing ball outside in the elements too early can damage it or cause the paint to prematurely peel. Test the surface of the gazing ball with your hand to see if it transfers paint onto your hand. If the surface feels moist, wait until it feels totally dry.

Pun or vibrate the concrete.,
Understand the effect of the additive.",How to Use Cement Additives2," To achieve the greatest resistance, it is essential that concrete is well punned or vibrated to eliminate trapped air.;
, It is to 'plasticise' the mix, reducing the amount of gauging water required, giving the mix additional strength and flexibility to prevent it cracking or crazing during a more controlled drying out period. It provides a compact easily worked mix when wet with a smoother hard wearing, less dusty surface when dry.


The improved adhesion of the mix helps considerably when used for mortar rendering purposes. The liquid can be used with all types of Portland Cement, but not with high alumina cements. It is simply mixed with water 1:30 and added to the cement/aggregate mix as the gauging water to the required consistency.

"
"
Use a mortar plasticizer.,
Add the plasticiser to the gauging water at a rate of 1⁄5 liter (0.1 US gal) of plasticiser to 20 liters (5.3 US gal) of water.",How to Use Cement Additives3," It has all the advantages of lime and none of the disadvantages. This liquid admixture plasticises a cement/sand mix using less gauging water than usual, giving an easily workable 'fatty' mortar with strong adhesion. It has a reasonably fast initial setting period but leaves ample time for the adjustment of bricks.


When dry the mortar with added plasticiser is more resistant to the effects of frost than a standard cement/sand/lime mix.

,


It is normal practice to mix sufficient plasticiser and water in a large tub to provide a uniform strength for several mixes of cement and sand.
As a rough guide, you will need to mix in 0.28 liters (0.1 US gal) of plasticiser with water for every 50Kg of cement.

Allow to self-mix.",How to Use Cement Additives4," The granules have a self-mixing action simply by being added to a dry mortar or concrete mix, then turned over in the normal way before the gauging water is added. The amount of colourant used will affect the shade produced so a careful check must be kept when mixing successive batches that the same quantity is used each time. As a guide, 2-10kg per 100kg of cement is recommended.


Note that shading is affected by the colour of aggregates used.
Cement Dyes are made from synthetic oxides, complying with BS 1014.

Add a concrete dustproofer and surface hardener.,
Pour the dust-proofer in the concrete.,
Add more if needed.",How to Use Cement Additives5," It is a ready-to-use alkaline solution of tough silicate material which combines with softer lime-free particles in conventional concrete mixes to form a harder surface which resists wear and dusting.


It can be used on old concrete in basically good condition or on new concrete laid at least 14 days before.

, Provided the concrete is clean and free from surface water, the dust-proofer is simply poured onto the floor and spread out with a soft broom, then left to dry for 40 minutes. The floor is then washed with clean water.

, On very porous floors a second or third coat should be applied with 40-60 minutes between coats.


Ponding should be removed after 10 minutes. 40-60 minutes after the final coat the floor should be washed with clean water.
When coloured pigments have been used on concrete or granolithic flooring, it is advisable to test treat a small area first to check that Dustproofer has no adverse effects on the colour.

Place sheeting down for summer laying.,
Take precautions with winter laying.,
Use with the correct cement.,
In winter, the gauging water should be at temperature of not less than 20°C particularly when the air temperature is close to zero.",How to Use Cement Additives6," In very hot weather where concrete has been laid in direct sunlight, polythene sheeting or damp sacking should still be placed over the surface to prevent the top drying out at a faster rate than the remainder.

, In winter, the concrete will still harden much more quickly than usual and is protected against sudden temperature drops but you should still take the precautions generally associated with cold weather concreting, such as laying polythene sheeting covered with sacks, expanded polystyrene or a similar insulant over the concrete to preserve the heat generated during the drying process.

, Frost Proofer and Rapid Hardener should only be used with ordinary and rapid hardening Portland Cement. It should not be used with high alumina cements, sulphate resistant cements, extra rapid hardening Portland Cement, lime mortars or in mixes intended for steam curing. The admixture which contains calcium chloride should also not be used in steel reinforced concrete or for pre-stressed concrete work.


The admixture is added to gauging water at the rate of 1.7 liters (0.4 US gal) for each 50 Kg of cement.

, When mixed and laid the concrete should be no colder than 10Â°C. At no time should the component parts of the mix be allowed to become frozen.

"
"
Use internally or externally.,
Add the admixture to the gauging water at a ratio of 1 part admixture to 30 parts water.

,
Calculate at 500–1,000 milliliters (16.9–33.8  fl oz) per 50kg of cement.

",How to Use Cement Additives7," Generally used for exterior rendering, it can also be used internally for making good after the installation of injected damp proof courses.

Avoid placing stuffed animals or toys inside the crib.",How to Design a Minimalist Nursery," It is easy to clutter a baby’s room with toys and tools that they do not need. For a minimalist design, you should decide ahead of time what types of furniture you need in the room. Only write down the bare necessities.A crib is the most important item in the room. You should look for a crib with a high safety rating that can potentially be used for future children as well. It should be sturdy but stylish, with sleek lines.
A rocking chair glider will be the centerpiece of the room. It should be comfortable but sturdy. If you’re planning on having more children, you should make sure it is a neutral color that can fit into the décor of any room.A changing table and dresser will be necessary. You can buy a changing table built into a dresser or a separate attachment that can be placed on top of a dresser.
You will want enough storage for your baby’s toys, clothing, diapers, and other necessities but not so much that it clutters the room. Consider storage bins, shelves, and hanging storage.;
, Before you begin, start looking through design books, magazines, and websites for tips and ideas about nursery designs. If you find an idea you like, save it for later. Decide what it is you like about the design. Does it have a pleasing color palette? Are there particular pieces of furniture that stand out to you?


Design websites, such as House and Garden or Parents may have galleries of pictures.
Pinterest is a popular place for people looking for nursery ideas.

, A single unifying theme for the room can help you pick furniture and décor that go together well. If you do not want one overwhelming theme, you can also choose a few motifs to guide your design instead.If you’re struggling to find a theme, think of one or two words that you want to describe your nursery. Some ideas include:


Geometric shapes
Ocean
Animals
Stars
Tranquil and serene

, A good color palette can help make your nursery interesting and eye-catching. A good minimalist palette will have a neutral or semi-neutral base. If you want more colors, add it with bold accent pieces.


Gray, white, and black are the best base colors for a minimalist palette.When deciding on accent colors, you might want to choose two or three colors. These colors may also be the same type of color tone, such as pastels, earth tones, or jewel tones.
Colors do not need to be based on the baby’s gender. You can always design a nursery with neutral colors or non-gendered hues, such as orange or yellow.

, On a piece of paper, draw the shape of the nursery. Be sure to measure the nursery on each side so you understand how much space you have. Mark where the windows, doors, and closets are. Draw in each piece of furniture where you think it will look best. Erase and move around furniture until you have a design that appeals to you.


You can use blue painter’s tape to help you visualize the furniture inside of the room. Outline with the tape places where you want the furniture to go. Move the tape around as it suits you., Friends and family members may want to give toys, clothing, or other extra, unneeded items that can clutter the nursery. Tell them that you are planning on staying minimalist and only buying what you need. If you are willing to receive gifts, sign up for a registry at local baby stores, and register only for what you need.


You can say, ""We are designing a minimalist nursery for the baby. This means that we're only buying what we need for the baby so that the nursery does not become cluttered.""
If you have a registry, you can say, ""If you want to get something for the baby, we have a registry at ABC Baby Store that can tell you what we need.""

, While you may want to maintain a minimalist look, babies will require quite a few things as they grow older, including diapers, wipes, clothing, bottles, sippy cups, and toys. To keep the room looking neat, you should try to find different storage options that allow these objects to be tucked away out of sight.Some items include:


A dresser that also serves as a changing table
Hanging storage in the closet
Cube shelves with removable bins
Boxes or drawers that slide beneath a crib

, For a minimalist look, you should find pieces that have sleek lines or rounded edges. Find furniture that does not have overwhelming design elements, such as brightly painted patterns or branded characters. You can add these elements through accent pieces.Think about what the baby needs now. While the baby may grow up to need different toys or furniture, you can wait until they are the appropriate age to buy them those things.

, If you have already decided on the color palette, you can look for objects that provide a pop of color to the room. These accents can be decorative objects such as pictures, toys such as stuffed animals or practical pieces such as blankets.


While you can choose colorful curtains for the room, you will need to make sure that they at least have a blackout liner to prevent too much light from getting in when your baby is napping.Crib liners are a good way of adding some color to the room. You will need many different options, as these can easily be ruined. Pick a few different designs for variety.
If you have wood floors, you should invest in a rug. It should be plush, such as a wool or shag rug, but make sure that the pile is short rather than long.Wall art can provide interesting statement pieces without cluttering the room. You can put up wall stickers, framed prints, or a mural.
A mobile can add an interesting touch while giving the baby something to look at. Choose ones with high contrast colors. You can buy one or make your own.

, You may not find minimalist furniture for your nursery in every baby store, so you may need to shop around. You can look both online and in stores to find the right pieces. Start early in the pregnancy to make sure that you have plenty of time to find the pieces that you want. Some places you can look for minimalist furniture include:


Ikea
Wayfair
Houzz
Buy Buy Baby

, Before you move the furniture in, you should paint the walls. Generally, the wall color will be the base color from your palette. White or gray walls are popular, or you could do an off-white, such as a cream or light yellow.


Wallpaper is another option for the walls.If you want a mural in the room, now is the time to paint it.

, Once you have bought the furniture, you can start arranging it in the room. You might find that the furniture you chose doesn’t work with your original floor plans. Rearrange the furniture until it suits you.


If you are pregnant, you may want to ask your partner or another person to help you with moving and arranging the furniture.

, If you need more storage, you do not have to go out and buy more bins. Instead, build floating shelves into the wall. You can buy shelves from a furniture store or make your own. You can use these shelves for books or toys. You can also use them to place lotions, bottles, and other objects that you want to keep out of the baby’s reach., While it may look cute to put stuffed animals or a blanket in the crib, you should not have any objects where the baby sleeps. All the baby needs is a crib mattress. Blankets and pillows in the crib can actually increase the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).You can drape a blanket on the rocker or glider instead.
Put stuffed animals on a shelf or window sill.

Determine the application.,
Acquire the right tools.,
Purchase the paint.,
Painting is much the same process as with latex, but the drying time for alkyd paints is longer, and the need for ventilation is greater.,
Before the final coat of paint, sand with a very fine grit sanding sponge or paper, wipe off the surface with a clean cloth, and then wipe with a tack rag.",How to Know when to Use Oil Based Paint Instead of Latex," Alkyd paint is best used for cabinetry, exterior trim, interior trim, doors, kitchens, high-moisture bathrooms, and anywhere a rich, semi-gloss or full gloss look is desired.;
, Most of the time, homeowners will use a brushed finish for a traditional painted look. This requires a high quality china bristle brush (the kind with the black bristles), or a synthetic brush that is advertised for oil-based finishes and paints. For most job a simple 2"" or 2 1/2"" cut-in (i.e., diagonal bristle) brush will work, but if you will be painting window mullions you will want a smaller 1"" sash brush. A small paint can that is comfortable to hold is helpful, because you don't want to be dipping the brush into the can that the paint comes in (to avoid contamination with dirt, hair, loose bristles, etc). And a couple of jars for cleaning up with mineral spirits (AKA paint thinner) and for re-using the old mineral spirits. For most homeowner jobs, a pint of mineral spirits will suffice for clean-up.

, Most paint stores sell oil-based paints, but some of the big box home centers don't because it isn't as familiar with the DIY market. Sometimes alkyd enamel is sold under the heading of ""industrial rust preventative"" or some such wording, but it is the same stuff.

, As with latex, two coats over a primer is standard. The primer can be oil or water based primer, but if the paint color is dark you should have the paint store tint the primer the approximate color of the paint.

, This will keep imperfections out of the final finish.

Use a raw crystal as a centerpiece.,
Place gemstones in a display case.,
Use them as planters.,
Buy a vase with gemstones.,
Put out a mineral lamp.",How to Decorate Your Home with Gemstones1," A crystal can be the focal point of a room. Buy a large, raw crystal or other mineral that appeals to you. Keep in mind that they can be costly. Once you have chosen the crystal, place it on the center of a table in whatever room you’d like. The living room or a sitting area is an ideal place. You can put the crystal directly on the table, or put it on a tray.The crystal doesn’t have to be overwhelmingly big. It just needs to be big enough to attract attention.;
, Turn your gemstones into art. Make the gemstones unique and noticeable by placing them in glass display cases. You can find display cases at many arts and crafts stores and interior design stores. You can choose plan glass display cases or one that are lined in silver or gold. Make sure the case is big enough to easily fit over the gemstone.Some popular gemstones you can choose to display are citrines, aquamarines, emeralds, and rubies.
You can put one large, gemstone in a case or several small ones.

, Make both your plant and mineral more interesting by using the mineral or gemstone as a planter. You can buy a mineral that is made to be a planter, or you can use a raw mineral that has a hole big enough to put the plant inside of it. Succulents typically work and look best with mineral planters.Amethyst crystal planters are popular and fairly easy to find.

, Display your flowers in a mineral, rock, or gemstone planter. A smooth, polished vase looks best as far as mineral or rock vases. For gemstone vases, it is easier to find a simple vase with gemstones attached to it. For example, you can find a gemstone with a selection of small gemstones, like, turquoise, attached to it. You can put the vase out as the centerpiece on a table, or place it on a side table.

, Use a mineral in an unexpected way by buying a mineral lamp. You can buy a classy and graceful lamp with a polished mineral base, like marble, or a raw mineral that has been attached to vase. You can find traditional lamps, or a table lamp for your desk."

Use gemstone coasters.,
Replace your drawer pulls.,
Put out rock or mineral coat hooks.,
Buy mineral bookends.",How to Decorate Your Home with Gemstones2," Coasters are a great way to decorate your home with gemstones in a subtle way. Buy several coasters to place around a room. You can buy gemstones that have been cut and polished, like rose quartz. Or, you can make a gemstone coaster by yourself by gluing gemstone to the side of a plain coaster. Using real gemstones can be costly, so you can find fake gemstones to attach to the coaster at art and crafts stores.You could glue some flat gemstones to the top of a coaster, but round gemstones would make the top uneven and wouldn’t support a drink well.

, Gemstone drawer pulls are unique and classy. You can choose one room, like the kitchen to replace the drawer pulls, or you can replace the drawer pulls on a bedroom dresser. Choose smooth and round gemstones, or rough minerals.For polished gemstones, you can use turquoise or pearl. For rough minerals, you can use crystal.

, Using mineral coat hooks is a great way to add an organic quality to your home in a very subtle way. The entire coat hook does not have to be made of mineral. Instead, you can find coat hooks that have a mineral attached to it—like quartz. If you prefer to use gemstones, you can make your own by gluing one or multiple gemstones, like rubies, to a coat hook., Using bookends made of minerals can be subtle to obvious, depending on how you use them. If you want to use them in a subtle way, put a few books in between the bookends within a bookshelf. For a more obvious use, place some of your favorite books between the bookends in the center of a table.


Quartz bookends dipped in gold are a great way to achieve an organic and classy look.

Put together a seasonal altar.,
Create a purely decorative altar.,
Set up a meditation altar.,
Make a remembrance altar.",How to Decorate Your Home with Gemstones3," Not all altars have to be used for spiritual reasons. You can also use them for decorative reasons. One way to display is altar is by redecorating it for every season. Choose a high table or a prominent space in your home. Put out things like gemstones, minerals, rocks, flowers, ribbons, and whatever you think represents the season.For fall, put out gemstones in colors like green, red, orange, and black, fake seasonal vegetables, and any other items that are representative of fall for you. Rubies and onyx are good to use for fall.
For winter, put together light colored gemstones, items representative of the winter holiday you celebrate, and white glittery ribbons. Pearls and turquoise are good to use for winter.
For spring, set out out pastel colored gemstones, fresh flowers, and items that remind you or renewal and growth. Rose quartz and moonstones look nice for a spring altar.
For summer, put out things like earthy colored gemstones, like topaz and jade, and sunflowers.

, The altar doesn’t have to be representative of anything. Instead, you can use the altar as a decorative part of your home that is reflective of the current interior space. Choose gemstones and minerals in the colors you use in your home. Choose items that fit in with the current décor.For example, if you have a cottage themed home, put out items that remind you of the woods or beach.

, Set aside a space for your home for meditation. Meditation is a great way to reduce stress and achieve a clearer mind at the beginning or end of your day. Choose a space in your home that is usually quiet, like your bedroom, or with a space that gets soft, natural light. Put out some gemstones that appeal to you, candles, and any other items you’d like to focus on while meditating.Some gemstones are thought to influence your energy and aid meditation. A couple of those gemstones are amethyst and rose quartz.

, Set aside a space in your home dedicated to remembering loved ones that have been lost. Put out fresh flowers, mementos that remind you of the loved one(s), photos, and gemstones, like crystal, turquoise, and citrine."

Learn the purpose of primer.,
Learn the purpose of undercoat.,
Decide on your paint type.",How to Tell the Difference Between Different Types of Paint," Primer is used to cover porous surfaces, to provide a barrier between the surface and the remaining coats, so that the paint is not soaked up by the surface. Typical porous surfaces it is used on include: new plaster, bare wood, unpainted metal, etc.;
, Undercoat is used over the primer. It's the coat to add before you add the main color. Depending on the brand purchased, it may be specially tinted or have certain protective properties you need for the surface or area being painted. Most paints require undercoat even if primer has not been needed. Some types of paint may claim that there is no need for an undercoat but generally it ensures a smoother finish if used.

, There are different types of paint that you can apply and each one will provide a specific kind of finish:


Water based paint: This paint tends to be used for walls and paints a flat surface. It can also be used for other painting work, as indicated by the container instructions. The great thing about this paint is the ease of clean-up - simply wash out with water. This paint is often low VOC (volatile organic compounds) these days, making it easy on your respiratory system.






Stain or semi-gloss paint: This provides a sheen finish. It is best used to highlight specific features or rooms. It's also suitable for high traffic areas. It can be either water-based or oil-based. If oil-based, you'll need to take greater effort cleaning up afterward.






Gloss: Gloss paint is hard-wearing and is usually used for wooden areas such as skirting boards and window surrounds. This one is usually oil-based and requires mineral turpentine to wash the brushes.






Non-drip. This is an alternative to gloss. It has a gel-like consistency and it won't drip when using, making it a great choice for painters who find this aspect of painting troublesome.

"
Determine if the paint is from 1970 or earlier.,
Talk to the owner of the home, or the previous owners.,
Check if the paint is deteriorating.",How to Identify Lead Paint1," Most homes built before 1970 often have lead-based paint on the walls, doorways, stairwells, and baseboards. If your home is old and you know it was built in the early or mid 1900s, it may have lead-based paint.Often, historic buildings or homes that are old and have not been renovated contain lead-based paint.;
, If you do not own the home and are a renter, talk to your landlord about the age of the home. Ask them if they know if there is lead-based paint in the home. If you own the home, contact the previous owners to find out if they know if there is lead-based paint in the house., Examine the paint in the home to determine if it is peeling, flaking off, or deteriorating in any way. If it is lead-based, this may be cause for alarm. Lead-based paint that is deteriorating can pose a health hazard, as it will release lead dust as it breaks down.Pay extra attention to paint that is on doorways or stairwells. These areas usually get more wear and tear, causing the paint to crack, flake, and peel.
If you notice the paint is deteriorating and suspect it may be lead-based, test the paint so you can address the issue immediately.

Let it dry for a day.",How to Decorate Garden Stones," Virtually any type of stone will work well for this project, so focus more on its condition, rather than what type it is. Favor those with smooth, rounded surfaces. Avoid chipped, broken, or jagged ones.Don’t limit yourself to stones with “perfect” shapes, like exact circles. Be on the lookout for oddly shaped stones that suggest designs uniquely suited to them, like a snowman or the Cheshire cat from Alice in Wonderland.
Waterways are ideal places to find stones that have been worn smooth by currents. However, be careful about where you look, since public parks may forbid removing them.
If you can’t find any available in the great outdoors, visit a local craft or gardening store, which often carry them.;
, Expect paint brushes to wear out pretty fast when used on something as rough and hard as a stone. Save your money and leave expensive sets on the shelf. Buy a cheap set that offers a variety of sizes.If not already included in the set, also buy some wide, flat brushes to paint your background (or any other element covering a large surface area) in addition to the smaller brushes for your detail work.
A paint palette is also advised if you're going to be using lots of different paints and shades, rather than just one or two colors.
The longer the bristles, the better, since these will hold more paint and last longer.

, If you are painting stones to add a touch of color to your garden or lawn, expect them to suffer more abuse over time from the sun and weather. Choose the right materials for the job. Favor paints designed specifically for exterior use. Then seal them with a spar urethane sealer for more protection from the elements., If, on the other hand, your plan is to bring the outdoors in and raid your garden for stones to paint and place inside your home, use any acrylic, craft, or water-based paint. Then apply a coat of Mod Podge or acrylic spray for a sealant.Of course, there's no harm in using materials meant for exterior use here. So if you have some handy, feel free to use them instead.

, This step isn't strictly necessary, so feel free to skip it if you're just looking to have fun and aren't too concerned about the finished product. However, if you prefer perfection, practice your design on a sketchpad. Then use tracing paper to copy it, which you can then use to trace the outline on your stone. Additionally, expect the stone's natural shade to possibly affect the paint's color after drying, so dab your paints on a test stone with a similar shade to see what happens., If you’re using stones that you found outside, wash them first. Don’t worry about special cleaners. Just wash them in warm water and soap to remove any dirt that might muck up your paint or stick to your bristles. Rinse them off with more water and then either let them air-dry, pat them down with a towel, and/or use a hair dryer to get rid of the moisture.Store-bought stones should be relatively clean and ready to go, but washing them to get rid of any dust won’t hurt either.

, Use a wide flat brush to apply your background color with minimal effort. Start your first coat on whichever side you choose: the back of the stone or its face. Let it dry completely before flipping the stone over and painting the other side. Once that side has dried, repeat the process with a second coat to minimize any alteration in color that the stone’s natural color may cause by bleeding through the paint. Expect drying times to vary depending on temperature, humidity, the type of paint used, and how much.When flipping the stone over to paint a new side, make sure any paint that may have dripped onto your dropcloth has dried as well. If necessary, replace your worktable’s protective covering with a fresh one.

, If you’re going to paint your rock freehanded, feel free to skip this step. Otherwise, use a pencil or fine-point marker to copy your design onto the stone (or, if you’re simply painting a bunch of squares in various colors, you can use painter’s tape to outline the first to be painted). For now, only worry about copying the largest elements. Leave the smaller elements for later, since anything you trace now may end up being covered by your next coat of paint. For instance:Let’s say you’re painting Lisa Simpson’s face onto a blue background. For the moment, just trace the outline of her head (minus her eyes) as a single shape. Leave out her lips, inner ear, eyelashes, eyeballs, and pupils until later.

, Always color these in before moving on to smaller details. Avoid the risk of painting over your detail work, which could easily happen if you save the largest areas for last. Depending on how large or small your stone is, choose between a wide flat brush or a thick round one. Let the paint dry completely before moving on to smaller elements or fine detail work.Again, let’s say you’re painting Lisa Simpson. For now, simply fill the outline of her head with yellow paint.

, Once your last coat of paint has dried completely, repeat with smaller elements. Always work from biggest to smallest, letting one set of elements dry completely before moving on to the next smallest. If you’re less sure of your painting skills when it comes to extremely fine lines, consider using variously colored fine-point markers or marker paints instead of a brush and paint.With Lisa Simpson, move onto her eyeballs next, since these are the second largest elements after her head. Paint them white and let them dry. Doing so once the yellow has dried helps prevent the two colors from mixing accidentally.
Once the white paint dries, proceed to add her lips, inner ear, eyelashes, and pupils, as well as a fine black border around each feature.

, Protect your artwork from wear, tear, and moisture. Add or one two coats of sealant. Be sure to read the directions for the particular sealant you choose, since some may recommend only using outdoors and/or with a ventilator mask in order to prevent inhalation of hazardous fumes.Once the sealant has dried, feel free to glue any add-ons (like pipe cleaners for whiskers, googly eyes, or bows) to the surface, if desired.

, Almost any sort of container can be used for this. Just be sure there aren’t any holes in its bottom or sides so cement doesn’t leak out. If necessary, trim the sides so they’re only a little higher than the stone you intend to make for easier access to the cement once it’s poured inside.Possible molds include metal baking pans, plastic bowls, buckets, or containers, or even paper milk cartons cut to size.

, Depending on how large you wish to make your stone, the amount needed will vary. However, let’s saying you’re making two stones using a couple of standard-size loaf pans as molds. For this, measure about 2.5 lbs (0.9 kg) into a plastic bucket. Then pour 1 cup (237 ml) of water into the mix. Stir to combine until all of the cement mix has been moistened.The directions to your particular brand of mix may advise a different ratio. However, for this project you only need enough water to get all of the cement moist, rather than make a wet soup like you see in the movies.

, First, spray the inside of your mold with cooking oil to lubricate the sides for easier removal. Then pour the cement in as evenly as possible. Once it’s filled, lightly rap the mold’s bottom on a hard surface a couple of times, which will help any trapped reach the surface and escape. Then smooth the surface with a spade or even just your hand., Consider adding other elements in addition to (or instead of) painting your stone. Set mosaic tiles into the surface immediately after filling the mold, while the cement is still wet. Wait 30 or 40 minutes after filling, and then use stepping stone stamps to press names, words, or numbers into the cement's surface, like your family name or street number., Keep watch over your stone for the first hour after filling the mold. Pat the surface dry with paper towels if any water is forced to the surface as the cement dries. After that, simply let it sit for 24 hours. Then flip the mold upside down over a soft surface and whack the bottom until the stone falls out."

Get out in the sun.",How to Choose a Garden Bench," If your goal is to spruce up a beautiful outdoor setting, it’s hard to go wrong with the warmth and allure of natural wood. Woods like acacia, cypress and teak are among the best outdoor options, as their resins make them naturally resistant to water and insects. Wicker is another popular choice. When properly maintained, a well-selected wooden garden bench can last for decades.Opt for lightweight woods like cedar if you think you’ll be moving or rearranging your bench often.
Treating your wooden bench with a protective stain or clear coat can help preserve its natural color and prevent warping, splintering and decay.;
, Benches of metal construction can be sleek and modern or boast an element of classic elegance, as with traditional wrought-iron. Look for sturdy designs that are able to withstand exposure to the elements. Perhaps best of all, you’ll never have to worry about a metal bench splintering or wearing out.Metal benches are typically designed to prevent rust and discoloration.

, Assuming your budget doesn’t permit an elaborate wrought-iron or redwood bench, you can still outfit your garden in style by picking out synthetic seating. A plastic bench will be lightweight, waterproof and, above all, affordable, meaning replacing it after a few years won’t be a financial hassle.Many of these benches are molded as a single piece or come pre-assembled, so no complicated building is required.
Top-end synthetic benches are often woven together to look like wicker, making them a more tasteful possibility for those who aren’t willing to sacrifice style.

, If you prefer a classic approach, a stone bench may be the thing for you. Depending on your price range, you can find stone benches made of everything from marble or granite to molded concrete. A stone garden bench imparts a sense of idyllic beauty, looking like it leapt off the pages of a storybook.Make sure you have the right spot picked out for a stone bench before having it brought in. They’re extremely heavy and difficult to move.
Stone benches are essentially no-maintenance, which is ideal for people who don’t want to have to do a lot of cleaning and storing., Garden benches come in a nearly endless variety of shapes and sizes. As you’re browsing different models, imagine how it would look as the centerpiece of your outdoor space. In the end, trust your instincts and go with what you like most.


The basic style of your bench should reflect your unique outdoor space and individual sensibilities. An ergonomic bench with an aluminum frame, for instance, would seem out of place in a garden full of dazzling flowers, but will be right at home in an extended patio.
If you’re not happy with any of the models you look at, consider having a custom bench built to your own specifications., The color of your bench will also influence how it looks among your garden. Natural wood benches will blend with their surroundings for a serene, outdoorsy effect, whereas plastic and metal benches can create a pleasant contrast that defines your garden as a stylishly contemporary space. Get as bold or as understated as you please, using the general aesthetic of your garden as the principal reference.Look for materials and shades that won’t clash with the colors of the plants growing around them.
To ensure that your bench stands the test of time, keep the most vibrant colors confined to cushions and other subtle accents.

, Put some thought into the purpose your garden bench will serve. Should it provide spacious seating for outdoor get-togethers? Or is more ornamental than functional? Review the layout of your garden and settle on a bench that’s the right size to complement the space you have without dwarfing it or being swallowed up.Determine how many people are likely to be sitting at one time.
Be aware of how big nearby plants are likely to grow so that your bench doesn’t end up competing for room in your garden.

, If you plan on spending a lot of time relaxing on your bench, it may be worth it to invest in a set of decorative cushions or pillows. Make sure the accessories you buy are rated for the outdoors and made from waterproof synthetic materials. Cushions can offer enhanced comfort as well as a little something for the eye to linger on.Even weather-resistant cushions will need to be brought inside during heavy downpours or inclement winter weather.
Wipe outdoors cushions clean with a simple wet washcloth, or use a stiff-bristled brush to remove set-in dirt and stains., A small bench can make an outstanding feature for gardens that are configured to promote foot traffic. Following a stroll through your outdoor sanctuary, you or your guests will have a convenient place to take a seat. This will give you a chance to rest and appreciate the beauty of your surroundings.


Make room for the bench among taller shrubs and trees to give yourself more privacy., If your garden is spread out or part of an open yard, strategically positioning a large bench can bridge disconnected flower beds and cover tracts of ground where nothing grows. It will also make the area appear more neatly organized and add visual depth, breaking up long stretches of grass and dirt.Find a place for your bench somewhere with a scenic view, whether it’s a rose bush in full bloom or a faraway mountain vista.Combine a garden bench with other decorative accents, such as a fountain, bird feeder or latticed archway.

, Turn your backyard into a private wilderness haven. Nestle a wooden or plastic bench in a secluded corner of the garden where you can relish a moment of quiet solitude. You can seek shade under a tall tree, or immerse yourself in the breathtaking color of blossoming flowers.Benches with built-in backs will allow you to sit upright more comfortably.
Layer the bench with soft cushions to make your private getaway more luxurious.

, Rather than retreating into the inner reaches of your garden, place the bench right out in the open and take advantage of warm, sunny weather. From your position of leisure you’ll be able to soak up a few rays or sit and watch the kids play all afternoon. If you’ve been looking for a reason to get outside more, this is it.


Ample sunshine will also help keep wood and metal benches dry, reducing the risk of rot and rust.
Pair your garden bench with an outdoor coffee table where you can set a pitcher of ice cold lemonade or some snacks."

Do a home test of the paint.,
Get a professional test done on the paint.,
Determine if the lead paint is hazardous.",How to Identify Lead Paint2," You can buy a home testing kit for lead-based paint at your local hardware store or online. The kit will require you to test a sample of the paint for any lead. These kits are relatively inexpensive and easy to use.Keep in mind home test kits for lead paint are not always reliable. They will not be as accurate as a professional test on the paint.

, Contact your landlord if you are a renter so they can arrange a professional test on the paint in your home. You can also contact your local department of health or a lead testing service in your area. Professional, qualified individuals can then test the paint in your home for a small fee., The professional test should tell you if there is lead paint in your home and if so, if it is hazardous to your health. Lead paint that is in good condition, where it is not peeling, chipping, or flaking, is not considered a health hazard.If there is lead paint in your home that is in good condition, you should still keep an eye on it to make sure it does not become damaged or start to deteriorate.

Paint over it if it’s not hazardous.,
Cover the lead paint with drywall.,
Remove and replace the lead paint.",How to Identify Lead Paint3," Lead paint that is in good condition can be painted over to seal it and prevent any lead fumes from entering the home. You can use water-based paints over the lead paints or encapsulants, which seal the lead paint so it won’t chip. Doing this will ensure the lead paint is not a hazard., You can also cover the lead paint with a new surface, such as drywall. This will prevent the lead paint from getting damaged, exposing everyone in the home to lead., Removing lead paint can be difficult, as you do not want to sand, power wash, or scrape off the paint without safety goggles, gloves, and a respirator. Breathing in lead dust can be toxic. Consider hiring a professional to remove the lead paint and replace it with water based paint so you do not put yourself or others at risk.Lead paint on doorways, windowsills, and stairwells can be replaced by removing the actual materials and putting in new materials.

If the sub floor has cracks between sheets of wood, fill them with quality wood filler (filler MUST dry before painting). For varnished wood floors, laminate, tile, or vinyl, lightly sand the surface.
, Be sure to let the floor dry before going to the next step., Allow 24 hours to dry., Determine base color, which will go down first, then two or three colors to compliment. Floor and porch paints are your best option and may be tinted to desired choices., Experiment! Experiment! Use a large board or piece of cardboard, to perfect a technique before starting.

, Roll on two coats of your base color, and allow it to dry 24 hours before splattering., Try paint stick stir, fling fast creates little drops, more paint dripping slower fling bigger drops, different sizes of paint brushes creates softer splatters, drop big drops of paint use a stick drag through to create squiggles, a dry paint brush creates swirls. Allow paint to harden 24 hours between coats of splatter for best results., Use a sealer and acrylic wax, available at hardware or do-it-yourself stores, similar to school gymnasium floors. Three coats are adequate for high durability. Use a coat of sealer and wax every 3 months for the first year, and then annually. Sealer for wax goes down first (3 coats first). Then wax (again 3 coats). Use a lint free mop or applicator for sealing/waxing. Let dry well between coats., Use water and a small amount of gentle detergent damp mop once a week to maintain shine."

, You do not want to paint it directly in the center of the room. Start by finding the exact center, then moving over and up 1 foot (30 cm).

, Dab any excess glaze off in the paint pan. Begin forming the clouds by dabbing the sponge in a straight line to form the bottom of the cloud. Continue up from the line, dabbing and twisting the sponge to form a cloud. You want the clouds to be denser toward the middle and thinner toward the edges.

, Wring out excess water. Use the cheesecloth to soften the edges of the cloud.

, You'll also want to add some wispy clouds in between larger clouds. Clouds should be light and airy looking. Try to be random with the placement of your clouds, just as they are in nature.

, Also, let some of your clouds continue around a corner.

Look for pastel accessories.,
Add pastel pillows.,
Put out pastel tableware.,
Set out pastel planters.,
Buy a pastel bedding set.",How to Decorate Your Home with Pastel Colors1," If you only want to add small touches of pastel to your home, then adding small accessories is the best way to do it. For example, in the kitchen you could put out a light blue butter dish. In the living room, look for light green coasters. In the bedroom, add a lampshade in a light pink or purple color.;
, A good way to add a touch of pastel to your home is to put pastel throw pillows on your couch, chair, or bed. Consider the colors that you already have in your room when choosing pillows. Choose colors that would pair well with the existing colors in the room. If you have a lot of neutral colors in the room, almost any color will work, like light pink, green, blue, or yellow.Colors like light yellow and purple are great for creating a relaxing environment.

, To add pastel to the kitchen, buy pastel plates and cups. This will add a touch of pastel to the kitchen without being too overwhelming. You can leave them set out on the table to show off at all times, or only set them out when a meal is being served.Look for pastel tableware at any home decorating store, or at stores like Target.

, You can use planters to decorate both the inside and outside of your home. If you can’t find pastel planters, you can paint them on your own. Set them outside of your door, or put your indoor plants inside of them. You can choose one color, or choose an array of colors for a cheery look., A pastel bedding set will add more than just a splash of color to your room, but it won’t overtake the room if it is the only pastel. Look for a bedding set with a comforter (or duvet cover), sheets, and pillowcases. They can be in a solid color, or in a design, like stripes. If you don’t want all of your bedding to be in pastels, just buy a comforter.Pastels can add a soothing effect to your bedroom.
If you don’t want the bedroom to appear to “girly,” you can choose pastel colors like light blue and green.

Think about your overall design plans.,
Draw an initial sketch of the image (if applicable).,
Choose the type of stencil material you want to use.,
Create the final image with clean lines and good contrast.,
Print out the final image on a regular piece of computer paper (if applicable).,
Attach the paper with the stencil image to the stencil material.,
Cut out the areas of your image where you want the paint to appear.,
Attach the stencil to your painting surface.,
Apply the spray paint.,
Remove the stencil and inspect your work.",How to Make Spray Paint Stencils," Consider what the stencil is to be used for--say, a small decoration on a box or a pattern for use on your walls. How will your use of the stencil influence the design you can use? Here are a few specific points to consider:


Don't use paper. Determine what size of stencil you need. If the stencil is going to be large, it is okay to include small details. If the stencil is going to be small, a simpler design should be used.
Know how many colors you want to include in the stenciled image. You can use multiple stencils and each will be used with its own layer of color. These factors will affect the amount of materials you need and the number of stencils you need to create.;
, At this point, you are only trying to develop the image that will become the stencil. You can experiment with patterns or attempt to hone a design that you had intended from the start.

, There are a variety of materials that are suitable as stencils, but you need to consider how much use the stencil will have (one time or many?) and the ease with which you can work with the material.


Cardboard or foam board are good for large, simple stencils on flat surfaces.
Paper works for a single-use stencil on either flat or rounded surfaces.
Poster board holds up better than paper and can be used on flat or slightly rounded surfaces.
Plastic or clear acetate are good if creating reusable stencils for either flat or rounded surfaces.
Frisket film, which is a clear film with a slightly sticky backing, is good for flat and rounded surfaces.

, The image must be clear in order to make it easy to cut out.If you are drawing your own image, clearly outline the areas of the image that will be cut out for the stencil. Remember that you need to define the edges and the details of your image, or the stencil will not portray your original drawing.
If you are using a photograph or an online image, you need to use a software program that can adjust the contrast and brightness of your image so that you have defined dark and light areas. It will probably be easiest to switch the image into purely black and white.Make sure that your current design will work as a stencil. If you are attempting to create a complex image with textures or shadows, make sure that you design does not force you to cut whole sections out of the stencil. Alter the image so that the stencil will remain as a single piece.Photo images also work best if you erase the backgrounds first. This may be the most time-consuming portion of the process., After the image has been printed, it may be a good idea to outline any areas areas in which the contrast remains ill-defined. You must have a clear image to cut out for the stencil.

, There are a number of ways in which you can attach the paper:









Tape it in place using masking tape or clear adhesive tape. Make sure to have some tape near the edges, but it may also be useful to stabilize the paper by taping down sections in the middle.
Alternately, you can attach it with spray adhesive. Simply spray the stencil material and then carefully place the paper over the top of it.
You can also transfer the image to the stencil material using tracing paper. This will work best if the stencil material is cardboard or poster board.

, Using a sharp utility knife, delicately cut out the unneeded portions of the stencil. If your design will have more than one color, you must create different stencils for each color.








, It is absolutely vital that the stencil is lying flat on the surface when you begin to spay the paint. If any portion if elevated, paint can get underneath and make the design unrecognizable. There are a number of methods that can be employed, including the following:


Tape works well for simple stencils. Complex stencils with a great deal of detail may be more difficult to hold in place with tape.
A temporary adhesive sprays are available at craft stores. They are perfect for more detailed stencils because they can help every part stick closely to the surface that is to be painted.
If the stencil material is frisket film, simply remove the backing and stick it to the painting surface.

, Do not apply the paint so thickly that it pools or puddles. That much paint is likely to get underneath the stencil. Instead, keep the application process fast, and do not concentrate the nozzle on a single point for too long.








, It is common for some paint to get past the edge of the stencil (no matter how hard you try), and so you may want to check to see how the design appears. You may want to apply some touch-up paint to areas that are not well covered.









It can be a good idea to try the stencil on a test surface before using it for real. You can get a sense of how the image looks, and you can also see if paint crept in past the edges of the stencil and so secure it more appropriately when you will use it on the intended surface.

Clean the plastic.,
Rinse and dry the item.,
Sand the surface.,
Wipe the surface.,
Take the project outside if possible.,
Ventilate indoor areas.,
Make a DIY spray paint booth.,
Cover surrounding areas.,
Choose the right paint.,
Apply a coat of paint.,
Let the coat dry.,
Apply a second coat.,
Repeat on all sides.,
Let the paint cure.",How to Spray Paint Plastic," For small items, fill a sink with warm water and add a teaspoon (5 ml) of liquid dish soap. Wash the item in the sink using a cloth. For larger items, fill a bucket with soap and water. Soak a sponge or cloth in the soapy water and use the sponge to clean the item.








Cleaning is a must before you paint any surface, because it will remove dust, dirt, and other particles that could prevent the paint from adhering.;
, After cleaning, rinse the item with clean water to remove dirt and soap residue. Pat the item dry with a towel or cloth to absorb excess water. Leave the item to air dry for at least 10 minutes, or until all the water has evaporated.








, When the item is completely dry, use a piece of fine-grit sandpaper to lightly sand the entire surface. Sanding will rough up the surface slightly, and this will give the paint something to stick to.








A fine grit sandpaper is one with a grit between 120 and 220.Sanding is especially important if the item you're painting was previously painted. Remove as much of the original paint as possible with the sandpaper.

, Use a microfiber, lint-free, or tack cloth to wipe down the plastic.This will remove dirt, dust, and plastic particles from sanding. Leftover dust and other debris on the surface will prevent the paint from sticking to the surface, because the paint will land on the dust particles rather than the plastic.








, Spray paint is dangerous to inhale, and the overspray and dust can easily land on nearby surfaces. Take the item you want to spray paint outside when possible, such as when the temperature is mild, when there's no precipitation, and when it’s a calm day.


The ideal temperature range for spray painting is between 64 and 77 F (18 and 25 C).The ideal humidity for spray painting is between 40 and 50 percent.When you can’t spray paint outside, take the project to a shed or garage if possible.

, Inhaling spray paint is bad for your health. To protect yourself, open windows, doors, and turn on exhaust vents when you must work inside. Don’t turn on any fans, as these will just blow the paint around.


Invest in an activated carbon mask if you work with spray paint often. This will protect your lungs and keep you safe from the health problems associated with spray paint exposure., A spray paint booth protects surrounding areas from overspray, and protects the painted item from dust and dirt when it’s still wet. For smaller projects, you can make your own simple spray paint booth with a box and a pair of scissors:


Find a box that’s larger than the items you're spray painting
Cut off the flaps that form the lid
Lay the box on its side with the opening facing you
Cut off the top panel
Leave the bottom, side, and back panels of the box in place
Place the item in the center of the bottom panel

, For larger projects, you may not be able to make your own spray paint booth. To protect the floor and surrounding areas from overspray, lay out a large drop cloth or piece of cardboard. Place the item in the center of the cloth or cardboard.If you also want to protect the drop cloth from excess paint, lay down some newspaper over the cloth and place the item on the newspaper.

, Different materials require different types of paint, and plastic typically needs a special type of spray paint. The wrong type of paint may blister, bubble, flake, or just won’t adhere properly to the surface. Look for spray paints that are specifically formulated for plastic surfaces, or that are suitable for plastics.


Companies that make spray paint for plastic include Krylon, Valspar, and Rustoleum., Shake the can of spray paint. Hold the can 12 to 18 inches (30 to 46 cm) from the object. Aim the nozzle at the object and press down. As you spray, sweep the can back and forth over the object in a vertical or horizontal motion to apply a thin and even coat to the surface.









Avoid pointing the nozzle directly, at a single spot, as this will make for an uneven application. Instead, keep the can in motion as you spray., Spray paint typically requires anywhere from eight to 30 minutes to dry. After applying the first coat, let the paint dry before applying a second coat, or before turning the item over to paint the other side.









Consult the manufacturer’s directions on the can for exact drying times with the paint you're using., Most items will benefit from at least two coats of spray paint. When the first coat has had time to dry, apply a second coat. Use the same side to side or up and down sweeping motion as you spray to ensure a thin and even coat.









When the second coat has been applied, give the paint up to 30 minutes to dry before assessing whether it needs another coat, or before painting the other side.

, Some objects have a bottom or other side that won’t be accessible when you're applying the initial coats of paint. When the final coat has had time to dry, turn the object over. Apply two coats of spray paint using the same technique, giving the paint up to 30 minutes to dry between coats.








, Paint generally has a drying time and a curing time. While spray paint dries in about 30 minutes, it needs about three hours to cure. Once you’ve applied the final coat of spray paint, let the item dry for at least three hours before using it normally again.









With spray painted furniture, for instance, don’t sit in the chair as soon as it’s dry. Instead, wait a few hours so the paint can fully cure.The drying time is how long it takes for the paint to be dry to the touch. The curing time, on the other hand, is how long it takes for the paint molecules to fully bond and harden.

Use stencils.,
Choose a color for the molding.,
Paint one wall.,
Paint the room.",How to Decorate Your Home with Pastel Colors2," If you don’t want to commit to painting your entire wall, you can use stencils to add traces of pastels. You can find stencils at many art and home improvement stores. Choose a stencil in the design of your choice. Buy a pastel paint in any color, like light purple or yellow. Hold the stencil up against wall and paint the color onto the wall.Stencils are usually made of flexible plastic. Stencils in the shape of flowers and geometric patterns are especially common for walls.
Make sure not to get paint outside of the stencil.

, Painting the wall molding in your home is another way to add some color to the room without painting the entire wall. You can choose to paint just the molding near the ceiling, or all of the molding in the room. Consider the color your wall is before choosing a pastel color.For white or black walls, any color will do.
For blue walls, consider a light yellow.
For red walls, consider light blue or pink.

, Painting one wall in a room is a way to make the pastel very noticeable without taking up the entire room. The best wall to paint is the one that is directly in front of you when entering a room, or the wall that the couch side tables are in front of. Choose a color like light blue or green for a relaxing vibe. Choose light pink if there are reds in the room that you’d like to tone down., It is also an option to paint the entire room in a pastel color. If you do this, you should only have a few other pastel details or none at all. Too much pastel can take over the appearance of the room. That may, however, be your goal. Choose a color that can go with a range of furniture, like light blue or light yellow.Painting a room in a pastel shade can make a small room appear larger.

If you don’t already have wooden chairs, you can look for some at vintage shops or yard sales. You can choose to paint all of the chairs one color, or use a different color for each chair.Light green, pink, and purple would look nice together for patio chairs.

, Painting the cupboard is a way to add an accent of color without a large commitment. You can update your own cupboard, or choose to buy one from a yard sale or vintage shop. If you’re painting one that is wooden or a different color, make sure to use a white primer first., If you don’t have furniture that you can paint, it is an option to reupholster old furniture. You can reupholster on your own, or you can take it in to have it reupholstered. If you aren’t sure how to reupholster furniture, then it is best to take it to a professional. If you are reupholstering on your own, make sure to purchase fabric made specifically for reupholstering furniture. It will only be a decorative piece of furniture if you don’t.You can find upholstery fabric at arts and crafts stores, like Jo Ann’s, and at most fabric stores.
You can find upholstery fabric in several types of materials, like leather, wool, cotton, linen, polyester, and wool.

, If you don’t want a solid shade of a pastel color, look for furniture that incorporates pastels into the design. You may want to look for a chair that is mainly light pink, but has black stripes. Or, you can look for a black chair that has yellow polka dots. If you’re reupholstering furniture, look for fabric that has pastel shades in the design.Another example of printed pastel furniture would be a couch with a paisley pattern in pastel colors.
If you don’t want to change your furniture, you can add pastel ottoman in front of your chairs and/or couches in a pastel color, like light blue or green. The light colors, however, would be more likely to show dirt.

, Skip the pastels and neon shades, and stick with strong, eye-catching hues.

, Once your kid reaches school age, he or she will likely have his or her own interests and obsessions. Interests often include anything from animals to cityscapes and ballerinas to sports. Build a theme around your child's interests and paint wall art specifically tailored to those interests.

, Images that use simple shapes and abstract designs will likely appeal to your maturing child more than specific pictures. Use muted colors or bright, funky shades depending on your child's personality.

For instance, there are specific painting tapes designed for drywall, wood, metal, or wallpaper.Painter's Mate Green painter’s tape, Scotch blue painter’s tape, and FrogTape are multi-surface tapes that are all popular choices for most home renovation needs.;
, To ensure the tape sticks properly, take a damp cloth and wipe away dirt and dust from the surfaces where you'll be applying tape. Otherwise, the tape will stick to the dust particles instead of the surface and will peel off before you even begin painting.Allow the area to air dry completely before applying tape.

, Tape actually stretches, so if you try to use strips that are too long, you will stretch the tape, and this will lead to paint bleeding onto the surfaces you're trying to protect.When you're applying painter’s tape, apply it in foot-long strips. Be sure to slightly overlap each section of tape so that paint can't get through., What you need to protect will depend on what you're painting. For instance, if you're painting walls, you may want to mask (tape) the ceiling, floor trim, window and door frames, or tile (in a bathroom). To paint a ceiling, you'll want to mask sections of the adjoining walls. Other things that may require protection include electrical boxes, door handles, and fixtures.


When you're applying tape, apply it flush with and as close as possible to the surface you'll be painting. For instance, to protect a ceiling from wall paint, apply the tape to the ceiling where the ceiling and wall meet, getting the tape as close to the wall as possible without masking the wall itself.If you're painting multiple surfaces, always make sure fresh paint is fully cured before you apply tape to the surface. While paint may dry in a few hours, it takes several days to cure., When you're masking horizontal surfaces like floor trim, don’t fold excess tape down onto the trim. Instead, apply the tape edge to the trim as close to the wall as possible, and then leave the excess tape sticking out like a roof overhang so that it will catch any paint splatter.

, After you apply each section of tape, run your finger over it to ensure it’s properly sealed to the surface. This will bond the tape to the surface, stop paint from bleeding, and prevent the tape from peeling off prematurely.Instead of your finger you can also use a putty knife flat against the surface to seal the tape in place., At internal angles, such as where floor trim meets in corners, cut the edge of the tape on a 45-degree angle at each corner, so that the angle created on the top of the tape is an acute angle.Mitering the tape like this will allow the edges to come together in corners without overlapping onto the wall.
Make sure you leave enough tape to overlap the tape edges, so that no trim is exposed underneath.
You can also do this in the corners of ceilings.

, This may be necessary if there are additional surfaces that you want to protect from paint spatter, such as the surface of an electrical panel, for instance, which may be exposed in the middle of the wall you want to paint.


To start, tape up the edges of the panel first, and press the tape down flat.
Cover the remainder of the panel with newspaper or masking paper. Tape all the edges of the paper to keep it in place and prevent paint from getting in., To prevent paint from spilling or splattering where you don’t want it, remove any furniture and other items from the room before you begin painting.If there are items that are too large or awkward to be removed, arrange them in the center of the room and cover them with a sheet, tarp, plastic cover, or drop cloth to protect them., Electrical outlet covers, light switch plates, vents, and other items that are affixed to the wall should also be removed before painting, as you don’t want to have to worry about splatter or having to paint around them.Most vent, light, and plug covers are fastened with one or two screws, and can be removed with a screwdriver.
Tape the screws to the back of each fixture to avoid losing them or mixing them up.

, Unless you are redoing your floor after painting, cover the floor with a drop cloth, tarp, or plastic painter’s sheet before you begin. Pay special attention to the areas closest to the walls you will be painting.Lay the sheet down as flat as possible and pull it taught so that it doesn’t become a tripping hazard. Use masking tape or painter’s tape to secure the sheet in place.

, This is important because you want to give the paint a fresh surface to stick to. Using 120-grit sandpaper, sand the areas you will be painting. Then, fill a small bucket with warm water and use it to dampen a course-grit sanding sponge. Go over the walls with the sponge, adding water as necessary.When you have sanded the walls, get a fresh bucket of water and a clean sponge to wipe the walls down and remove dirt and dust. Add a bit of dish soap to the water if the walls are dirty.
Allow the walls to dry, and when everything is dry, vacuum up any leftover dust and dirt from the walls and baseboards.
When sanding, it’s a good idea to wear a protective mask and safety glasses to prevent dust from getting into your mouth, nose, and eyes.

, To prevent the tape from sticking, leaving residue, or chipping the paint, remove the tape as soon as you're finished painting. If you wait for the paint to dry first, you risk the paint drying to the tape and peeling off with it.Peel the tape off slowly, and pull it at a 135-degree angle toward yourself., If any paint has dried to the tape, use a utility knife, putty knife, or other blade to score the area where the tape and paint meet. Be careful not to score too deeply, or you could cut the wall.


When you're scoring, hold the blade at a 45-degree angle., Sometimes tape can leave behind a sticky residue, even if you pull it off right after painting. When this happens, you can remove the residue with soap and water.


Fill a small bowl with warm water and several drops of dish soap. Dip a lint-free cloth into the soapy water and rub at the tape residue with the cloth.
Rinse the cloth, wring it out, and wipe the area with clean water.
If you need something stronger than soap and water, consider using a citrus-based cleanser on the residue.Apply a small amount to the affected area and let it sit for a few minutes before wiping it away with a clean, damp cloth.

Decide on a ""theme"" for the painting.,
Look at your wall and decide how large a painting you want on it.,
Get a piece of paper and sketch your idea.,
Go to any hobby or art supply store and buy a stretched canvas in your chosen size.

,
Pick up some acrylic paints in colors similar to the color theme in your room.,
Spread some newspapers or a drop cloth under your canvas to protect your furniture.,
Paint!,
Once you feel it's done-leave it alone!

,
Hang your new artwork and enjoy the compliments from friends!

",How to Paint Artwork for Your Walls," ""Abstract"" works pretty well since everyone can draw a few shapes and smack paint on canvas to create a nice work of abstract art. If you feel more artistic, think about one of the more common themes for art - a still life of flowers or fruit, a landscape with a cute little house and some fields, or a portrait of a pet or a person.;
, Some common canvas sizes are 8""x10"", 16""x20"", and 24""x36"". There are also smaller or larger ones if you want to do a series of tiny paintings or a really huge one.

, If you can get the paper in the same size that your art will be in, that's great, but if not (ie, if you're using a huge canvas and just don't have that extra roll of art paper lying around), then just sketch it to scale and don't worry. Think about what colors you want before you go out to get your materials.

,, If you decided on paint colors before you left the house, check to see that you get all the ones you wanted. Black and white are not always good to have for making colors lighter or darker To make shades, use the opposite of the color to darken it. For example, use green to darken red. Use a few paintbrushes or sponges to get it from the bottle to the canvas!

, Prop the canvas up on a chair, table, or easel while you work, and sit or stand as you feel comfortable.

, Have fun with it - again, don't try to be perfect.

Choose the right spray paint machine for the project.,
Get advice from your paint supplier about the kind of paint you need and whether you will need to thin it with water or paint thinner.,
Select your nozzle, or tip, and pump pressure.,
Practice on scrap pieces of wood or drywall.,
Put down drop cloths and use tape and plastic sheeting to isolate the area you want to paint.,
Wear coveralls, gloves, a hat, eye protection and a respirator to keep paint from settling on your clothes, hair and skin and to keep from getting paint in your eyes or in your lungs.

,
Adjust the viscosity of the paint, the pump pressure or the nozzle if the paint isn't going on evenly.

",How to Use a Paint Spray Machine,"


Airless spray paint machines are versatile enough for most paint jobs and are the choice of professional painters.
Air assist spray paint machines are used by woodworkers and automobile painters because they leave the best finish. They are the most expensive type of spray paint machine, however.
Hand-held electric cup machines are often purchased by homeowners for small jobs, but can be difficult to use. They require that the paint be thinned significantly, and can clog or spit paint.;
, The supplier should be able to provide you with a viscosity tester to help you determine whether your paint is thin enough to use in your spray paint machine.

, In general, small nozzles and lower pressures are best for thin paints such stains or enamels. Large nozzles and high pressures are needed for thicker paints, such as wall paint.

,


Hold the sprayer so the paint will exit horizontally and maintain a consistent distance of 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) from the surface. Keep your wrist stiff and move the sprayer in sweeping motions with your arm. To paint horizontal surfaces, such as ceilings, use a tip extension to redirect the paint.
Spray from left to right (or right to left if you're left-handed), pressing the trigger on the sprayer just before you arrive at the point where you want to lay down paint. Lay down about 3 feet (1 meter) of paint at a time.
Overlap the next application over your first by 50 percent so the surface will get 2 thin coats and won't dry into stripes of paint.

, Cover anything you don't want painted. Using a spray paint machine puts a lot of paint droplets in the air, which will drift away and settle on objects nearby, including plants, decks and cars if you are painting outdoors and on furniture, walls and floors in other rooms if painting indoors.

Reapply painters tape to unveil another section of your illustration.",How to Paint Wall Art for a Kid's Room2," Use a blue pencil with an eraser. If you cannot find a blue pencil, use a regular pencil with an eraser, instead.

, Tape is especially useful if you want to create straight lines, and sectioning your illustration off will prevent you from accidentally getting the wrong color on the wrong portion of the illustration.

, Use acrylic paints and start with colors you know you will use to complete the first section instead of pouring out all the paint at once. This will prevent your paint from drying unnecessarily before use.

, Use a thin paintbrush to provide yourself with more control.

,, Remove your painting tape and allow the sealer to dry.

, Paint and seal the paint using the same method you used for the first section. Repeat as necessary until all sections are complete.

Apply an acrylic paint sealer if you used acrylic paint.",How to Paint Wall Art for a Kid's Room3," You should search for large stencils, rather than smaller ones, in order to create a noticeable design that stands out as soon as you enter the room. It may be easiest to use stencils specifically made for use with wall paint, since they usually come in finished designs.

, Painters tape is strong enough to hold the stencil in place but will not ruin the paint already on the wall.

, You may use standard wall paint, but acrylic craft paint will likely be more cost-effective, especially if you plan on using multiple colors.

, Coat the roller in your paint and roll the paint over the entire stencil until the entire design has been filled in.

, A stubby stenciling brush works best and creates an ""orange peel"" finish, a slightly bumpy texture that mimics the texture of an orange peel.

, If you found the image in a printed source, scan or transfer it into your computer. If you found it online, simply save a copy of the file to your computer.

, You can ask your local library if they offer projector rentals, but more likely than not, you will need to find a store that specializes in renting audio visual equipment.

, If you rented a projector that requires the use of transparencies, you need to transfer your image onto a transparency. You can purchase clear transparency paper for your home printer at most office supply stores.


If you rent a projector that hooks up to your computer directly, you do not need to print out a transparency.

, Adjust the position and projection size as necessary until you feel satisfied with the way the image looks on the wall.

, Redraw every line you wish to duplicate on the mural.

, Check the image to make sure that you copied everything correctly. If not, turn the projector back on and finish filling in any details you missed.

, Use acrylic craft paint for the best results.

, Choose a paintbrush that has an appropriate thickness for the size of the picture. A brush that is too small will cause the process to go slower and may increase streaking in the final picture. A brush that is too large may cause you to make more mistakes and paint outside the lines.


Use multiple paintbrushes of varying sizes if needed, switching to a smaller paintbrush to complete smaller details.

The less paint on your roller, the easier the clean-up process will be. Roll excess paint from your roller onto newspapers, cardboard or any other disposable surface.;
, Latex paint and oil-based paints require different methods of cleaning the rollers.


Wash latex paint from your roller with soapy water. Submerge the paint roller in a bucket of soapy water, swirl the roller around and squeeze excess paint from the roller with your hand. Empty the water, refill the bucket and repeat the process until the roller water rinses nearly clear.






Clean oil-based paint from rollers with paint thinner. Wearing gloves to protect your hands, pour paint thinner into a clean paint tray, and roll the roller in the paint thinner several times. When mostly clean, submerge the roller in a bucket of warm, soapy water to clean it for reuse.







, Cut off the side of an ordinary clothes hanger. Attach the roller to the bottom part of the hanger to dry. Drying the roller this way helps to save the nap, which keeps it fluffy for the next time you wish to use the roller. A roller with smashed nap may paint unevenly.

, A disposable roll of paper can be bought at Home Depot. You can also put some big pieces of plastic over big areas. You can get that at Walmart, if you cannot find it at the 99 cent store.

, Allow to dry per manufacturer's instructions (usually 2-4 hours) then sand flush. Apply a second coat and sand if necessary.

, This is especially important in kitchens and bathrooms, where different residues are commonly built up on the walls. A simple solution of dish-soap and water works wonderfully. I have found that a sponge headed mop is the easiest tool for scrubbing walls. Finish the walls with a quick rinse of plain water to remove any soap residue.

, If your walls are already covered in a low gloss, water-based paint, such as ""builder's white"", you can simply paint over the old paint. If you are painting over oil-based paint or a gloss or semi-gloss surface, you should prime. Also, whether you choose to prime your entire walls or not, you should always spot prime any areas which you spackled, else they will show up as ""shiny"" areas in your finished paint job.


There are also primer/paints that only require one coat and it does not need priming.

, This keeps the old color from showing through if your tape line doesn't exactly match the old line.

, For simple painting projects, you may find you only need one or two colors. If you want to use color schemes to really change your décor, you may want accent walls, wainscoting, decorative trim, and numerous other embellishments.

Dab pad onto paint smeared surface to remove first layer of paint. Press down and create a circular motion with the pad to remove paint.
Use additional pads to remove paint. For latex paint, you may want to allow the paint to dry first for best results.

, Painting in awkward areas can be tough with a traditional paint brush. However to reach those difficult crevasses and corners you can make one using the pad from an edging tool and a craft or yardstick.


Remove the pad portion from the paint edging tool using either a sharp blade or a knife. Avoid ripping the pad from the original material as it may rip.
Attach the pad to either a long rod or a yardstick or a craft stick, depending on the area you need to paint. For example if you need to paint behind a toilet, you may want to use the craft stick. However, for high reaching areas, such as behind a furnace pipe, you may opt for the yardstick.
Use a paintbrush to apply the paint to the pad and then use the pad on the intended surface. Doing this will ensure smooth, even coverage.

, Avoid splashing paint or painting your drop cloth, then risking having the legs stick to the cloth by elevating the chair. This allows you to fully cover the bottom of the chair without having to paint the drop cloth too.


Determine if the chair is sturdy or light enough to hold screws. For heavier furniture consider using large wooden blocks instead of screws.
Gather screws for each leg and your electric drill. One screw for each leg will do. Also, using an electric drill will make the process move along more efficiently.
Drive screws approximately ½” into the bottom of each leg. Make sure each screw is drilled into the leg the same length (so you avoid having the chair wobble while you paint).
Perch chair on drop cloth and then paint. Now you don’t have to worry about turning the chair on its side to paint the legs--you can do it all at once.
Wait until the chair is completely dry before removing screws with electric drill. Use the “reverse” setting on your electric drill to remove the screws.

, Sometimes the painter’s or masking tape you used to protect other surfaces during painting just won’t be ripped with ease (and may leave behind pieces). Use a hairdryer to apply heat to the area to gently (and completely) remove tape.


Wait until the surface is completely dry. Otherwise you may compromise your paint job by removing tape from a wet surface.
Use your hair dryer to add gentle heat to the paint or masking tape. Heat the tape until it is warm to the touch and not scorching hot.
Immediately (and gently) pull tape at a 90 degree angle. This will allow you to remove the most amount of tape with one pull.

, The perfect example is painting behind a toilet. Getting behind the toilet is hard enough, posing numerous opportunities for you to splash paint onto the porcelain.


Purchase the special wrap that you can use to cover the item. Depending on the size of the item you’d like to protect, you may want to purchase multiple rolls.
Wrap the item like you would a gift. You won’t need tape to adhere the sealant to the item but still approach wrapping the item like a gift to ensure full coverage.
Smooth your hand over the sealant to ensure full coverage and protection. Make sure you didn’t miss any spots by inspecting the item or by running your hand over the item to check for any holes or missing areas.

, Although you could place the items in the grass and paint, consider using a large cardboard box to protect the ground and other surroundings when you use spray paint.


Find a large cardboard box, left over from an appliance, moving or at a grocery or retail store. The box doesn’t have to be in perfect condition, just strong enough to stand on its side and void of holes that could emit paint.
Place items inside the box. Either stand items inside the box or you can hang them by poking a wire coat hanger through the top of the box and using the bottom of the hanger to hold your item.
Spray paint and allow the items to dry inside the box.

For this reason, it is imperative that you ask at least 3 to come into your home and assess the job before you hire a painter.;
, You probably got painter recommendations from family or friends, and that is a great place to start. Once the painters have given you estimates, ask them for a list of references that you can call on your own to verify the quality of their work and client satisfaction.

, After you have narrowed down your choices and checked their references, don't forget to ask for licenses and proof of insurance. In addition, dig a little deeper and call the Better Business Bureau to find out if there are any complaints filed against any of the painters you are considering for the job.

, When you are calling the references, ask the homeowners if they mind you coming over for a quick look at the paint job. Be sure to visit new jobs as well as older jobs so that you can see for yourself how well the craftsmanship has held up over time.

, Not all paint adheres to surfaces without some problems after it dries. You don't want to find yourself looking at freshly painted walls that are suddenly bubbling or flaking without a promise that the contractor will come back and fix her work.

, The paperwork should include all the essential details, including name, address, office and cell numbers, license number and an itemization of the work you have agreed upon. Have the painter attach a copy of his insurance policy in the event that something gets broken.

Measure the home or room.,
Subtract areas that won't be painted.,
Determine how much paint you need.,
Figure out the cost of paint.,
Determine the cost of materials.",How to Estimate Painting Jobs1," To figure out how much a paint job will cost, or how much you plan to charge, you need to know the rough size of the home or room you're painting. You can find this somewhere in the paperwork you signed when buying or renting your home. If you're painting for someone else, ask them for the information.However, if you don't have that information on hand, use a ruler or tape measure to measure the length and width of the home/room. You can enter this into an online calculator to determine the rough square footage.;
, Not every inch of a home or room will be painted, so subtract as necessary. Doors and windows will likely not be painted, so measure these areas and subtract their measurements from the total square footage.As a general estimate, you can subtract about 20 square feet per door and 15 square feet per window. Say a 700 square foot room has one door and two windows. You would subtract 20 for the door, and 30 for the window, resulting in a square footage of 650.

, A gallon of paint covers 350 square feet. So, a room that's 650 square feet would need roughly two gallons of paint because 650 divided by 350 comes out to about 1.8. However, you usually need two coats, so expect to buy around four gallons of paint for a room of this size., Once you've determined how much paint you need, figure out how much your paint will cost. Paint costs vary depending on factors like color and quality. Paint is generally $20 to $40 per gallon, with higher quality paint costing more.Say you want two coats of a decent quality paint for a 650 square foot room, which requires four gallons of paint. If you plan to buy paint at $30 a gallon, expect to pay around $120 for paint.

, What supplies do you have and what supplies do you need to buy? You will likely need masking plastic, masking paper, paint tape, caulking, and a gallon of primer.Find the average cost of these supplies by visiting local suppliers and adding up the total.
For example, say the masking plastic costs $25, the masking paper costs $15, the tape costs $10, the caulking costs $15, and the primer costs $20. This means cost of supplies is around $115.

Factor in the basic cost of labor.,
Think about anything that could lengthen painting time.,
Account for potential accidents.,
Calculate the total cost.,
Ask for a professional estimate.",How to Estimate Painting Jobs2," If you're hiring workers to help, you need to know how much you'll pay them. If you're painting for someone else, you need to know how much is fair to charge them. One to two painters can usually paint 2,500 square feet in one to two days. It usually costs around $800 a day.For a small room, such as the 650 square foot example, it should only take a few hours. Divide 650 by 2,500 to get roughly .25. This means you will probably only pay a quarter of the cost of a full day's worth of work, meaning the paint job will be roughly $200.

, If there is a lot of furniture to move or if you're painting with different colors, this will tack on extra time. If you believe the job will require extra labor, tack on some extra money. For example, if you're painting your 650 square foot room two different colors, add $100 on to the labor costs. This brings labor costs to $300., Unfortunately, paint jobs do not always go as planned. Parts of a home may become damaged, paint may spill, and so on. It's a good idea to give yourself a little wiggle room. You can give consumers an estimate roughly $50 to $100 higher in case of an accident., After you have all the individual costs calculated, add them together to get a rough estimate. In the 650 square foot example, the estimate would come to around $535. In case of accidents, you can quote about $635., If you're hiring painters, it's not always a good idea to try to calculate costs yourself. Get a quote from several different companies, explaining your needs and the size of your home. This will give you a more accurate price and help you budget for a paint job."

Depending on the spill this could take repeating several times until desired results are reached. If the paint is dried however, use Goof Off first to work loose and soften the paint then proceed with the stain remover.;
, Removing paint from HARD SURFACES is easily achieved by scraping with your fingernail or a plastic spatula/scraper. A latex paint remover, Goof Off, works well also. Apply to a rag and scrub and for tough spots apply letting it sit a minute or two so the remover will loosen the paint before scrapping with your fingernail or plastic scraper/spatula.

, Removing latex paint from CONCRETE surfaces may be achieved with a water hose and wire brush. Spray concrete with water and then brush the affected area with a wire brush loosening the paint. Repeat these steps until desired look is achieved.

, Remove latex paint from PAINT BRUSHES by running water over the brushes spreading the bristles apart under the faucet. Scrape any dried paint with fingernails or plastic scraper.

Start with a good roller pin.
To extend your reach and give you better control, screw a 48 inch (1.2 meter) wood handle or extension pole onto the end of the roller.
Invest in a good roller cover (also known as a sleeve). It’s tempting to buy the cheapest cover available and throw it away when you’re done, but cheap roller covers don’t hold enough paint to do a good job. It’ll take you twice as long to paint a room and the results won't be as good. Use a 1/2 inch (1.2 cm) nap for flat paint on walls and ceilings, 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) nap for rough surfaces like textured ceilings, and 1/4 inch (.63 cm) nap for satin or semi-gloss paint. See the Tips below for more information on how to take good care of your equipment.
You’ll rarely see a pro using a paint tray for painting very large areas. A 5-gallon (18.9 liter) bucket with a special bucket screen hung over the edge works better because it's easier to load the cover, it's easier to move around, and you're less likely to trip over it or step in it. And if you need to take a break, you can just cover it with a damp towel to keep the paint from drying.
Roller trays work well for smaller areas such as bedrooms where a single gallon of paint might be all that is needed. Cleanup is also easier with roller trays. Add a tray liner to make cleanup even easier.;
, Since rollers can’t get tight to edges, the first painting step is to brush along the ceiling, inside corners and moldings.

, Start about a foot from the bottom and 6 inch (15.2 cm) from the corner and roll upward at a slight angle using light pressure. Stop a few inches from the ceiling. Now roll up and down back toward the corner to quickly spread the paint. You can leave paint buildup and roller marks at this step. Don’t worry about a perfect job yet.

, Keep a wet edge. Keeping a wet edge is crucial to all top-quality paint jobs, whether you’re enameling a door, varnishing furniture or rolling paint on a wall. The idea is to plan the sequence of work and work fast enough so that you’re always lapping newly applied paint onto paint that’s still wet. If you stop for a break in the middle of a wall, for example, and then start painting after this section has dried, you’ll likely see a lap mark where the two areas join.

, Don’t reload the roller with paint for this step. Use very light pressure. Roll up and down, from floor to ceiling and move over about three-quarters of a roller width each time so you’re always slightly overlapping the previous stroke. When you reach the corner, roll as close as you can to the adjacent wall without touching it.

, Get as close as you can. This “cutting in” process leaves brush marks that won’t match the roller texture on the rest of the wall. For the best-looking job, you’ll want to cover as many brush marks as possible with the roller. Do this by carefully rolling up close to inside corners, moldings and the ceiling. Face the open end of the roller toward the edge and remember not to use a roller that’s fully loaded with paint. If you are skilled enough to roll within an inch of the ceiling while rolling vertically, you can skip this step.

, Use your putty knife, or better yet, a special roller scraping tool with a semicircular cutout in the blade. A painter's ""5-in-1 tool"" is perfect for this task.

, Lather up the roller and scrub the mat with your fingers like you are washing a short-haired dog. The detergent will pull a lot of the paint residue out of the mat and make the next step easier.

, A roller and paint brush spinning tool, available at hardware and paint stores, simplifies the cleaning task. Just slip the roller cover onto the spinner and repeatedly wet and spin out the roller into an empty bucket until it’s clean.

, If the boards you’re painting butt against a different paint color or a wall, you can lay a line of painter's tape against the edge, pushing it down tight against the surface to prevent the wet paint from bleeding underneath the tape.

, into the paint to load the brush. The more paint the brush carries, the faster you’ll coat the woodwork, but you want to avoid dripping. Tap the tip of the brush against the pail, like the clapper of a bell. For a drier brush, try dragging one side over the edge of the pail.

, The paint should flow smoothly onto the surface with little effort on your part. When the brush begins to drag, stop and reload. See the Tips below.

, Avoid dabbing small areas as this leaves marks in the paint. The brush will leave a slight track of parallel ridges, but they’ll lie down before the paint begins to skin over.

, Try to coat a whole board or section, but don’t let the paint sit more than a minute before tipping. Tip the wet paint by setting the tip of the brush against the wet paint at the top of the board and lightly stroking down the whole length of the board. Hold the brush almost perpendicular to the surface for this stroke.

, (This will only apply if you didn't put down painter's tape.) Learn with a smaller brush (1-1/2 in.) and go to a wider brush as you gain control. Dip the brush and scrape one side on the pail. Hold the dry side of the brush toward the line and slowly draw the brush along. Support your arm to steady it, and keep the stroke moving. Use gentle downward pressure; you want the bristles to splay out slightly as you stroke. You’ll find you can control the paint line by varying the pressure you apply to the brush. When the brush is dry, reload and start where the previous stroke ended. Sometimes you’ll have to go back over a section where the paint is shy of the line. Complete cutting in and then coat the rest of the piece.

, Wash latex brushes in warm, soapy water and rinse in clean water, then shake dry (or dry in a spinner). Smooth the bristles back into shape. Rinse oil brushes thoroughly in fresh paint thinner and shake dry. With proper cleaning, a quality brush will last for years.

Assemble your materials.,
Clean the surface of your project.,
Prep your work area.",How to Spray Paint1," Spray paint is available in dozens of brands and hundreds of colors, so check out what types are offered in your area to see what will meet your project’s needs. A few other supplies are needed to do a professional spray paint job.


Pricier spray paint from art supply stores may be a good investment if you are short on time, as it typically requires less coats than cheaper varieties from hardware stores.






Keep in mind that light colors especially need multiple coats, so you may need to purchase multiple cans of spray paint in the same color.






Whenever possible, use a primer on your project before you spray paint. This will help the paint to adhere to the surface better, give a smoother surface, and enhance the color of the paint. It is also advisable to use a sealant as a final touch, to protect the paint.






Gather newspaper or plastic tarp to lay on the ground before painting. This will help keep your work area clean of the paint mist.






Always keep old rags available during the painting process to clean up any accidental paint application or messes.






If desired, use painters tape to cordon off certain areas of the surface you are painting or to give a smooth edge to your project.






Because most spray paint is toxic, it is always a good idea to use disposable gloves and a mask during the painting process. If you do not have a mask, be sure to paint in a well-ventilated area, and take a break if you feel even the slightest bit dizzy, queasy, or have difficulty breathing. Remember, your health and safety is always more important than your project.





;
, Paint has difficulty sticking to surfaces that are dusty, greasy, or otherwise unclean. Take a few minutes to wipe off any debris that might be clinging to the surface of the material you are working with.


You can use a damp rag only or use a household cleaner to aid in cleaning your project.






If there is any sticky residue on the surface of your item, such as the remnants of a price tag sticker, be sure to scrape it off and remove it completely during the cleaning process.






For surfaces that have a shiny wax coating or finishing product, use sandpaper to roughen it a bit. This will help the paint to stick better.







, Whenever you spray paint, you should always work outdoors in a well-ventilated area. Spray paint won’t adhere well if it is too cold or wet outside, so wait for a time when humidity is below 65% and it is sunny and at least slightly warm.

Place your newspaper or tarp down with weights (like rocks) to keep it from blowing around in the wind. Be sure to spread it far enough out, otherwise your yard or driveway may have a light misting of color.






Tape off any areas you don’t want painted on your project. Be sure the edges are sealed well to the surface to prevent paint from leaking underneath.






Get your mask and disposable gloves on. These are important for keeping your lungs safe during the painting process."

Pick your oil.,
Spray or rub the oil onto the spray paint.,
Rinse and repeat.",How to Get Spray Paint Off Skin1," Vegetable oiland cooking spraysmade of vegetable oil are often believed to work best, but you could also try other cooking oils, like olive oil or coconut oil, and non-cooking oils, like baby oil. Butter and margarine have even been known to work.


Oil is one of the most effective remedies for removing spray paint from skin. The vast majority of spray paints are oil-based. This means that water will not affect them at all—since oil and water do not mix or bond—but other oils and oil-based products can bond with the paint and lift it away.
If at all possible, you should avoid corrosive oils like turpentine. Such oils are harsh and can very easily irritate the skin, especially if used on sensitive areas. If you must use turpentine, only use it on areas of tougher skin like the feet or hands; never use harsh oils on the face or neck.;
, If you work with cooking spray, you can spray it directly on the paint-covered skin. For other oils, you can soak a cotton ball, cotton pad, or clean rag in a little oil and rub it onto the paint that way.









You could also put those other oils into a spray bottle and spray them onto the skin as you would do with cooking spray.
When applying the oil with a rag or cotton pad, rub the oil into the skin using the material. When applying it in spray form, spray your fingers with a little oil, as well, and scrub at the oil-soaked paint spot with your oil-covered fingers.

, To avoid making a mess or creating further stains in your sink or tub, it is recommended that you rinse the oil and paint off under rapidly running water while it is still wet. Use soap, if necessary, to help strip it away from your skin.








You may not be able to get rid of all the paint after your first attempt. If some still remains, repeat the process as often as necessary to lift it off.

Finish your product.",How to Spray Paint2," Shake the can well before spraying, and then add an even coating of primer to the entire object. Only one coat is necessary, but if you would like to add two it is fine. Wait for the recommended drying time before adding spray paint.

, As with the primer, shake well before using. Apply one slow, even coat over the entirety of your project. It will likely be splotchy and show the original color through the paint, but this problem will be rectified with a second coat of paint.









Test the spray paint on an old board or piece of newspaper to make sure there is no blockage in the nozzle that might prevent an even coating.
Hold the can of paint about 8 inches (20.3 cm) away from your object, and move it back and forward slowly at a rate of about one foot per second.
Don’t apply a heavy coat, as this increases the likelihood for dripping and will be tacky longer which makes it more likely to get smudged. Instead, apply multiple thin coats of paint., Most spray paints require a minimum of 24 hours drying time before applying a second coat. Don’t rush this process, as being patient will give the paint the best adherence and help it to stick longer over time.








, Although this might not always be necessary, applying a second coat for good measure is safe practice. It will guarantee total coverage of your project and the brightest color.








, Allow time for it to dry completely after the second coat, and remove any tape that you used. You’re finished! Clean up all tarp or newspaper and store extra paint in a clean dry area.

Smooth the surface.,
Wipe off any dust or debris.,
Add a coat of primer.",How to Spray Paint3," Because glass, ceramics, and porcelain all have an incredibly smooth surface, it will be too slippery for the paint to adhere well. Use sandpaper to roughen the surface a bit.

, Make sure that none of the shavings from sanding it down are stuck to the glass, as it will cause difficulty with the paint sticking. Use a damp rag or cleaner if desired.

, Glass especially needs primer because it expands and contracts with fluctuations in temperature, making cracks and creases in your paint a big possibility. Add at least one coat prior to painting.


Paint your glass. Using the same basic painting techniques as described above, apply an even coating of paint over your glass or ceramics. Allow time to dry.






Add a second coat of paint if necessary. If you feel that your project is finished with a single coat of paint, then skip this step.

Remove any rust.,
Roughen the surface.,
Clean the metal.,
Prime the metal.,
Paint the surface.",How to Spray Paint4," Rust will not only give a rough surface texture, but it will cause the paint to chip off over time. Use ingredients from your kitchen like vinegar and baking soda or purchase rust remover from a hardware store to do this.


Allow the vinegar or a paste of baking soda and water to sit on the metal for several hours to dissolve away the rust.
Use anything from steel wool to a toothbrush to scrub off the rusty reside after soaking.

, Use sandpaper to remove the sheen from the metal and make it better for the paint to stick to. The metal should lose its gloss and feel a bit rough to the touch.

, After removing the rust and sanding the surface, be sure to give a thorough wipe down to the metal with a damp cloth.

, Add one even coating of primer to the entirety of the surface.

, Follow the same painting tips as aforementioned and give an even coat of paint to the metal. Add multiple coats if desired.

Remove any hardware.,
Remove any varnish or polish.,
Dust off sawdust with a dry cloth.,
Apply a primer.,
Paint the wood.",How to Spray Paint5," You may want to paint this, but do after separating it from the wood so that everything gets a full coat of paint.

, Use an electric sander or sandpaper and rub off as much of the shiny outer coating of the wood as possible.

, Avoid using a damp cloth so that you don’t have to wait for the wood to dry before painting.

, Special wood primers are available, but a regular spray-on primer is all that is necessary.

, Use your spray paint to form an even coat, spraying at at least 8 inches (20.3 cm) from the surface. Apply multiple coats if desired, allowing dry time in between."

Use up as much of the excess paint out of the roller as you can.,
With the roller still on the roller handle, grip the handle and point the downward at arm's length away from you.

,
Insert the roller into the cleaner.,
Using a garden hose with a pistol type nozzle, begin to wet out the paint roller slowly to avoid splash back.

Store roller head in plastic bag, the type you typically get at most grocery and department stores.

",How to Clean Paint Rollers With an EZ Roller Cleaner,";
,, Clamp the handle. The roller head should spin freely.

,, The paint roller should spin in the jet spray of water.

,, The water should run clear.

, Be sure the roller head is soft when dry. A stiff roller indicates that not all paint was removed and the roller should be discarded as it will not provide optimal coverage on your next project.

Put a dollop of lotion on the paint.,
Thoroughly rub the lotion into the skin.,
Let it sit before wiping clean.,
Repeat as needed.",How to Get Spray Paint Off Skin2," Choose a heavy lotion or cream and squeeze a generous amount over the skin stained with spray paint.









Baby lotion is often recommended.Any lotion will do the trick, really, but baby lotion contains little to no added chemicals, fragrances, or dyes, so it is the gentlest and best suited for areas of skin that could be sensitive or prone to irritation.
Lotions, hand creams, foot creams, and similar moisturizing products usually contain oil, which can bond with the oil in spray paints in order to lift it up and off of the skin.

, Scrub the lotion into the skin, restricting it to areas covered by paint. Use your hands to rub the lotion in, applying firm pressure without being abrasive.









Avoid letting the lotion spread to untouched parts of your skin. There is some chance that the paint lifted out and carried into the lotion could spread to previously unstained areas of skin in this manner.

, Let the lotion sit on your skin for one or two minutes before wiping it off with a clean paper towel.









By allowing the lotion to sit, you give it a chance to penetrate the pores deeper, sinking further into the skin and coming into contact with more of the spray paint.
You could also use a clean rag instead of paper towels.

, Depending on how much spray paint you got on your hands and how deeply it sunk into your skin, one application may not be enough. If you notice some change but some paint still remains, repeat this method again until the rest of the paint lifts out.








"
"
Coat the paint-covered skin with petroleum jelly.,
Wipe clean with a paper towel.,
Repeat as needed.",How to Get Spray Paint Off Skin3," Rub a generous amount of petroleum jelly over the paint on your skin, using your fingers and applying firm pressure.









Keep the petroleum jelly restricted to the area contaminated by paint. If you let it spread too far past that area and onto clean skin, there is some risk of spreading the paint onto your previously clean skin, as well, causing the stain to spread.
Petroleum jelly is an oil product, so it is often effective against spray paints, which are largely oil-based, as well.
You could also use other beauty products that use petroleum jelly as their base. Vapor rubs and petroleum jelly products mixed with lotions and creams can even prove more effective due to the added oils and chemicals they contain.

, Wipe the paint and petroleum jelly off simultaneously by passing over them on the skin with a clean paper towel, working in even, straight strokes. Continue until all the petroleum jelly is gone.









You could also use a clean rag, but understand that this rag may end up being stained permanently by the paint.

, If you notice some change, but also see some spray paint left on your skin, repeat the process until all the spray paint has been removed.

Soak a cotton ball or pad in makeup remover.Take a little wad of cotton and dunk it into your favorite eye makeup remover or other type of makeup remover product.,
Scrub the paint with the cotton.,
Repeat as needed.",How to Get Spray Paint Off Skin4,"









You could also use nail polish remover. Acetone-based removers are especially effective, but acetone is a harsh, abrasive cleaner, so you should not use this if you have sensitive skin or if you are getting paint off your face or neck.
You could use a cotton rag, too, but disposable cotton pads are preferred.
If you have makeup wipes, these can be used in place of the liquid remover and cotton.
Makeup remover is designed to lift out stubborn dyes and oils from your skin, so it can be effective against spray paint.

, Thoroughly rub the cotton pad with the makeup remover on it over the skin covered by spray paint. Use firm pressure, but do not rub your skin raw.









Most of the paint should lift up and into the cotton pad directly. You can rinse your skin when done, but any paint that will come off will likely come off into the cotton.

, If some of the paint has still stubbornly stuck onto your skin, you could try another method or repeat this one a few more times. After a few disposable cotton pads soaked in makeup remover, most if not all of the spray paint should wipe away.








"
"
Fold the wipe into a small square.,
Scrub the paint off.,
Repeat as needed.",How to Get Spray Paint Off Skin5," Fold a baby wipe in half lengthwise or vertically, then in half once more crosswise or horizontally. You should have a neat little square wipe.









By folding the wipe, you give it extra layers, making it more resistant to tearing and shredding.
Having a thicker wipe also gives you a little more power than a thin wipe would.
This method is not necessarily the most effective one, but most baby wipes contain cleansers that are gentle on the skin yet strong enough to wipe away big messes left by little ones, so they can generally tackle spray paint, as well.

, Use firm, even pressure to scrub the folded baby wipe over the skin, back and forth, passing over all areas of the stain as you work.









Once one side of the wipe is too covered in paint to be of use, unfold the wipe and flip it around to reveal a new, clean side. Continue unfolding and refolding the baby wipe in this manner until the entire thing is covered in paint.

, If you got a lot of spray paint on your skin, one baby wipe probably won't be enough. You can repeat this method as needed, however, until all the paint does eventually lift off.








"
"
Choose an object with a clean plastic edge.,
Scrape the edge over the paint.,
Rinse and repeat.",How to Get Spray Paint Off Skin6," An old credit card or the handle of a disposable razorboth work well, for instance.


If using a credit card, make sure that you do not use the portion of the card nearest the magnetic strip, since this magnetic strip could get damaged, thereby rendering the card unusable.
If using a disposable razor, make sure that the handle has a blunt, defined edge.
Do not use anything that could cut your skin, and avoid objects made from glass or metal. Sturdy plastic will work best for this method.

, Hold the skin taut with one hand. Use your other hand to gently scrape the paint off your skin, starting from one end of the paint splotch and working your way to the other end.









Note that this will work best if the spray paint has already dried onto your skin. This method may not prove as useful if working with wet or tacky spray paint.

, Thoroughly rinse off the flakes of paint under running water and wipe your skin with a clean paper towel to dry. If you notice additional paint still stuck on your skin, you can try repeating the process to flake it off, as well.









For paint that has seeped too far down into the skin, however, this may not work. Physical force does not lift paint in deeply stained skin up and only takes care of the paint lying on the surface.

Remove the air regulator from the paint.,
Open the lid from the paint cup to pour out any unused material.,
Using paper towels, wipe as much left over material from the cup and lid of the cup as possible.,
Pour a small amount (fill gun throat to overflowing) of waste thinner into the cup.,
Shake the paint gun vigorously ensuring to coat the inside of the cup with thinner.,
Run used thinner into waste thinner container through the fluid nozzle.,
Wipe down all parts with paper towels until dry.

,
Repeat steps four through seven at least once or until satisfied with initial cleaning.

,
Remove the paint cup by turning it counter clock wise until it comes off.,
Remove the fluid needle to avoid bending or damaging the needle during the removal of other parts.,
Take the now revealed spring out, press on the trigger, and pull the fluid needle straight out.,
Remove the air cap on the front of the paint gun by turning it counter clock wise until it comes off.,
When satisfied with secondary cleaning wipe dry and begin rinse with clean thinner.,
Dry all parts with clean paper towels and if available compressed air.,
Reassemble the gun and parts.,
Wipe any excess oil off the gun with clean paper towels.,
After all steps have been completed begin final clean up.",How to Clean an Automotive Paint Gun," The air regulator is the device at the bottom of the gun where compressed air can be hooked up to the bottom of the air gun. Make sure that the compressed air source is disconnected from the regulator first and then you can disconnect the regulator from the gun.;
, You need to make sure you dispose of the waste in the proper containers. There should be at least two containers for the unused material:


Hardened (Catalyzed) Material. This means any materials that do not stay a liquid form but turn into a solid material.
Base coat (Liquid) Material. This means the any material that stays in liquid form.

, By wiping out the excess material will make cleaning out the cup and lid a lot easier with the thinner. Bear in mind that when drying with paper towels paint thinner is a corrosive liquid and easily able to deteriorate and soften the towels being used.

, Waste thinner is also referred to as recycled thinner; it is paint thinner that has been used before. The throat of the gun is in the inside at the very bottom of the cup.

, To elaborate this is to make sure that all the remaining paint or base coat is dissolved by the thinner.

, To do this you point the nozzle into the container and squeeze the trigger like you would in normal operation.

,,, Remove the paint cup lid as well.

, To do this, first remove the fluid adjustment knob, located on the rear of the gun, it is generally the middle knob although this can vary depending on model. Clean all parts with waste thinner as you remove them.

, Again, clean all parts with waste thinner as you remove them.

, Then using the paint gun key find the correct size for the fluid nozzle and remove the fluid nozzle by turning counterclockwise. To reiterate, clean all parts with waste thinner as you remove them.

, Rinse gun body, cup lid, air cap and all parts that have remaining paint, excluding any gaskets. Though this process can be quite repetitive, doing so well only save you from future headaches and you can be assured a clean paint gun.

, Use the compressed air to clean holes and moving parts that can’t be reached with just wiping. Last make sure gun is completely dry after using compressed air, as excess liquids can be blown back onto the surfaces from the pressure on crevices and moving parts.

, Lubricate moving parts and threads as you replace them. You want these parts to be oiled to prevent sticking or seizing of removable and non-removable mechanical moving parts.

, After you have finished the gun is ready for use or storage.

, Start by making sure all waste material is contained in appropriate containers away from any heat source. Next, make sure all work stations and tools are clean and put away. After completion of this step you have a clean, contaminant free paint gun and work station.

Lightly wet the skin.,
Apply pumice soap.,
Rinse and repeat.",How to Get Spray Paint Off Skin7," Spritz your paint-covered skin with a little water or rinse it under a running faucet to get it somewhat damp.









The water alone has no effect on the paint, since most spray paint is oil-based and does not bond or mix with water. The water will help the soap get sudsy, though, maximizing the usefulness of the soap and preventing the abrasive pumice from damaging your skin too severely.

, Use either liquid pumice soap or bar pumice soap to scrub over the spray paint on your skin. If using bar soap, you can scrub the skin directly with the bar. If using liquid soap, scrub the skin with a nylon scrub pad.









Pumice soap is usually used to remove automotive grease and oil from the skin. It is highly abrasive and not recommended for sensitive skin.
For areas of sensitive skin, you can try an exfoliating facial cleanser, instead. While this is not as abrasive, it will still help you exfoliate and scrape away the dead skin cells stained with paint.

, Rinse the skin under running water to remove all traces of soap and paint. If some of the paint still remains, you can repeat the procedure, but do so with caution. Using something as abrasive as pumice soap can cause damage to your skin if used in excess.

Select your paint and thinner.,
Prepare the area where you will paint.,
Put on a mask or respirator, safety glasses, and gloves.,
Prepare the surface to be painted.,
Prime the surface if necessary.",How to Paint with a Compressed Air Sprayer1," Oil based enamels are most easily used with a compressed air sprayer, but acrylics and latex paints can also be sprayed. Adding a suitable thinner will allow more viscous paint to flow freely through the siphon tube, metering valve (fluid) assembly, and nozzle.;
, Place a drop cloth, sheet plastic, scrap lumber or other material on the ground, floor, or any furniture. For ""fixed"" projects, like the one illustrated here, you will need to protect adjacent surfaces and make sure you have adequate ventilation.


Protect nearby surfaces from ""over spray"" with masking or painter's tape and painter's paper or newspapers; in windy, outdoor conditions, airborne paint particles may drift farther than you expect.
Set your paint and thinner on a suitable surface so that spills will not damage anything.

, These will keep you clean and protect you from dangerous fumes and particulates.

, Grind, brush, or sand off rust and corrosion from metal, remove all oil, dust, or dirt, and make sure it is dry. Wash the surface: for oil-based paints, use mineral spirits; for latex or acrylic paints, use soap and water. Rinse thoroughly.

, You can use the sprayer to apply the primer (following the steps below as if it were paint) or apply it with a brush or roller. When you’re done, sand it smooth if needed.

Choose the spray paint you will use.,
Wash the furniture well with soap and water if needed.,
Rub a piece of sandpaper or a wire brush over the furniture to remove any loose old paint or rust.,
Check to be sure to see the furniture is dry before you begin painting.,

Allow the furniture to dry for several hours before placing it in its new home.








",How to Spray Paint Furniture," Make sure it is the right spray paint for the type of furniture you are trying to paint. You can purchase special spray paint for outdoor furniture. Pick a color and texture that you like. Check the can to see how much you will need to buy to cover your furniture completely.






;
, You want the piece of furniture to be completely clean before you begin spray painting.








, If the piece of furniture is unfinished, you may still want to complete this step to remove any splinters. Using sandpaper on any surface will rough it up and help the paint to stick to the surface. Wipe the furniture with a damp cloth after completing this step.








, After you finish cleaning and sanding, you will want to be sure the piece has time to dry or the paint will not stick.








, You can use a screwdriver to remove hinges, doorknobs and any other removable parts.








,, You may want to put something underneath the furniture, such as newspaper or plastic, to protect the ground.








, This ensures that the paint goes on in thin coats.








, Keep the can moving to prevent running from too much paint being applied in one spot.








, Check the paint can to see that this drying time is accurate for the type of paint you are using.








, If you get too close, you will cause the paint to run.

Turn on the air compressor.,
Adjust the regulator on the compressor to between 12 and 25 PSI (pounds per square inch).,
Attach the air hose coupling to the sprayer.,
Pour a small amount of paint thinner into the paint cup.,
Open the metering valve slightly.,
Prime the sprayer.,
Empty the spray cup of any remaining thinner.",How to Paint with a Compressed Air Sprayer2," You will use some air for priming and testing your sprayer, so let it build up pressure while you get your paint ready. The compressor should have a regulator to allow you to set the pressure for the sprayer correctly; otherwise, fluctuations will occur as the pressure rises and falls while you are spraying.

, The exact amount will vary depending on your sprayer, so look at the manual (or the equipment itself) for details.

, Make sure it is tight; you may want to wrap the threads with Teflon tape to insure an airtight seal. This does not apply if your sprayer and hose are equipped with quick connect couplings.

, (This is the reservoir attached to the bottom of your spray gun.) Use just enough to submerge the siphon tube in it.

, This is usually the lower of two screws above the handle (pistol grip) of the sprayer.

, Aim the nozzle into a waste bucket and squeeze the trigger. It usually takes a few seconds for the sprayer system to prime with liquid, so at first, only air will come out of the nozzle. After a moment, you should get a flow of paint thinner. If no thinner comes out of the nozzle, you may have to disassemble the sprayer to check for stoppages or loose seals in the siphon tube assembly.

, A funnel helps, here, so you can return it to the original container. Mineral spirits and turpentine (two common thinners) are flammable solvents, and should only be stored in their original containers.

Mix enough paint to do your project.,
Thin the paint with a suitable thinner.,
Fill the paint cup about 2/3 of the way with paint and lock it onto the sprayer.,
Hold the sprayer about 5–10 inches (12.7–25.4 cm) from the surface.,
Squeeze the trigger to spray the paint.,
Overlap each pass slightly.,
Refill the paint cup as needed until the project is done.,
Allow the paint to dry, then re coat if desired.",How to Paint with a Compressed Air Sprayer3," After opening your can of paint, mix it thoroughly, then pour enough of it to do the job into a separate, clean container. If the paint has been stored for any length of time, it is a good idea to strain it through a paint filter to remove any lumps of hardened paint which may have formed. These lumps can stop up the siphon tube or the metering valve, causing the flow of paint to stop.

, The exact ratio of paint to thinner will depend on your paint, sprayer, and nozzle type, but the paint should usually be thinned by about 15 to 20% for a good flow. Notice how thin the paint looks when you use an aerosol spray paint; this will give you an idea of what you are looking for.

, Whether the spray cup attaches to the bottom of the sprayer with a clamping assembly and hooks or screws on, be sure to attach it securely; you do not want the spray cup to drop off suddenly while in use.

, Practice moving the spray gun in a side to side, or up and down sweeping motion, parallel to the surface. If you have never used this type of paint applicator before, practice holding and swinging it for a moment to get a feel for the balance and weight.

, Keep the sprayer moving whenever the trigger is squeezed to avoid drips and runs caused by over application.


It’s best to test-paint a piece of scrap wood or cardboard before tackling the main job. This way, you can adjust the nozzle if necessary to get a finer spray pattern.

, This way, the ""feathered"" edges of the spray pattern don’t leave thin spots in your paint job. Watch for drips and runs, moving fast enough to keep the paint from getting thick as you spray.

, Do not allow the sprayer to sit with paint in it; if you need a break, remove the cup and spray some thinner through the sprayer before leaving it unused.

, For most paints, a good, even ""wet"" coat is sufficient, but a second coat may give a more durable finish. Sanding between coats is recommended for varnishes, polyurethane finishes, and other glossy paints to improve the bond between the coats.

"
"
Pour out the unused paint.,
Rinse the siphon tube and cup with thinner.,
Fill the spray cup about 1/4 of the way with paint thinner, slosh it around, and spray it through the sprayer until it comes out clear.,
Remove all masking tape and paper from your work area.",How to Paint with a Compressed Air Sprayer4," If you have a significant amount of paint left, you can return it to the original can; remember, however, that the amount you return to the can has already been thinned, meaning the next time you use it, you may need to adjust the amount of thinner used.


Epoxy paints and paints that use a catalyst (two-part paints) cannot be returned to the original can; they must be used entirely or disposed of properly once mixed.

, Wipe off/out any excess paint.

, If there is too much paint left in the cup or the spray assembly, you may have to repeat this step a few times.

, Do this as soon as the paint job has dried; leaving the tape on the surface for an extended period will allow the adhesive to set, making it difficult to remove.

Find suitable objects.,
Find stencils with which to work.,
Choose your spray paints.,
Coat a solid cover of paint as the base.,
Consider whether you will spray one side or two sides at a time.,
Hold the stencil as close as you can to the item.,
Decorate with stickers if desired.

",How to Stencil an Item Using Spray Paint," They can be metal or plastic. Some items may need a primer for real color to stick. You may have to use several coats of paint.;
, Any number of weird or normal things can be found that would make a cool stencil. Choose something with a unique spacing or design. Even a toy railroad track or ping pong net might work. Or create your own out of cardboard or thick paper. If you want to make your own stencils, the best material to use is transparent overhead sheets because they are sturdy and reusable.

, Pick colors you have around for a cheap redo of tins. Or if you want, buy something fresh for the job in the color scheme you want. Do not mix and match faux crackle paints with regular because they are not made to mix with other paints. They may refuse to dry and ruin your work when sprayed over or put under other paints. You will have enough variety without them, just using the stencils and your creative hand.

, You may have to think backwards as you plan, so that the color you want in the design shape is laid down first. Make sure you cover any pre-printed writing on the can at this stage because you don't want to have to come back and retouch after your never-to-be-repeated-exactly stencil spraying has occurred.

, This will affect your overall theme for the tin when completed. And sometimes it's hard to remember what color was used on the bottom if you do multiple items over multiple drying days. Don't be afraid of trying a new color or pattern. Just consider it all experimentation and have fun.

, Have a light touch with the spray paint. Spritz in short blasts till you know how your paint adheres. Some paints go on wet and sloppy and need lots of level drying time. But don't worry if they run or bleed into a mess. Just go right over it with another color and call it your own special design. This is where you might need cheap gloves to prevent your stencil-holding hand from being sprayed.


Multiple stencils can be used on an item. If sprayed wet (before first coat has dried), do less spraying with the second color. Spraying when still wet creates a different effect as the colors swirl and affect each other. Of course, items sprayed can be left to totally dry between coats.

Test the spray painted sofa out.",How to Spray Paint Your Sofa," Obviously, if you already have a dingy, past-its-used-by date sofa hanging around that you're just about to toss, it'll be the ideal candidate. Just be sure to ask all those invested in the sofa if it's okay to change its look.––You'll probably find everyone is in agreement with either changing it or ditching it provided they don't have to do the work! It's also a good idea to agree on the new color you'll spray paint the sofa before going ahead––ask your spouse, housemates or anyone else affected for their thoughts on preferred colors. If you're the only one in the house who really cares about color matching though, you're probably clear to get going. One other thing––this article is concerned with fabric-covered sofas. You'll have to find a different option for leather, polyester or vinyl covered sofas, which will need different treatment and coverings because they are generally paint-resistant.


The sofa doesn't have to be one in your home. Maybe you saw a fantastic sofa down the local thrift store going for a song but hated the color or feel it needs sprucing up. Don't hold back.––The spray paint solution might be just the motivation needed to go ahead and buy that old couch.
If you want to change a new sofa's color, be sure everyone agrees with the move. People who love the new sofa are bound to be rather more touchy about changing its look while it's still in great condition.
One way to test the suitability of a couch for painting is to add a drop of water. Where the water sinks into the couch, it will usually be fine to spray paint. On the other hand, if the water beads up, it'll probably resist the addition of paint.





;
, It's a good idea to keep the color change as simple as possible because it's a lot of effort to spray paint a sofa and any deviation from one simple color will increase the effort and challenge. The color should be either neutral or one that fits in with your existing decor. Neutral colors have the advantage of being open to any color addition by way of cushions, etc. If you do want to paint the sofa more than one color (for example, say wide stripes or differently colored seat cushions from the rest of the sofa), be sure to match the colors well., For a fabric sofa, you'll need special industrial fabric paint able to cover the sofa evenly and can handle the sofa fabric. Don't use the usual spray paints sold in a hardware store––the end effect will be a crunchy, flaky sofa that nobody will dare sit on. Instead, choose specially formulated sofa/fabric spray paint, available from craft store and furniture renovation stores. The retailer will be able to assist you with questions about particular brands and colors.


Make sure the paint is formulated for the same fabric type used on your sofa. Check to see if the paint can lists sofas or couches as one of the compatible fabrics, as not all fabric paint works well on sofas. If it doesn't specify a sofa, talk directly to the retailer or even the manufacturer of the paint. Sending an email to the manufacturer can be a good way of getting some certainty.
You might also get away with adding a textile medium to an acrylic or latex paint; the addition of a textile medium can make the standard paint more flexible for use on fabric than it would otherwise be.In this case, you'll need to roll on the paint or use a paintbrush rather than spray painting the sofa.

, It's a really good idea to steam clean the sofa, or even to have it professionally cleaned, before proceeding. This will remove stains, pieces of stuck-on food, fluff and any other accumulated debris, giving you the artist's proverbial clean canvas. If you look for special deals, you can often get a good price for a professional to come around and clean the sofa; if all the carpets need a cleaning, ask for a deal on adding the sofa in too.


As well as cleaning, take this opportunity to repair rips and gouges in the sofa. These won't disappear post-painting and will continue to widen with the pressure of sitting. If you feel capable, mend the tears yourself with industrial strength thread, or have a professional seamstress or furniture repairer come by to fix them. Avoid the duct tape solution––it may seem bright at the time but it'll ease its way off and create even larger tears as it does so.






If you need to replace springs, start considering whether the cost is worth the effort versus a new sofa. If you can get the springs fixed and keep the costs down, then repair may be a good option, otherwise it might be better to get the sofa recycled and start anew.






Remove the cushions from the couch to be sprayed separately or completely recovered in new fabric that matches the paint. Cover the part under the cushions with a sheet adhered with painter's tape so that it won't get sprayed too.






Cover every part of the couch you don't want to spray paint with painter's tape/masking tape, such as the wooden legs, wooden edging, wooden armrests, whatever. If you're doing more than one color, you'll need to cover all parts not getting sprayed that color with a drop cloth that is neatly taped to a perfect edge next to the area to be sprayed. Absolutely everything you do not want spray painted must be covered to protect it.







, You're going to be spray painting, which means that you need to be somewhere that paint can drift without affecting surrounding items and you'll need excellent ventilation (lack of ventilation when working with paint fumes can make you feel woozy and sick and can even harm your health). The garage, an outdoor driveway, a large room, etc. are probably ideal places––with rooms and the garage, be sure to keep open all windows and doors; if the area has a fan, use it to draw out the paint fumes. Just be aware that if painting outdoors, you'll either need perfectly dry, sunny weather over a week or so, or you'll need to keep bringing the sofa indoors to dry, as each layer requires several days to dry before the next layer can be added.


Use plenty of drop sheets to cover everything in the area; drifting paint will land on items and potentially stain them. Cover walls, the floor and fittings as well as furnishings. Old sheets can be found in thrift stores if you don't have your own. Drop cloths are sold at most hardware stores and are very affordable and are usually reusable again and again.






Set up a station for the paint, rags, brushes (for fine corner work), paint thinner and anything else needed. Keep this within reach of the sofa workspace. (The paint thinner helps if you make a mistake––you can simply wipe off the paint quickly with the thinner on a rag.)







, As well as ventilation, you might consider wearing a respiratory mask to avoid breathing in the paint fumes. Wearing gloves is a good idea too, to prevent stains on your skin and be sure to wear old clothes and shoes, as you will end up getting paint all over them. Tie back any long hair to protect it and consider wearing goggles to protect your eyes from stray paint.

, You can always test the paint colors out on an unseen part of the sofa first, to see how the color takes and what it feels like. It's recommended that you do this before spraying the whole sofa and finding out you can't stand the end result. Head around to the sofa’s backside and spray a little where no one can see.


As well as color, check for compatibility of the paint with the sofa. Check that it dries evenly, doesn't rub off after drying and looks okay. Drizzle a little water on the painted test spot after drying, then rub a white or light cloth over it to see if the paint stays in place. If any paint comes off, the paint brand is not appropriate with the sofa fabric and you'll need to try another one––you don't want clothes and skin stains caused by the newly painted sofa.







, In each case, spray paint a thin base coat first, allow it to dry, then add more coats, always aiming for an even consistency overall. Wipe off any drips quickly, or use a brush to smooth them into the remaining paint evenly.

Use a fine paintbrush for easing the spray paint into corners, into fabric details or over ridges/into dents in the fabric that the spray paint might either miss or not cover evenly.
If hairs come off a paintbrush used for detailed corner work, remove immediately as these will look unprofessional if they dry onto the sofa.

, Continue to be on the safe side and start with the back of the sofa. Begin at the top and spray paint thin, even lines, overlapping as you move downward. This initial coat may look streaky and thin but that’s okay, because you're actually laying down the foundation for subsequent coats.


Don’t worry if couch patterns or colors are still visible after painting. Remember that dark spray paint colors may cover patterns or old colors quicker than lighter colors. You may need to do more passes with a lighter spray paint color.







, Then move to the arms and the front of the sofa, each time painting as in the previous step to achieve a base coat of paint. Then, if you are spray painting the cushions, do these separately (they will need to be turned over, so this can take a while to allow the painted sides to dry enough before painting the unpainted sides).


It may be a better option to recover the cushions in a fabric that matches the paintwork on the sofa. This gives you the opportunity to throw in some contrasting patterns or textures and it's a lot easier to cover cushion rectangles or squares than it is to cover the whole couch with fabric.

, This time is essential to determine that the couch color works for you and that the paint is adhering properly to the sofa fabric. After three days, rub the paint with a white towel to make sure the paint has dried and bonded to the sofa fabric. The base coat will give you a good idea of whether this type of paint and/or color is right for your couch.

, As outlined above, methodically spray paint each part of the couch until the sofa has a second layer. Each time you spray paint a layer, add one layer at a time, waiting a few days in between coats. While this probable seems like a long, drawn out process, it's the only way to guarantee a decent final outcome.


In each case, aim for consistency of the coats. Avoid spraying on too much paint each layer; aim for a smooth, consistent look.

, The final appearance is a matter of personal taste. Just be sure to avoid spraying too much paint on or the couch may feel like a crunchy papier mâché project to sit on! In many cases, only one layer more will be needed over the base layer.


After you're satisfied with the paint outcome, rub the couch down with a white towel to remove any napping fabrics or paint clumps.

, Sit down with your friends, a fine drink and a favorite movie to give it a trial run. If your friends are attentive, you might even get a compliment![[Image:Spray Paint Your Sofa Step 14 - Version 2.jpg}}"

Texturize the surface of the sheet metal.,
Clean the sheet metal.,
Protect areas you don't want painted.",How to Paint Sheet Metal for Home Decorating1,"


Analyze the surface of the sheet metal. If the sheet metal is smooth to the touch, you will need to texturize it before painting.
Create a rough surface on the sheet metal. Using high-grit sandpaper or steel wool, rub the surface of the sheet metal. This will allow the paint to adhere to the metal. Create a light, even texture on the surface and avoid making deep grooves in the metal. To remove stubborn rust spots, use a drill with a circular wire brush attachment.;
, A clean surface will allow the paint to adhere better to the sheet metal and will create a more attractive finish.


Spray the sheet metal with white vinegar and wipe it down with a clean rag. The vinegar's acidity will further abrade the sheet metal.
Spray the metal with compressed air. This will remove any dust and dirt from the surface of the sheet metal.

, If there are areas of the sheet metal that will not be painted, cover them with painter's tape or masking tape.

Choose the type of pattern you want to create.,
Tape your walls for perfection.,
Pick a color scheme.,
Use a small roller to paint the stripes rather than a paint brush.",How to Paint Stripes on a Wall1," Stripes can be thick or thin, horizontal or vertical, or patterned in various ways.;
, Taping is the trickiest part of painting stripes on walls because of the tendency for the paint to bleed under the tape.


Use low-tack painter's tape and seal each tape edge with a thin coat of the wall's base color to prevent paint from seeping under the tape. Let it dry before beginning to paint the stripes.

, Know which colors blends well and don't. Do you want your color to make the room bold, inviting, warm, cool, contemplative, or anything between?


Monochromatic schemes are similar tonal combinations that use several shades of a single color for a subtle scheme. This scheme is accomplished by adding black and white to the original color to slightly alter the hue.
Analogous schemes combine colors that are similar in tone and feel but are not the same hue. For example, orange, yellow, and green would be an analogous scheme that creates a soft contrast.
Contrast schemes are composed of colors dissimilar in hue from each other. This adventurous yet balanced palate might combine three hues evenly spaced apart from each other on the color wheel.
Complementary schemes use two hues opposite one another on the color wheel for an intense variation that livens up any room. One example of such a scheme is blue and orange.

, The smaller the roller, the more control you have over where the paint goes. Rollers create a smoother, fuller finish than paint brushes.

"
"
Prime the sheet metal with an oil-based primer or a rust-resistant latex primer.",How to Paint Sheet Metal for Home Decorating2," A primer, sometimes referred to as an undercoat, is a preparatory substance that allows paint to adhere better to surfaces. The primer also adds a layer of rust-protective coating to the metal and keeps the paint from peeling.


Brush or spray on the primer. Rust-resistant primers are available in both spray paint and brush-on options. Apply 2 thin coats of the primer, allowing the first coat to dry completely before applying the second coat.

"
"
Choose a paint created specifically for metal.,
Apply paint with a brush or roller.,
Spray paint the sheet metal as an alternative to painting with a brush.",How to Paint Sheet Metal for Home Decorating3," Choose an acrylic latex semi-gloss, a gloss enamel or an oil-based semi-gloss paint. Paints designed for use on metal will resist rust and will be more durable than traditional wall paints.

, Sheet metal paint is available in both spray paint and brush-on options. Both types of paint work well for home decorating purposes.

Choose a brush or roller size appropriate for your sheet metal project. If the sheet metal is large, select a wide brush or roller; if the sheet metal is small, choose a smaller brush or roller. For best paint control, hold the brush at the base of the handle near the bristles.






Apply 2 coats of the paint, allowing the first coat to dry completely before applying the second coat.







,

Shake the spray paint can vigorously for 1 or 2 minutes before painting the sheet metal.






Test the nozzle before applying paint to the sheet metal. Spray a small amount of paint on a newspaper or piece of cardboard to ensure the nozzle is working correctly and sprays paint evenly.






Apply spray paint to the sheet metal. Hold the spray paint can 12 to 24 inches (30.4 to 60.9 cm) from the surface. Spray in a quick, smooth and even pattern until the surface is covered. For best results, keep the can parallel to the sheet metal surface and spray in a back and forth motion over the surface.

Add bold, eye-catching pizzazz to any room by painting chevron stripes on your walls.,
Choose colors that fit your intention.,
Plot the points that will act as the peaks of the stripes, and the points that will act as the valleys of the stripes with your pencil, using a level to insure that your points are even.,
Tape on the outside of the plotted points, laying it down peak to valley, valley to peak.,
Using the base coat color, paint over the stripes and the outside edges of the tape with your roller.,
Dab a little bit of the correct colored paint between the tape before painting to give yourself a color guide for painting each stripe.

,
Finally, paint the stripes and let them dry fully overnight before removing the tape.

",How to Paint Stripes on a Wall2," The zig-zag pattern is a classic technique used primarily for creating accent walls, meaning one wall in a particular room that is painted differently than the others.

, Chevron stripes are extremely eye-catching, so if you want them to stand out as the boldest accent in the room, choose complimentary colors or contrast schemes. For a more subtle, sophisticated look, opt for a monochromatic scheme.

,


The valley points should be halfway between the peak points, though there is no specific length that each chevron stripe needs to be. The shorter the distance between peaks, the sharper the point will be.

, Make sure the tape is sealed tightly against the wall

, This step helps to prevent the other colors from seeping under the tape.

Create an illusion of depth and openness with vertical or horizontal stripes in your home.,
Select your colors and paint the entire wall with your base coat color.,
Decide what you want the width of the stripes to be and mark the stripe width using a tape ruler and the green pencil, starting at the top of the wall.,
Using either a traditional carpenter's level or a laser level, connect the markings with the green pencil to create the stripes.

,
Press tape firmly on the outside the pencil outline.,
Paint a second coat of your base paint over the stripes.,
Allow this second base coat to dry and then fill in the stripes with the the other color or colors you have chosen.,
Let the walls dry overnight and peel off the tape to reveal your new room.

",How to Paint Stripes on a Wall3," Vertical and horizontal stripes are great for small rooms, as they will open the space and make the room appear larger.

, Allow the paint to dry.

, Continue to measure and mark the stripe width at lower intervals on the wall.


If you want fewer, but bigger stripes, space them farther apart.
If you want asymmetrical stripes, place the tape at different widths to create a more varied look of random stripe sizes.

,, Place a small X with painter's tape over the stripes that you want to remain the base color.

, This prevents bleeding from occurring.

, Repeat with a second coat of paint if necessary.

Make sure that the wall is clean.,
Prepare your work area.,
Protect your clothes.,
Consider practicing your design on a piece of cardboard first.,
Consider giving the entire wall a fresh coat of paint first.",How to Paint Designs on Walls1," If the wall is dirty, the paint may not stick to it. Wash the wall using a microfiber cloth and a solution made of one part mild dish soap and four parts warm water. Dry the wall afterwards with a clean cloth., Spread a drop cloth, some newspapers, cardboard, or a plastic tarp down on the floor where you will be working. This is to catch any paint drips or spills and protect your floor. You will also want to have all your paints, brushes, tape, and paper towels handy.

, Put on a painter's smock or some old clothes that you don't mind getting dirty. If you have very sensitive skin, you might want to consider putting on a pair of vinyl or latex gloves, although most acrylic paints are considered to be safe and non-toxic.

, If you are planning on using stencils for the first time, you might want to practice on a piece of cardboard first. This will allow you to get the feel for your foam roller or stencil brush first. It will also allow you to develop the right technique before you move onto your actual wall.You can even paint the cardboard the same color as your wall first. This will not only give you a similar texture, but it will also give you an idea of how the final colors will look like,

, This can be the same color as before, or a whole new color. Be sure to use an indoor latex house paint. Keep in mind, however, that if you are using reverse stencils, the color you are using right now will be the color of your shapes or designs.

Measure the ceiling.,
Examine the available lighting.,
Decide what level of realism you want.,
Determine where the planets will be on the ceiling.",How to Paint the Solar System on a Ceiling1," This determines the size of the ""canvas"" you have to work with. For a small room, you may not have enough room to paint all the planets on the ceiling. You can choose to put the outermost planets on the upper walls or limit the painting of the solar system to only the planets visible to the naked eye (Mercury through Saturn).


With Pluto's 2006 demotion to the status of dwarf planet, one option is to paint the recognized eight planets of the solar system on the ceiling and Pluto on the upper wall. This both represents Pluto's new status and that the angle of its orbit (17 degrees) is greater than that of the regular planets.;
, Look at how much natural light enters the room. This will determine how dark you can make the sky when painting the solar system. If there isn't enough light in the room to allow a black sky, you can use a dark or medium blue for it instead.


You can also use phosphorescent (glow in the dark) paints for some or all of the planetary features, such as Saturn's rings or Jupiter's Great Red Spot, as well as for representations of planetary satellites, asteroids, or ancillary stars.
If the ceiling has a central light, you can use it for the sun. If the room's electric lighting comes from another source, such as a wall or table lamp, then you'll want to paint a sun in the center of the ceiling.

, You need to have the solar system's planets in the correct order from the sun (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) and correctly sized from largest to smallest (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Earth, Venus, Mars, Mercury). Beyond that, you only need to include enough of each planet's distinctive features to make it recognizable as one of the planets in our solar system. The level of realism you choose should be determined by these factors:


Your budget.
Your painting skills.
Your child's age. For younger children, lighter colors for the sky and planets are more appropriate, while older children can better handle a black sky. (A decorating option for teenagers would be to use fluorescent paints to paint the planets to represent the false color imaging astronomers use to make certain planetary features more distinct.)

, While you need to have the planets in the correct order from the sun, you should arrange their positions so the overall solar system painting will look balanced. Similar-sized planets (Uranus and Neptune, Earth and Venus) can be placed on opposite sides of the sun, or larger planets can be placed opposite smaller planets.


One way to do this is to take a picture of the ceiling and experiment with various planetary positions. You can either use cutout circles with a printed picture, or upload the picture into a graphic editing program and use digital images of the planets, each in its own layer. Move the planets around until you find the layout that looks best to you and your child.

Let it dry.,
Prepare your trowel.,
Apply the first coat.,
Apply the second coat.,
Let it dry.,
Burnish the surface.,
Apply a topcoat.",How to Venetian Plaster," Venetian plaster comes in two varieties: synthetic and lime-based. Which one you use will depend on your budget and level of expertise.


Lime-based plasters are true Venetian plasters. These plasters will, over time, turn to stone.Unlike the ""faux-finish"" of synthetic plasters, they are durable and and retain their beauty longer. On the other hand, true Venetian plaster is harder to come by, more expensive, and more challenging to work with.Lime-based Venetian plasters are natural and considered more environmentally friendly than synthetics. They are also naturally resistant to molds and mildews.Lime-based plaster comes in many different colors, and you can also tint it yourself with a lime-based tint.
Synthetic Venetian plaster is an acrylic-based substitute available at any home improvement store. It will result in a similar look to the traditional lime-based plaster, and is less expensive. However, synthetic plaster does not have the life of traditional Venetian plaster. It is more easily damaged and harder to touch up.Synthetic plaster comes in many different colors and is thought to take vibrant colors better than lime-based Venetian plaster.;
, To protect the floor in your work area, it is a good idea to lay down tarps, just as you would if you were painting.


Do not users painter's tape to protect molding or other walls you are not plastering. Plaster is not paint. It may bond to the tape and crack or flake when the tape is removed.This is especially true if you are working with lime-based plaster.

, Fill any holes or dimples in the wall, otherwise they may show through your finished work.


If the wall you plan to plaster has a very bumpy surface, you may need to sand the wall in its entirety or even scrape it with a putty knife.If using synthetic plaster, you can also fill holes in the wall with plaster as you go., Using a paint roller, spread the primer across the wall evenly and lightly. Depending on the texture of the walls you are plastering, you may need to let it dry and then apply a second coat to get a smooth, even surface.


For lime-based plasters, you will need to either apply the plaster directly to stucco or masonry, or use a special primer called fondo.Natural Venetian plaster will not adhere well to standard primers.

, Make certain your primer is fully dried before you apply any plaster.


This may take up to 24 hours.

, Using 100 grit sandpaper, round the the corners of a flexible steel trowel. This will reduce edge marks during application., Using your trowel, apply a base coat of plaster. Using small strokes, spread your plaster as thinly as possible. Apply using random strokes, or work in patterns, just don't spread it all in the same direction.


Hold the trowel at a 15 to 30 degree angle, and wipe it often with a clean, dry cloth to prevent dried bits of plaster from affecting your pattern.It is a good idea to start at the top, in a corner.
To get plaster into tight spots, such as in a corner or along molding, simply apply the plaster with your finger using latex gloves. Then, immediately wipe away any plaster that gets on surfaces you are not plastering.If using traditional Venetian plaster, hang tarps over your surface so that it will dry slowly and evenly. Otherwise, it may crack., If using synthetic plaster, apply the second coat about four hours after applying the first coat.If using lime-based plaster, some experts recommend waiting as long as ten days between coats.Start in the same place you began applying the first coat. Hold the trowel at a 30 to 60 degree angle, and apply your plaster in long and short overlapping strokes to get the irregular look the final finish should have.If you unsatisfied with the final product after applying the second coat, you may apply a third coat if you wish.
If you are lime-based plaster, it is at this stage that you add a tinted topcoat of lime dust, linseed oil, soap, and a coloring agent., All plaster should be completely dry before you proceed any further.


As before, if using lime-based plaster, hang tarps to make the drying process more even and gradual.

, Go over the final coat it in a circular motion with a clean trowel, held at a 30 degree angle to give it a polished look.The more you burnish your plaster, the shinier it will become.


For synthetic plaster, you can also burnish with 400-600 grit sandpaper if you prefer. This will provide a more matte-like finish.Synthetic plasters can be burnished any time between about four hours and seven days after the last coat has been applied., To preserve the polish and durability of your finished plaster surface, it's a good idea to go over it with a topcoat of some kind.


If you are using synthetic plaster, there are commercial topcoats produced specifically for this purpose. Some of them even come in different colors if you decide you want to change the color of your wall after applying the plaster.You can also finish your plaster with beeswax or linseed oil to help protect it. This may, however, change the color slightly.For lime-based plaster, the final coat is sometimes made of an olive-oil based soap, which will form a compound with the wax and seal the plaster."

You can even go back over the stencil with a second color to add shading. Be sure to give yourself plenty of time for this project, however, as stenciling can take a while. Here's a list of what you will need:


Wall stencils
Painter's tape or repositionable spray adhesive
Foam roller or good quality stencil brush
Acrylic paint or wall paint
Paint pan or paint palette
Paper towels;
, You can place it anywhere you want. If you want to cover your entire wall with the design, you can start off by placing it in the top left corner of your wall or right in the middle of your wall. Once you know where you want your stencil, trace the corners lightly with a pencil. You can also outline the corners with some painter's tape.Consider using a level tool to ensure that your stencil is straight. It looks like a metal or plastic ruler, with a short, fluid-filled tube in the middle of it. The air bubble inside the tube moves around as you tilt the level about. Your project is leveled if the bubble is in the middle of the tube.

, You can do this by taping it to the wall along the edges with painter's tape. You can also spray the back with a repositionable spray adhesive, wait for the adhesive to get tacky, then press the stencil against the wall.


Consider sealing the edges off with a few rows of painter's tape, especially if the design on your stencil is close to the edge. The painter's tape will prevent you from accidentally going over the edges of the stencil and painting the wall by mistake.

, Acrylic paint would be great for small areas, but if you are stenciling your entire wall, you might want to consider some wall paint instead. Choose a finish that matches the original finish of your wall: glossy, satin, eggshell, matte, etc. Do not pour too much paint out at once, or the paint will dry before you can use all of it. This way, you won't be wasting any paint.


If you are using a foam roller, pour the paint out onto a paint pan. Foam rollers are great for covering large stencils and large areas.
If you are using a stencil brush, pour the paint out onto a paint palette. Stencil brushes are great for covering small stencils. They are also good for designs with multiple colors.

, You don't want to apply too much paint all at once, or you might get drips. The paint may also leak under the stencil and create blotches. Because of this, it is much better to apply many thin coats of paint rather than one thick coat.


If you are working with a stencil brush, you can tape several folded paper towels onto the wall next to your work.This way, you can hold the palette in one hand and the brush in the other. Everything will be close by. Just make sure that your paper towels are folded thick enough so that the paint does not bleed through them and onto the wall.

, Apply the paint using light to medium pressure. You don't want to press down too hard with your brush or foam roller, or you will squish the paint out and create blob.Work with one color at a time, and use a fresh paint roller or brush when you do.


If you are using a foam roller, simply roll back and forth lightly across the pencil.
If you are using a stencil brush, lightly tap the brush over the stencil.

, At some point, you will probably need to reload the roller or brush with more paint. Do this only when your roller or brush completely runs out of paint.Whenever you dip your roller or brush into paint, be sure to tap the excess paint off onto a paper towel.


If you accidentally painted outside the stencil, wipe the paint off using a damp paper towel or a baby wipe.Consider adding some shading to your design using a stencil brush. Use a slightly darker color to do this, not straight black. This will look more realistic. A great places to use shading is around the edges or tips of your design., If some paint got under the stencil and onto the wall, use a damp Q-tip to clean the excess paint off. If there are any gaps along the edges of your design, use a thin paintbrush and some extra paint to fill in those gaps.If you painted a design, such as a branch with flowers and leaves, your stencil may have left some gaps between the different shapes. You can fill those gaps in using a thin paintbrush and extra paint for a more authentic, hand painted look., If you plan on reusing the stencil, double-check underneath it. If any paint got underneath the stencil, you might end up transferring that paint into your wall. If you see any leaked paint, wipe it off using a damp paper towel.

, If you attached your stencil using painter's tape, pull off the old pieces and use new ones. If you used repositionable spray adhesive, you may need to re-spray the back before you press the stencil down again.

, Refer to the label on your paint can or bottle. Just because something is dry to the touch does not necessarily mean it is fully dry. Most acrylic paints will be dry in 20 minutes, while some may require up to two hours. Latex wall paints will require a much longer drying and curing time.

Cardstock
Craft knife
Double-sided tape or repositionable spray adhesive
Foam roller or paint sponges
Acrylic paint or wall paint
Paint pan or paint palette
Paper towels

, You can also use template plastic, or blank stencil sheeting as well.


You can find template plastic in the quilting section of a fabric store.
You can find blank stencil sheeting in the stencil section of an arts and crafts store.

, You can also spray the back of each shape with repositionable spray adhesive.

, You can create a grid or checkered pattern. You can also use a completely random pattern.


If you are using shapes of different sizes, consider arranging them in an asymmetric clump. Keep the larger shapes towards the center, and the smaller shapes towards the edges/ends.

, Don't pour out a whole lot, or the paint will dry out before you can finish using it. You can always pour more paint out into your paint pan or paint palette. If you are painting a large area, consider using wall paint. If you are painting just a small area, any acrylic paint will do.


If you are using a paint roller to apply the paint, you might find a paint pan easier to use.
If you are using a small paint sponge, you might find a paint palette easier to work with.

, This will prevent you from applying too much paint all at once. If you apply too much paint at one time, the paint may not dry or cure properly. It may also end up with a bubbly texture. Because of this, it is much better to apply many thin coats of paint rather than one thick coat.

, Simply roll the foam paint roller across the entire wall, including your shapes. If you want a softer look, you can gently tap around your shapes with a paint sponge.

, Wait for the paint to dry, then apply a second coat. If you are taping the paint on with a sponge, you can even use a slightly lighter or darker color.

, If you remove the shapes after the paint dries, you will risk accidentally chipping the paint. Gently peel the shapes off using your fingernail.

, Look over your design, and fill in any gaps using a thin brush and some extra paint. If you got paint where you don't want it to be, wipe it off using a damp Q-tip.

, Most acrylic paints will dry within 20 minutes to two hours. Latex wall paints have a different composition and may require four to six hours to dry, if not more. Refer to the label on the can or bottle for more specific drying times.

Make any touchup after the paint has dried.",How to Paint Designs on Walls4," Painting designs straight onto the wall without any stencils can be difficult, but it can also be a lot of fun. The result is unique, and each brushstroke is filled with beauty. This is a great technique for organic designs, such as curling vines and twisting branches. Here's a list of what you will need:


Paintbrushes
Acrylic paint
Paint palette
Chalk, pencils, or watercolor pencils
Cup of water
Painter's tape (optional)
Paper towels

, Use a light color for the outlines if your wall is dark. Use a dark color for your outlines if your wall is light. Start with the largest shapes first, then move onto the smaller ones. For example, if you are painting a cherry blossom branch, sketch out the branch first, then add the flowers. You don't need to add the details just yet, since your paint will likely cover those up. You will be painting your design on in layers.


Consider using watercolor pencils that match your paint color. This will make them less visible once the paint dries. For example, if you are outlining a brown branch, use a brown watercolor pencil. If you are outlining some green leaves, use a green watercolor pencil.

, Pour some paint right out onto your paint palette. You will be starting from the largest shapes first. Avoid pouring out too much paint at one time. Acrylic paint dries fast. If you pour out too much paint at one time, the paint may dry out before you use it all. You can always pour out some more paint if you run low.

, If you apply the paint too thickly, you will get visible brush strokes. Consider using a small, pointy brush for organic, twisting designs. If you are painting lots of straight lines, consider using a small, flat brush. This will give your more control over your line work.


If you want, you can tape the paper towel onto the wall next to your work; just make sure that it is folded thick enough so that the paint does not bleed through.

, Be mindful of the direction you are painting in. If you are right-handed, start from the left side of your design. If you are left-handed, start from the right side of your design.


You will probably need to reload your paintbrush a few times. Always remember to tap off the excess paint onto the paper towel.

, Use a large brush for the larger areas, and a smaller brush for the smaller areas. If you accidentally go outside your outline, wipe it off using a damp Q-tip. If you can't wipe the mistake off, keep painting. You can ""erase"" the mistake after it dries by covering it up with your background/wall color.

, Use the same technique as you did for the larger shapes. Depending on how small your shapes are, you might not even have to switch to a larger brush; you might be able to paint the entire shape with the brush you used for outlining.

, For example, if you want to add some texture to the bark or some white centers to the flowers, wait until the paint has dried. Paint on the details using a small, pointy brush.

, You can ""erase"" any mistakes by covering them with your background color (the color of your wall). You can also fill in any missed spots with some extra paint. Use a small brush for this.

Prepare the room for painting.,
Paint the sky color on the ceiling.,
Paint in any other background images.,
Lay in the planets.,
Paint in the planetary details.,
Add ancillary details.",How to Paint the Solar System on a Ceiling2," Remove unnecessary items from your child's room. Lay down drop cloths to cover the items that aren't practical to move, then sand and prime the ceiling surface as necessary.

, You can do this with a paint roller, ideally one with a long handle that lets you paint without climbing a ladder.

, Depending on how large the ceiling is, you may want to add other space background images, such as nebulae, before painting in the planets, particularly if you want to have a planet overlap them. You can paint these in with artist brushes or sponges.


You can also mix colors onto a board and dip a paint brush until it's loaded full with the paint mixture, then stipple it on the ceiling so that the mixed colors transfer from the brush to the ceiling surface.

, Trace the circles for each planet at the locations on the ceiling you figured out earlier. You can either draw the circles in freehand or use a compass. Sketch in any significant planetary features.


One way to map in planetary features is to draw a grid over the reference image for each planet, then reproduce the grid over the circle on the ceiling in the appropriate size to aid you in transferring the planetary details to the ceiling.
Use a pencil or chalk color that contrasts with your sky color.

, Mentally break each planetary image into layers. Paint in the base color for the planet; then paint the individual details over it.


To make the details stand out more, paint in a darker color first and a lighter color over it. (If you're painting with a sponge, however, you can often get more striking results by using a lighter painted color underneath a darker sponged-on top color.) You can also use the stippling technique described above.

, After you finish painting the planets themselves, you can add in touches as moons of the outer planets and individual stars in the Milky Way. These only need to be individual points or dots of a single color.

Gather your supplies.,
Start by applying painter's tape to your wall in a design you find pleasing.,
Smooth the tape down with your fingers or a straight edge.,
Pour some wall paint out onto a paint pan.,
Dip the paint roller into the paint pain and tap off any excess paint onto a folded paper towel.,
Gently roll the paint roller across your entire wall.,
Pull the painter's tape off as soon as your are done painting.",How to Paint Designs on Walls5," You can create simple designs using just painter's tape and some wall paint. This method is best for geometric designs, such as stripes, zigzags, and chevron. Here's a list of what you will need:


Painter's tape
Wall paint
Paint roller
Paint pan
Paper towels
Pencil

, The width of the tape will be the lines between your designs. When you are done painting, you will pull the tape off to reveal the original wall color underneath. Try to make the designs large and bold. If you make the designs too small, they will appear out of proportion against your huge wall. Here are some ideas for designs:


Chevron
Zigzag
Stripes (vertical or horizontal)
Triangles

, The tape needs to be sealed against the wall. If the tape is not properly sealed against the wall, paint might seep underneath it.Consider leaving small tabs at the end of each piece of tape. This will make it easier to pull off at the end.

, Try not to pour too much paint out at one time. If you pour out too much paint at once, the paint may dry out before you get a chance to use it all. You can always refill your paint pan with more paint when you run out.


Try to match the paint finish to the finish of your wall. For example, if your wall has a satin finish, choose a paint that has a satin finish as well. This will help your design blend in better.

, You don't want to apply too much paint all at ones. If you put too much paint onto the wall, it may leak under the tape. It may also create a bubbly texture, or take too long to dry. For these reasons, it is better to apply many thin coats of paint rather than one thick coat.

, Use a light to medium pressure, and always go in the same direction: back-and-forth or up-and-down. When your roller starts to get dry, apply more paint, but remember to tap it off onto the paper towel.


If you are using more than one color, work with one color at a time. Use a fresh paint roller and paint when moving on to a different color.

, Gently pull the tape towards you at a 135 degree angle. Don't wait for the paint to dry. If you pull the painter's tape off when the paint is already dry, you may cause the paint to chip or flake off.If the paint has dried and sealed over the edge of the tape, gently scratch at the seam with a craft knife.
If the paint has dried and chips when you pull the tape off, get out a small, pointy paintbrush and fill in the gaps using extra paint.

Choose your color scheme.,
Pick a theme.,
Decide on the layout.,
Consider the paint finish.,
Consider the room that you are painting.",How to Paint Designs on Walls6," Unless you are painting a mural, you might want to limit your colors to two or three; this includes the base/background color of the wall. If you make your wall too busy, it will draw attention away from the rest of your room. Here are some color ideas to get you started:


If you want a more subtle look, use two different shades for your wall and design. For example, you can paint your wall a dark blue, and stencil on some bird silhouettes in light blue.
If you want a bolder look, use contrasting colors. For example, you can paint your wall a fresh, spring green, and some leaf and branch outlines in bright white.
You can also paint colored designs. For example you could start with a dark brown or black branch on a white wall. Then, you could add some light pink cherry blossom flowers to the branch.

, Most walls with designs have a specific theme to them. The easiest designs to paint are silhouettes or outlines. They will be just enough to add some interest and movement to your wall, but they won't be so busy as to detract attention from the rest of your room. Here are some common themes:


Nature-related, such as branches, leaves, and birds
Abstract designs, such as scrolls and damask

, Do you want your design to cover the entire wall, or just a small patch? How you arrange the design is important. Here are some ideas to get you started:


If you are covering your entire wall with the design, consider a grid or checked pattern.
If you are covering just a small patch, consider making the patch more asymmetric than asymmetric. If you are using both large and small shapes in your design, try to place the larger designs more towards the center of the patch, and the smaller designs towards the edges.

, Most acrylic paints will have a glossy, satin/semi-gloss, or matte finish. Most walls will have a satin/semi-gloss or matte finish. If you use the same finish for both your wall and your design, you will get a more uniform result. The design will blend into the wall, and look like it is part of it. If you use contrasting finishes (such as a glossy design on a matte wall), you will get a bolder result. The design will contrast with the background/wall, which can create a very interesting result.

, Some designs are better suited to certain rooms than other designs. For example, you might consider a more energized design in a room that sees a lot of activity, such as a family room. Bedrooms are generally a place of rest, so a more peaceful design might do better there. Here are some ideas to get you started:


For a fancy dining or family room, consider using dark, rich colors. Use ornate designs, such as scrolls and damask.
For a kitchen, consider using something bright and open. You can also paint some food-related designs, such as grapevines or citrus.
For a bedroom, use colors that you find peaceful. These can be cool blues and purples, refreshing greens, or even pastels. Consider using something organic for the design, such as long, sweeping curves, leaves, flowers, or branches.

Consider using tempera paint.,
Consider using acrylic paint.,
Add dish soap to your paint before use.,
Avoid permanent window paints.",How to Sponge Paint Windows for the Holidays1," Choose colors that will work for the scene and ambiance you want to create with your holiday window paint.


Use color schemes already associated with the holidays. Certain holidays already have specific colors assigned to them through tradition. For instance, Christmas is associated with red and green.
Opt for white and blue to create generic winter scenes.
Use festive metallic hues like silver and gold to create a sense of festivity commonly associated with the holidays.;
, Tempera paint dries with a matte finish and the end result is usually translucent. Moreover, it is the easiest paint to remove.

, Acrylic craft paints are among the most commonly used paints for temporary window illustrations. They can be scraped off windows fairly easily but are a little more durable than tempera paints.

, This step is especially important if using acrylic paints, since dish soap reacts with the paint and makes it easier to wash off later. Add 1 teaspoon of dish soap to every 1/4 cup bowl of paint and mix thoroughly.

, Permanent paints specifically meant for windows will be nearly impossible to clean off once the holidays pass.

If you are using your wall color as your border background, choose a lighter or darker color for the border.;
, Alternatively, if you are putting borders in other parts of the room you can measure distance from the floor, doors and windows. Mark the measurements with chalk.

, Use chalk and follow your measurement marks, taking care to ensure that your lines are straight and your measurements are correct.

, This will help to keep your sponge painting within the border area.

A sea sponge or natural sponge gives your sponge painting a more random appearance. For a more uniform sponge painting effect, a synthetic kitchen sponge works fine.
Cut a couple of the sponges into smaller pieces or wedges to use in corners and small spaces.
If you want to sponge in a uniform pattern, cut your sponges into shapes like hearts, circles or triangles. Use cookie cutters or other patterns to make more intricate designs.
Soak the sponges in warm water, then ring out the excess water. If they still retain water, ring them out inside of a dry towel.

, Use a paint brush or sponge paint the background. Allow the background to dry fully before continuing.

, Plastic lids off of disposable containers, cans and aluminum pie plates also work well.

,, Apply the paint to a large piece of poster board or paper to see the effect. Adjust the amount of paint on the sponge accordingly until you like the look.

Create a full scale detailed compositional rendering.,
Create your color study.,

, It will be used for mixing the right color tones and for general color reference.

,, The scratch, brown/rough/float (arriccio), coat names reflect the grade of sand - coarse, rough, fine. After preceding coats are completely dry, depending on the size of the panel 2-7 days, apply an ""Intonaco"" - final, painting coat on the day of painting. In the beginning it is better to use a ceramic tile and only 2 coats ""Arriccio"" (base coat) and ""Intonaco"" (actual painting coat).

, It will help to grind the base pigments with water into the paste in advance, storing them in sealed glass jars, this way in the morning (before the painting begins) there will be more time to prepare tone mixes. To start with, try about 12 different colors. Use freshly ground dry lime mixed with water as white (pigments mixed with lime and lime mixed for whites can not be saved). Your mixes should be done ONLY with distilled water. The best working pigments in fresco are the earth oxides and other mineral pigments. Some pigments will not work with lime plaster at all - some man made greens change to yellow when being mixed, as well as many other modern day pigments except the ones that specially formulated for the use with plasters. Test the colors in advance by mixing little portions of them with lime. Most art supply stores also have reference material on traditional fresco palettes.

, They should also be round, flat, and in many sizes.

, Wait about twenty minutes after applying the final intonaco (painting plaster coat). Before starting to paint, make sure that the plaster is firm to touch (will not dent if pressed with a finger).

, The under-painting is done with terra verde (green earth pigment) with shadows enhanced in umber (picture on the right) or with other colors, but remember in fresco it is not possible to completely paint out a ""wrong"" color therefore every tone should be carefully planned. Another thing to remember is that plaster behaves differently during the day - it will need more water in the tones at the beginning and the end of the day then in the middle and do not keep to much paint on the brush - it will result in ""blobs"" squeeze it slightly between the fingers before touching the plaster.

, The plaster enters what is sometimes called ""the golden hour"" - painting is 3/4 done and plaster is in it's best stage. Time to finish the detail pickup and blend color tones by passing over and over with layers of transparent color at (this stage the color mixes should be ""wet"" again). Painter must work fast and precise at this stage because ""golden hour"" also means that plaster will soon ""lock up"" - stop receiving paint (the paint will change to much lighter opaque tone as soon a it touches the plaster - that is it put the brush down!). One thing to remember is that in the next seven or so days following the painting the fresco will be undergoing the curing stage and this is a confidence test for the Artist. Colors dry at different speed and plaster is naturally compacted unevenly although it looks flat and perfect changes to white faster in more compacted areas. These are to of many other factors that make color in fresco change into discouraging cacophony for the first few days after the painting is finished. But do not worry in about 7-10 days it will look even more beautiful and just a little lighter then the day it was painted.

,,, Use latex paint for the base color. This type of paint is easy to work with and to clean up and will provide a smooth base underneath the rag pattern.


The base color latex paint is usually a lighter shade, so the glaze color that is rolled on top with the rag will stand out on top of the base coat.

, To prepare, use a separate paint bucket and mix the latex paint with a glaze that is water-based. The glaze will give the wall a soft look and add a sheen.

, Allow to dry for 24 hours before adding the rag glaze.

,


Moisten the rag slightly with water and then dip it into the glaze. Dab the rag onto the wall, making a pattern. Go back in with another rag to dab off excess paint to change the pattern. Experiment.

,, Dab the sponge over the stencil until the entire design is filled in, but not solid. Do not use the sponge to rub the paint over the stencil, as doing so will ruin the texture of the finished image.

, Carefully dab the paint over the portion of the stencil that requires that color, but do not allow the color to transfer into other portions of the stencil. Use a separate sponge for each paint color instead of trying to rinse the colors off in between uses.

, Depending on what color you want the base coat to be, this step may already be done. However, if you hate the color of the walls, purchase some paint and rollers and apply one or two even coats of paint as needed before you begin sponging.


Try to decide ahead of time what color you want to sponge on top so that you'll end up with two colors that display well together.
Allow the paint to dry fully before moving on.

, A good ratio is four parts glaze to one part paint. However, you may want to experiment with these ratios until you find something you're happy with. More glaze means a more transparent sponge layer.

, Pour the glaze/paint mixture into shallow container, such as a paint rolling tray or even just a paper plate.

, You may want to practice on something disposable first (like a trash piece of cardboard) in order to find the optimum amount of paint to put on the sponge.


If you want a darker top layer, use more paint.
Wring the sponge out whenever it gets too saturated with paint.

, Don't let the sponge layer dry before this step. You'll want to use a second sponge, dampened, to lightly pat the areas you already covered and remove some of the paint. This way, you'll allow more of the base coat to show through. Remove as much of the paint as you want.


Feel free to pat more paint on with the first sponge if you mistakenly remove too much.

",How to Faux Paint a Wall,"


Ragging generally gives the smoothest texture. Color wash gives the most worn look, while sponging gives a very textured appearance.;
,


The more paint you add to your surface, the more textured the surface will appear. A single coat leaves brush or rag marks on the wall, while a second coat will mostly cover these and provide a more even appearance.

,


Look at paint samples in a store to see how paint will appear when applied. You can tweak the brightness of the paint by adding a light or darker base coat, and you can also mix two colors to create different tones.

,


Buy the paint, base coat, and other materials--a brush, rag, or sponge, as well spackling paste for filling irregularities in the wall--at a paint or home supply store. Consult sales staff to make sure you are buying the right colors for your faux paint and base coat.

,,,,


The base coat is necessary to protect the wall and for the faux paint gloss to appear how it should. Dip the roller in the base coat and apply it to the wall with long, even strokes from ceiling to floor.

,,,,,


Your strokes should crisscross one another and look informal. Painting a series of X's is one good way to get the desired look. Allow sections of base coat to appear through the glaze; do not cover the entire wall.

,,,,,, Let the base coat show through in sections.


To create the proper effect, rotate the sponge before each application and do not apply glaze in a pattern. Press the sponge against the wall gently; squeezing or pushing hard will create odd spots of darker color.

Metal knobs will need to be primed with a spray metal primer (i.e. Rust Oleum). Resin knobs require the least prep--a light sanding with 220 grit if the surface is uneven. No primer required--just start painting!;
, It's best to keep paint off the bottom of the knob (the part that will go against the drawer or cabinet face) as this can cause a ridge that makes it hard to get the knob to screw in tightly. Let each coat dry thoroughly before re-coating.

, It's best to figure this out before you start painting. Keep it simple or go wild. Look at fabrics or wallpaper in the room for inspiration. In the beginning, keep it simple! A couple lines for a stripe, a few more for a plaid. You can base your designs on the fabrics and wallpaper in the room. Just take the original material to your local copy shop, (along with the knob for scale) and reduce or enlarge them to fit the knob.

, Trace the knob shape onto paper, then transfer your design to the traced shape. You can transfer this design to the knob after you've basecoated it by using graphite paper, or you can do it freehand.

, Here's the fun part. If you transferred your design with the graphite paper it'll be just like those paint-by-number projects you did when you were a kid. Keep a damp sponge handy--if you don't like what you've painted, and you've let your earlier coats dry completely--you can wipe off anything you don't like. Just do it quickly. If it's dried and you're not happy, just grab some sandpaper and take it down to what you do like!

, Use 4-5 coats for a kid's room. Also be sure to use water-based varnish. It dries quickly, it's really durable and it's safer for kids to be around.

",How to Camouflage Paint," Different areas of the world require different spray patterns to adequately camouflage something. For example, you would not want to paint a vehicle forest colors if you are on an expedition in the arctic.


Use blotches for deciduous forest and arctic applications.
A slash pattern may be used for deserts and grassy areas.
Broad blotches should be considered for jungle and coniferous forest areas.;
, Avoid light background colors in heavily treed areas where the leaves and branches create a dark backdrop. Avoid dark backgrounds in meadows or lakes where fall grasses and reeds may be the primary colors.

, Most camouflage paint colors are tan, black, green, rust, and brown. White and grays may also be used for arctic camouflage. Purchase 3 or 4 colors to give your camouflage adequate depth and texture. Make sure to purchase flat or matte paint, not glossy.

, If you're painting on metal, be sure all rust, dirt, and oil is removed. Sand and prime the area as needed.

, This may include the grip of a rifle or the truck's headlights.

,, If the paint runs or produces splotchy areas, you are spraying too thickly. Move across the area of the project, and make even sweeps with the spray can. Allow the first coat to dry before applying another. Apply several light base coats instead of 1 thick one.

, Make the blotches uneven and fairly large. Allow to dry.

",How to Paint a Stained Door,"


Select oil base primer paint for the first coat.






If you are painting over stained cedar or redwood, ask an experienced paint store clerk to help you choose the proper primer to cover those woods.






Choose either oil-base paint or acrylic latex paint for the second coat and finish coats. Read the label on latex paints to make sure they can be painted over oil primer.
Choose exterior or interior paint depending on where the door surface will be. A gloss or semi-gloss finish is best for exterior surfaces. Semi-gloss or “eggshell” finish is best for interior door sides.
Choose an acrylic clear sealer to cover the paint after it dries to prolong the life of the paint and make it easier to clean.
For an average-sized door, you will need 1 quart of each kind of paint and sealer. (You will need 2 quarts of finish paint if each side of the door is a different color.);
,


Leave one half of the hinge attached to the doorframe to make it easier to re-hang the door.






If you can’t remove the door for some reason you will need to protect the doorframe and nearby walls with painters tape.







,, Pay special attention to areas around the door handle and the edge of the doorframe.

,,


Sand to remove the gloss and slightly roughen the surface, not to remove all the previous coatings of sealer or stain.






Be careful not to gouge or make grooves when sanding.






Use a wire brush to rough up grooved or ornate design areas on the door.







,, Let it harden and sand it smooth.

,,, Let the primer dry completely. Consult the directions on the can for the proper drying time and don’t rush it.

,, Let it dry. Consult the directions for proper drying time between coats.

If you use acrylic or any other paint, your carpet will end up with that crunchy, clumpy feel. And while you could use a paintbrush and paint from a can, you won’t achieve the same coverage consistency as you would using spray paint.


Keep a bottle of paint thinner nearby to “erase” mistakes. In case your design doesn’t go the way you want or in the even the spray paint hits a piece of furniture or the floor you can attend to it quickly.

Map out your design or the completeness of color area.",How to Paint Your Carpet2," Unless you plan to cover the carpet with one consistent color, get out your tape measure and map out the design you’d like to create. Use a washable marker to create your map––consider using a light color that won’t be visible underneath the paint.


Tape out areas that you don’t want to paint. Especially if you're using multiple colors, you’ll want to tape out the area you plan to paint using a specific color. Paint, allow it to dry, remove the tape and then re-tape the area in preparation of the next color.

Avoid shaking the can over the area you want to paint to prevent the paint from splashing or splattering.






Run the paint over the carpet in a smooth, even fashion. If the first pass is too light, repeat the step until you're satisfied with the coverage.






Dab any puddled paint on painter’s tape with a rag. You don’t want to have puddled tape dry on the tape as when you peel it away it could not only stick to the carpet, some paint could not be fully dry and spill on other areas of the carpet.







, Make sure you are fully satisfied with the section you are painting before moving forward.

, This may take some time, but doing it the right way will be worth the wait.


Be sure you lay painter's tape on fully dried paint. During the second or third phase of the painting, you may be laying painter’s tape on previously painted area. Never place tape on a painted area unless completely dry or you risk compromising the integrity of the previously painted area.







, Typical dry time is anywhere from eight to 10 hours depending upon the climate and humidity levels.

Pick your paint.,

Purchase any other supplies you need.,
Paint your dish.,
Draw or write with a no-bake ceramic paint pen, if necessary.,
Keep breathing.,
Sand your way to success.,
Gloss over acrylic paint.,
Bake any ceramic paint.,
Use your no-bake ceramic paint dish.",How to Paint Ceramic1," Depending on how you plan to use your ceramic, there are a few slightly different approaches to picking paint, each of which will yield a different result in terms of appearance, durability, and usability.


Using regular paint (such as acrylic) plus an acrylic clear coat will produce highly glossy dishes that are pretty to look at, but not safe to eat off of.
Using a no-bake ceramic paint pen will allow easy, quick designs on dishes that are safe to eat and drink from, but which won't last with sustained regular use.
Using bake-on ceramic paint will produce fairly glossy patterns that are safe to eat and drink from, and that in most cases should last for years.;
, Once you've decided on your paint approach, acquire a brush suitable for the pattern you want to paint, or consider a paint pen. A paint pen will allow you to “draw” the paint on like a marker, making it great for words and line drawings, but its applications aren't as flexible overall.


A small, pointed brush is perfect for painting flower buds and vines.
A flat-tipped brush is ideal for geometric work such as rims and straight lines, as well as for filling in larger areas of paint. If you plan to stencil in a design, a small flat-tipped brush is also probably the best choice.

, Buy clear coat for decorative dishes; pick up some painter's tape or masking tape if you want to paint straight lines or angles. A smock or apron and some disposable gloves are also useful in many cases.

, With your dish thorough clean and dry, apply your chosen paint to it to create whatever design you want. The specifics of this step will vary somewhat between the different types of paint, but the basics involve brushing on designs with acrylic or bake-on ceramic paint. Using a small brush, paint your design on the ceramic dish.


To paint flower buds or leaves, use a pointed brush. Apply a tiny blob of paint to the dish where the base of the bud or leaf will be, and then drag and lift the brush in the direction of the tip of the bud or leaf. The tip will be created wherever you pull the brush away from the plate.
To paint straight lines across a plate or bowl, tape off the area on either side of where you want each line to be with painter's tape. (Use a ruler to ensure that the gap between the tape strips is evenly spaced.) Paint between the tape lines with bold strokes using a flat-tipped brush, then gently remove the tape to leave a clean line.
For an unusual motif reminiscent of the De Stijl art movement of the early 20th century, try blocking off rectangular sections with criss-crossed lines of painter's tape, and then filling in the sections with different colors of paint. Leave one or two sections unpainted for an eye-popping geometrical effect.
Know that acrylic paint can be reapplied after the first coat has dried to make it even brighter. This step isn't usually necessary for ceramic paint.

, These pens are available at many art and craft supply stores, as well as online. They're relatively mess-free, making them ideal for children's parties and other open group activity settings.


Draw, write, or doodle just as you would with a colored marker. The paint will dry quickly once applied. If a pen seems not to be writing, hold it with the point angled down and gently shake it for a moment.
Try drawing a background or part of a picture in one color, letting it dry for a moment, and then adding the next layer in a different color to build a bright, fun image.
Be sure to add a signature on the bottom of the dish so that everyone knows it's your creation.

, Be sure to paint in an open and well-ventilated area for safety, especially when using acrylic paint. Fumes can be unpleasant and aggravate any existing conditions, such as allergies, that you may have.

, For dishes that seem too glossy to take paint, consider gently sanding them with an ultra-fine grit sandpaper, such as 1800 or 2000 grit. Don't apply much pressure, and try to sand evenly.


This works because the sandpaper creates microabrasions in the glaze of the dish, allowing paint to stick more easily.
Don't make the finish visibly rough or jagged. A gentle sanding is more than enough.

, If you chose to paint a decorative dish with acrylic, let it dry thoroughly, and then apply clear acrylic topcoat to it. Let one layer dry, and then add a second to be sure it's completely sealed.


This dish will look very shiny and nice, but is not safe for food or drinks. Instead, display it on a shelf or give it is a gift. Be sure to tell the recipient not to use it for eating or drinking.

, If you chose to paint a dish with special ceramic paint, find an out-of-the-way place to let it dry for at least 24 hours. Once it's dried completely, bake it in a preheated oven according to the manufacturer's instructions.


Always yield to the manufacturer's instructions. If they tell you to bake it earlier than this guide, do so.
This dish will have a pleasantly glossy finish, and be safe to eat and drink off of. If you chose a high-end ceramic paint that's dishwasher-safe, you can even run it in the dishwasher! The design should remain there for many years to come.

As with any painted dish, consider hand washing it even if you can technically use the dishwasher. Hand washing is much gentler, and ensures the longest life for your dish.



, If you chose to use no-bake ceramic paint pens to decorate your dish, it's ready to use as soon as the paint dries. No other steps are needed.


Your dish will be safe to eat off of, but this paint will scratch and chip over time from contact with utensils, teeth, and other hard edges. It's definitely not dishwasher-safe.

Using a level, measure and tape the stripes.,

,
Optional: To prevent paint bleeding (where the tape hasn't adhered 100% to the wall texture), use a small brush or trim roller to paint one coat of your base wall color over the tape seam.,
Paint the contrasting stripes.,
Remove the tape shortly (around 5 minutes) after painting.",How to Paint Stripes on an Interior Wall," This is probably mostly personal preference, but perhaps the scale of the room should be a factor. In this article, 10"" is chosen as a uniform stripe width.;
, If you intend to paint the ceiling, paint it first.

, It is unlikely that your last stripe will measure exactly 10"" (or whatever size you use), so make sure that strip ends up in the least noticeable corner of the room. If you are only striping one accent wall, measure the wall and center the stripes (the outside of each end stripe should be equidistant from its corresponding corner).

, For the purposes of this article, 2"" tape was used (you'll find out why in a minute). Remember to tape the outside of the contrasting stripe. This means that if you went with 10"" stripes and 2"" tape, the exposed wall will alternate between 10"" for the semi-gloss stripe, and 6"" for the flat stripe. This is the step most likely to cause problems, so it is recommended that you eyeball the stripes one more time after you've finished taping. It helps to put small pieces of tape inside of the stripes that should not be painted, to serve as a visual reminder.

,, Once this paint is dry, proceed to next step. (This is so the base wall color will fill in any minor gaps in your tape seam. When you remove the tape in the final step you will have a nice, clean seam with zero bleed through.)

, You may need two coats. Remember that it was recommended to use 2"" tape along the sides of the stripes? Here's why - with a 10"" stripe, you can use a 12"" roller and get full coverage on the stripe. The 2"" tape gives you 14"" to work with. The benefit of this is that there is no risk of roller lines. On the other hand, a standard 9"" roller will be 1"" short.

, If you are working with a partner, just get a 2-3 stripe head start and have your partner remove the tape right behind you.

Know your limits.,
Gather your supplies.,
Clean and sand the tile.,
Prime the tile.,
Choose your paint.,
Paint the paint on evenly using a paintbrush.,
Finish the tile.,
Clean up your mess.",How to Paint Ceramic2," Ceramic tile of the type found in kitchens, bathrooms, and laundry rooms, can certainly be painted, but the process is more involved than painting a hobby item like a plate or a lamp base. Additionally, there are practical limits to what can be painted, and how long you can expect your paint job to last.


Lay out a plan beforehand. When you paint home tile, you'll be decommissioning whatever area of the house you're painting for a while. Plan ahead to avoid awkward bathroom and kitchen situations.
Paint somewhere sensible. High-traffic areas, and tiles that are constantly subjected to moisture, are not generally considered good candidates for home repainting. At best, expert advice on the subject is ambivalent. Choose to repaint less-trafficked areas of tile, or accept that your project may not last as long as you'd like it to.

, Painting or repainting ceramic tiles in your home requires considerably more patience and preparation than the other ceramic painting methods described here, but it should go steadily as long as you have the tools you need. Collect the following items:


Fine grit sandpaper, such as 220 or 240 grit
An electric sander, preferably an orbital sander
Heavy rubber gloves, eye protection, and a face mask
Abrasive tile cleaner, such as Comet, Ajax (powder), or Bon Ami
Bleach to destroy mildew and other mold
High-adhesion primer designed for glossy surfaces
High-quality acrylic or epoxy paint
Clear urethane or epoxy top coat finish
A large paintbrush and/or paint roller
Rags and a vacuum cleaner for cleanup

, The first step to repainting your tile is be sure it's ready for new paint. Be sure to wear a face mask and safety goggles for this step, to avoid getting dust in your eyes or respiratory system. If you're worried that 220 grit sandpaper will sand too quickly or too deeply for you to apply it evenly, you can use a finer grit. Just remember that the process is likely to take longer as the grit number goes up.


Start with your abrasive tile cleaner. Thoroughly scrub the area you plan to repaint, and wipe it down until it's clean and dry.
Disinfect. Using a fresh rag, make a bleach solution and scrub through the tiles a second time to kill mold.
Sand down the area. Affix your sandpaper to the orbital sander and sand your tiles down carefully. Your goal is to remove any extra gloss remaining above the ceramic itself, without damaging the ceramic.

, As with painting a lamp, your exposed ceramic tile will need to be primed. Paint the primer on evenly with a brush.


Choose the right primer. Apply an oil-based primer to ensure better water protection.
Apply two coats, then finish. Once the first coat has dried a little, apply a second coat of primer over it. Give it time to dry thoroughly (a few hours), then sand it with ultra-fine grit sandpaper, such as 1500 or 2000 grit, to remove any bumps or ridges in the coat.

, Now that your tile is primed and dry, it's time to add paint. Choose the best paint possible. There are three basic options available:


Epoxy paint is glossy, highly durable and long-lasting, but also more expensive than most other kinds of paint.
Acrylic paint isn't as durable for high-traffic areas as epoxy, but is easier to work with and cheaper.
Latex paint provides a soft-looking, “rubbery” finish that some people prefer, but it's the least durable of the three.

, A flat-tipped brush with a fairly wide tip is best. Start with a thin coat, let it dry, and then add a second coat. You'll get brighter and smoother results than a thick one-coat job.


Refer to thinning instructions on your paint can to learn how to thin it properly, if thinning is required.
To paint a geometric pattern, tape shapes together out of blue painter's tape before you begin, and then use a laser level and a ruler to properly place them evenly throughout your work area. Remove the tape after you're finished (but before you apply a clear coat) to reveal sharp lines and shapes.

, Wait 2-3 days for the paint to dry completely. Once the paint has dried, it's time to apply a clear finish and seal it in. Apply two coats of finish. Wait long enough between coats for the first coat to become dry to the touch. Choose between urethane and epoxy finish. Both have advantages:


Urethane finish is cheaper, quicker to apply, and easier to work with. However, it doesn't hold up in high-traffic areas for as long as epoxy.
Epoxy finish is hard, glossy, and essentially permanent, making it the better choice for areas with a lot of foot traffic or areas that get wet regularly. However, it is more expensive and takes more care to apply properly.

, Throw away any paper you set out. Vacuum up any remaining dust or detritus. Clean and store your supplies. Let the finish dry fully. Again, 2-3 days is recommended.

Finish up.",How to Paint Ceramic3," To repaint an old ceramic lamp (or other decorative ceramic fixture), you'll be taking four basic steps: sanding, priming, painting, and finishing. To paint a ceramic lamp, spraypaint is the most sensible choice. Many people recommend Krylon-brand spraypaint for its bold color and durability, but other brands are usable as well. In any case, purchase the following supplies for your project:


A face mask (surgical mask) and plastic safety goggles
Electrical tape
1800-grit or a similar ultra-fine grit sandpaper
A sanding block to mount the sandpaper
Paper towels and old newspaper
A general-purpose spray primer in a neutral color such as dark gray
Semi-gloss or glossy spraypaint in the color of your choice
Clear gloss spray sealer

, Unless you're painting a totally unfinished ceramic lamp, the first major step will be to sand its surfaces so that they'll take your primer more readily. To prevent dust from getting into your mouth and nose, wear a face mask before you sand.


Remove the lampshade. Remove any other parts of the lamp you can set aside and don't plan to paint. (If there's still a light bulb in the lamp, remove that, too.)
Sand it down. Attach your sandpaper to the sanding block, and sand the entire lamp using gentle, even pressure and smooth strokes.
Don't over-sand the lamp. It shouldn't be rough or irregular to the touch. The sanding step is only to give the primer a better surface to bind to.

, Once you've finished, wipe down the lamp with damp paper towels and/or a gentle cleaning agent. Be thorough to ensure you've cleaned all of the sanding dust off the lamp, as well as any other remaining impurities.

, Once the sanded lamp is clean and dry, it's time to apply primer. Move your project outside or to an open garage or workshop, if you haven't already. Put on safety goggles and a fresh face mask. You'll be working with spraypaint, which can get into your mucous membranes from the air and irritate them.


Prep your lamp. Set it on a bed of newspaper that's much wider than the base of the lamp, for easy cleanup. Use electrical tape to firmly seal off any part of the cord or screw base that might otherwise get paint on it, including under the base.
Apply the first coat of primer. Spray it on uniformly and steadily, all around the lamp. Once it's been applied, let it dry for at least 3 or 4 minutes. There's no need to wait more than 10 minutes at most before moving to the next step.
Apply the second coat of primer. Once the first coat is set, repeat the process to add a second coat of primer. This will help ensure a smooth, uniform base for your spraypaint, and should completely obscure any previous colors and patterns on the original lamp as well.

, Give the primer between 30 minutes and an hour to set somewhat, and then bust out the paint. You'll be applying multiple coats for a great-looking finish.


Apply the first coat of paint. Using even movements, apply a thin coat of spraypaint over the primed lamp. Chances are, the primer will still be affecting the color somewhat; this is ordinary. Don't over-spray your first coat. You'll get a much brighter and smoother finish by using multiple thin coats.

, Advice varies on how dry you should let the first coat get before it's okay to apply the next coat, but the average consensus seems to be between half an hour and 2 hours. This guide recommends waiting 1 hour between coats.


Spraypaint actually takes about a day to set completely, but there's no need to wait that long between coats.

, Repeat the pattern described above to apply at least 2 more coats of spraypaint. Be sure to keep each coat thin.

, Once the last coat of paint has dried enough to take another coat, switch to your sealant and spray it on. For a professional-looking finish, choose a clear, glossy finish such as Krylon No-Scent Glossy.


As with painting, once the first thin coat has dried, add a second coat to maximize the glossy look.
Once you're satisfied, protect the lamp from the elements and leave it to dry overnight. Don't touch the lamp during this time if you can help it.

, The next morning, remove the electrical tape from the lamp and bring it inside. Add a bulb and a shade to complete your lamp.


Don't feel bound to use the shade that originally came with the lamp. Look at department and thrift stores to find one that suits you.

Select the item you wish to paint.,
Pick two contrasting colors.,
Paint the first layer.,
Cover the first coat in a crackling medium or all-purpose clear glue.,
Paint on the top color immediately.,
Let your project dry thoroughly.",How to Crackle Paint1," Crackle painting can be done on wood, ceramic, and canvas as well as various other surfaces.


If you are using wood, make sure it is treated as untreated wood may discolor the faux finish.





;
, It does not matter which color you lay down first. Crackle paint will show up with a dark on light contrast as well as a light on dark.


You can also use metallic paints to give the object an added shine.
Note: if colors are too similar, the crackling effect may not show up as well.







, Use a paintbrush or small paint roller to coat the object with a layer of latex or acrylic paint.


Paint any edges that may be visible, like on a picture frame or piece of wall art.
Let the first coat dry completely before proceeding.







, Crackling glue can be bought at your local craft supply store. You can use generic glue as well. The thicker the coat of glue the larger the crackling effect you will achieve.


For fine crackle lines, apply a thin layer of glue.







, The crackling medium will dry fast so you must get the second color on before it dries or the crackling effect will not work. Lightly apply the paint with a soft paintbrush.


You do not want to be heavy handed with the brush or you will run the paint through the glue, which will distort the faux finish. You can also spray on the top color with a paint sprayer for a faster application.







, As the paint dries, the cracks will appear.


If you want to speed up the process, you may wish to use a heat gun.
Finish the project by putting on a clear coat of polyurethane.

Use two different shades of acrylic paint.,
Use good quality paint.,
Spray the first shade as a primer.,

Use a stain (optional).",How to Crackle Paint2," If you want a significant contrast in color, use two different colors. Alternatively, you can use two shades of the same color - one darker, one lighter - to create a more subtle crackle effect.

, Good quality paint is essential. Acrylic paint is recommended.

, Select the shade of paint you want to use as your base coat and spray a thin, even layer over the surface. Then wait for the paint to dry.

, Apply a second coat of the same color, spraying heavily. Wait for the paint to begin drying, just until it becomes tacky.

, Now spray the second shade of paint to achieve a crackle effect. Make sure the paint you use is a high-gloss acrylic. For a heavier crackle effect, concentrate on spraying some parts more than others.

, Use a heat gun to dry the final layer of paint. This will cause the top layer of paint to crackle and form interesting patterns.

, You could also give your work an aged woodwork effect by applying a thin dark stain to the surface, then wiping it off with a cloth. Raw linseed oil is a good option, as it doesn't dry too quickly.

Ask Questions.,
Make sure your work area is large enough the number of people required.,
Ensure that you have the right tools for the right job.",How to Choose Your Faux Painting Finish," Before you choose what faux finishing technique you want to faux paint your wall with, ask yourself the following questions:


Is the finish going to look too busy or patchy overall? Remember that when you are looking at a small sample, it is different than looking at it over large areas. That's why you should always practice on a large poster board first. You might want to paint a couple of boards and place them on the wall and then stand back to get the full effect before you proceed to faux paint the wall. Make sure if you are going with a patterned type of faux finish that it does not clash with the décor in your room. Sometimes it’s best to go with a simple color washing faux finish that incorporates all the main colors in the room and blends nicely in the background.
Is it practical? Take into account the complexity of the finish you like - is it going to be easy to touch up later? Remember that some decorative finishes cannot be touched up and so are not suited for high traffic areas.
How high are your ceilings? If the technique you are going to use requires using a roller or brushing on more than one color, you should use a scaffold instead of dangerously carrying up multiple trays up a ladder. However, if you can’t fit a scaffold in the area, then you will have no choice, therefore get your climbing shoes on because you will go up and down that ladder a lot of times.;
, If the method you are going to use requires using 2 persons, make sure that both of you will be able to fit in the working area, especially if you have to fit a ladder in there, too.

, In choosing your faux finish and the faux painting tools you are going to use, keep in mind that in small sections or tight areas, the tools might not fit. Therefore, it’s best to keep those patterned faux finishes to walls that don’t have too many fixtures on them.

Ensure the surface you're going to apply the decorative plaster is flat and smooth with no abrasions.,
Prime the wall to to give the plaster something to key to.,
Use a mirrored trowel (smaller the better for stucco) to apply the stucco.,
Give the dry first coat a very light sand using high grade paper about 320 grit.,
Apply the second coat of stucco the same way you did the first.,
""De-crud"" the surface.,
Leave the wall to dry for a minimum of 8 hours.

,
Sand the surface very lightly and gently across surface.

,
Repeat one more coat of stucco.,
Start to work your trowel over the surface in random directions.,
Protect the finished surface with either a wax or lacquer.",How to Apply Polished Plaster," If it's a gypsum plastered wall, then use a fine filler to repair any blemishes and sand where necessary.


This step is vital, as a stucco venetian plaster is very thin and any imperfections in the wall will show through.





;
, Leave the primer 8 hours to dry before applying the first coat.

, Work in a random manner across the surface starting at one side/corner and then going across. Try to keep the first coat as flat as you can, but it doesn't have to be perfect. Ensure the whole area gets an even coating.

, This is very quick; an area of one square metre should take 10 seconds.

, Try for an even coating, but bear in mind now the patterns you put in with trowel will come through the last coat and give it some character.

, Once covered and the plaster is immediately starting to dry, trowel over the surface to take off any high spots of plaster.

,,, Once the coat is on, give the surface a gentle troweling up to start creating a shine. If you feel the trowel is gripping then leave a short while for the plaster to harden a bit.

, The ideal time to do this depends on the surface and conditions, but usually within 1 hour of stuccoing. As you work, look across the surface and you will begin to see shine points all over. Continue this until satisfied with the finish.

, Follow the instructions of either product; normally, you'll want to trowel on any wax and brush/ roll on and lacquer. The lacquer is now finished, but once dried out, the wax can be rubbed with lambs wool to create an even higher shine.

Paint something to look like marble.",How to Faux Paint," The type of hardware you're dealing with will depend on what you're painting. Items like walls, furniture, and doors will likely have hardware that you have to remove.


Remove the hinges from doors and cabinets before painting. Use a screwdriver to remove the screws attaching the hinges, and then take the doors or cabinets down.
Remove handles, knockers, mail boxes, and other attached accessories from doors, cabinets, furniture, and other items.
For walls, take everything off the walls and remove vents, switch plate covers, outlet covers, and other items.;
, This is particularly important for stationary objects like walls and counters. For walls and counters, protect the floor underneath by laying down a drop sheet. Tape the drop sheet in place with painter’s tape. Protect adjacent areas by taping them with painter’s tape. This includes ceilings, walls, sinks, fixtures, and other areas touching the surface you'll be painting.For mobile objects like furniture, cabinetry, hardware, and doors, move the object to a well-ventilated space, such as a garage. Place the item on a drop sheet to protect the floor underneath.

, It’s a good idea to use a degreasing cleaner to clean any surface before painting. This will remove all traces of oil, grease, grime, and dirt, and give the paint a clean surface to stick to.Dip a scrubbing pad or sponge into a degreasing cleaner and wipe the entire surface. Rinse the area with a damp sponge, pat it dry with a rag, and let the surface dry for 30 minutes.


Denatured alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, and ammonia-based household cleaners are all good degreasing cleaners.
You can also use ½ cup (4 ounces) of trisodium phosphate mixed with 2 quarts (1.8 L) of water as a powerful degreasing cleanser.

, Sanding before painting is important no matter what kind of surface you're working with, because it cleans and roughs up the surface so the paint can stick. Using an orbital sander will make the job go much faster, but you can sand smaller surfaces by hand with a sanding sponge.For countertops and wood furniture, use 150-grit sandpaper
For doors and metal, use 220-grit sandpaper
For walls, use 120-grit sandpaper
For cabinets, use 100-grit sandpaper

, After sanding, vacuum the surface and the surrounding area to remove excess dust. Then, go over the entire surface with a clean, damp sponge to remove any remaining dust and dirt. Soak and wring out the sponge often to make sure you aren't just pushing dust around.


Once clean, let the surface dry for another 30 minutes.

, Priming any surface before painting will give the paint an even surface to stick to, will cover imperfections, and will help reduce color variations in the final paint job. Choose a primer color that will complement your paint project, and use a primer suitable for the surface you're working with.Apply the primer with a roller, and use a brush to get into corners and awkward spaces and joints.
Allow the primer to dry according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This usually takes at least 24 hours.

, To create a faux bois, or fake wood, look on any surface, you'll need paint in your color of choice, a few basic painting supplies, and one specialized tool. You can use any color paint you like, but make sure it’s suitable for the surface you're working with. For this project, you'll need:


Paint
Glaze (for latex paint) or paint thinner (for oil paint)
Paint tray
Roller
Wood grainer (can be purchased at paint, home, and hardware stores)
Whisk broom
Brush

, To create a faux bois finish, you have to paint the surface first and then use a wood grainer to mark a wood pattern into the paint. Thinning out the paint prevents the paint from drying too quickly, and makes it easier to press in the pattern.


If you're using a latex paint, mix it in the paint tray with equal parts glaze and water.
For oil paint, mix the paint with one part paint thinner., Saturate your roller in paint. Roll the roller over the paint tray a few times to remove excess. Working in a small area, apply a thin but even coat of paint to your surface.If necessary, use a brush to access corners, joints, recesses, and awkward areas.


To stop the paint from drying too quickly, work in sections that are no bigger than 4-feet squared (1.2-meters squared). Once you’ve painted and imprinted a section, you can move on to the next.

, After you’ve painted your first small area, use the wood grainer to imprint the paint with the wood pattern. Place the grainer at the top of the section, press the grainer into the paint with gentle but even pressure, and drag the grainer down a strip of paint in a straight line.When you’ve finished the first strip, go back to the top of the section, align the grainer immediately beside the first strip, and drag the grainer down the second strip.
Repeat until you’ve imprinted the entire section with the wood grainer.

, When you’ve dragged the grainer over the entire painted surface to create the wood pattern, allow the section to dry for about 10 minutes, or until the paint starts to feel dry to the touch. Then, use the whisk broom and gently brush the surface of the paint in vertical swipes. This will create a subtle grain effect.When you’ve finished with this first section, move on to the next. Follow the same painting, wood graining, and brushing steps until the entire surface is complete.

, Let your first coat of paint dry completely, according to the manufacturer’s directions. Normally paint is ready for a second coat within a few hours. When the paint is dry, use the roller to apply a second coat of paint, working in small sections like before.


Make sure the coat is very thin, because you don’t want to completely cover the wood grain pattern you created.
The purpose of the second coat is to create a sealing layer over the first, and also to make the wood pattern a little subtler.

, When you’ve finished the first section of the second coat, use a wide brush to gently brush over the entire area to remove roller marks. This will also create a more pronounced grain effect.Continue painting and brushing in sections until the entire second coat is complete.
Following the manufacturer’s directions, allow the paint to dry completely. This normally takes at least 24 hours.

, Aged or antique paint finishes are a great way to give walls, furniture, and other items character. Crackle painting is the most common aging finish, and it involves applying a top layer of paint that breaks and cracks the way old paint does after many years.


There are a couple ways you can create an aged crackle effect. One is with glue, and the other is with a special crackle paint.

, Color washing is a very popular paint finish for walls. It’s another way to achieve an aged and textured look, and it’s quite simple to execute. You can achieve a color washing look with a rag, a sponge, or a combination thereof.

, Granite is a very popular stone to use for counters and other home accents. However, granite can be quite expensive, and replicating the look of it with a granite paint finish is much more affordable.


The easiest way to create a faux granite finish is with a spray painting kit. You can buy these at most home, hardware, and paint stores.

, This is a great finish for walls and furniture when you want to transform the look of a room without having to spend too much money.


As with all paint projects, the key to a successful faux leather look is giving the paint time to dry properly between coats.

, A faux marble finish is a popular painting project for people who find real marble too expensive. Like other stones, faux marble is popular for:


Kitchen and bathroom counters
Fireplaces and hearths
Flooring
Desk and tabletops

Are there features in the room you want to play down or emphasize? Do you want your room to feel airier or cozier? The color you use can help you achieve the look and feel you have in mind.High contrast either in color or intensity can create a visual focal point of some feature in your room that you really love.
Avoid sharp contrasts between color or intensity if you want to downplay areas or features in your room.
Light or neutral colors can open up a small space.
Deep, rich colors in warm tones will create a cozy, inviting space.;
, You want to have a sense of the proportions of the room as well as how much paint you are going to need based on the square footage.

, Wall color can change the way room size feels or appears. If you have a very large or a very small room, select a color that will make the most of your space.Avoid sharp contrasts between colors in small rooms. Try cooler tones in neutral shades to help the room feel larger.
Large rooms can feel more cozy with medium to deep colors in warm tones.

, How large or small the room feels or appears to be can be affected by the ceiling. For instance, a large room can feel smaller if the ceiling is low, and a smaller room can feel bigger if the ceiling is very high.With a large room and a high ceiling, or a small room with a low ceiling, a contrast in color tone or intensity can visually separate the walls and ceiling. This will make a larger space feel more intimate and a small space feel more expansive.
If your room is small and has a high ceiling, or is large with a low ceiling, keep the color tones the same. Make sure that the contrast between the walls and ceilings is moderate or low.

, Room color appearance can change depending on how much light the room gets. Also, the kind of light in the room is a factor in how the color looks.Natural light will change during the day, so how it affects wall color will change too. Try out your color options first. Paint sections of the walls and check to see how it looks throughout the day.
Lighting fixtures also impact how colors will look. Paint a few sections in your color options, and then turn on the lights you will use most often to see how they affect the color.

, If your room has one or two large unbroken walls, the color you choose will have a big impact on the room overall. If there are multiple doors and windows throughout, your room will have a lot of color contrast between trim and door colors, and the wall color., When you change the wall color and trim color, you need to make sure the ceiling coordinates and looks just as fresh as the newly painted walls. In addition, just as the tone and shade can change how the room’s proportions feel, the ceiling color will have the same effect on how high or low the ceiling seems to be. "

There are also free apps that can do the same thing. These kinds of tools are great for getting a sense of how things will look overall, but keep in mind the digital version is only an approximation of how colors will coordinate in the actual space., Places that sell paint will have printed cards that show different paint colors and color families.

Decide if you want to feel soothed when you spend time in your room, or if you want to feel peppy and full of energy., Create a file with images you like and use these as a guide to help you decide what you want to do.Look for images of rooms that have an overall feel that you like.
Save images that have elements or details that appeal to you.
Make notes to yourself about why you like a particular room or look. You may forget if you collect a lot of images.
Pin up print images in your room and visualize how different looks would work in your space.

, Color family and tone are important factors in how a room will look and feel. Colors will also range from light to medium to dark. Accent colors or trim colors should have the same tone as the wall and ceiling, but you can use color intensity or color families that complement each other to create contrast.Color tone is either warm, cool, or neutral. Warm tones can create a cozy feel, while cool tones can make a room feel bigger.
Choosing coordinating colors of the same intensity can make a room feel more spacious.
Large rooms can look very dramatic and dynamic if there are sharp contrasts between the intensity of the trim and the wall color.

, Different color families affect how people feel; some colors are warmer, and others cooler, and these qualities are important for conveying a mood.


Reds are hot or warm colors typically. Red is also a very hot color in terms of creating a feeling in a room. Red can feel romantic and dramatic, or lively and exciting.
Blue is a cool color, and conveys a sense of calm and peace. Like the perfect clear light blue of a summer sky or the deep blue of the ocean, the soothing quality of blues won’t vary much with intensity.
Try green colors for a good balance between warm and cool. Because green is the result of a warm color (yellow) and a cool color (blue), it is an excellent choice for rooms with a neutral feel.
Yellow is an energy color as well as a comforting hue. Yellow is a great choice for rooms that could use some brightening up while still feeling soft and tranquil.
Neutrals like beiges or whites will almost always have a hint of color and tone. If you want a very quiet space these are a good choice, and you can introduce a suggestion of warmth or coolness by choosing a neutral with warm or cool colored tints.

, The furniture does not need to be the same color, but placing furniture in a room with walls that fall within the same color family will make the colors blend more, creating an overall space that looks wider and more open.

, Bright colors draw the eye. If you want to draw attention to the walls, one wall in particular, or to the ceiling, consider using a color that is bolder than any of the other colors found in the room.

, Neutral colors, especially shades of white, fade into the background. As a result, they show less of the surface they are painted onto, giving it less presence and less visual weight.

, This technique causes the dark color to recede, creating an illusion of width, and balancing out the room's proportions.

, Darker shades force your eye to look at head level, keeping the focus on your walls and furnishings. However, dark colors can make a low ceiling appear too overbearing.

, Light colors on the ceiling attract attention. In doing so, however, they make a room look taller than it actually is, making light colors especially well suited for low- to average-height ceilings.

Decide if an enamel paint is right for your project.,
Choose the right type of paint.,
Use high quality brushes.,
Start with a primer.,
Utilize the proper brushstroke.,
Use a sprayer.,
Apply two coats.,
Account for drying time.,
Touch up worn paint carefully.,
Clean enamel paint when needed.,
Remove paint using chemical paint strippers.",How to Work With Enamel Paint," Enamel paints are best suited for use in places outdoors that are exposed to severe weather and fluctuations in temperature. They are also useful inside the home in areas that receive heavy general wear. Due to their dense, high-gloss finish, surfaces painted with enamel paints are easily cleaned and resistant to staining and damage.


If the project you’re working on requires a piece to be able to withstand lots of abuse, enamel paints are probably right for you.Enamel paints are also a good pick for any material that needs a slick, protective finish. Bathroom fixtures and metal appliances are often finished with enamel paints.;
, Traditionally, enamel paints are oil-based. The oil content allows the paint to mix and go on smoother, as well as adhere to surfaces longer. With recent increased demand for non-toxic paint alternatives, water-based enamel paints have become more common. Water-based enamel paints can be simpler to work with, as they dry faster and are easier to clean, while oil-based enamel paints last longer and provide a smoother, more durable finish.The choice to use an oil-based vs. a water-based paint is largely preference. Water-based paints will do nicely for basic projects, while heavy duty oil-based paints will hold up to constant wear and harsh outdoor conditions.
There exists a wide variety of enamel paints. Before buying paint, take a look at many different kinds to find the one that best suits your project.

, Not just any type of brush should be used when working with enamel paints. For best results, select a brush that features the right filament type and stiffness for the paint you’re using. A Chinese or ox-hair brush, for instance, is a softer-bristled brush that helps spread thick oil-based paints effortlessly. When working with water-based enamel paints, brushes made from synthetic fibers are preferable, as the filaments won’t soak up the water contained in the paint and become soggy.Some brushes are designed with angled bristle edges that aid in painting smoother lines. This type of brush would be ideal for working with enamel paint, which demands an even finish.
Stick to one type of brush for one type of paint. For instance, while it’s okay to use a synthetic filament brush with an oil-based enamel paint, it’s better to choose a new brush if you’ve already used the synthetic brush with a water-based paint.

, Primers are special paint products that act to prepare surfaces to be painted with a topcoat. A preliminary coat of primer will fill crevices in wood grain, cover inconsistencies in unfinished materials and give the paint a more uniform area to stick to. Most primers are oil-based, which allows them to form a better seal against the wood and helps paint hold better once the primer is dry. It is recommended that you use a coat of primer before applying enamel paint, especially on indoor surfaces, furniture, cabinets and trim.Look for primers that are approved for use on the type of surface you're painting. Some brands of enamel paint are even formulated with built-in primers which improve the adhesion of the paint.
Always use a primer when painting wood and other uneven natural materials, walls, cabinets, trim and any surface with variations in dimension and texture.

, Because of its smooth, glossy consistency, enamel paints tend to make painting imperfections more visible. For this reason, it’s advisable to use a second “tip off” stroke after brushing on the top layer of paint. To do this, make sure the brush’s bristles are wet with paint (but not oversaturated) and angle the brush as you make the second pass so that only the tips run along the area that you just painted.When using the tip off technique, make sure that you drag the brush along the entire length of the painting surface (with the natural grain if you’re painting wood) to keep the thickness and orientation of each stroke uniform.
Take care to make your brush strokes as fluid and even as you can. Some surfaces, such as furniture and handmade crafts, will be harder to paint than others due to their many irregular contours.

, Enamel paints can also be applied via sprayer, a handheld device that propels paint through tiny holes at the end of a nozzle. A sprayer will ensure that the paint goes on in even coats. Using a sprayer can save you time on jobs where there’s a lot of area to cover, such as refinishing outdoor furniture and appliances.A sprayer will help you quickly take care of rugged painting projects such as coating a patio deck or touching up mechanical equipment.
Thicker types of enamel paint might need to be thinned before they can be used in a sprayer. , Most home improvement experts recommend applying a second coat on projects for which enamel paints are used because of the need for protective coverage. Allow paint to dry between coats, and tip off the top coat for an even finish. Two coats of paint will be superior to a single coat for seamlessness, durability and color integrity.


Use two coats of paint on stairs, outdoor work spaces and any surface that receives regular exposure to the elements.
While you should apply the first coat as smoothly as possible, it’s not necessary to tip it off; this process will be reserved for the outermost coat.

, Under normal conditions, oil-based enamel paints will require between 8-24 hours to dry completely due to their thickness. Water-based paint can dry to the touch in 1-2 hours or less. Temperature and humidity have an effect on drying time, so outdoor projects can be expected to take longer to dry. Freshly painted surfaces should be left alone while drying to prevent smudging and other contact imperfections.Whenever possible, time outdoor painting projects to coincide with warm, dry weather to prevent excessive humidity, temperature spikes or precipitation from potentially sabotaging the drying process.
Some paint companies have special quick-drying enamel paint formulas that dry in as little as 15-20 minutes., When reapplying enamel paint to worn and discolored areas, use a single thin coat at a time. Brush the fresh coat on carefully to make sure that the surface remains uniform. Primer shouldn’t be needed for touch ups unless you plan on completely stripping the paint from an area first.It’s generally a good idea to apply a fresh coat over the entire area being painted, provided that it’s not too large. This way you can avoid variations in thickness or a mismatch “seam” where the new coat has been brushed on.

, Another benefit of the smooth finishes created by enamel paints is that they lend themselves to hassle-free cleaning. Should a painted surface become dirty, simply wet a towel with a mixture of warm water and a mild liquid detergent and wipe away whatever debris is clinging to the paint’s exterior. Oil-based enamel paints can be more difficult to clean and may require the use of mineral spirits or diluted acetone.Mineral spirits is a mild solvent used to thin and strip paints. It can be brushed on or applied with a damp towel. Because of its solvent properties, mineral spirits are highly effective at removing dust and grime from dried enamel paint., If you need to take off a coating of paint, you will most likely need a powerful paint stripper. Chemical strippers come in a variety of forms and are one of the only methods strong enough for removing the thick, hardened paint. Apply the paint stripper in heavy globs rather than even coats and allow time for the solvent to take effect. After the chemical stripper has set to work dissolving the enamel paint, remove any remaining paint by going over the area with a medium-grit sandpaper.Chemical paint strippers tend to highly caustic, and some types may emit toxic fumes. Caution should be taken when using chemical strippers to remove enamel paint yourself.
If possible, acquire the services of professional paint specialists to strip surfaces finished with enamel paints.

Think about the mood of the room.,
Check the lighting.,
Don't go headfirst into painting; try painting your colour on a poster board before doing the entire wall.,
Use the colour wheel.,
Don't just focus on the one room.,
Think having just one colour is boring?,
Consider the room.",How to Choose a Paint Colour," Do you want it to be fresh and open, or intimate and dramatic? Lighter feelings are usually created by cool colours, while warm colours generally make the room heavier and more dramatic. Do you want stimulating and sociable or formal and quiet? Warm, bright and contrasting colours make for a more outgoing atmosphere; for a more formal atmosphere, try going with deeper blue-greens and neutrals.;
, They have the light boxes at paint stores for a reason: colours can look different in different lighting.


Natural lighting shows the truest colours
Warm tones and yellows are brought out by incandescent lighting
Fluorescent lighting causes a sharp blue tone

, Don't be afraid to get brighter colours outside of your comfort zone; a chocolate brown or canary yellow might be great for an accent, or maybe the entire wall.

, A small colour wheel can be an invaluable asset when picking paint colours. It can help you intensify colours; for instance, if you want a strong red, have green accents, as they are complementary colours and bring each other out. Look up other complementary colours and use them for accents and main colours.

, You need to think of your house as a whole, otherwise you will have abrupt stops and starts of different colours. Consider how the colour of, say, the dining room interacts with the colour of the kitchen.

, Think again. There are so many shades of colours, you could have an entire house painted in shades of white and it would never feel boring. Use the colour wheel to find different shades of a colour that go very well with each other; you could, for example, have goldenrod walls with maize accents, or olive walls with shamrock trim. The possibilities are endless for a single colour.

, If you have a spacious room that you want to seem cozier, go with a warm hue; for smaller rooms that you want to feel larger, use cooler hues.



Consider the furniture, too. If you've already got furniture, choose paint that will not clash with it.
Finishes play a big part. If you choose the same colour for walls and trim, simply getting different finishes can make them seem different. You could have an eggshell finish on walls and satin on trim, or vice versa. The choice is yours. Use flat paint for low-traffic areas, such as ceilings and walls. Following that, use low-luster or satin finishes on areas you desire to have a bit of a shine; these types of paint are easier to clean and are better in high-traffic areas like hallways, kids' rooms, and kitchens. Using this information, use high-gloss paints for shelves, banisters, or the like-anything you'd like to accent. But beware, higher glosses tend to bring out imperfections.

Choose a warm color to convey togetherness and strength.,
Consider painting the walls a brown-tinted red to create a warm, inviting appearance.,
Avoid using red on the ceiling.,
Add a delicate touch to any room by painting the walls or ceiling a light pink.,
Create warmth in a room by painting the walls burnt orange.,
Add peachy tones to a room to make it glow.,
Lighten up a room by painting the ceiling or walls yellow.,
Consider using bright red, bright pink, or bright orange as accent colors.",How to Choose Interior Paint Colors2," Warm colors make a room feel cozy and intimate. Muted tones and deep tones have the coziest effect, while brighter tones may seem loud and chaotic if used in large amounts.

, This color automatically triggers a sense of comfort in most individuals. It is a little darker in tone, which draws the room in and increases the coziness as a result.

, It can appear weighty and oppressive.

, Pink is dainty and feminine and usually works best in a girl's bedroom. Pink also works in bathrooms, since light shades complement skin tones.

, Like brown-tinted reds, burnt orange combines the weight of a dark color with the natural coziness of the warmer half of the color spectrum to create a comfortable, intimate space.

, Peach tones enhance skin tones, making them especially suitable for the bathroom.

, Yellow often appears brighter than plain white appears and makes an especially helpful choice in rooms with poor lighting. Light hues work best in accomplishing this task, while golden hues tend to create a warmer ambiance.

, These colors can all seem overwhelming if you fill the room with them, and painting all the walls in a room in a saturated tone may make the room feel chaotic and uncomfortable. Instead, use these colors in accent pieces, or paint one wall a bright shade while choosing something more muted for the other three.

Choose cool colors to create a soothing effect.,
Paint a room green to give it a natural tone.,
Bring peace to a room by painting the ceiling blue.,
Use violet to create an air of serenity.",How to Choose Interior Paint Colors3," Cool colors seem fresh and relaxing. Lighter shades seem fresh and clean, while darker shades can almost be therapeutic.

, Green is a color found most prominently in nature, allowing it to blend in easily with most rooms. Green walls tend to give off a calm, safe feeling, but green can also reflect light poorly and make your skin tone look unattractive, especially when green is used on the ceiling. Therefore, green may not make the best choice for bathrooms.

, Light shades have a cool, heavenly appearance, while dark hues make the ceiling look as though it is advancing, making dark shades more suitable for tall rooms.

, Violet is a regal and romantic color. It has less energy than red but more energy than blue. As a result, violet walls can give a room a sense of balance and harmony.

Keep things simple with neutral colors.,
Use white to create a blank slate.,
Paint a high ceiling black or dark brown, especially if it is an exposed ceiling with open ductwork.,
Create shadows by painting the ceiling or walls gray.,
Opt for brown walls if you want a warmer neutral.",How to Choose Interior Paint Colors4," Neutral tones include shades of white, gray, black, and some browns. They blend in with most surroundings and make it easier for homeowners and interior designers to change out furniture later.

, White on the ceiling reflects light and reduces shadows, making a room look more open. White on walls can also open a room and will make it look neutral in the process. This hue provides you with the greatest amount of versatility when it comes to room accessories.

, These dark hues can camouflage ductwork and direct the eye downward, back into the room. Avoid putting these colors on the walls, however, since they tend to seem threatening and over dramatic.

, Gray adds a little bit of drama without becoming too intense. The hue can also inspire creativity.

, Brown has a warm, durable ambiance. Mid-tones and dark hues are especially warm, while soft hues feel natural and neutral.

Base your color scheme on your furniture.,
Opt for a complementary color scheme to draw out the richness of your paint.,
Keep things mellow with monochromatic and related colors.,
Pick a style or theme.,
Save your boldest colors for accents.,
Consider using multiple paint colors.,
Try the color before committing to it.",How to Choose Paint Color for a Bedroom1," If you already have furniture for your bedroom, select a color scheme from that. Pick colors from your dominant pieces, such as floor rugs, chairs, and bedspreads, and choose paint colors that match these hues. If you introduce an entirely new color, you may pick something that clashes, or you may make your bedroom look too busy by having too many colors.;
, Complementary colors are found on the opposite ends of the color wheel and include red and green, yellow and violet, and blue and orange. Choose a subtle hue of one color and pair it with a dominant hue of its complement. You can accomplish this with paint alone, or you can rely on a combination of paint and other decorations.

, Related colors are found next to each other on the color wheel, and monochromatic colors are colors of the same hue but different tones. Both of these color schemes have stylish, uniform appeal.

, The right paint color can bring a theme together, but the wrong one can completely tear it apart.


Stick with white, black, or similar neutrals for a modern bedroom space.






Give your room an exotic twist with a cinnamon or apricot hue.






Opt for ivory or rich hues to create a more traditional style.







, Bright, bold colors can seem too energetic and overwhelming in a bedroom if used as the dominant paint color. Instead, opt for a more toned-down shade for your paint and introduce bright splashes of color by using other design details.

, Walls are traditionally painted a single color, but you can add drama and depth by painting one wall a different color. This ""accent wall"" tends to be a richer or more vibrant shade than the other walls.

, Buy a sample color and paint a corner of one wall with your selection to see how it looks in the room's lighting. If you like what you see, move forward with it. Otherwise, make a different selection and try again.

Measure the room.,
Determine the surface area of the walls in square feet or meters.,
Find the total preliminary surface area of the walls by adding the totals of the four walls together.,
Account for door and window areas.,
Calculate the net surface area.,
Allow for special circumstances.,
Account for the doors, door frames and baseboards.,
Compute the surface area of the ceiling.,
Calculate the amount of paint you'll need to paint the room.",How to Calculate Amount of Paint to Paint a Room," Start by recording the height and width of each wall.;
, For example, if a wall is 15 feet (4.6 m) wide and 10 feet (3.1 m) high, the square footage of the wall is 150. If the longer walls of the room are 20 feet (6.1 m) wide, the square footage of each wall is 200. Opposite walls in a standard room will have the same surface area.

, In our example, the preliminary square footage is 700 (150+150+200+200=700). Jot all your figures down with pencil and paper.

, Subtract the surface area of doors, including the frame, and windows when calculating how much paint you'll need. For example, in room whose wall surface area is 700 square feet, there are 2 doors and a window. 1 door, including frame, measures 4 feet (1.2 m) wide by 8 feet (2.4 m) tall. The other door is 10 feet by 8 feet. The window is 10 feet wide by 4 feet high. The total square footage of these areas is 152 (32+80+40=152).

, Subtract the area of the doors and windows from the total surface area of the four walls. In our example, it is 548 square feet (700-152=548).

, You might want to paint certain areas, like window sills, the same color as the walls. You can build small areas into your calculations by adding 10 percent to your net surface area. In this example, you would need to add enough paint to account for 54.8 additional square feet of coverage.

, Most people paint these items the same color, but choose a different color than they use for the walls.


In our example, the surface area of the doors is 112 square feet. The baseboards, if any, usually will be about 3 inches high (7.6 cm) and will extend around the room, minus the space of the door frames. The 2 doors in the example are on the same 20 foot (6.1 m) long wall. One door is 4 feet (1.2 m) wide and the other is 8 feet (2.4 m). That means the baseboard on that wall is 8 feet (2.4 m) long. The other baseboards are 15 feet (4.6 m), 15 (4.6 m) and 20 feet (6.1 m). The total linear footage of the baseboards is 58 feet (17.678 m).
Convert the surface area of the 3 inch (7.6 cm) baseboards into square feet. Divide their total linear footage by 4. 58 feet/4=14.5 square feet. To paint the doors, door frames and baseboards in the example, you will need enough paint to cover 126 square feet. Add 20 percent to this figure to account for door frames and touch-ups, bringing the total to 151 square feet.

, Measure the width and length of the floor. Multiply the two. That is the square footage, minus any vents or fixtures. In our example, the ceiling is 200 square feet. Textured ceilings may require slightly more paint.

, Estimates range between 350 to 400 square feet per gallon of paint on smooth, interior plaster walls. In this example, you would need slightly less than 2 gallons of paint to cover the walls with a single coat. If you want to paint doors, door frames, baseboards and the ceiling the same color, you will need an additional gallon of paint. Use these parameters if you're painting with brushes and rollers. If you're using a sprayer, you will need about 10 percent more paint.

Add throw pillows and blankets.,
Drape fabric in fall colors over your window covers.,
Put up fall wallpaper.,
Add new rugs near your doors.",How to Decorate Your Home With a Fall Theme1," Collect leaves, branches and pine cones from your backyard or a nearby park. Individual leaves and branches surrounding battery-powered candles on a tray or charger plate is a subtle but beautiful accent. You can also press dried leaves flat and arrange one or two in a picture frame. For a more dramatic centerpiece, cut medium- to large-sized branches with changing leaves and place them in a large vase.As fall progresses, the leaves that change color vary so you can continue to collect different hues and patterns throughout the season.
If you don’t live in an area that experiences fall, purchase fake pine cones, branches and leaves to reuse each year.
There are endless ideas to decorate with dried leaves and branches. Use your creativity!;
, Decorate your dinner table, sideboards and coffee tables with pumpkins and squash of all sizes. Add some dried wheat, dried Indian corn and fall-themed ribbons to create an entire centerpiece or focal point. Place the pumpkins, gourds or squash on a fall table runner or in cylindrical vases with vines or branches. Accent these festive centerpieces with votive candles.Buy carving pumpkins early in the season to use as decoration for the fall, and then carve them when it comes time for Halloween.
Yellow, green and purple squash can double as decoration before you prepare it for a meal.

, Place kindling or pine cones to throw in the fire in a basket near the fireplace. Baskets can hold seasonal soaps, lotions and tissue in the bathroom. Use a large bushel basket to hold extra blankets near the sofa. A basket by the front door can be a holder for umbrellas.

, Find accents in colors like gold, crimson, red, orange, vermilion, tan, beige and maroon. Arrange seasonal pillows and throws by layering colors and adding in a few patterns and textures. Pick patterns and textures with similar shades to keep the arrangement cohesive.Work from the outside of the sofa and move inwards as you arrange.
To save some money, buy pillow covers that you can put on the pillows you already have.
Don’t be afraid to add in extra large pillows or odd shapes to mix up the look.

, Don’t worry about purchasing new curtains or drapes for the season, but instead purchase a large piece of fabric that you can drape across the curtain rod for a cozy touch.


Make sure that the fabric lays evenly on both sides.

, Before installing, wipe down the wall you are planning to cover and let it fully dry. Unroll the wallpaper and place a few heavy books on the corners to help flatten the curled edges. Cut the panels of paper according to the space you have and lightly mark the wall with a pencil where the edges of the panel should go. Stick the paper to the wall and smooth out any creases and bubbles.Temporary wallpaper makes it easy to switch out your look for each season.
Peel and stick wallpaper typically runs for less than $50 a panel.
Be sure to measure the space you plan to cover carefully before purchasing the wallpaper panels. Consider purchasing more than you need to be sure you have enough.
Ask a friend to help. The process is much easier with two sets of hands.

, Large rugs can change the look of a room but are pricey, so you can just focus on switching out rugs near your home’s entryways, in the bathrooms and under the kitchen sink.


Instead of purchasing Halloween or Thanksgiving rugs, consider purchasing fall themed rugs to keep all season.

Consult the color wheel.,
Try a bright color to contrast with neutral shades.,
Evaluate the colors of your neighborhood.,
Think about matching with subtle exterior colors.",How to Choose a Front Door Color1," You can find a color wheel online. The color wheel shows which colors best compliment one another. Look at things like your home's color and any colors on places like your front porch. Pick a color that matches based on the color wheel.For a monochromatic style, you can pick several shades of the same color. For example, a red house could be paired with a red door of a slightly different shade.
For a light contrast, select a door color about three colors away from the color of your home, siding, or another exterior color.
If you want complimentary colors, go for colors on the opposite sides of a color wheel. For example, choose a yellow door if you home is colored in a purple shade.;
, If your home is a neutral shade, this gives you a lot of freedom when choosing a door color. You can use your door as an opportunity to add color to a duller home. For example, a yellow door can add a bright, welcoming touch to a home painted in a shade like gray., You may not want your home to stand out too much in the neighborhood. You do not want your home to look too strange or out of place. Make a quick drive through your neighborhood and check out other people's front doors. See if there are certain or color schemes that seem to be more acceptable.For example, you may notice red is a popular color in your area. If you see a lot of red doors, consider this color for your own front door.
If you want to stand out just a little, pick something that fits with the color scheme but is unique. If most red doors tend to be very bright, go for a shade like burgundy.

, You do not have to match strictly with the color of your paint or siding. Look for subtle exterior colors found outside your home. For example, maybe the porch rails are painted yellow. You could make a yellow door to match to draw everything together. You could also look at the trim near your home. Pair a blue door with a blue trim."

Consider neutral colors.",How to Choose Paint Color for a Bedroom2," If you have a small bedroom, you may want to put lighter shades on the wall, since lighter shades create a wider, more open appearance. If you have a large bedroom, you can experiment with bright and rich hues that close the space in, creating a cozier ambiance.

, Many individuals only think about what color to put on their walls, but you can paint the ceiling of your bedroom to give the room an entirely different mood. If you have a low ceiling, you can open it up by sticking with white or light yellow. If you have a high ceiling, you can create a warmer, more enclosed space by painting it a shade or two darker than the color you have on your walls.

, Generally, warm colors create a cozy feeling, but bright shades of warm colors can be energizing and oppressive. Cool hues almost always promote a sense of calm.

, Walls painted burgundy red or burnt orange can inspire warmth and passion in your bedroom. Bright, neon shades can quickly overwhelm the space, making it too vibrant and energetic to relax in.

, Golden hues create warmth, while pale hues open a space and create the illusion of additional light. Sharp yellows are often too dramatic to use as wall paint, however.

, Light blues are reminiscent of the sky and sea, and as a result, they create an open, free ambiance. Medium to deep blues have a more sober effect, but can be just as soothing.

, Violet has romantic connotations but is less bold and in-your-face as red or pink tends to be. A violet on the cool side of the spectrum can also create a peaceful, harmonic sensation, especially when used in light shades like lavender.

, Medium and dark browns have an especially soothing effect. Light greens can also work well for bedroom paint, but deep, saturated greens do not flatter most skin tones and should be avoided.

, Neutral paint colors are the most versatile and can be made to work with nearly any color scheme you choose for your furniture and decorations. Stick with stark white to open a space up, grays to introduce a cool edge into the room, and beige and tans to add a touch of warmth.

If your favorite colors would go well with your home, think about choosing one of your favorite colors for your front door.Make sure the color is fitting, however. You may have to alter your favorite color to match your home's color scheme. Consult the color wheel.
For example, maybe your home is painted light green. If your favorite colors are bright floral shades, like fuchsias and purples, this may not go great with a lighter green. However, a light pink is also a floral shade and would match better with a green house.

, If you want your door to be very noticeable, think about a bolder shade. Oranges, purples, and very bright blues can make for dramatic shades. If your personal style tends to veer towards the bold, think about a bright and somewhat unusual color.Be careful not to verge on gaudy though. When select a bold shade, do not go too bright or fluorescent. This may look too out there for a front door.

, Yellow and blue shade tend to look welcoming. People are drawn to these kind of friendly and inviting colors.

Try a richer, deeper color for a traditional home.,
Go for something brighter with a modern home.,
Evaluate your home's geographical or period influences.,
Do not be afraid to break tradition.",How to Choose a Front Door Color3," More traditional styled homes, like Victorian homes, pair better with richer, deeper colors. Something like black, navy, or dark red would pair well with a more traditional home. It may be a good idea to stay away from brighter, modern colors.Old-fashioned farmhouse-style homes, however, are an exception. They often have brightly colored doors, such as a red door on a white farmhouse-style home.

, For a home that was built recently or fairly recently, something brighter could work well as a front door color. Think about bolder shades like bright reds, yellows, and blues., A house that's meant to look like it belongs in a certain era or place may look better or worse with certain colors. An English tutor style home, for example, may not look great with pastels. Homes designed with a Mediterranean style in mind may pair well with turquoise. Think about the geographical region or time period your home evokes and look up houses from that place or time. See what door colors are traditionally used., There are no hard and fast rules for painting a door. If you're attached to a particular color, you may be able to make it work even if it clashes slightly with your house's style. Don't be afraid to break convention to get what you really want.For example, if you want a bright purple door, but your house is an older style, think about sticking to the purple but compromising. A rich and deep purple, for example, could pair well with a house with an older style.

Paint!",How to Choose a Paint Color," You will need to measure the room you want to paint in case you want to make designs with the colors you chose.;
, You should search for stores that you might trust to have good paint options. You can look on the internet for more local choices.

, If you find free swatches, hold them up to the wall of the room that you want to paint.

, Does your paint color complement them? Complement (not compliment) is a technical term in color analysis. Many people choose a light blue or Navajo white, perhaps a beige or light rose, for their walls because anything too heavy/dark can be depressing after awhile (for most people). Light colors help your nice furnishings stand out better.

, From which direction? Not all four walls and the ceiling need be the exact same tone, though that is generally a little less expensive perhaps. You will find that a bright yellow with a lot of sunlight can be electrifying, perhaps too much of a good thing? Better might be a light olive green, as it's more sophisticated, especially if you have nice houseplants. Light green has long been used in hospitals because it was thought to have a curative effect but nowadays most hospitals go with white it seems, as it's more clean and surgical-looking. Consider whether you want a flat finish or a gloss finish. Perhaps you have a smoker and want a grey-yellow to help blend the effects of the smoke's staining. Perhaps you eat in the room all the time and want the walls to look especially clean. perhaps you have spiders in the summertime -- there are a lot of factors to consider! Think it through carefully -- take your time and use your imagination to picture the space with the new color.

, When you have decided your color, paint the room or find someone to do it for you.

, Instead of throwing a fiery red rug into a black-and-white room, weave color into the space a little more naturally. Toss a few teal or violet pillows onto a cream couch, or match a brightly colored rug with a modern painting that contains the same hue.


By using varying neutrals within the space, you also create a sense of harmony and contrast that you cannot get by sticking with simple black and white, which makes brighter accent colors seem more harmonious with the rest of the room.

, Contemporary style is all about simplicity. Zebra and leopard print, polka dots, floral, or other patterns add busy details that clash with the no-fuss nature of a contemporary space, even when used as accents.

, Look for furnishings with solid, well-defined lines instead of over-stuffed or floppy pieces. Unlike modern style, contemporary style usually includes rectangles with slightly rounded edges over those with sharp corners, but the lines must remain just as smooth.

, Steer clear of details like scroll-style arms, engravings, excessive graining, and trims. The legs and surfaces of your furnishing should remain clean and tidy.

, Leather, cotton, and canvas are popular choices for upholstery, but many contemporary spaces introduce silk, wool, and linen into the mix in the form of pillows, drapes, throws, and other fabric accessories.

, Maple and birch are favored choices, as long as the wood does not have any heavy or distracting graining. Dark woods can weigh a room down, while light woods can give the room that light, natural look that most contemporary themes lean toward.

, Wood should be polished until it shines or coated in a glossy lacquer. Handles, hardware, and table legs are often made with metals like stainless steel and nickel, and glass table tops are equally common.

, Instead of relying on patterns, colors, and accessories to add visual interest to a room, contemporary style is more likely to introduce various materials and textures into a space. Pair silk throw pillows with a canvas couch, or introduce marble flooring into a bathroom with white tile walls and metallic faucets.

, Beds and lounge seating—couches and living room chairs—are often low to the ground, concealing short, simple legs. Low contemporary furniture either has thin yet sturdy legs or rests on top of a solid platform.


You do not need to choose low pieces for other types of seating, such as dining room or desk chairs. These pieces should stick with thin, sturdy legs instead of solid platforms, however.

, A smart contemporary room uses lighting to make a statement. Ideally, a contemporary space will have a large window that lets in plenty of natural light. The room should also have plenty of floor and/or ceiling lights. Ceiling lights that can be directed onto artwork or other statement pieces are especially desirable.

, Steel, chrome, or nickel lamps are more fitting than lamps made with wood, ceramic, painted metal, or gold finishing. Floor and desk lamps with straight, hard lines are also preferable to soft, curvy designs.

, These pieces have a no-fuss ambiance that coordinates well with the simplicity of contemporary design. Stoves and other kitchen appliances should be made of stainless steel and have an industrial look. Sinks should have slick, metallic faucets, and cabinets should have doors with smooth fronts.

, Paintings, vases, a stack of books, and sculptures are all fair game. If you opt for a painting, look for a simple one with minimal colors, and avoid pictures of elaborate scenes. Similarly, vases and sculptures should use very few colors.

, Contemporary areas should look open and inviting. Do not fill a room with more furniture than you have space for, and do not clutter tables, counters, and walls with too many accessories. Limit your accessories to one or two statement pieces for best results.

For example, look for neon hooks in the shape of animals.

, If you have some old chairs in your kitchen, consider spray painting parts of them in neon shades. You don't have to spray down the entire chair if you feel it would be too much. You can just spray down key parts, like the seats or legs.This can work well if your kitchen has a more neutral color scheme. Some neon on your chairs can brighten up the room.

, Many people shy away from the idea of painting a wall neon. It may seem too bright or even tacky. However, a small splash of neon on one wall can actually brighten up a room without being too gaudy or distracting.If you have a room with neutral colored wall paper or paint, try painting one wall in a neon shade to add some light and fun.

For example, if your living room is mostly in shades of beige or white, add a neon end table or toss a few neon throw pillows on your couch., You can paint around the windows of your front door, using neon shades. You can also paint something like the handle or frame of a door neon. A few neon accents on the doors in your home can incorporate neon in a way that is not overwhelming., Being too concerned with matching is a decoration pitfall in general. Worrying too much about matching with neon is particularly difficult. Your neon shades will probably not match the color scheme of your room exactly and that's okay. Neon is meant to add some variation to a room. It's okay if neon colors differ a little from other shades in your home., While many neon shades are fun and attractive, some decorators dislike neon green. The color tends to be polarizing and can easily overwhelm a room. If you're concerned about your home looking tacky, stick to other shades of neon., Remember, neon can be intense. Therefore, you may be better off using it often forgotten areas of the home. Places like windowsills, cabinets, and artwork on the walls can all incorporate neon. This adds a hint of neon without overwhelming a room."

, Making the room look like a rainforest or the open seas with pirate decorations will, of course, excite everyone who enters the room at first but could grow stale over time.

Gather your materials.,
Prepare your work area.,
Measure and cut the PVC for its intended use.,
Sand the outside of the PVC.,
Treat the PVC with acetone.,
Apply multiple coats of spray paint.,
Allow the painted PVC to dry.",How to Paint PVC1," For a basic PVC paint job, you’ll need a large sheet of high-grit sandpaper, a small container of acetone, a clean washcloth, one or more cans of spray paint in your chosen color and the PVC you wish to paint. Make sure you have everything you need before you begin painting.


Practice proper workshop safety. Wear gloves, protective eyewear and a ventilated facemask to filter out dust and chemicals.Choose a spray paint that’s specially formulated for use on plastics, such as Krylon Fusion or Rust-Oleum Plastic.;
, Lay down a large dropcloth or plastic tarp where you plan to do your painting. Keep all furniture and nearby appliances and electronics covered. Remember to work in a space that permits proper airflow, like a garage or workshop with the doors and windows open.Work in a well-ventilated, open space. This will not only help the paint dry faster but keep you from being exposed to harmful acetone and paint fumes.Spray paint tends to disperse when it’s applied, so a dropcloth will be useful for protecting floors, countertops and other work surfaces.
If you don’t have access to a dropcloth, you could also use a few overlapping sheets of newspaper.

, The PVC should already be the right size and shape for the project you have planned. Take care of any necessary measuring, cutting and assembling in advance. That way, all you’ll have to do is add a custom color and install.








If the PVC you’re painting needs to be fitted with elbow corners, for instance, they should be in place prior to sanding and painting.

, Go over the outer surface of the PVC with a high-grit sandpaper. The most efficient way to do this is to place the sheet of sandpaper in your palm and wrap your whole hand around the pipe. You can then scour the PVC from one end to the other with a wrapping motion to achieve a uniform finish.








Avoid oversanding the PVC, as this can result in walls of inconsistent thicknesses that may wear out at a faster rate.
A fine sandpaper with a grit of 220 or higher is recommended., Place the corner of a clean, dry cloth over the mouth of an upturned bottle of acetone to dampen it. Then, wipe the acetone over the sanded PVC. You don’t need to use a lot—just enough to prepare the surface of the PVC for painting.








Wiping the PVC will help remove any loose grit left over from sanding.
The acetone will also cause the plastic to expand and become more porous, allowing it to hold paint better., Using slow, steady strokes, spray a light mist of paint down the length of the PVC pipe, making each pass as light as possible to prevent drips or runs. After you’ve painted one edge of the PVC, rotate it to paint the other side. Aim for a smooth, even finish free of bald spots and defects.








Continue applying additional coats until you reach the desired depth of color.
Let the paint dry for 20 to 30 minutes between coats., Once you’ve achieved the color and coverage you want, set the PVC aside and let it begin to set. Painted PVC will require 24 hours or more to dry to the touch. The paint should be sufficiently cured to withstand heat, pressure and scratches before being used in household or construction projects.








If you plan on using the PVC for especially messy or heavy-duty jobs, it may need to cure for as long as one 20-30 days."

Buy light-weight fabric and wrap your columns.,
Wrap columns with strings of lights.,
Buy fresh cut flower garlands.",How to Decorate Interior Columns," Columns are often decorated for weddings, Christmas, Easter and other parties or events. If you are creating decorations for permanent use in your home, consider a decorating theme to pull your other décor together.;
, You will need to choose or make decorations that match the palette. Request paint chips from a hardware store that you can carry around to craft stores and use at home.

, If you have purchased temporary columns for an event, you may choose to paint them to match furniture or other items.

Spray paint columns that will only be used for a single event. This can save you time, and spray paint comes in a variety of colors and finishes.






Paint the columns to look rustic. Search for craft tutorials online that show you how to do a barn, weathered or Tuscan finish on wood and other materials.







, You should determine the space between the columns and measure it for decorations. Keep in mind how sturdy the columns are when you are choosing your decorating materials.

, Half columns are regularly used to accent permanently decorated spaces, such as living rooms, dining rooms and hallways. Make sure that columns are placed away from traffic so they cannot be easily bumped.

, Garlands are versatile strands of décor that can be adjusted to use on almost any occasion. Wrap the garlands and secure at the top and bottom with nails, craft tape or tacks.

Find wreath-like garlands to decorate. You can find faux-pine or holly garlands and craft stores. Add your own ornaments, sprigs of holly or baby's breath. You can also use a hot glue gun to secure items onto the garland once it's been wrapped.






Make a garland out of string or felt pendants. Hang this festive banner at the tops of columns and around them for a child's birthday party.






Choose fake flowers that match the event's season. Wrap the wire stems around a leafy garland to create a floral arrangement that can be twisted around a column.







, First, wrap chiffon around the columns, and then cross fabric behind the columns to create a backdrop for a stage or ceremony,

, Wrap chiffon around the columns afterward. Plugging in the strand of lights will make them glow.

, Many flower stores make garlands from greenery and flowers that can be draped or hung around columns. Fresh cut flowers can turn an inside space into a garden-like atmosphere.

Sand the PVC to prepare it for painting.,
Wipe the PVC down with acetone.,
Apply a base coat of primer.,
Brush on the first coat of paint.,
Use additional coats as needed.",How to Paint PVC2," Scour the entire area of the PVC pipe to roughen up the slick exterior. This will help color settle into the plastic more easily. Use a consistent pressure and stroke length to get an even finish.








Think twice before using an electric sander. This can shave away too much of the PVC.

, Clear away as much dust and grit as you can. Let the acetone dry for 20-30 minutes. Be sure to wear gloves and work in a well-ventilated space during this part.









Rewet the cloth as needed to cover the area you sanded.
Try not to oversaturate the PVC. Too much acetone may eat away at the plastic, weakening its structure., Brush on a light layer of primer, working lengthwise from end to end. Primer is indispensable for encouraging paint to stick to surfaces that are otherwise too smooth to hold it. A single coat should be enough to do the trick.








Look for primer in a basic matte white. This will be versatile enough to make any shade of paint show up clearly and vividly.

, Once again, apply the paint in long, smooth strokes from one end to the other, the same way you did the primer. Turn the PVC as you go, painting overlapping stripes until you you’ve covered every edge.








Use a small, soft-bristled brush not much wider than the pipe.
Look for paints that will mimic the waterproofing effect of PVC, like a semigloss satin, latex or acrylic., You may need to layer on multiple coats before the color really starts to show. The color will darken and deepen with each subsequent coat. When you’re done, leave the PVC to dry for 24-48 hours. Afterwards, you’ll have a vibrant, resilient section of plastic piping to put to use in just about any project imaginable!








Most paint jobs will require an average of 2-3 separate coats.
Be careful not to apply the paint so heavily that it creates visible drips.

Small balconies present big challenges.,
Assess your wants.,
Know the rules.,
Know your neighbors.",How to Decorate Small Apartment Balconies1," What is the shape of your balcony: short and square or long and skinny? Enclosed, covered, or open to the elements? Deck-style flooring or concrete slab? Knowing these things will help you determine what kind of furniture, plants, or accessories will work best, and what won't work well at all. Putting a wide bench on a narrow balcony won't leave you much room for anything else.


A good rule of thumb would be to use furniture that mirrors the shape of the balcony.;
, Would you be happiest with a visual delight, a place to barbecue, or a spot for relaxation and cozy conversations? Small balconies will make it a challenge to have it all, so narrowing your focus to what’s most important to you is crucial.

, Your landlord or management company undoubtedly has a list of things you can and cannot have on your balcony. Many apartments and condos prohibit charcoal barbecues, for example.

, Consider them when planning your urban getaway. You may love having a bonsai rain forest on your balcony, but your neighbors below you might not enjoy having a steady flow of water on their carefully constructed desert scape or baby’s playpen.

Use a proper face mask to avoid all respiratory issues and internal tissue irritation.",How to Paint Over a Chrome Surface1," Depending on whether it is inhaled or absorbed through the skin, Chromium can cause irritation to the throat, nose, skin, and eyes, with the possibility of eye damage. It can create symptoms similar to influenza, asthma, and allergies, as well as the possibility of lung cancer with airborne contact.In addition to chrome, any primer you use likely has the potential to cause not only the same issues above, but also have chronic negative effects on the liver, cardiovascular, reproductive, and urinary systems.;
, This will decrease the likelihood of any sickness via inhalation of hazardous materials.More often than not, repair work like this is performed on a garage. This allows fresh air to enter easily and replace any fumes, dusts, or vapors that could bring you harm.


Keeping your paints and primers closed in their containers while not in use will help maintain a clean atmosphere and limit your exposure to hazardous chemicals.

, This should protect your skin from any contact with the chromium and/or primer. Another option is coveralls. A favorite of those who work in metal shops and auto repair, these are the onesies of safety and provide ample coverage of your appendages and torso.

, Since you will be working with corrosive substances, gloves made of thin plastic will not suffice. It is therefore recommended to use gloves made of P.V.C, rubber, or neoprene.As for footwear, there are a number of chemical resistant shoes available online. However, since you will not be handling any of the materials with your feet, it's really most important to just find something that completely covers your skin.

, If you choose to use an electric sander, this will guard the soft tissue of your eye from any flying debris. It will also block any splashes of paint, primer, and fumes wafting from these substances. Although it is common to simply wear glasses that rest on the ears, it is advisable to use goggles while working with chemicals.This way you have a tight film around the entire eye, and gaseous particles cannot cause you any harm.

, It is preferable to select a respirator that conforms to OSHA standards.This will filter out any particles in your paint of primer that could lead to infections of the lungs. Particulate respirators like the N-95 - common to hospitals - are simple and widely available, but insufficient. It is necessary to get something that protects not just from particles but from chemicals, gases, and vapors."

If you’re working in a home, you can paint plastic walls (in a bathroom or kitchen), cabinets, and backsplashes.You cannot paint plastic/laminate floors, bathtubs/shower stalls, or counters.
Keep in mind that if you paint something that gets a lot of use - such as a piece of furniture - it may require more coats of paint over time.;
, Plastic requires cleaning before you paint it. To clean plastic, mix a small amount of mild dish soap with water. Use a dry cloth or soft towel to wipe your plastic down with this solution. Remove any unwanted dirt or grime so your plastic is completely clean.







, Get a clean dry cloth or towel wet with clear water. Use that to wipe down your plastic to rinse off any lingering soap. Make sure you get off all soap residue before proceeding.







, Dab a small amount of rubbing alcohol on a soft cloth or towel. Rub down the full surface of the plastic with the rubbing alcohol to sanitize it and complete the cleaning process.







, After cleaning your plastic, let it dry completely before proceeding.Drying times vary depending on the size of your plastic and the climate in your region. Give plastic at least a few hours to dry.

, If there's any old paint stuck on your plastic, or if you notice any rough surfaces, use a light grit sand paper to sand off the old paint or smooth down rough patches.








Press gently when sanding plastic. Plastic is more prone to scratches than other materials., Plastic should be painted with spray paint. Not all paints will work on plastic items; if you choose the wrong paint, it will simply peel or smear off, even after drying. Head to the store or search online for specialty plastic paint. This is often available in both spray-paint and liquid (brush-on) paint, although the former tends to be easier to apply.


Plastic usually does not need a primer coat before painting.

, Work outdoors or in a well-ventilated area, such as a garage. To minimize cleanup and mess, lay down protective covering on the ground surrounding your plastic. This can include a tarp, newspaper, or sheets of cardboard.








If there are any places on your plastic you do not wish to paint, cover them in painter's tape.

, Take your spray paint bottle. Shake it up slightly, if directed to do so on the bottle, and apply a coat of paint about 12 to 18 inches away from the plastic. Spray slightly to the side of the surface you're painting. Then, move your spray paint across the plastic until you're a few inches past the edge on the other side.








Make slow, smooth motions to distribute the spray paint evenly.

, After you've painted your first line, repeat the pattern. Slowly and steadily move your spray paint across the surface, stopping when you're a few inches off the edge. Then, make another line below the first. Keep doing this until the full surface is coated.







, Usually, you need to apply a second coat. Before doing so, allow the plastic to dry. In general, it should take about 30 minutes for the plastic to completely dry., After the plastic has dried, apply another coat exactly as you applied the first one. Start applying the coat to the side of the surface, make a line running across the surface, and then stop a few inches off the side. Repeat this process until the full surface is coated in a second coat.







, After applying your second coat, inspect the plastic. If you notice any bare spots or light spots, add a splash of paint to cover them up., An acrylic sealer should be added about half an hour after you add your final touches of paint. This will protect the paint from damage. Apply it in the exact same fashion you applied the paint.An acrylic sealer is not always necessary. It's usually best used for plastic that will spend a lot of time outdoors.

, After all the coats are added, plastic should take a few days to completely dry. During this time, keep your plastic in a safe space where it will not be tampered with. Do not sit on plastic furniture for a few days after painting."

Chill!",How to Decorate Small Apartment Balconies2," If your balcony is very small, consider turning it into a flower and herb garden. Mix up colorful perennials, seasonal delights, hardy ivies and herbs that you can use in the kitchen. Get a sturdy stool and a soft cushion for the seat so that you’ll enjoy working your own private garden.

, Put plants that need sun up higher, and plants that like shade down lower. Fill in the corners with larger herbs such as rosemary or tomato plants.

, Make sure you water regularly, fertilize your plants, and keep them trimmed. This will keep it looking like paradise.

,, One of the easiest way to make your balcony more comfortable is to add a chair or two and a small table. You’ll be able to have a place to sit and admire the view, have a pleasant conversation, or simply enjoy an afternoon snack.

, If your balcony is long and skinny, consider a park bench, multi-purpose storage bench, or hanging porch swing, and add a side table for drinks, books, glasses, suntan lotion, and other friendly clutter.

, While this may not be the focus of your balcony, plants add a personal, colorful touch that will really make your little retreat a welcoming, homey place.

, There are several ways to approach this. If you have electrical outlets on your balcony, consider adding an inexpensive outdoor-rated lamp from the local hardware store, and use low-wattage bulbs for a warm and comfortable glow. You can also use a string of white outdoor Christmas tree mini lights strung up on the perimeter for an attractive effect. If you don’t have electricity available on your balcony, candles are a beautiful way to bring light to your retreat. Just make sure they are allowed by your covenant, and that you extinguish them whenever you leave the balcony.

, The last thing you want is a soggy seat.

, The flowers are pretty, and who doesn’t like a nice place to sit? But for you it's barbecue, friends, and libations all the way!

, Being mindful of apartment covenants, get the nicest barbecue that will fit your space. This will be the centerpiece of your balcony world, so do it right. Place it opposite the entry and exit doors if possible, so that you can make a quick dash from the barbecue to the kitchen in just a few steps.

, Barbecues sometimes last well into the evening, so you’ll want to be sure you can see what you’re cooking. Either use floor lamp (make sure it’s rated for outdoor use), or a battery-powered barbecue lamp.

, You’ll want a place to sit and talk about the game, the boss, and other deep topics.

, Refrigeration is something to consider as well, if your covenant permits. A small outdoor refrigerator is a great place to keep beer, condiments, and other barbecue essentials cold and fresh. It also works well as a little countertop, so consider adding a heavy-duty cutting board on top of it.


Should you be unable to add a fridge, a cooler is a good alternative, and can function as an impromptu seat as well.

Wash the chrome with soap and water until it is thoroughly cleaned.,
Hammer out any unwanted bends or dents using a body hammer.This must be done before any paint is applied, as hammering later on would damage the coat of paint.,
Sand the chrome exterior using sandpaper.,
Use a media blaster to clean your parts.,
Wipe down the chrome pieces to remove any dust and excess particles from the surface.",How to Paint Over a Chrome Surface2," Wipe the surface with a dry, bleached cloth and then wait until it is fully dry. This is done before sanding to eliminate the possibility of impressing any foreign particles into the metal and contaminating your work. Using a bleached cloth maintains as close to a sterile environment as possible, which will lead to a better-finished product.

, If you are working with any metal that has an exterior and interior side, you will always hammer the interior side. So remove any parts that may be blocking access to the interior side. Place a hard material against the exterior surface and hammer out the dent, pressing against the hard material. Move slowly and work around the dent's perimeter towards the center.Once the dent is hammered out, place your hard material on the interior side. Then lightly hammer the area surrounding your dent to remove any peaks in the metal.

, Sanding is the least complicated method of removing chrome and therefore a favorite. Although chrome can be difficult to remove it's best to start with a grit less than 160 to remove a majority of the particles.Afterwards you can use 320 grit sandpaper to remove any marks left by the first round, and give a smoother finish.


Note that with sanding it is important to be careful and use an equal amount of time and pressure over the entire surface to ensure an even result. This will create an ideal surface where the paint will stick more easily, and course texture won't show through the paint.

, If sandpaper is not cutting it, many professionals' next choice is a blasting gun. These tools use pressurized air to send tiny particles (usually plastic beads, ground-up walnut shells, glass beads, and aluminum oxide) to strip paint from base material, as well as smoothing out very durable metals.In order to contain the mess of media blasters, it is recommended to use a blasting cabinet. This will decrease the size of your work space, but also maintains cleanliness.
In addition to the PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) already in use, it is safest to use some form of ear protection with media blasters as they create a loud noise and could cause hearing damage/problems.

, Spray down the parts with wax and grease remover. It is easiest to use an atomizer bottle to coat all surfaces. Use clean, bleached rags to wipe everything off.

Guard your workspace from unintended painting.,
Mix your primer and strain it to prevent any clogs in the spray gun's tip and internal filters.,
Hang or position any pieces to be painted on a metal stand.,
Evenly coat the pieces with Two-Part Epoxy Primer using your spray gun.,
Properly store any left over primer by pouring it from the spray gun's paint cup into its original container.,
Clean the spray gun properly before adding your chosen paint.,
Mix and strain any paint to be used with the spray gun.,
Apply your chosen automotive paint.,
Give the chrome a polished appearance by applying 3 coats of automotive clear-coat paint.,
Wait for approximately 3 days until the automotive clear-coat paint has dried.",How to Paint Over a Chrome Surface3," Cover surfaces like trim, windows, and floors with drop cloth. The drop cloth is suitable for painting since it absorbs paint easily and allows for smooth painting.At this point it is safest to clear the floor of any potential tripping hazard that could catch on the sprayer hose.

, Wooden sticks are commonly provided with purchased paint and work well with mixing. To strain, a simple and effective method is using scrap window screen.This will remove any foreign particles or lumps and guarantee a smooth coat.


Use a Two-Part Epoxy Primer as they are waterproof, resist corrosion, and offer the best level of adhesion for metal and industrial painting., Hanging your pieces gives you closer to a 360º access while painting. This will also work well for bottled spray paint. If however you do not have access to a stand, simply spray the pieces over an ample piece of drop cloth.

, Allow them to dry, and add a second coat.If using bottled spray paint, apply the primer as evenly as possible all around the metal part.

, Store your primer in a cool, dry, and well-ventilated area. Also check to ensure the seal on your container is air-tight. Primer will not expire if properly stored, but it will evaporate if not securely sealed. Also keep in mind that primer is flammable and should be kept away from open flames, points of ignition, and temperatures over 100ºF.

, Make sure to remove your compressed air source and air regulator before you begin cleaning. It is important that a spray gun is thoroughly cleansed before you switch to a new substance, so follow the related wikiHow's instructions closely before moving on.

, More often than not, paint stores will be glad to provide a wooden paddle for stirring. Be sure to ask for one with your purchase. As with the primer, using scratch window screen is an effective and simple way to filter out any lumps or foreign particles from your paint., There are a few keys to keep in mind while painting. Maintain a distance of about 6 inches between the tip of the spray gun and the material surface. Using a sweeping motion that goes side to side while painting. If the spray gun is not in motion, then do not pull the trigger. This can lead to uneven, blotchy painting.Allow the paint to dry completely; this often takes 20 minutes to an hour for each coat.

, The clear-coat finish will also protect the chrome against rust and dust. Follow the same tips you did in the previous step.

, You can then buff the chrome exterior using a buffing cloth and buffing compound to give it a glossy shine.

Determine the type of paint previously used.,
If the existing paint is lead-based, the local building codes in your area may require you to remove all existing paint before repainting.,
If the existing paint is latex-based, you may simply paint right over it using latex paint.

,
If the existing paint is oil-based, you should first paint the room with one or two coats of a oil-based primer.

,
Allow the primer to dry for at least a day or two (see instructions on your particular paint), and then paint your top coat.",How to Paint over Existing Oil Paint in Your Home," Water/latex based paint will come off when rubbed with alcohol on a cotton ball, oil and lead will not. If it is oil or lead, the only way to tell the difference is to send a sample in to a lab to be tested. (It is not known if home test kits are actually reliable.) Look online for a reputable company, check with the Better Business Bureau.;
, Check local regulations before continuing.

,,, For best results, apply a second coat of paint after the first coat dries.

If desired, the paint store can tint your primer to within a few shades of the paint you will use as your top coat, which will help to hide the primer if you miss a spot, but this isn't generally necessary.

The best place to work is outdoors. Cover your work surface with newspapers or plastic cloth to protect it.


If you cannot work outside, then make sure to keep a window open and take breaks often. Consider turning on a fan, and keeping it turned away from you—it will help steer the fumes away.;
, Brand-new pots are often coated with a thin layer of dust. Some may even have price tags and stickers. All of these can prevent the paint from adhering properly. To fix this, start off by soaking the pot in a container of warm water. Use a stiff brush or coarse sponge to loosen any grit or dirt. If the pot has any stubborn price tags that won't come off, leave the pot sitting in the hot water for about an hour, then continue scrubbing it Once clean, set the pot in a sunny spot and let it dry., Once the pot is clean, use a fine, 220-grit sand paper to smooth the surface. Focus on any rough pots and sharp edges.Don't worry about polishing and getting the pot to be perfectly-smooth. Raw, unpainted terracotta will never be smooth as porcelain; it will always have some texture to it. The rough, jagged patches, however, are imperfections and will have to go.

, This will remove all traces of dust and grit. Let the pot dry completely before proceeding.

, Shake a can of clear, acrylic spray sealer until you can hear it rattle, then apply a light, even coat to the inside of the pot. Be sure to cover the bottom and the sides. Terracotta is porous, so it will likely soak up the first coat. This is normal.Simply wait for this coat to dry before applying another coat. You may need between two or three more coats. Make sure that you allow each coat to dry before applying another. The sealer is important, because it will prevent moisture from leaching through to the outside after the pot is planted.


You can use any finish for the acrylic sealer: matte, satin, or glossy. Be sure that the can states that the sealer is waterproof.
For a more sophisticated look, paint the inside of the flower pot black first, then seal it.

, If you are going to paint the entire pot one, solid color, then you will need to prime it. Hold the can 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the surface of the pot, and apply a light, even coat. You can apply a second coat, if necessary, once the first one dries. Applying some primer will not only help you achieve a smoother finish, but it will also prevent the pot from soaking up any paint.

, If you wish to paint some designs and have the raw terracotta still visible, then coat the pot with some matte, acrylic spray sealer instead. Hold the can 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the pot, and spray on a light, even coat. You may apply a second coat, if necessary, once the first one dries. This will seal the pot and prevent it from absorbing too much paint while giving the paint something to grip onto. The matte finish will blend in with the matte texture of the pot.


If you wish to create a weathered-looking pot, then use this technique.

, Most primers will dry within 15 minutes, but some may require as much as two to three hours. Refer to the manufacturer's directions on the can for more specific drying times.

, You can paint the entire pot a solid color, or you can leave parts of the pot unpainted. If you wish to leave some areas unpainted, then you will need to cover them with painter's tape. Here are some ideas:


Apply paint to just the brim of the pot for a splash of color. You can paint the drain dish a matching color.
Paint the body of the pot, but leave the brim unpainted.
Paint only half of the pot. You can choose which half: the top half or the bottom half.Create alternating stripes of painted and unpainted areas. You can also use a zigzag pattern.

, This will help you achieve a nice, crisp line between the painted areas and the unpainted areas. If you have a steady hand and are using a flat paintbrush or a foam brush, then you do not have to use the painter's tape. If you are using spray paint, then you will need to use painter's tape. Here are some ways you can use painter's tape:


If you want to paint just the brim of the pot, place a thick stripe of painter's tape just below the brim. If you are using spray paint, then cover the pot with a plastic bag and seal the edges of the bag to the pot using tape. The painter's tape will help you get a nice, straight line, and the bag will prevent any spray paint from accidentally getting on the pot.
If you want to paint the pot but leave the brim plain, then cover the brim with painter's tape.
If you are painting only half of the pot, then cover the part you don't want colored using painter's tape.
Place strips of painter's tape to create lines and zigzags. The areas with the tape will have the unfinished terracotta color when you are done painting.

, Paint comes in many different finishes, and the sort of paint you choose will determine what sort of sealer you will be using at the end, if at all. Here are some suggestions:


Metallic, pearlescent, and glittery paint will add some sparkle to your pot. These paints will need to be sealed with a glossy finish to preserve their shine and luster.
You can create a completely customizable pot with chalkboard paint. If you choose to use chalkboard paint, you won't need to seal it. Sealing a chalkboard finish will prevent it from working like a chalkboard.
Solid colored paints can be coated with matte, satin, or glossy sealants for different finishes.
Textured spray paint is also available. You can make your terracotta pot look rustic with a coarse, stone-like texture.

, If you are using acrylic paint, squirt some paint onto a dish. To reduce the possibility of brushstrokes, dilute the paint with a few drops of water, until it reaches the consistency of cream. If you are using spray paint, simply shake the can for few moments until you can hear the ball inside rattle.


You can use outdoor or craft-grade paint. The pot will be sealed once again when you are done painting.

, If you are using acrylic paint, you can use a flat paintbrush or a foam paintbrush. If you are using spray paint, hold the can 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the pot's surface and spray on a light, even coat. Let this coat dry before applying another. This can take anywhere from 15 minutes to a few hours, depending on the manufacturer's recommendations.

, Once the first coat has dried, you can apply a second or third coat. Make sure to let each coat to dry completely before adding another one.

, Apply some paint to the top inch (2.54 centimeters) of the inside of the pot. It isn't necessary to paint any more of the inside as the pot will be filled with soil., Painting your terracotta pot can give it some color, but adding designs can make it even more interesting. These section will give you some tips and ideas.

, If you want to create a pot with a striped or zigzag pattern, arrange some painter's tape on it in a pattern you like. Paint the pot again in a different color, then remove the tape. Let the pot dry. You can create more shapes and patterns by adding more painter's tape, painting, and removing the tape.You can also create a polka-dot pattern by sticking circle-shaped stickers or price tags onto the pot. Paint over the pot, and then remove the stickers.
If there are any chips in your paint from removing the tape, fill them in using paint and a thin paintbrush.

, Purchase some adhesive stencils and stick them onto your pot. If you cannot find any adhesive stencils, then you can simply tape them onto the pot using painter's tape. Paint over the stencil using acrylic paint or spray paint, then remove the stencil. You can use any color you want, but contrasting colors or metallic colors work best. Here are some ideas:


If you painted your pot black, consider using white or gold paint for the designs.
If your pot is white, then make some designs using black or gold paint.
If your pot is neon green, create some bold designs using pink or orange.
You can also use ordinary objects as stencils, such as doilies. Lay the pot on its side, and drape a doily over it. Apply the paint and lift the doily off. Do not drag the doily, or it will smear the paint.

, If you don't like using stencils, you can paint the designs on using oil-based paint pens or a thin paintbrush.

, Take a piece of fine, 220-grit sandpaper and lightly buff the surface of your pot. You can sand in the same direction, or achieve different effects by sanding left-to-right first, then top-to-bottom. You can even try buffing in circular motions. Keep sanding until the original texture of the terracotta pot starts to show through., This will allow you to change the names on the pots when the plant inside of them changes. If you make a large label, then you can even write down specific care and watering instructions.You can add a chalkboard label to a solid-colored pot, or to a raw, terracotta pot, sealed with matte acrylic sealer. Here is how you can add a label to your pot:


Seal your pot first. To learn how to seal your pot, refer to the section in this article on finishing and sealing the pot.
Block off any areas that you do not want painted with painter's tape. You can also use an adhesive stencil, shaped like a square, rectangle, circle, or oval.
Apply a thin layer of chalkboard paint using a flat paintbrush or a foam brush. You can also use chalkboard spray paint.
Allow the coat to dry 8 hours before applying a second coat.
Allow the paint to cure for two to three days.
Season the surface by rubbing white chalk over it, then wiping it off with a piece of damp cloth. Your chalkboard label is now ready to use.

, Because you will be working with spray-on sealers, you will need to move to a well-ventilated area. Outdoors is the best. If you cannot work in a well-ventilated area, then make sure to have a window open and take breaks often so that you don't feel lightheaded. Consider switching a fan on and turning it away from you. It will steer the paint fumes away from you. Make sure that your work area is free of any dust or debris, especially if you are planning on working with a glossy sealer.

, Make sure that the cup or can you are using is thin enough to fit inside the pot, but tall enough so that the pot can rest on top of it without touching your table. You are creating something that looks like a lamp or a giant mushroom. This will allow you to coat the entire surface of the pot, including the bottom., Several coats of a glossy sealer will give you a glazed-finish. If you painted your pot using metallic, glittery, or pearlescent paint, then you will need a glossy sealer as well.


If you blocked off the designs using painter's tape, then leave the tape on until the sealer dries. Once it dries, remove the tape.

, A matte sealer will give you a dull finish, similar to the original texture of the pot. This will work well for designs that you hand-painted onto a bare pot.

, A satin finish will have some gloss to it, but it will not be as reflective or shiny as a typical gloss finish.

, Instead, let the paint dry for 3 days, then prime it by covering the entire surface with a piece of chalk. Wipe the chalk off with a damp cloth. You can draw designs on the pot, or you can write the name of the herb or plant you are putting inside the pot.

, Hold the can 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the surface and apply a light, even coat. The sealer protects the paint from scratches, adds durability and makes the pot easier to keep clean. If necessary, apply a second coat once the first one dries. Be sure to get the bottom of the pot as well. Let the sealer dry completely before proceeding.

, If you see any drips along the rim, take a fine, 220-grit sand paper and lightly buff the surface until the drips are gone. Be careful not to scratch the paint off.

, Once you are done sanding, wipe the dust off with a damp cloth, and apply a light coat of sealer. Be sure to get the top of the rim, and the inside of the rim. Wait until the sealer has dried before applying a second coat.

, If you plant too soon, the paint may not be fully-dried yet. The moisture form the soil may cause the paint to bubble, crack, and peel away.

Add a single color scheme with paint.,
Use stencils.,
Try wallpaper.,
Add patterns with fabric.,
Number your stairs.,
Add words.",How to Decorate a Staircase1," You may want your staircase in a single color to match the color scheme of your home. If you have a wooden staircase, you can paint it in a shade that matches your wallpaper, carpeting, or other aspects of your house.You should use a paint primer on your staircase first, especially if it was previously painted a different color. This can help your chosen color show through.
You should usually place some painter's tape between the staircase and wall, creating a barrier between the paint and primer and your wall. When you're painting or a applying primer, you can use a roller or a paintbrush depending on the size of your stairs. It's a good idea to have a paintbrush handy to paint any hard-to-reach areas.
You can paint the stairs completely. However, you can also paint only a certain portion of the stairs if you do not want the color to overwhelm. For example, you can paint a line running down the center of the stairs, using a ruler and measuring tape to trace the line beforehand. You also may want to just paint the stair risers or just paint the top of the stairs.;
, If you want to add a design your staircase, you can use stencils. You can find stencils in a wide variety of shapes at a local craft store. You can also make your own stencils by drawing shapes on cardboard and then cutting out these shapes with an x-acto knife. Consider choosing stencils that match with other decorative elements of the room. If you have floral patterned wallpaper, for example, use flower stencils.


Many people enjoy creating a fun design by stenciling on the stair risers, which are the parts of stairs that are vertical. You will usually have to paint the risers a shade of cream or white first, if they are not already painted in this color, to help your designs stand out. You can also consider stenciling the wall around the stairs.You should dust and clean the staircase before stenciling or painting, to make sure no debris or dirt get trapped in the paint.
Place your stencil against the staircase. You can use spray mount, an adhesive spray you can purchase at a craft store, on the back of the stencil so it stays in place while you paint.
Take a small paintbrush and dab on a very light amount of the color you're using to stencil. Use tapping motions to apply paint. Go slowly, adding several layers of paint until your stencil shows up as bright as you want.

, If there's a specific design you want, like stripes or shapes, a simple way to get that design is via wallpaper. Peel and stick wallpaper, which has built-in adhesive on the back, is very easy to apply to stair risers. You can measure the dimensions of your risers, cut out wallpaper in these dimensions, and apply them to the risers. Wallpaper's main benefit is that you can chose a wide variety of shapes and decorations for your wall without having to paint or stencil them on.It's a good idea to dust and clean your staircase before applying wallpaper. Any dirt and debris trapped underneath the paper can cause bumps or ripples in the wallpaper.

, Another way to add patterns without stenciling or painting is using fabric. Fabric is cheaper than wallpaper, and provides as many design options. You can use modge podge, which you can purchase at a craft store, to apply fabric to stair risers, creating a striking design for your staircase.Measure out the dimensions of your stair risers. This should give you a rough idea of how many yards of fabric to purchase. Before you begin cutting the fabric, however, apply a layer of modge podge to the back of the fabric and allow it to dry. This will make the fabric easier to cut and also stiffer. It should take around 45 minutes for the modge podge to dry.
Once the fabric is dry, cut it into the dimensions you need. Apply a coating of modge podge to the stair risers. Then, press your fabric strips onto each riser. There may be some excess fabric along the edges of the staircase. This can be removed with an x-acto knife.

, Another fun staircase design is numbering your stairs. You can use a stencil to add a number to each stair riser. Choose a font you like for the numbers, and one that matches the aesthetic of your home., Many people enjoy adding words to your staircase. You may want to spell out a sentence running from the top of your stairs to the bottom. You can also try adding inspiring words, like hope and love, to each stair riser.


You can add words using stencils, which may be timely. You may be able to find wallpaper or fabric that has words on it, which you can apply to your staircase.
A fun way to add words is painting your staircase in chalkboard paint. Chalkboard paint can be written on in chalk, giving you the freedom to write whatever you choose on your staircase. You'll also have the liberty of changing the words for a specific season or event. If you have young children, they may have a lot of fun with chalkboard paint on the staircase."

Consult your hardware store about the condition of your redwood siding.,
Wash the wood with a weak solution of tri-sodium phosphate (TSP), if it is allowed in your state.,
Make sure your redwood is dry enough to absorb a little water.,
Use a roller and brush to apply 1 coat of oil or alkyd-based primer.,
Allow the primer to dry completely before beginning your redwood paint job.,
Paint the surface of the primed wood with 2 coats of latex paint in the color of your choice.,
Allow the paint to dry.",How to Paint Old Redwood Siding," If it is already painted, you will want to carefully strip the paint away with scrapers and sandpaper. Make sure to take the time to invest time in this process, since the preparation exposes the initial layer of redwood, allowing it to breathe and absorb the primer and paint.;
, Check into the health regulations regarding this toxic material. Rinse well with water and allow the redwood to dry.


Use eye-protection, gloves, long-sleeved shirts and pants when working with TSP. Make sure no animals or children get near it. Dispose of excess TSP at a toxic waste disposal site.
Do not allow your newly stripped redwood sit long without staining. Because it is soft, it can easily absorb moisture and dirt.

, Test it on a small area. You want to make sure it is ready to absorb the primer.

, Ask your hardware store if they have any specially formulated redwood primers. Use the roller on the straight parts of the sidings and use the brush to apply the primer in all cracks and sides of the siding.

, An optional step is to coat the primer with 1 coat of ""Duration"" or a similar product that will help your paint job to last longer.

, This acrylic paint will stretch and shrink with the wood as it ages. Buy a top-quality paint, if it is in your budget, and the paint job is more likely to last longer.


Use a clean roller and brush to apply the coats of paint. You may want to begin by brushing the edges and then rolling the straight parts to get a uniform coat. Make sure to follow the paint's directions of drying times between coats. This can be between a couple of days and a week.
Try to apply your paint in dry temperatures over 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius). This will help to avoid bubbling or peeling due to humidity.
For redwood that has maintained its looks, you may be able to use a paint sprayer. This is how paint is applied on most new redwood siding.

, Wash your siding with a water sprayer and some soap periodically to maintain the paint job. Rinse well and allow it to dry.

Plan ahead for space.,
Decide what room needs to go where.,
Think about natural light.,
Add walking spaces.,
Use rugs to define rooms.,
Define rooms with furniture.,
Create taller dividers.,
Add different lighting to each area.,
Make a focal point in each area.,
Continue colors in the whole space.,
Add similar textures and fabrics.,
Continue storage along the same wall.,
Use a single flooring type.",How to Decorate an Open Plan Home," Before you ever move your furniture in, decide what areas are most important to you. For instance, if you entertain often, you may decide a large dining area is important to you. On the other hand, if your family loves to have movie nights, you might want to spend more space on the living room.Think about the size of your furniture and how it will work in the space. It can help to make a blueprint by measuring the space and creating a drawing of it. Then you can make your furniture by creating small cards that are cut to scale. Move the furniture cards around in the blueprint of the room to see what works.;
, ""Rooms"" next to each other are called adjacencies. When planning out your spaces, you need to think logically about what belongs next to each other, such as the dining room next to the kitchen. After that, it's up to you what you put next, but it should make sense for how you live.For instance, if you work from home, it might make sense to add a little office space off the dining room, so you have a place to work. On the other hand, if that area will have too much traffic, consider having a little sitting area so people can gather and talk while dinner is being cooked.
If you have young kids, a play area near the kitchen might make sense, so that you can see them while you're preparing food.

, Placing your dining table where there's natural light creates a happier, brighter space. However, you may want to keep your television in an area that doesn't get as much natural light, as it can create glare on the screen.Observe the room to see where light slants in the morning and evening. That way, you'll know how to plan the area better.
Also, consider where you'll be at different times of day. For instance, you might not like glaring afternoon sun across an office space because it will heat up the room.

, In an open floor plan, it can be easy to forget to add in ""hallways."" However, people still need space to walk, even if it's not defined by walls. Add walking spaces that are at least 3 feet wide that will allow someone to walk through the whole room., One way to define each room is to lay out area rugs. For instance, have a rug for the living room, a long rug for the entryway, and a different rug for the living room. Rugs will visually break up the space while keeping the openness of the floor plan.The rug should be big enough so that the furniture can partially sit on it. A couch should sit about half a foot into the rug., Another way to define each room is to arrange the furniture so it breaks up the space. For instance, having a couch in the middle of the room can help separate the space into the living and dining room. In addition, adding an entryway table or sideboard directly behind the sofa can help give a sense of division., Most furniture is fairly short, so it doesn't divide the space visually as well as it could. To help, add in taller pieces, such as placing a lamp or another decorative piece on the tables that divide up the space. Plants can work well for this purpose., You want your lighting to be cohesive, so choose fixtures that are similar to each other in material and color and that go with the rest of the room. However, to help define the space, try picking fixtures in different shapes to help delineate each space., Every room should have a focal point, and that rule still applies when creating smaller spaces within an open floor plan. You can use focal points such as a television, a large window, a painting, or really anything you want to create an area around., When a kitchen flows into a dining room and then into a living room, you need to keep the colors going. If you use drastically different colors, it can be jarring instead of creating the flow you want.For instance, if your kitchen cabinets are a light green, pick up the same color in your sofa fabric or throw pillows.

, Another way to continue a certain look is to repeat fabrics and textures across the whole space. You don't have to use the exact pattern, but they should be similar enough to bring it together. For instance, you could use one fabric on your dining room chairs, and then use a complementary fabric as curtains in your living room., If a kitchen wall flows into the living room area, consider keeping the storage going, morphing it into bookcases and built-in cupboards. It will create cohesion and give you more storage space., One way to make the area look cohesive is to use the same flooring throughout the space. For instance, continue the same hardwood floors throughout the area, bringing the whole space together."

Remove a cabinet door and take it to a hardware store with a paint counter.,
Collect latex paint swatches at the hardware store to help you choose your color.,
Scrub the surface of the cabinets with a strong detergent mixed with water and a sponge.,
Set up a well-ventilated workshop where you can store your cabinet doors and drawers as you prep and paint them and wait for them to cure.,
Remove all doors and drawers from your cabinets with a screwdriver.,
Apply wood filler to holes with a putty knife, if you are planning on changing the configuration of your cabinet hardware from door pulls to knobs.,
Tape the inside edges of the cabinets and the outside edges of the counters.,
Sand the surface of all the surfaces you plan to paint with 220-grit sandpaper.,
Prime the surface of the cabinets with an oil-based primer.,
Sand the surface of the primed oak lightly with 220-grit sandpaper.,
Apply a coat of latex paint with a paint sprayer to doors and drawers.,
Apply 1 to 3 more coats of latex paint.,
Allow the last coat to dry and cure for at least 5 days.,
Reinstall your drawers and doors with the original or new hardware.

,
Remove painter's tape carefully along the edges of the cabinets and other surfaces.",How to Paint Oak Cabinets," Oak is porous, and if the pores were not filled during construction, your paint job may look pock marked. It is a good idea to check with a professional to see what paint, primer or sandpaper is specifically necessary for your oak cabinets.;
, Ask the hardware clerk for a high-quality paint that is formulated for kitchen cabinets. Low quality paints can result in drawers and doors that get stuck after reinstallation.


If you want to replace the hardware in your doors, take the old pulls and hinges to the hardware store, so you can be sure you are buying the right measurements. New cabinet hardware is often made in different sizes than older hardware.

, Rinse thoroughly and dry with clean towels. The detergent you use should be identified as a grease-cutting detergent.


If the cabinets are extremely old or dirty, you should use trisodium phosphate (TSP) to cut the grease on your cabinets. This is an industrial strength cleaner that should be used with extreme caution. You can use 1/2 cup of TSP mixed with 2 gallons (7.5 l) of water. Make sure to ventilate the area well and rinse thoroughly before drying.







, A garage works well for this purpose. Cover the garage floor with drop cloths and bring in sawhorses.

, Write the location of the cabinet on a piece of blue tape and stick it in the inside of the door or drawer to help you reinstall correctly. Place the drawers and door fronts in your workshop.


Store the hardware in small plastic bags to ensure you don't lose anything during the removal process.







, Place a piece of painter's tape behind the hole, to keep the putty from spilling out of the other end. Allow it to dry and then lightly sand the surface with 220-grit sandpaper.

, Cover the floor and appliance surfaces with drop cloths or newspaper. Tape them down at the edges.

, Spend extra time making sure it is sanded, if the oak has a thick polyurethane coating. Sweep off the dust and wipe the surfaces with tack cloth.

, Apply 1 coat and allow it to dry for 24 hours. If the hardware store professional told you that your oak surface has not been filled, you will need to use an extra thick primer.


For best results, rent a paint sprayer from a hardware store to apply primer and paint to the doors and drawers. Otherwise, use small foam rollers for the cabinet surfaces that remain in the house. If you don't have a paint sprayer, use a foam roller on the doors and an angled brush to get into the smaller spaces. It is not recommended that you use a brush to do all the surfaces.







, Wipe it with a tack cloth. Apply a second coat of primer, and wait 24 hours before painting again.

, Apply the paint with a small foam roller to cabinet ends inside the house. Allow the coat to dry for 24 hours, unless otherwise directed by the paint's label.

, This amount will depend upon how well the paint covers your current finish.

, Some people wait up to 2 weeks to ensure the paint is well-cured and will not stick.


If you plan to paint the inside of your doors, wait 5 days before turning them and repeating the primer and paint procedure.







,, Dispose of drop cloths. Clean your paint rollers and brushes thoroughly.

Decide on a theme.,
Add family photos to the wall along the staircase.,
Choose paintings and other artwork.,
Find a fun way to decorate the railing.,
Try decorative items.,
Use shadow boxes.",How to Decorate a Staircase2," When choosing decorations for your staircase, you can bring everything together by choosing a specific theme. This can help give you an idea for what kind of art, photos, and other decorations to add to the wall around your staircase.


For example, maybe you used chalkboard paint on your staircase. This gives you staircase an eccentric, kid-friendly feel. You could put up your children's art work on the wall around the staircase. You could also add bright and colorful paintings to the wall, giving it a fun and zany feel.
Deciding on how to decorate can be overwhelming. Choosing a theme based off other aspects of your home can help. If your staircase is just before your living room, which has a blue color scheme, you could continue the blue color scheme with your staircase. Choose paintings, photo frames, and other decorations that are in the right shade of blue.

, Many people line the wall along their staircase with family photos. This can give visitors something to look at as they walk up your staircase, and provide a warm and homey feel to your house. Consider printing and framing some family photos for your staircase.


You can print out photos from a phone, digital camera, or flash disk at stores like FedEx and Walgreens. You can choose the size you want.
When purchasing frames, consider a color scheme. If your staircase is decorated with blue fabric, for example, try adding blue frames to your chosen photos. Color coordinating your staircase design can really help tie things together.If you want something a little more lighthearted, consider making a collage without frames. Simply asymmetrically tape up a hodgepodge of family photos running up your wall., If you're not big into family photos, consider lining the wall leading up to your staircase with paintings and artwork. Visit a local art center or art museum, where you can pick up paintings, prints, and other bits of art for your staircase. If you're into crafts yourself, consider making something like a shadow box or a painting of your own to add to the wall along your staircase.

, If your staircase has a railing, do not neglect this in the decorating process. Look at fun ways to incorporate the staircase railing.


Consider painting the railing. This can be particularly striking if you have banisters running along the railing. You can paint each banister a specific shade, or create a gradient of one shade running up the stairs.You can also add stencils to a wooden rail. If you've stenciled your stair risers, it can be fun to add similar stencils to the railing.

, If you stop by a craft store, you can look for decorative items. Paper flowers, plastic fruit, or plastic twigs can be placed on shelves on top of the staircase or in a stair landing. These can be particularly helpful if you're going for a certain them. If you're trying to match floral wallpaper, for example, having paper flowers tied around the bannisters of your railing could be a nice touch.

, Shadowboxes are enclosed glass cases that can store items like decorative plates, old books, figurines, and other knick-knacks. You can try stopping by your craft store, picking up a few shadowboxes, and filling them with items that match your decorating scheme.


You can make your own shadow box by purchasing a box frame and gluing a collage of items in the back. Keepsakes can be placed in a shadowbox to fit with a family staircase theme. For example, you could layer family photos, tickets from events, and brochures from family vacations in a shadow box."

Add season specific decorations.,
Use balloons for temporary party decorations.,
Change up photos and paintings by season.",How to Decorate a Staircase3," It can be fun to add season specific decorations to your staircase. You can add decorations for seasons like Christmas, Easter, Halloween, and so on. You can also change up the staircase based on seasons like autumn and spring.If you have a chalkboard staircase, you can change the design by season. Draw pictures of rabbits for easter. Write Christmas phrases in red and green chalk for Christmas.
You can make use of the railing for holidays. Loop a garland down the railing or twist Christmas lights around the banister. Try add orange and black crepe paper to the railing for Halloween, or pastel crepe paper in early spring.

, If you're throwing a birthday party, consider adding a variety of colorful balloons to your staircase. You can blow up balloons with air, or rent a helium tank, and use scotch tape to tape them on your staircase railing or the wall near your staircase. This can makes for a fun, festive design that is easy to clean up after a party., If you have photos, paintings, or other artwork near your staircase, consider switching it up by season. You can add spooky paintings for Halloween. Consider adding landscapes of autumn scenes during the fall months. For Christmas, pull out specific wall hangings and family photos that come with a Christmas theme.

Examine your floor to make sure it is good enough condition to paint.,
Clean the floors.,
Sand the floors.,
Apply a primer.,
Paint the floors.",How to Paint Linoleum Kitchen Floors," If you find surface cracks, make sure they aren't the type that chip off the surface; otherwise, this problem may continue after painting linoleum, ruining your paint job. Also, if your linoleum is extremely wavy, it is likely breaking down from the underside, in which case you may want to consider replacing the flooring.;
,


Scrub the floors thoroughly with a scrub brush and a heavy-duty tri-phosphate (TSP) cleaner (found in your local home improvement or hardware store) in order to remove every last trace of grease and grime. This is especially important for ensuring paint adheres to linoleum kitchen floors.
If you find that the surface of the linoleum is still glossy, use a degreaser or a wax stripper to remove the final layer of protective wax.
Rinse the floor until it is cleared of any cleaner residue and allow it to dry completely.

, Use a light to medium grit sandpaper to scour the surface of the floors before painting linoleum, being sure to cover every part of the floor, even in edges and corners. This removes any remaining traces of wax that you may not be able to see and roughs up the surface enough to grip the paint.

,


Choose a primer that is formulated especially for floors, and use a roller and brushes as necessary to complete the application.
Apply as many coats as it takes to produce a smooth surface for painting linoleum.
Allow the primer to dry according to the manufacturer's instructions, which may be a period of several days.

, Use a roller for the broad surfaces and brushes for cutting in at the edges and corners. For linoleum kitchen floors, you should use either an acrylic floor paint or an epoxy coating.

Remove all visible hardware from the cabinets, including knobs and pulls.,Cover any un-removable hardware with painter's tape

,
Clean all laminate surfaces thoroughly with a de-greaser, such as tri-sodium phosphate.,
Sand all laminate surfaces with 120-grit sandpaper.,
Apply a specifically formulated laminate primer per the manufacturer's instructions.,
Apply a latex or oil-based paint of your choosing over the cured primer.,
Replace all hardware and rehang the cabinet doors once the paint has fully dried.

",How to Paint Laminate Cabinets," You may remove the cabinet doors entirely if the hinges are visible or if they are easily removable. This will allow you to paint the cabinet face and shelving thoroughly and separately with little mess.;
,, Apply the chemical carefully per the manufacturer's instructions. Once clean, rinse all surfaces thoroughly with fresh water and allow the laminate to dry completely before proceeding.

, You will want to create a rough enough surface for the paint to stick to, so ensure that all surface areas are well scuffed. Once you are finished sanding, clean all of the dust away by first vacuuming the surfaces and then wiping them with a clean, damp cloth. Again, allow the laminate to dry completely before proceeding.

, You can purchase an appropriate primer at most hardware stores. Allow the primer to dry completely per the label instructions.

, Oil-based paints provide a smoother finish and are easier to clean, so they are the better choice for kitchens and bathrooms. Apply paint with a roller to avoid leaving brush strokes on the laminate surface.

Be aware of the problems that can be caused by water intrusion that occurs in poured concrete foundations.,
Foundation wall cracks.,
Repair wall cracks.,
Repair cold joints.,
Repair snap ties and tie rods.,
Repair pipe penetrations.,
Repair honeycomb areas.",How to Repair a Poured Concrete Wall," The causes include:


Improperly sealed snap ties.
Cold joints (where new concrete meets existing concrete i.e. in an addition of a home).
Water, well, sewer, and electrical conduit pipe penetrations.;
,


On rare occasions, water can come through a concrete wall that hasn't been properly vibrated thus creating a honeycomb area in the concrete.

, The only way to repair foundation wall cracks successfully is by the injection process. Injecting a typical wall crack with an epoxy or urethane resin is done under pressure pushing the material from the inside all the way to the outside.


The injection process fills the crack from top to bottom, from inside to outside. This repairs and stops the water intrusion.
The old process of v-ing out a crack from the inside or outside and patching it with hydraulic cement or water plug will not work.
Foundations are prone to movement and because the hydraulic cement or water plug doesn’t have the strength to withstand future movement it will crack and cause the foundation wall crack to fail.
Epoxy injections are considered structural repairs and will weld the foundation back together when done properly. Urethane injections will stop water but are not considered structural fixes. It is however flexible and can withstand movement in the foundation. Newer cracks on homes that have been allowed to settle for at least 1-2 yrs are good candidates for epoxy injection. Because epoxy is like superglue gluing or welding the foundation together it needs a fairly clean crack in order to be successful.
For older homes that have had cracks previously repaired and have dirt and silt built up inside them, a urethane injection will be more successful in stopping water.

, Because no chemical bond is created when new concrete is poured against old concrete, cold joints, such as when you put an addition on your home, will often leak water. After the addition has been able to settle for a period of 1-2 yrs, the proper repair to stop water coming through a cold joint would be a urethane injection.

, Metal snap ties and tie rods are used to hold the forms of a foundation in place while it is being poured. After the forms are removed, the snap ties on the outside are typically coated with a flexible polymer or hydraulic cement before a damp proof or water proofing membrane is applied to the foundation. These snap ties can leak over time if the prep work is not done properly.


Inject a snap tie under pressure from the inside with a urethane resin will stop them from leaking.

, During the construction of a home, holes in the foundations are cored to allow for water, well, sewer and electrical conduits to penetrate through the foundation. For example, a typical sewer line is 4 inches (10.2 cm) around. The hole cord maybe up to 5 inches (12.7 cm) or more thus leaving a void between the outside of the sewer pipe and the concrete. Prior to backfilling the foundation on the outside, these voids are typically filled with hydraulic cement. Improper preparation around pipe penetration can cause water intrusion.


To stop a pipe penetration from leaking, an injection of a urethane resin that expands up to 20x its volume thus filling the void from inside to outside should be used. Injecting around a pipe penetration from the inside will stop water seepage.

, A honeycomb area in a foundation is the result of improper vibration or settling of the concrete thus leaving voids and pockets in the wall. Injecting a urethane resin under pressure will seal and fill these voids and pockets thus stopping the leak.

Prepare the concrete surface.,
Apply a chemical paint stripper to the concrete surface.,
Allow the stripper to work.,
Scrub the concrete.,
Repeat the steps if necessary.,
Clean the concrete surface.",How to Remove Paint from Concrete1," Use a broom or shop vacuum to remove all dirt or debris. If possible, remove any loose paint from concrete with a scraper or brush.






;
, The type of stripper you should use depends on the type of paint you are trying to remove, such as water-based or oil-based paint. If in doubt, use a stripper designed for removing oil-based paints.








, Check the directions printed on the can by the manufacturer. This could be anywhere from 1 to 8 hours. In some cases, only minutes may be required.








, Use a wire scrub brush or a scraper to remove the loosened paint. You could also use a pressure washer for outdoor concrete surfaces such as driveways or patios.








, In some cases, a second or third application of paint stripper is needed to thoroughly remove paint from concrete.








, Use a power or pressure washer to remove all traces of the paint stripper. If you have removed paint drops or drips, cleaning the concrete can avoid leaving clean spots on the surface.

Clean the concrete to be surfaced.,
Place wooden planks around the area to be resurfaced.,
Mix concrete in your wheelbarrow.

,
Take a small amount of the concrete mix and add water until it attains the texture of paint (the concrete mix itself should be substantially thicker).

,
Apply this thinner mixture to the surface of the concrete in a thin layer.,
Begin pouring the main concrete mix from the wheelbarrow onto the concrete surface.,
Pour concrete right up to the frame and stop when you get to the desired height.

,
Go over the new surface with a brush to add texture.

,
Let the new concrete surface sit for at least half a day.

,
Remove the frame.

",How to Resurface Concrete," Remove all debris, break off any loose pieces of concrete and fill any cracks with caulk.;
, These will act as a frame to keep in the new concrete. Ideally, the frame should be as high as the new level of concrete.


Add rocks or other large weights against the outside of the planks so that the frame doesn't move under pressure from the concrete.
Choose an appropriate concrete mix for your project. If you only want to add a thin layer of concrete, be sure to choose a mix that doesn't have large rocks. If you want to add a significant amount of concrete, a coarser mix might be the best choice.

,,,


This thinner concrete mix serves as a paste to make the adhesion of the new concrete mix to the old concrete easier and to avoid cracking. Only a very thin layer is necessary and can be applied with a brush.

, Even with a trowel as you go along. Pour concrete slowly and evenly using less concrete than you think you might need.

Work in a steady manner, pressure washing one section at a time before proceeding.",How to Pressure Wash Concrete," A gas or electric washer with a pressure rating of at least 3,000 PSI, and a flow rate of at least 4 gallons (15.1 L) per minute, will effectively clean exterior concrete. Set the spray nozzle to high pressure and use a 40-inch spray tip. Add an appropriate cleaning solution to the reservoir.;
, You must know if the concrete is badly stained, a blast of water won’t be able to get rid of problem areas. Apply a de-greasing agent, bleach or detergent first (depending on the type of stain) and scrub the stain. Allow the applied cleaner to sit for sometime even after scrubbing and then you may pressure wash it., Proper preparation is the key to a successful concrete cleaning experience. It will make the job quicker and easier for the do-it-yourselfer.


Remove any obstacles or large debris from the cleaning area. You will need to temporarily relocate any patio furniture, planters, etc.
Dampen and cover nearby plants or gardens to protect them from the high pressure spray and cleaning chemicals. You can use any non-porous cover such as a tarp or plastic tablecloth.
Cover all exposed outlets or electrical wires. If outlet covers do not exist, seal them with plastic and water-proof tape.
Remove dense areas of oil or grease with tri-sodium phosphate (TSP). Apply the product per the manufacturer's instructions and be careful to follow all safety precautions.

, You may increase or decrease the power of the spray by adjusting either the nozzle setting or the distance at which you are holding the wand from the concrete.

, This will ensure that there are no uneven streaks in the concrete once it dries. Follow the slope of the concrete to optimize proper draining and run-off.

Observe the entire wall from a distance of five feet (0.13 meters) away after the location of the first tie rod hole leak.,
Use a standard hammer by rapping on the area until the 5⁄8 inch (1.6 cm) (15.88 millimeters) hole is fully exposed and the edges of the hole are hammered away to a beveled edge.,
Properly expose the existing 5/8 inch (15.88 millimeters) diameter tie rod hole to a depth of three inches (76.20 millimeters).,
After properly exposing the tie rod hole, remove any debris in the tie rod hole by flushing out with clean water or vacuuming.

",How to Repair Leaking Tie Rod Holes in a Poured Concrete Basement Wall1," Viewing the wall in this method will help see the others as they may appear as a small extrusion or irregularity in the surface of the concrete.


Most homes will have tie rod reinforcement holes every eighteen inches (0.46 meters) across the wall. 
Eight-foot high walls (2.44 meters) have two rows approximately one foot (0.30 meters) from the floor and the upper row is approximately five feet (1.52 meters) from the floor.
Ten-foot (3.05 meters) high walls will have three rows with the first row approximately three feet (0.91 meters) high from the floor and three feet (0.91 meters) higher for each of the remaining two rows.
Normally the upper and lower rows align vertically with each other. ;
,  In most cases the front of the tie rod hole will have a ¼ inch  (6.35 millimeters) to 1/2” inch (12.70 millimeters) cosmetic covering of concrete.  

, Take a standard screwdriver, dowel rod, or a tie rod bar to finish exposing the hole to a 3 inch (76.20 millimeters) depth. 


If necessary, the area may need to be drilled out using a 5/8 inch (15.88 millimeters) masonry bit.

Cover the whole surface with nylon plastic.,
Let it harden.,
Remove the plastic and hose off the top.,
Remove the forms.,
Saw cut the pad.,
Seal the surface.",How to Pour Exposed Aggregate Concrete," This box will hold the concrete in place until it is fully cured. It is important it is symmetrical and nailed together properly because your concrete pad will resemble this box.


Use 2x4s in order to obtain 4 inch thick concrete.
Use 2x6s in order to obtain 6 inch thick concrete.
To make a curved shape pad, you must use a more flexible kind of wood.;
, This area must be relatively flat.

, The stakes will hold the box in place.


It is best to put a stake at each end of the board, then fill in the middle with stakes at roughly 4 feet apart.
To make sure your board is strait, run a string from one end of the board to the other end.

, The box must be level, but if it is a large surface it is best to lower one side of the box slightly so rain will run off the edge once it is finished.


To make the surface of the concrete even with the ground, you must dig down 4 inches.
To make the concrete pad above ground, just nail it into the stakes.

, Now since the forms are set, make sure all of the ground within the box is at least 4 inches deep, and compact it by using a compactor or stamper.


To check depth, run a string across from the top of each form and measure down making sure it is 4 inches. This is also referred to as ""Grade"".
Now would also be the time to add steel mesh or re-steel, if you have it (for strengthening purposes).

, Call and ask for exposed aggregate concrete. They will inform you on what it is and different options they offer. As for amount, concrete is purchased by the yard. If you have trouble figuring out how much is needed, tell the concrete company your square footage and thickness.


One yard of concrete is the equivalent to 81 square feet per 4 inch thick concrete.
The equivalent for 6 inch thick concrete is 54 square feet.
To figure out the square footage of a rectangle or square the equation is length times width.

, This step can be tricky depending on where your pad is. It is easy if a concrete truck can reach the pad with its' chute, but if not you will have to use a wheel barrow or power buggy to move the concrete from the truck to the forms.


The concrete must be poured quickly so you have time to move it into place while it is still wet.

, Essentially, screeding is leveling out the top of the concrete. Run a strait board on the top of your forms across the concrete, if there is a large pile-up, have someone rake back the pile so you can proceed with the screed process.


It is best to have one person on each side of the screed board and pull back the concrete simultaneously.
If your pad is too large or not in a position to be screeded from the outside, one person or both people must stand inside the pad and do your best to run the board along the 2x4s.
If you cannot perform these two methods for screeding, it is suggested you seek help from a more advanced concrete finisher.

, Bull floating is the first step of smoothing out the concrete. It will knock down all of the rocks and bring the ""creamy"" concrete mix to the surface. Doing this correctly should leave your pad flat and smooth with no holes. The ""wetter"" the concrete is, the easier it will seal all the holes up; if you wait to long to bull float, it will be hard to seal the surface.


If some holes will not close up, you can sprinkle some water to aid in the process.

, Hand edging the concrete will create a nice rounded edge as opposed to a sharp rigid one. It will also seal the edge. If an error is created in the edging process, use the hand float to clean up along the edge. The hand float should be used to seal up any holes that are reachable.

, After the first round of sealing the surface by bull floating and edging, it is generally time to do the process over again. The objective is to get the bull float lines and edger lines to go away, while the top remains smooth.


This may take some time depending on weather, if the sun is out it it will dry up quicker.
There is a video tagged in these instructions that will help you learn how to properly finish concrete.

, Once you have finished the top and it is smooth with no lines or air holes, it is time to spray it with a chemical retarder. The retarder chemical will keep the top layer of concrete wet while it lets the core harden.


Try to disperse it evenly amongst the surface. Making one spot wetter than another will cause that spot to give away faster and potentially cause holes in the washing away process.

, The surface must be covered after the retarder is sprayed in order to lock in moisture, prevent wind from drying out the top, and to keep it out of direct sunlight.


Make sure your plastic is big enough to cover the whole pad with some wiggle room so you can weigh it down along the edge.
Gently lay the plastic down on the surface of the concrete so you do not create any smudges.

, Now you must wait for it to harden. Depending on when you poured it and how wet the concrete was at that time, you generally need to wait roughly 10-24 hours for the core to harden. Do not wait to long to check, because the retarder and plastic cover can only keep the top from hardening for so long.


It is best to let it sit over night and check it in the morning unless you poured it very early, in which case you can check it later that day.

, Removing the plastic should be no problem. It should be safe to walk on now. Start hosing off the top evenly amongst the surface. The creamy top layer should start to wash away exposing the pea stone gravel underneath. Use a broom to help brush off the top layer if it is not washing away easily.


Be careful to not focus in one area for too long, doing so can create rivets.
Pea stone should be exposed evenly throughout the surface.

, Removing the forms while the concrete is still wet can cause trouble so as long as it has hardened, removing them is an easy process. Just remove the stakes and take out any nails and the 2x4 boards should pop right off.


Forms can be reused for future jobs.

, Concrete WILL crack. It is unknown when it will crack but it WILL crack. Saw cutting it essentially says to the concrete ""Crack Here"". So instead of an obscure crack throughout the whole surface, it will crack along the specific saw cut lines you have set out for it. Which will make it look better and last longer.


Make the saw cuts symmetrical.
Square pads are cut into squares for symmetry, do not let the saw cut lines extend for more than 10' by 10'.

, Sealing the surface with a sealant spray solution will make the surface more weather resistant and prevent erosion. It will also bring out the true colors of the pea stone and generally make a shinier surface.


Make sure the surface is clean and free of any stains before hand.
Disperse the spray evenly amongst the surface for best results.

Make an absorbent paint stripper.,
Mix the stripper with the absorbent material.,
Spread the mixture.,
Scrape the mixture off.,
Scrub the spot.",How to Remove Paint from Concrete2," Assemble your materials. You will need paint stripper. If you are working in a well-ventilated area (outside or in an open, separate garage), you can use a stripper with methylene chloride. This will make the process much faster. You will need a respirator if working with this kind of paint stripper.









You will also need absorbent material. Finely ground clay is most effective. If you don’t have access, you can crush up cat litter into a powder.
To finish the cleanup job, you will need a stiff brush and scouring powder.

, Create a paste with your clay or cat litter. Depending on how thick the stripper is, you may not need to add much material. The absorbent material will help draw the paint off of the concrete, making it easier to scrape off.








, Apply a layer of the absorbent paint stripper mixture to the paint spot on the concrete. Allow time for the stripper to work. Depending on the chemicals that you are using, this could take anywhere from 20 minutes to several hours.









Add more paint thinner to the applied mixture during the process to keep the ingredients active.

, The paint thinner should have done most of the work for you, allowing you to remove most of the paint by simply scraping the mixture off with a hard plastic scraper. Add a second layer of mixture if there is remaining paint, and repeat the process.








, Use the stiff brush, scouring powder, and water to scrub at the stripped surface, removing any excess paint particles. Rinse away the scouring mixture and keep scrubbing with the brush to finish the job.

Consider soda blasting.,
Obtain a blasting unit.,
Blast the painted area.",How to Remove Paint from Concrete3," Determine if a blaster is right for your needs. If your paint covers a large area, then a blaster may be a better choice over a paint stripper solution. One form of blasting is soda blasting, which uses baking soda as the scouring agents. Soda blasting is also much more environmentally-friendly than using chemicals, and will not damage the concrete underneath.








, To soda blast, you will need a pot blaster. Your local hardware store may be able to rent them to you. You will also need special sodium bicarbonate. The baking powder that you buy at the grocery store is too fine to use in a soda blaster. The proper powder should be available where you rent the blaster, but can also be ordered online.









Most standard sand blasters cannot work with soda. You will need to obtain a specialized soda blaster in order to use sodium bicarbonate.

, Work slowly, holding the nozzle about a foot and a half away from the ground. Be sure to wear a respirator to avoid inhaling particles. Move the nozzle evenly across the painted area to make sure that no paint gets left behind.









If blasting near vegetation, be sure to avoid getting excess particles on plants. The high pH soda can cause browning and death in flowers and bushes.
If you have a lot of paint to remove, consider hiring a professional blaster. The amount of blasting material needed and the size of the blasting unit will most likely be far too much to afford on your own.

Dispose of your used materials.,
Allow the epoxy to cure completely.,
Observe the re-coat times carefully.",How to Put an Epoxy Coating on a Garage Floor," Epoxy coatings will react with other, previously installed coatings, so realize polyurethane and latex floor paints do not make a suitable substrate for epoxy products. If you have one of these coatings on your garage floor, it will require stripping prior to applying the epoxy.;
, If you have spilled lubricants, or your automobile has leaked on the floor, it will have left a residue that must also be removed before beginning the application. An industrial degreaser or solvent based cleaner will be required for this purpose, and care should be used to prevent asphyxiation or combustion while this step is undertaken.


Once you've cleaned the floor, it's now time to remove any formation of grease or oil. The cheapest and quickest way to remove grease and oil residue is by using a concrete degreaser. You can buy this in the hardware store. Pour the solution on your floor and start scrubbing away. The next step is a bit unorthodox. Let the degreaser soak in for a number of minutes and pour cat litter over the areas that have stains. Proceed by grinding it using your shoe. Let it stay there for 24 hours and sweep it.

, This material will need to be sanded or ground off, as ordinary solvents do not effectively remove it.

, Drip small amounts of acid solution to various areas of the floor. Pay close attention to those areas that appear different in color, texture, or shininess. The solution should fizz slightly yellow if there is no coating present.


If a coating exists, it will have to be removed, depending on the size of the area:






Small isolated areas: a surface grinder or aggressive sander with 50 grit or coarser sandpaper may do the trick, and then repeat step one.
If most/all of the floor will not return a fizz then it's suggested that you would rent or purchase a floor grinder to remove that coating.
Repeat the previous step of testing again.



, Etch the floor with muriatic acid or a masonry cleaner, such as SureClean 600. Most kits provide etching products that you can use. You need to follow the instructions found in your kit. Use your scrub brush so that it can be agitated really well. A home local improvement center can provide you with an etching product if the kit does not have one.


Etching is an important process as it opens up the pores of the concrete so that epoxy paint can properly stick. The lack of etching will contribute to an epoxy-coated floor with a lot of imperfections. Etching the floor involves applying muriatic acid or phosphoric acid and neutralize the floor afterward by using a high pressure nozzle.

, Use a garden hose to wet the entire floor just enough so that the floor is moist.

, Evenly pour out the gallon to cover 70-100 sq. ft. Try working in 'squares' as much as possible. Use a stiff bristled 18-24"" shop broom, and apply it in a scrubbing motion to scrub the areas, you should get a 'foamy' white reaction. Once this area is fully scrubbed, move to the next area and repeat.

, Once all areas have been completed using above steps, rinse the entire floor well with water. Broom out any excessive water.

, Any residual moisture will be trapped beneath the finished epoxy coating, causing the bond to weaken or fail between the coating and the concrete surface. Depending on humidity and temperature, thorough drying should take place in a week to ten days. Test the floor's dryness by placing a flat, moisture proof object on it, and allowing it to stay overnight. A vinyl floor tile is perfect for this purpose, and single tiles can often be purchased at your local home center or building supply company. After leaving the tile in place overnight, remove it and look for evidence of condensed water or a darkened appearance of the concrete surface indicating the presence of moisture.


You have to check first if there is any sign of moisture on the floor. You can do this by putting duct tape on a plastic that is laid out on the floor. Make sure that all of it's edges are sealed properly. You can use 1 gallon (3.8 L) zip lock bag for this testing. Leave it there for 24 hours and check it the next day. It has to be dry because a wet floor means that you can't paint on it. The paint will repel from a floor that is wet.
Some manufacturers recommend using a dry method for scouring the concrete because muriatic acid can damage the coating if it is not completely rinsed off.

, Epoxies vary, depending on the product manufacturer, but most are comprised of three ingredients. These are:

The epoxy resin. This is the main ingredient of the epoxy coating, and is generally a clear, or amber viscous liquid. It is available in quart, gallon, and five gallon containers.






The catalyst. This is the component of a multi-part epoxy system that causes the resin to harden, and is usually a part B of the package you will be purchasing. Buying your epoxy in a two part package insures the compatibility of the components. Read the mixing directions carefully to insure the proper proportions are mixed.






Pigment. Since epoxy is a semitransparent or colorless material, a pigment is used to give it its final color. Pre-pigmented packages are the best bet for home installers, but separate pigments can be purchased for your project if you wish to do so.






Texturing materials. It may be desirable to texture the floor with an aggregate material so the finish is not too slippery. Numerous materials are used for this purpose, from sandblasting sand to PVC plastic granules, giving different textures and degrees of traction. When in doubt, visit a paint retailer and look at samples of the products they offer, and read the manufacturer's literature for recommended products and procedures.







, Epoxies do not cover as much surface area as other coatings and paints, so check the application (or coverage)rate for the product you choose. Basically, for a 5-6 mil application rate, one gallon of combined material will cover 200 square feet, or a small, one car garage. Because you will want a seamless, one-step application of each coat, be sure to allow for waste and purchase significantly more than you will need.

, The rest is install the coatings per the manufacturers instructions. The basic steps will be these:

Mix the pigment, if used, with the resin in a clean metal container with twice the capacity of the total amount you will use for each application.






Add the hardener (catalyst) and mix again. Thorough mixing is essential for best results, so consider using a paint mixing paddle in a power drill, but avoid mixing at a speed so high it creates bubbles in the material.






Using a 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) nap roller on an extension handle, apply the material to the floor. Begin at a back corner, so you can work your way toward the exit as you roll, and overlap each roller path by one half its width with each successive roll. Keep plenty of material in the roller, and if it begins tacking, dip it again in your mixing bucket.






Work the roller as quickly as possible, as the epoxy has a short working time. Most epoxies, mixed according to manufacturer's directions, must be used in less than one hour, excessive hardener will reduce the working time considerably.







, If you wish to add paint chips, you should paint a measly 6'x6' section at a time and put the chips afterward. When you're putting them, make sure that you toss them in the air so that they will fall back to your fresh paint. You'll have a more random spread if you do this compared to throwing them directly on the paint., Dispose of your paint roller cover when you have finished applying a complete coat over the entire garage floor. The solvents used for epoxy cleanup are dangerous, and expensive, so cleaning your tools is simply not practicable.

, Again, read and follow the manufacturer's directions for the product you select, as this time may vary significantly.

, It's best that you put an extra coating to your floor. It will have a more glossy shine that can lock in the chips and ensuring the your floor will last longer. Remember, re-coating after waiting too long can be just as bad as not waiting long enough.

Create traction.,
Cure and seal the concrete.,
Maintain your concrete.",How to Pour Concrete," This includes grass, rocks, trees, shrubs, and even old concrete. Clear away everything until raw earth is exposed.;
, Your subbase is another word for any material on which the concrete rests. Usually, granular fill or road base is used as a subbase, although in some rare cases, soil itself can be used if it is extremely compacted and stable.The soil underneath your subbase is called your subgrade, and your concrete is only going to be as strong as your subgrade.Think about it: If your subgrade shifts, craters, or otherwise moves, the integrity of your concrete is going to be compromised. Make sure your subgrade is properly compacted and stabilized before adding the subbase.

Many professionals choose open-grade stone or closed-grade fine-grade stone for their subbase. Open-grade stone lack the smaller stones, giving water a way to pass through. Plus, it's less expensive. On the downside, it doesn't really compact as well as finer-grade stone. Finer-grade stone is compactable but tends to be more expensive.
Lay a 4–8 inch (10.2–20.3 cm) thick subbase with your chosen material, and then compact it with a hand tamper or a plate compactor. Plate compactors can be overkill for small, DIY projects, but offer more power in the compacting process.

, A form is usually a wooden perimeter, secured by special nails or screws, and built around the pouring site. A well-built form will help you achieve a better finish on your concrete. Keep a couple things in mind when building your form:


For square or rectangular forms, make sure that your corners form 90 degree angles. Take a tape measure and measure both diagonals of the square or rectangular; they should correspond to one another exactly. If they don't, it's back to the drawing board with your form.
Also make sure that the forms have a slight slope to them. If they are completely level, you can expect water build up in the middle of your beautiful concrete. To eliminate this possibility, create a slight slope of 1/4"" for every foot. When working with certain stamps, it's acceptable to use a 1/8"" slope for every foot.

, Wire mesh and rebar are used for added stability, especially on heavy load-bearing structures, such as driveways. If you're pouring concrete for surfaces onto which you're not likely to put a lot of weight, it would probably be overkill to add wire mesh/rebar. Both have their advantages and disadvantages:


Wire mesh will help guard small cracks growing and spreading, as well as offer stability across two axes (wire mesh is welded, where rebar is often tied together). The downside of wire mesh is that it is not great at providing structural integrity.
Rebar may offer better structural integrity, and be better for higher load-bearing surfaces. On the flip side, it doesn't do much to minimize the appearance of cracks that do appear.

, Concrete is mixed by adding together Portland cement, sand, and coarse aggregate (gravel) together in a ratio of 1:2:4. Water is added to the dry mixture to bind all the components together.


In a concrete mixer, add the determined amount of water and then the concrete mix. You can also mix this in a wheelbarrow with a shovel. Use as little water as possible. Water makes the concrete more maneuverable but it also weakens the constitution of the final product. A drier mix makes the concrete more crack resistant. Turn on the machine. The mix will become smooth and consistent. Shut off the machine.

, You can sometimes get a truck to pour concrete straight into your form; otherwise, load it into wheelbarrows and tilt them into the form until the high point is reached. While doing this, enlist some helpers to spread out the concrete with shovels, rakes and ""come alongs,"" which is a special concrete rake.

, Starting at the uphill point, use a screeding tool to flatten out the wet concrete. Screeding involves jiggling a wide plank of wood back and forth, if possible immediately over the forms, to create a flat surface.


Work your way from top to bottom, gently screeding until you have a flat surface. Your concrete surface won't be finished yet, but it will begin to look more complete and professional looking at this point.

, At this point, you should move fairly quickly as the concrete will set fast. Your floating process will contain two steps:


Use a large floating device, also known as a bull float, to press down aggregate and help the cream (gravel-free concrete) rise to the surface. Do this by moving the bull float away from you, keeping the tailing edge slightly elevated, and then moving the bull float back towards you, keeping the leading edge slightly elevated.
Use a magnesium hand float to go over the surface. After some of the water bleeds to the surface, use long sweeping motions with your hand float.

, Line up a plank as a straight edge to make periodic joints in the concrete. These joints will help the concrete withstand cracking due to temperature changes. Cut the joints about a quarter of the thickness of the concrete.

, Use a broom to sweep across the surface, creating designs. This will provide traction on the concrete so it is not as slippery when wet. A soft brush can also be used for a different texture that is less rough. For a smoother surface, but one that still has a pattern to it, you can use the trowel and slide it over the surface in a circular motion. Make sure the grooves are not so deep that water stands on the surface. Standing water will compromise the integrity of the concrete.


If moving the broom over the concrete causes clumps of concrete to aggregate on your broom, it's too early to broom. Move over the concrete again with the magnesium floater to smooth out the pattern left by the broom, then try again later.

, Concrete should be left to cure for 28 days, with the initial day being the most critical. As soon as the concrete has been poured, professionals usually recommend sealing the concrete. The sealant will help the concrete cure, as well as prevent cracks and discoloration.

, Although concrete is often thought of an a no-hassle surface, it benefits from regular maintenance. Regular soap and water maintenance will help keep the concrete looking its best, while occasional seals (~ every five years) can help keep the concrete from getting damaged through use.

Determine where you want to construct a concrete patio, how large it will be, and its exact dimensions.,

Use a bull float to smooth the concrete surface.,
Put on the finishing touches.,
Let the concrete cure for at least two days.",How to Pour a Concrete Patio," The size of the patio determines the amount of concrete required and whether you will need a mixer. If the patio is too large in area, it might not be an easy DIY job. The location is also important. You want to choose a mostly even area so you don't have to level the uneven ground before you lay the concrete.


Check local building codes to find out if a permit is required, how far the patio has to be from property and house lines, or any other county or city regulations.
Before you dig anywhere in your yard, find out where septic tanks, underground lines, or other utilities are located.;
, Tie string between the stakes and use a line level to determine the slope. The stakes and string will give you a good picture of how the patio will fit in your back yard. Adjust the area if needed.


Cutting the stakes to a pointed end may make them easier to drive into the ground.If the ground is uneven, you have two choices: build up the low side or dig the high side out., This can be done with a hoe, a shovel, or other common gardening tools.

, Dig 4 inches (about 10 cm) deep for raised and 8 inches (20.3 cm) deep for level.


Compact the earth if necessary.
If you're planning on having something extremely heavy such as a brick barbecue on your patio, your first step will be to pour a concrete foundation for added stability.

, Typically, this base will be 4 inches (about 10 cm) deep.


Ensure the gravel or crushed rock is compacted and laid evenly. Fluctuation in the height of the base can cause shifting or cracking in the patio over time.

, These stakes should be slightly outside your original stakes.They will be used in a later step to help support the outer edge of your patio.


Make sure the stakes are firmly embedded in the ground.
Patios need to slope to allow for water runoff. The standard slope is 1/8"" per foot. Check your local building codes for the exact slope dimensions.Don't underestimate the heaviness of wet concrete. Use very sturdy wood or it could bend or even break under the weight. Consider using steel concrete forms to avoid this problem.

, The frame (also called the form) holds the concrete. Cut the 2x4 to the length so that the inside dimensions are equal to the patio area.The form will be removed after the patio is finished, so you want to make sure you don't count the edge of the frame into your dimensions; if you do this, the patio will be smaller than you originally intended.

, When you insert the board into your patio site, they should be aligned directly underneath the string. Remember, the 2x4s are acting as the outer walls of your patio, so make sure you place them in the correct space.

, The stakes are the form's support so it doesn't bend against the concrete. Make sure the stakes, nails, and forms are sturdy. Use nails that are long and strong enough.


You can also use screws instead of nails. This requires a screwdriver.
While you are nailing each four forms to the stakes, make sure the forms are level. Use the string or a level to ensure the forms are level. If the forms are not level, you might end up with uneven concrete.

, The stakes should be just below the edge of the forms. They should not be visible above the concrete.


If pouring concrete next to a house, other slab of concrete, or other structure, place an isolation joint between the concrete and the existing surface.An isolation joint allows the concrete to move and minimizes cracking. Isolation joints are usually made by adhering asphalt-impregnated fiber sheeting or Iso-strip-off to the wall or surface your concrete will touch. The adhering asphalt-impregnated fiber sheeting and Iso-strip-off can be found at most home improvement stores., This assures that the concrete won't adhere to your boards so they can be removed after the concrete has finished setting.

, This can be done by hand or with a mixer. Always follow the directions on the bags of concrete. They will list how much water you need and how you should mix it.


You can calculate the number of bags you will need by determining the cubic yards of the patio site. Multiply the thickness, the width, and the height of the area to determine how many bags you will need. You can also use a concrete calculator like this.
If mixing by hand, you can put the concrete mix into a mortar tub or a wheelbarrow. Mix with a shovel or a hoe. Make sure that when mixing concrete by hand you wear gloves and protective eye wear.
If using a mixer, make sure you can move the mixer into the area where you are building the patio. Do this before you begin the project.
The amount of concrete needed for the project should determine whether you can mix by hand or with a mixer.

, Do this all at once to avoid independent shifting and settling of slabs.


If using a wheelbarrow, make a ramp so you can pour the concrete into the area. Make sure the ramp does not move or disturb the forms. Ramps can be made with 2x4s or other long pieces of wood.
Getting help from others will help with this step. Have someone shovel out the concrete as you hold the wheelbarrow.

, Concrete is heavy, so make sure to dump it close to where you want it. If the area is large, you might want to use a longer tool to spread hard to reach inside areas, or wear rubber boots to walk in the concrete as you spread.

, Work from one end of the patio to the other in a sawing motion.


This is easiest done with another person.

, Move the float back and forth to smooth the patio and to fill in low spots.


Water will float to the surface during this process. Wait until the water disappears to finish the patio.

, Using an edger, slide it between the forms and the concrete to create a rounded edge. When the concrete can support your weight, cut grooves in the concrete every 8 feet. These are control joints that help if the concrete shifts or changes over time. The final step is to hand float the concrete with a steel or magnesium float to finish smoothing the surface out.

, Cover the concrete with plastic or a curing compound to ensure it stays moist. After the concrete cures, remove the form boards. Be careful during this process; you don't want to chip your newly laid concrete.

Buy a statement piece.,
Use pink throws and pillows as a pop of pink.,
Paint one accent wall pink.,
Add texture to a room using pink wallpaper.",How to Use Pink in Your Home Decor1," Pink can be an intimidating color to use in home decor. Some people feel that pink is too bold to use on walls and it reminds them of childish or overly feminine decor. As a result, use pink as an accent colour to brighten a room and add a pop of color. To do this you can buy a statement piece, such as a sofa, appliance, table, headboard, or large piece of artwork, depending on the room you are decorating.Use subdued colors on the walls in order to allow the pink statement piece to act as a focal point in the room.;
, If you want to use pink in a more subtle way, try adding pink throws and pillows to your living room. This allows you to incorporate pink into your decorating pallet without breaking the bank on a large statement piece. You can also change your throws and pillows seasonally to mix things up in a fun way.


For example, you could use pink pillows and throws during the spring and summer months to brighten up your home.

, Another way to incorporate pink into your home decor is by painting one accent wall pink. This will allow the color pink to stand out and make a statement without feeling overdone. Try using a bright pink in a small space such as a front entryway or powder room. You could also create a pink accent wall in a bedroom, using a softer more romantic shade of pink, such as a blush or rose., Wallpaper can also be a great foundation for your color scheme. Patterned wallpaper will help to add texture to a room. You can try wallpapering the entire room, or just one wall depending on your preference. If you choose to use wallpaper on only one wall, you should paint the remaining walls in the room to match the background color of the wallpaper. This will create a seamless transition between the accent wall and the rest of the room.For example, if you choose a pink wall paper with tiny white flowers, pull out the pink background color and paint the remaining walls to match that shade of pink.

Try decorating with blush or rose.,
Decorate with dark bold pinks.,
Layer different shades of pink.",How to Use Pink in Your Home Decor2," Pink also comes in a variety of different shades that are suitable for different styles of decor. Try decorating with subtle pinks such as blush, shell pink, and rose to give your home a summery feeling. For example, use a neutral color base, such as cream or ivory with shell pink pillows, urns, and other decorative pieces. This will give your living space a light pop of pink., Dark bold pinks, such as fuchsia or hot pink, will draw a lot of attention. As a result, you should use them mainly as impact pieces that will catch the eye and hold attention. Use bold pinks in artwork, upholstery, or as part of a patterned rug. Although you can paint walls in bold pinks, some people may find this overwhelming. It is best to stick to smaller rooms or accent walls.Pair hot pink with green or navy blue to make a bold and vibrant statement.

, You can also try layering different shades and patterns of pink to create a youthful elegance. This type of decorating is called monochromatic. Use pink as a base color and then layer your accent pieces with different shades of pink. This type of decorating works nicely in the bedroom.For instance, if you are decorating a nursery or child’s room you can use multiple shades of pink to create a unique look. Try layering light pink walls with bubble gum pink furniture, and hot pink floral accessories."

Pair pink with dark colors.,
Use metallic colors to complement pink.,
Use pink as a neutral tone.",How to Use Pink in Your Home Decor3," Soft light pinks pair nicely with darker tones. Dark tones, such as black, brown, dark grey, and dark wood allow the lightness of pink to stand out. For example, pink upholstery looks great framed by dark wood. You can also position pink furniture on dark tiled floors for an elegant and sophisticated look., Pink also pairs well with metallic tones, such as silver and gold. For example, you could pair pink upholstered dining room chairs with an ornate gold light fixture. This will help brighten the room and the gold and pink tones will complement each other nicely. Similarly, you could use a cooler shade of pink for a living room area rug and pair it with grey furniture and silver light fixtures.


Experiment throughout your home matching different shades or pink with a variety of metallic textures.

, You can also use pink as a neutral tone. For instance, paint your walls a beige color that has pink undertones. You can pull out these undertones by adding pink accent pieces to the room. For example, try pink drapes, pillows, pictures, or floral arrangements. This is a great way to incorporate pink in a subtle and sophisticated manner.Alternatively you could paint your walls a light pink and then pair it with more neutral furniture and accessories. This will allow the pink walls to appear more neutral.

Transplant mature herbs with care.,
Spread more soil over the newly planted herbs.,
Label the jars individually.,
Find a creative way to display your garden.,
Place the herbs where they can receive plenty of sunlight.,
Water the herbs regularly.,
Use fresh herbs in your favorite recipes.",How to Build a Mason Jar Herb Garden," Ordinary glass mason jars can be purchased inexpensively at most supermarkets and home good stores. Pick up as many jars as you think you’ll need to contain a garden of the size you have in mind. Mason jars are often sold in sets, which can simplify the process of collecting them.Most mason jars come in either quart or pint sizes, which can be useful if you’re planning on growing more of one type of herb than another.
You might also take a more thrifty approach by repurposing the jars from pickles, jellies and pasta sauces.;
, Excess water can cause the delicate roots of most herbs to rot. Since the solid glass bottoms of the jars don’t provide any openings for runoff, a couple inches of small stones will allow water to settle out of the reach of the roots, making sure they absorb just the right amount.Gravel, cork shavings or even glass marbles can also be used to create the first layer of your mason jar planters.Mix in a small amount of sand to fill in the spaces between the stones and keep the soil from shifting.

, Scoop the soil into the opening of the jars, stopping when they’re about three quarters of the way full. This will give you a little extra space to work with when it comes time to plant the herb seeds and give them room to stretch out as they grow.Try not to pack the soil too tight—it needs to be somewhat loose in order for water and nutrients to penetrate down to the roots with ease.
Use a thin dowel or the tines of a fork to aerate the soil periodically., Keep the seeds confined to the area near the center so their growth won’t be checked by the walls of the jar. Only scatter a small pinch of seeds in each container. If you’re planning on growing large quantities of a particular type of herb, you’ll be better off using multiple jars.If you’re replanting seedlings that have already begun sprouting, make sure you position them with their roots pointing at a downward angle to the soil.You have a wide range of possible herbs to choose from, including cilantro, mint, chives, sage, rosemary, marjoram, parsley and lemongrass., You can also use the mason jars to continue cultivating herbs that are fully-grown. Just make sure to burrow the roots into the soil so they’ll be able to properly take hold. Packing the soil tightly around the base of the herbs will help keep them anchored in place.Try to minimize the amount of time that the roots are exposed to the air.
Water the transplanted herbs as soon as you’ve potted them.

, Once the seeds or mature herbs are in the jars, cover them with an additional half inch of soil. Tamp the new layer lightly to provide a more stable base. Don’t smother the herbs with too much soil. This can make it more difficult for them to sprout.
Alternatively, blanket new seeds with a thin layer of mulch or starting mix to help them along., Without labels, it can be difficult to keep track of what’s in the different jars, especially when they’re all bunched together. As a precaution, identify each jar separately in case they happen to get mixed up or moved around. Choose from stylish premade labels to customize the look of your garden, or simply mark a strip of masking tape.
Grouping similar types of herbs together can help ensure that they’re subjected to consistent growing conditions.

, Rather than simply setting the mason jars on a ledge, think of how you can be more expressive with their presentation. You might line them up in a narrow tray where you can keep them organized, or suspend them in a crafty macrame weave. Whatever you decide on, make sure the jars won't fall or get knocked over, and that nothing is in the way to prevent the plants from receiving water and sunlight.Another idea is to attached the jars to a separate board and mount them on the wall, where you can label them plainly and keep an eye on their growth and development.If you're planning on keeping your garden outside, try arranging the herbs in a wooden trough or the bed of an empty wheelbarrow to create a quaint, eye-catching bit of decoration., A window sill or low shelf in an open area can be a good place to leave them. As a general rule, your herbs should get at least six hours of sunlight a day in order to flourish.Move the jars around as needed to keep them exposed to direct sunlight. Too much or too little shade can stunt the growth of young plants.For those short, dark winter days, it can help to have a secondary light source, like a grow light or heating lamp., Once your herbs have begun to sprout, they’ll only need enough water to dampen the uppermost layer of soil. Wait until the soil is dry to the touch before watering them again. Try not to oversaturate the plants, as too much moisture can kill them off.Some herbs, like basil and mint, require more frequent moisture. Other, more delicate varieties such as lavender should be given time to dry out between waterings.
Fill a spray bottle with fresh water and mist the herbs at soil level once or twice a day. The gentle dispersion will help you avoid overwatering.

, Anytime you think a dish could benefit from an infusion of flavor, you’ll have a supply of potent and savory herbs at the ready. Snip the herbs close to the stems with a pair of sharp scissors, removing only as much as you plan on using. For recipes that call for an abundance of a certain herb, take cuttings from multiple plants to ensure that there’s enough left to grow back.If you have herbs leftover, you can sandwich them between a layer of damp paper towels, slide them into an airtight plastic bag and store them in the refrigerator.
Even though the herbs have been grown naturally, it’s still a good idea to wash them before incorporating them into food."

Select a suitably sized patch of relatively flat ground for your greenhouse.,
Using a tape measure, lay out a rectangle 16 feet (4.9 m) by 40 feet (12.2 m) on the ground to define the base of your greenhouse.,
Lay out planting beds inside this rectangle, leaving a walkway down the center of the 40 foot (12.2 m) dimension.,
Choose one of the 16 foot (4.9 m) ends to be the ""front"" of your greenhouse, where the door will be located.,
Repeat the previous step with the ""back"" pair of stakes and another piece of PVC.

,
Insert pairs of 3 foot (0.9 m) rebar pieces into the ground on opposite sides of the greenhouse every 5 feet (1.5 m) down each long side of your rectangle from the ""front"" pair, and (again with the help of a friend) slide another length of PVC over the two new stakes.,
Make three 40 foot (12.2 m) pieces of PVC by gluing together pairs of 20 foot (6.1 m) pipes using PVC joint compound.

,
Center a 40 foot (12.2 m) pipe down the underside of the series of arches to form a ""spine"" for the greenhouse, using stainless steel wire to make an ""X"" around each intersection.,
Duct tape a 40 foot (12.2 m) pipe along the the long edge of your plastic sheet, then roll it up in a few turns of the sheet (like you're making a scroll) and duct tape it securely in place.

,
Repeat the previous step with the third 40 foot (12.2 m) piece of PVC along the opposite edge of the plastic sheet, roll it up, and duct tape it securely.

,
Lay the assembly against one of the long sides of your skeleton, and with the help of a friend or two, walk one side of the plastic sheet with PVC attached over the top of the arches to form the ""skin"" of your greenhouse.

,
Once you have the skin stretched over the skeleton, make sure it's centered, so there's an equal amount of excess material lying on each side of the greenhouse.

,
Pile sand, sod, or loose soil over the flap of excess material (and the attached PVC pipe) along the whole length of one side of the greenhouse.,
Once one side of the sheet is thoroughly weighted down, go to the other side of the greenhouse, pull the plastic sheet down tight, and bury the excess material there the same way, making sure to keep the sheet as snug and wrinkle-free as possible.

,
Plant a pressure-treated 4x4 vertically about 2 feet (0.6 m) to either side of the spine of the greenhouse at each end to form uprights.,
Attach the front and back uprights to their adjacent rib using conduit clamps or plumbers strapping & wood screws.

,
Pull the plastic sheet around the ends of the greenhouse and secure it to the uprights by wrapping a 1x2 in the excess plastic at each side, pulling it tight, and attaching it to the uprights with wood screws driven through the plastic and the 1x2 and into the 4x4.,
Repeat the previous step at the front and back of the greenhouse.,
It's up to you whether you want to put doors on both ends of the greenhouse, or a door on one end and a window on the other.,
Seal up any gaps or tears in the plastic skin using duct tape and pieces of plastic sheet.

,
Add your chosen plants, and enjoy!

",How to Build a PVC Hoophouse," Be sure there are no trees, buildings, or other objects that will cast a shadow on the greenhouse for a significant portion of the day.;
, You'll probably want the 40 foot (12.2 m) dimension to run as close to east-west as you can, so the plants will get the maximum possible exposure to the sun. Measure the distance between opposite corners to make sure you have square corners. If the corners are square, the diagonal measurements will be equal (43 feet in this case). Push or hammer a 3 foot (0.9 m) piece of rebar into the ground at each corner, leaving about one foot protruding from the ground.

, You may want to consider making raised beds from planks or concrete blocks. In any case, you should perform any cultivation, tilling, addition of soil amendments, etc. at this time.

, With the help of a friend, bend a 20 foot (6.1 m) length of PVC pipe into an arch, and slide the ends over the ""front"" pair of rebar stakes. Be careful not to let go until both ends are slid all the way down the stakes; it's very springy stuff and could injure someone.

,, Repeat this process until you reach the ""back"" of the greenhouse.

,, Make sure you locate the ends of the wire on the underside of the spine and so there are no sharp points sticking up that might tear the plastic sheet. You should now have something that resembles the skeleton of a beached whale.

,,,,, Tuck the plastic sheet into the corner where the ribs of the greenhouse meet the ground, and be careful not to allow wrinkles to form in the sheet between the ribs.

,, The tops of the 4x4's should extend slightly above the point where they cross the front and back ribs of the greenhouse, so dig the holes accordingly.

,, You may want drill pilot holes so you don't split the 1x2 or break the screws.

, Use the same technique to secure the excess plastic hanging over the ends of the spine, by screwing another 1x2 between the tops of the uprights.

, In any case, assemble suitably-sized rectangles of 1x2's, reinforcing the corners of the door with triangles of 1/4"" plywood. Wrap the frames in plastic, and attach them to the uprights using standard door hinges. Attach a sliding bolt latch to the side opposite the hinges.

Wait at least 24 hours before use.",How to Polish Concrete," Use a Mohs hardness pick to determine the degree of mineral hardness. Determining whether the concrete is soft, medium, or hard will allow you to fine-tune the polishing process.


Use the tools supplied in the kit to test the hardness of the concrete against the hardness of other minerals. The softest mineral that is capable of scraping the concrete is harder than the concrete, placing the concrete's level of hardness directly below that mineral.;
, Prepare a solution of warm water and household detergent, then scrub the concrete thoroughly using that solution and a bristle brush. Rinse away any suds and let the area dry.For especially stubborn stains or mold, you might need to use a stronger cleanser. Hydrogen peroxide, ammonia, and TSP are common options, but do not mix these chemicals together. Choose and use only one chemical.
Wear protective gloves and eye goggles before handling any chemicals. Keep the area well-ventilated, too.

, If there are any cracks in your concrete surface, you should repair them before you polish it.Purchase specialized concrete crack filler. Follow the instructions on the package to mix the filler, then squeeze it directly into the crack.
Allow the filler to set completely before moving onto the next step.

, You'll need to use a specialized tool to grind concrete; a standard sander will not be enough. You can usually rent concrete grinders from most hardware stores.


Before agreeing to rent the grinder, make sure that it feels comfortable enough for you to use.
Note that renting a grinder can cost as much as $1000 per week, so this project may not be especially cost-effective if you're only working with a small concrete surface.

, Before handling the grinder, you should prepare yourself by wearing a dust mask, gloves, safety goggles, and ear plugs.While not strictly necessary, you may also want to wear a helmet to protect your head in the event of an accident. This is especially important if you are working in an area currently undergoing other construction.
Wear work shoes with a good grip, too. Even if you feel fairly confident about your home improvement skills, accidents happen, and no-slip shoes can help prevent accidents caused by sliding, slipping, or falling over.

, If you need to remove sealer, stain, or other contaminants that wouldn't wash off, start with a 40-grit grinding disc. If you do not need to remove anything, though, skip directly to an 80-grit disc.


Note that these discs must be metal-bonded diamond discs. Non-diamond discs will not be hard enough to grind down the concrete.
Keep in mind that lower grit values indicate coarser discs. In other words, 40-grit discs are coarser than 80-grit discs.
Follow the instructions that come with your grinder to determine the proper way to attach discs and power the machine. Pass over the entire concrete surface, gradually working from one corner to the diagonally opposite corner.

, You will need to use at least two or three more grinding discs. Choose discs that are progressively higher (less coarse) in grit-size.The exact grit sizes may vary depending on the hardness of your concrete. As a general guideline, however, follow the 40-grit disc with an 80-grit disc. Move onto 150-grit after that, followed by 200-grit, and possibly 400-grit.
Pass over the entire surface with each new disc. For each new disc level, the idea is to buff away any scratches made from the previous grinding disc. Accomplish this task by crossing over scratch lines in a perpendicular direction.

, Spray liquid chemical hardener over the surface to help solidify the concrete.The best time to densify the concrete will vary depending on the original degree of hardness. Return to the results of the Mohs hardness test. For soft to medium concrete, apply the densifier after using the 80-grit disc. For medium to hard concrete, apply the densifier after using the 200-grit disc.
Follow the manufacturer's instructions when determining how to apply the densifier. Typically, you'll need to pour the product into a small sprayer. Use the nozzle of the sprayer to coat the entire concrete surface, then let it dry before continuing.

, After your primary grinding and densifying, attach a 3000-grit disc to the grinder. Work over the entire concrete surface with this disc, moving from one corner to the diagonally opposite one.


This grit on this disc is so fine that it will actually begin polishing the surface. You can skip this step if absolutely necessary, but following it will give the finished concrete a high-gloss appearance.

, Grinding the concrete produces plenty of dust and debris. After you finish all of the grinding, you should vacuum as much debris as possible using a shop vac.


Note that some concrete grinders come with their own vacuum. In these instances, use that vacuum instead of a separate shop vac.
You can also vacuum the surface in between disc switches, but doing so is not typically necessary. One thorough vacuuming before you buff the concrete should suffice.

, Remove the grinding disc from your concrete grinder and attach a burnishing pad. Pass over the entire concrete surface using this pad.Working the concrete with the burnishing pad should buff the concrete and make it notably smooth.
If you do not have a burnishing pad for your concrete grinder, or if the machine does not have an appropriate setting for use with a burnishing pad, use a low-speed brush-style buffer instead.

, Choose a water-based or solvent-based concrete sealer and follow the manufacturer's instructions when applying. Some sealers need to be rolled, while others should be sprayed onto the surface.Sealers protect the concrete against grease, dirt, and other stains. Moreover, using a glossy sealer should give the polished concrete more of a sheen.
No matter which type you use, the standard coverage rate is 250 to 300 square feet (23.2 to 27.9 square meters) of concrete per 1 gallon (4 L) of sealer.
Apply two thin coats instead of one heavy coat. Wait for two to four hours for the first coat to dry before applying a second, then apply the second coat in a direction lying perpendicular to the first coat.
After applying the second coat, wait another two or four hours before moving onto the next step.

, Pass over the sealed surface once more with the burnishing pad or buffer. Work slowly and thoroughly, covering the entire surface at an even pace.


Move in the direction lying opposite/perpendicular to the direction in which your applied your last layer of sealer.
When you finish this final pass, the concrete should look as smooth and glossy as finished stone.

, Allow the final coat of sealer to completely dry before you actively use the concrete surface.


The exact amount of time will vary depending on the manufacturer, but it will usually be between 24 and 72 hours.
After you wait the appropriate amount of time, the polished concrete should be finished and ready for active use.

Hang your trellis.",How to Build a Garden Trellis," Making a garden trellis is not difficult, but it does require some special tools and materials. To build a garden trellis, you will need:








miter saw or circular saw
drill
sander
eye and ear protection
eight boards measuring 1 ½ inches x 1 ½ inches by 8 feet
lots of 2 ½ inch exterior grade screws
tape measure
pencil;
, Take your 8 foot long boards and measure them to the dimensions that you need for this project. Use your pencil to mark the boards where they will need to be cut. You will need to measure and mark your 8 foot boards so that you will end up with:








four 72 inch boards
seven 48 inch boards
several small pieces (about 6 inches) to use as spacers (optional)

, After you have finished measuring and marking all of your boards, you can use your miter saw or circular saw to cut them. Use the pencil marks that you made on the boards to cut the boards to the required dimensions.








Make sure that you wear your ear and eye protection when you use the saw.
Watch your fingers and be very careful when cutting your wood pieces.
If you are worried about cutting the wood or if you do not have a saw, then you can also consider getting them cut at the hardware store.

, Do your best to smooth out any rough edges on the ends of the boards.You can use a power sander or a manual sander to smooth out the ends and edges of your boards.









Start with a coarse grit sandpaper such as #80 grit and then advance to a finer grit sandpaper as you remove the larger flaws in the wood. For example, you might finish sanding the trellis edges with a #150 or #180 grit sandpaper.Don’t forget to wear your ear and eye protection if you are using a power sander.

, Lay out two of your 72 inch pieces so that they are parallel with each other. Then, place two of your 48 inch pieces on top of them so that they resemble a picture frame. Next, screw the corners of the 48 inch boards the corners of the 72 inch boards.








Place two screws into each of the four corners to keep the trellis from pivoting.
You can make pilot holes before you place your screws to help prevent the screws from splitting the wood, but this is optional. If you decide to make pilot holes, then they should be as big as the smallest diameter of your screws.Use a smaller sized drill bit that is as long as your screw to create the pilot hole before you place the screws.

, After you have created the frame, you should have two 72 inch pieces left. Measure along each of your 48 inch frame pieces to determine where to connect your last two 72 inch pieces. These two pieces should be evenly spaced between the other two 72 inch pieces.








Secure the ends of the 72 inch pieces to the 48 inch pieces with a couple of screws.

, Measure the two outer 72 inch boards and place pencil marks to indicate where you want to place your five remaining 48 inch boards. You can place them wherever you want, but make sure that these marks are even with each other so that the boards will be straight.








To get a sense of how to space your boards, you can start by placing one board so that it lays across the centers of the 72 inch boards. Then place the other four pieces in the spaces that are left.
Consider how you plan to use the trellis before deciding where to place the boards. For example, you might like to have a couple of boards lower to the ground to hang a planter.
After you have decided where each of the boards should be placed, secure them with screws.

, If you want to leave a gap between the back of your trellis and the wall, then you can add some spacers to the back of your trellis. You can also add spacers to the front if you plan to hang something from the front (such as a planter or trough) that may sag without a spacer.








If adding spacers to the back of your trellis, secure them to each of the four corners as well as a few in the center.
If adding spacers to the front of your trellis, then place them wherever you think you may need them.
Use your drill and a screw or two to secure your spacers.

, Use your drill and screws to secure your trellis to a wall or sturdy fence. Place screws at each of the four corners of the trellis as well as a couple of screws in the center to secure your trellis in place.








Make sure that the screws that you use are long enough to go all the way through the trellis and into the wall behind it. For example, if you have placed spacers at your corners, then you will need screw that are at least five inches long to secure the trellis to the wall.

Add a small amount of vinegar to a paper towel and gently wipe the colander down.If the colander is a little wet after cleaning, set it aside until it's dry. You can also dry patting it dry with paper towels.;
, You want to start with spray paint primer. This will help your paint stay on better.Spray paint outside with a large drop cloth underneath your colander. It's best to set the colander on top of something high up, to avoid slouching while spray painting. For example, set it on a work bench outside.To spray paint, make horizontal swiping motions. This will help the paint be distributed evenly. Keep going back and forth, making horizontal stripes, until the colander is completely coated with primer.
Make sure to read the instructions on any primer or spray paint you use. You want to make sure you follow any specific instructions.

, Primer take about two hours to dry. After the primer dries, spray paint your colander in your chosen color.Remember to use horizontal swiping motions while you spray paint and read the instructions on your spray paint can.Depending on your type of spray paint, you may be able to get away with a single coat. If your paint looks thin, however, add a second coat of paint after the first one dries.

, You want to be completely certain your colander is completely dry before proceeding. Let your colander sit overnight to dry. Put it in a safe place, such as an outdoor shed with a door that closes, to prevent damage., Use more fabric than you think you will need. You will trim it down later. Use a pair of scissors to trim your landscape fabric into a circle.Set your colander upside on the landscape fabric. Draw a circle an inch or two bigger than the colander to cut out. The circle does not have to be perfectly round.
If you can't find landscape fabric, set coffee filters inside the colander instead. Set down as many as you need to cover the inside of the colander completely.

, Place the landscape fabric in your colander. Flatten it against the bottom and sides of the colander so it's covering most of the colander's interior., If you have any extra fabric pouring over the sides of the colander, trim it. When you're done, the landscape fabric should fit neatly into the colander. You shouldn't have any excess fabric spilling out.Again, the circle does not have to perfectly round. You will be filling the colander with soil and then plants, so the fabric will not be highly visible.

, Get potting soil at a greenhouse and most department stores. Add a small amount of potting soil at first, just enough to secure the landscape fabric., If you're transporting a plant into the colander, make sure to remove it with a spade at the roots. Then, insert the roots into the new soil. If you're planting seeds, consult their label. This should tell you how deep to plant them., You want to make sure you cover the roots of a plant you transported to the colander. You also may need to add more soil to assure a seed is planted deep enough. Add extra soil as necessary to your colander., Use wire cutters to cut your chains. Cut them to the length you want. For example, cut them around a foot in length if you're going to hang your plant from a ceiling in your kitchen. Cut out three chains of equal length.It's important the chain's lengths be equal, so use a ruler.

, Attach hooks on one end of each chain. Feed the hooks through the slots in the colander. You should have three hooks that essentially surround the colander, keeping it balanced. Keep the hooks roughly equal distances from one another. This should keep the colander steady when it's hanging., An S-hook is a larger hook shaped like an ""S."" You can get one at a local department store. Hook all three chains together using the S-hook., You can hang the colander off of a mantel or ceiling hook in your kitchen. You can also hang it outdoors, using hooks around your porch or railing."

Let the metallics have the spotlight.",How to Use Metallics in Your Home Decor," If you’re new to this trend and haven’t played around with metallics before, don’t go big right away. Try adding a few small pieces to a room first, just to get a feel for how it works in your home – and to confirm you like metallic décor! Adding a metallic gold vase as a table centerpiece or hanging up a mirror with bronze trim are examples of ways you can add a bit of bling to your space without feeling overwhelmed., If you aren’t a professional interior decorator, you might not have a grand vision for your space. That’s OK! You can always buy a few items that can work in several places around your home, and you can play around with them. Look for pieces that can work in your bedroom or your living room, or the bathroom or the kitchen. You can move things around and experiment.A metallic picture frame is a small touch that can add a lot to a space, but can also work in virtually any space. The same goes for metallic lamps, trays, bowls, and so on.

, If you aren’t ready to fully embrace this trend yet, why not purchase a few temporary metallic accessories? For example, consider using fun golds and silvers in your holiday or seasonal décor. You can find festive throw pillows, table settings, display trinkets, and so on. If you still love the metallic trend when the season or holiday ends, you can get some décor that is more permanent.

, If you don't want to fill your home with various metallic pieces, or simply only have one metallic piece that interests you, why not just use it solo to make a statement? Whether it's a metallic tea tray on your coffee table or one metallic piece of art on your mantle, one statement piece will draw the eye immediately. You don't need to add metallics to every corner of the room to embrace this trend in your home.

, After all, not all metallics are created equal. A shiny, smooth gold will create a different effect in a room than a hammered gold. Any metallic with an antiqued finish will look darker and older, and a metallic with a brushed finish will be more matte. If you’re not interested in traditional gold or silver, don’t overlook copper and bronze décor! Also, don’t be afraid to mix and match metallics to create a lot of interest.Again, if you aren’t sure which one you’ll prefer over time in your home, try out a few smaller, temporary pieces! You can get an idea for your personal preference without committing to anything or shelling out a lot of cash.
Don’t buy a certain type of metallic simply because it’s recommended with your color palette or someone suggested it. Choose a metallic that you personally love, and you won’t get sick of it., If your space needs a makeover, try heading to Pinterest before heading to Home Goods. You can also find decorating ideas from interior design magazines and websites. Even if you have experience decorating your home, it never hurts to check out what other people are doing. You can see how the professionals are using metallics in homes, and you might discover combinations or ideas that you never considered.

, Giving your own furniture or décor a metallic makeover is a great way to save a little money and extend the life of your belongings. Instead of tossing that plain wooden dresser you’re sick of, give it a makeover. A coat of black or white paint with some metallic knobs or accents will make it look like a whole new piece. The same goes for old chairs, tables, desks, and so on. You can find metallic spray paints in every hue at a home improvement store., To bring balance to the room you’re decorating, it’s a great idea to pair opposites. In other words, try blending your metallic décor with soft fabrics. A vibrant gold bowl placed on a faux fur place mat creates a beautiful contrast. Adding a metallic throw pillow to a soft velvet armchair strikes that same balance.Not only do these pairings create balance, but they also allow the metallic element to really stand out.

, Using metallics to decorate your home is a pretty bold choice, and it’s typically best to let those elements be the focal point. In order to do this, try to keep the rest of the room fairly neutral. Pair your metallics with colors like gray, white, cream, black, and so on. Not only is this extremely modern and on trend, it’s also much more welcoming and “livable.”Pairing some already flashy metallic décor with colors like hot pink or electric blue is certainly a bold choice, but you’re likely to get a bit sick of it after awhile.

, The other tips have alluded to it, but the key to using metallic in your home décor is to let those pieces have the spotlight. By keeping the rest of your décor neutral, soft, and simplistic, you’ll ensure that your space doesn’t become overwhelming. For example, if there’s a metallic coffee table that you love, go for it! Just keep the couch and rug neutral, and let that table have the spotlight.


The added bonus of keeping your spaces pretty neutral is that you will be able to swap different metallic pieces in and out as you like!

Select a basket.,
Line the basket.,
Choose good soil.,
Select strong plants that are appropriate for growing in a basket.,
Hang well.,
Place in good positions.,
Keep watered.",How to Prepare a Hanging Basket," There are a variety of baskets available on the market. Consider what will fit with your decor and what theme works well with your garden and plant choices. Also select the size that best suits the type of plant that you will be planting, including consideration for its likely future growth. Hanging baskets are typically available in such materials as:


Stout galvanized wire






Solid plastic






Ceramic pot in a macrame or other knotted hanger






Ceramic pot attached with wire






Plastic mesh or basketry





;
, Lining a basket helps to keep the soil in place and reduces the need for watering; it also neatens the appearance of the basket. The best lining for a hanging basket is sphagnum moss. This works especially well with hanging baskets that are wire based. Another lining that can be substituted for sphagnum moss is polythene; be sure to punch some holes in the base of this lining to allow the water to seep through and ensure good drainage. For the most successful water retention and reduced need to water in large baskets, combine sphagnum moss and polythene linings (polythene over the sphagnum moss, with small holes poked in the polythene).

, A good quality potting mix or compost should be used for hanging baskets. Add a slow-release fertilizer and mix well before filling the basket.

, The best plants to use in a new hanging basket are well-established plants that are either flowering or are close to flowering. Arrange large plants first and tuck in smaller plants around these, including trailing plants at the edge. There is a huge variety of plants that work well in hanging baskets; some plants that are ideal for hanging baskets include:


Lobelia







Gypsophila (baby's breath)






Nasturtiums






Geraniums (long-flowering)






Hoya






Verbena






Fuschias






Begonias






Pansies






Polyanthus







, Once the basket is filled with soil and plants, it is heavy. Be sure to have a sturdy surface to stand on for hanging (such as a stepladder correctly placed so that it won't wobble). Make sure that the hooks used to hang the baskets are very strong; the basket will become even heavier after each watering.

, Where you place your hanging baskets will depend in large part on the reasons behind why you want them. Perhaps you want to disguise something that isn't so pretty, perhaps you want to brighten up an area or perhaps you simply want a brilliant display of flowers that you love. Be guided by the reasons that drive you. Also be considerate of the plants' needs; few plants can withstand full sunshine or full shade when they are planted in a hanging basket.

, Depending on the temperature and the plant type, hanging baskets may need to be watered daily. Get a good quality watering can or a plastic container with a nozzle that reaches high; you can squeeze the water up from the container through the nozzle and into the plant to save you having to reach to high places.

Add a hole in the bottom for drainage.,
Allow the planter to dry thoroughly for about 7 days.,Carefully de-mold the planter and add soil and plants.",How to Make Hypertufa Planters,", Vermiculite can be used in place of perlite for a more workable hypertufa. Perlite resists water where vermiculite will absorb it. The vermiculite concrete will be harder than perlite concrete

Measurements may be approximate.
Try to get all the lumps out of the peat moss for best texture.
Wear gloves and avoid breathing near the mixture.
You can use a shovel or trowel to stir.

,

You should be able to form a ball of the mixture in your hand.






,
Whatever you use as the form should be much larger than the opening you want in the finished plant pot, because the walls will be quite thick.
Make sure the shape of the pot or form you use will allow you to remove the finished planter easily. It should have sloped sides with no undercuts.

, Make the walls 1-2 inches (2.5 to 5cm) thick. You will be able to see the shape of the finished plant pot as you complete it.
, You can use your finger to form the hole.
, To reach full strength the concrete will need 28 days total however the initial 7 days will provide an 75-80% strength,"

Find the mirrors that you want to turn into garden mirrors.,
Using a circular saw, cut the plywood into the exact same size and shape as the mirrors.

,
Paint the plywood with any outdoor paint.,
While you're waiting for the paint to dry on the plywood, cut the fence boards into the length you need to make your outer frame.,
Using liquid nails or caulk, glue the ""frame"" of fencing material to the front of the mirror.

,
Measure the inside of the frame from top to bottom and cut a piece of trim to fit that exactly.,
Create an open window look.,
Measure the distance between the two pieces of frame and cut another piece exactly that size.,
Cut a piece a little longer than you will need for the top and bottom part of the window and place it where it needs to go.,
Determine how you want to hang the garden mirror.,
Using an unbroken line of waterproof caulk around the outside back of the mirror, and more all over the back of the mirror, glue the painted plywood in place.

,
Add the hangers to the back of the garden mirror.",How to Make a Garden Mirror,";
,, Since it won't be seen, any color will do, so use up unwanted paint if you have any, or even mixed colors.

, If you're really good with the saw, you might try cutting at a 45 degree angle. In this tutorial, the outer frame was simply cut square since there wasn't any material to spare.

,, Glue it on to the mirror adjacent to one side of the frame.

, This is the tricky part. You have to use your judgment to determine how ""open"" you want the window to look. It's recommended that you don't try to make it look too open or the effect won't work. Cut a piece of trim about two inches (5cm) (depending on the size of your project) smaller than the first piece. Glue it about an inch (2.5cm) from the other side of the frame.

, Glue it in the exact center of the first two pieces, but perpendicular.

, Mark the angle you need to cut on both sides and cut it. Now glue each of those down.

, You'll need to add a small piece of wood to the plywood for a hanger before you attach the plywood to the back of the mirror. This part is up to you because it depends on where you'll be hanging the mirrors to how much wood you need to attach. Use your judgment.

,, Now hang the garden mirrors up!

Choose accessories and furniture that coordinate with your adjacent rooms.,
Pick a paint color or wallpaper that suits the area.,
Put up a low-hanging chandelier or pendant light.,
Create an eye-catching wall display.,
Hang an accent mirror to create space.,
Add some greenery.,
Choose furniture with organization and storage in mind.,
Make the most of the wall space with hooks.,
Add a runner or throw rug.",How to Decorate a Foyer," As the main entryway to your home, your foyer should set the tone for the rest of the house. Though you want your foyer to make an impression, it should also blend seamlessly into all adjoining areas. So, if you have Victorian furniture in the living room, try placing a Victorian table in the foyer.


You can also try blending furniture styles for a unique, less designed look. For example, pairing antique and modern items will help refresh the older items while creating a more comfortable, welcoming atmosphere.;
, If you have a spacious foyer, you can choose from both dark and light colors. However, if your foyer is small, you may want to stick with a bright color to make the area seem bigger. This will also help lighten the space if it doesn’t get much sun.


Try choosing colors that lead well into the rest of the house. A great way to do this is to use a blend of interior and exterior paints. For example, if the outside of your house is gray and the inside is marigold, try using both colors.Or, for a simple, modern look that makes a statement, try combining hues from the same color family.

, This is not only a great statement piece but also a good way to make the room look bigger. Just make sure you have enough room to hang the chandelier or light at least 6’8” above the floor. If you can't, the room may appear smaller and crowded.


If you don’t have the space for a chandelier or pendant light, but still feel like the area is too dark, try a table or floor lamp. You can go with a simple design or choose a decorative piece. For example, an antique, hand-painted, glass lamp is a beautiful addition to any room.
You can also try track lighting, which works particularly well in long hallways. It also keeps everything off the floor so you have more space.

, This is a great way to showcase your personality and display items that are important to you. For example, you can create a photo collage of places you’ve traveled to or use shadow boxes to exhibit family memorabilia. You can also choose singular items like a large portrait, painting, mirror, or wall hanging to display.If you can’t set your mind to one thing, try painting a wall with chalk paint and keeping a bin of multicolored chalk nearby. This way you and your guests and can write and draw as you feel inspired. It's also a great way to change the space with the season/holiday or to leave people welcoming messages.You can even mix all of these items for an eclectic feel. For example, make a collage of pictures, mirrors, and shadow boxes.

, If your foyer is small, a mirror is a great way to make the area appear larger. You can also try hanging two mirrors on opposite walls to reflect into each other and widen the room. Try choosing an oddly shaped mirror, like an oval or wide circle, or one with an intricate frame to add character to the space.


If the room is dark, you can position a mirror to catch sun and bring in light, too.
Adding a mirror or two is also a great idea so you and your guests can check your appearance before coming or going.

, Whether they’re real or fake, adding plants to a room is a simple way to bring in some color and variety. For example, you can choose a large floor plant like a Dracaena or a rubber tree, or you can utilize a console table to set up some small flower pots.


You can also try keeping a large flower arrangement of something like calla lilies or sunflowers in a vase.
If you feel like you don’t have the space for plants, try a wreath. These are easy to change with the season.

, When picking pieces to fill the space, try to find items that double up as containers. For example, a storage bench provides both a place to sit and a spot to put shoes, umbrellas, and other extraneous items.


You can also utilize bins, baskets, or repurposed crates and wood pallets to help declutter the area and stay organized with style.
If you have space, try setting a small table by the doorway for incoming and outgoing mail, keys, and change.

, If you don’t have a large area to work with, getting items up and off the ground can be important. Try installing hooks to get the most out of an area. For example, you can use them for clothing items like jackets, scarves, and hats as well as keys.


To be even more organized, try labeling each hook with the names or pictures of your family so everyone knows where their items should go., This is a great way to lead a person’s eye into your home. It’s also a great idea to protect your floor from mud and wear. Try choosing a rug in a dark color or intricate pattern to reduce the appearance of dirt.


If you don’t want the hassle of constantly washing a runner, you can even paint one directly onto your floor.

Measure and cut a mat-board and a mounting board to the overall size calculated to create a mat 4 to 6 inches larger than the print so as to reveal 2 to 3 inches (5 cm to 7 cm) of the mat on all sides of a print.,
Obtain a frame matching the dimensions of the finished matted print/mounting board.

,
Lay the cut-to-size mounting board face up and center the print on it.

,
Tape the print to the mounting board with archival tape ""hinges"" at the top edge only so a print ""hangs"" and expands and contracts with the humidity.,
Make a mat for the print using archival mat-board to prevent the print from touching the glass by doing the following.,
Cut the mat-board from the backside along these lines in one stroke for each cut.,
Lay the frame face down.

,
Clean both sides of the glass to be used in the frame and lay it into the fame.,
Lay the display side of finished, cut mat-board into the frame directly on the glass.

,
Lay mounted print in the frame face down on the mat-board installed previously.,
Install backing material of same size as mounting-board/mat into the frame on top of the mounting board just laid in.,
The print is now framed in a professional manner that will last for years.

",How to Frame a Print,";
,,,


Use archival tape ""hinges,"" available with instructions at any art supply store. Tape ""hinges"" are an invisible mounting method used so the upper edge of a mat only needs to overlap a print edge by 1/4 inch (.6 cm).

,


Measure the print horizontally and vertically. To create a mat to overlap the edges of the print by 1/4 inch (.6 cm) on each of four sides, subtract 1/2 inch (1.2 cm) from the overall horizontal and vertical dimensions of the print. This is the size of the opening in the mat to display the print, which is 1/4 inch (.6 cm) smaller than the print on all four sides.
On the back of the mat-board, diagonal lines drawn between the opposite corners will cross at the center-point of the mat. Note the center-point and measure 1/2 of the dimensions determined above from the center out toward the edge of the mat both horizontally and vertically. Mark these using a pencil.
Use a T-Square aligned from the adjacent edge and align it to the pencil marks to assure perfectly square lines parallel to each other and to the mat-board edges. Draw a line along the edge of the T-square to define the inner area of the mat that will be cut out for the print.

, Assure cleanly cut corners by overlapping the cuts at the corners by at least 1/8 of an inch (3.175 mm). Overlap cuts will be nearly invisible on the face of the mat.

,, Assure all four edges of the glass lay securely in the frame.

,, Before proceeding, lift an edge of the frame and look to assure the print is aligned with the mat-board opening and no dust or material is between the glass and the mat or print .


With the frame face down, secure the backing material to the frame using framers points pushed into the wooden frame on each side of the frame. Metal frames are provided with snap-in metal tabs for this purpose.

, Any cardboard or mounting board will suffice for backing.

,"
"
Take the frame apart.,
Extract all of the broken glass.,
Measure the opening where the glass sits.,
Buy a dollar store frame and swap the glass.,
Purchase a pre-cut or specially cut piece of glass.,
Pay attention to the corners.,
Clean the new glass.,
Insert the new piece of glass.,
Put the frame back together.",How to Replace Broken Glass in a Picture Frame," Work over a table so you don’t drop any glass on the floor. The back of the frame may be held in place with clips of some kind. Remove the back and the picture and set them aside. If the picture has any glass that is stuck to it, you can use a hairdryer to heat up and loosen the hold between the two.;
, Carefully get all of the glass out of the frame. If the glass is broken into shards, you may need to shake the frame a little to dislodge any stuck pieces. Be careful when handling shards of glass. Broken glass should not be put into a trash bag, so place it all in a cardboard box or directly into an outdoor trash container or dumpster.Making sure all the shards are out of the frame is important. Any shards left in the frame may cause the new piece of glass to not fit properly, or may even break the new piece.
Take precautions in the area where the frame broke to ensure no glass pieces are on the floor. If there are pieces of glass on hard floors, use a broom and dust pan to sweep them up. If there are pieces stuck in the carpet, you can use a vacuum, or use a cloth or gloves to carefully pick them up by hand.

, If this is hard to do, try measuring the cardboard backing. If you are not sure, make a paper template. You will be using this to get the correct size glass. If the picture frame is not a square or rectangle, always make a template.If can’t get a perfect measurement, it is best to choose a measurement that is shorter rather than longer. A slightly short measurement will make the new piece of glass a little loose in the frame, but a measurement that’s too big will cause the piece to not fit at all.
For example, if the measurement is between 10 ⅝ & 10 ¾ inches, it’s best to go with 10 ⅝.
Frames can be constructed in different ways. Yours may be just the metal frame and the glass sits directly in that frame, or there could be a cardboard insert where the glass sits. This is why it is important to measure exactly where the glass will be placed to ensure you get the right size.

, If the picture frame is a standard size, and you don’t have particularly high standards for the glass, this is a great option. Purchase a frame of the same size as the broken one. Then you can remove the glass from the new frame and use it in the frame you already have.Again, due to different frame construction, picking a frame for the same size picture won’t necessarily be the exact right size piece of glass. Compare any frame you consider buying to the frame you have at home to make sure the glass itself is the same size.
If you can take the frame apart without opening a package or messing anything up, do this so you can check the glass more closely. Be careful not to break anything you haven’t purchased yet.
You might even take your tape measure with you to check the new piece of glass.

, You can go to a specialty glass store or picture frame store, or you can go to a hardware store. Most picture frame glass is 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) thick, but you should try to check your frame specifically. Make sure to take your measurements with you to the store so you are sure to get the right size.


Buying glass at a specialty store may give you the option of anti-glare coatings or extra clear glass that a basic picture frame won’t have.
If the glass is exceptionally large, or is not rectangular in shape, such as an oval, you will almost certainly have to get a piece specially cut. If this is the case, you should take the frame to the glass store with you to help tell them the size piece you need.

, Check the inside corners of the frame, along with the corners of the glass that broke. Some frames have glass with rounded edges. It’s important when you get a new piece to determine ahead of time if you need pointed or rounded corners. You don’t necessarily have to get the same kind, as long as the new piece will fit properly and not show its curves.

, Before you install the glass into the frame, you want to make sure both sides are clean. Spray window or eyeglass cleaner on the piece of glass and wipe with a paper towel. Make sure neither side has any streaks. If you don’t have glass cleaner, vinegar and warm water will work, too. Don’t use a cloth, which will leave small fibers.Since you will have to handle the glass, which could smudge it, you might want to wear gloves of some kind. It will help you avoid getting cut by the edges or smudging the glass as you clean it.

, If you have measured and chosen the new piece carefully, it should fit just right into the frame. If the piece is just slightly too big, you can use sandpaper to gently sand down the edges just enough to make the piece fit. Depending on the frame, it may be designed so the glass fits tightly. You may have to carefully angle or jiggle the glass to get it into place.


If you do need to sand the piece of glass, wear gloves and be sure to sand over a table or counter that can be easily wiped up. Use a wet paper towel to wipe up the glass dust.

, Put the picture back into the frame. If the frame has any type of cardboard insert, place this in next. Put the back in place and secure it with the clips, if the frame has them.

Define what your bar will be used for.,
Choose a theme.,
Decide your budget.,
Install your appliances.,
Install lighting.,
Consider installing storage options.,
Buy furniture.,
Find posters, art, photography and/or wallpaper that match your theme.,
Stock your bar.,
Add additional décor elements.",How to Decorate a Bar," Chances are that if you have installed a bar, remodeled your home or dedicated a space, you have a general idea about the bar's use. Decide if it will be a wet bar, a coffee bar or a breakfast bar before you start to decorate.;
, Although it is not required, many people like to decorate in themes. The following are common bar theme ideas:


A wine bar. If wine is your drink of choice, then you may be acquainted with the special equipment needed to keep wine in perfect condition. You will need to consider cool storage, wine racks and safe glass storage. Classic Tuscany, contemporary Napa Valley and the Mediterranean coast of France are all places that inspire décor choices in a wine bar.
A tiki bar. This kitschy look is playful and fun for both adults and children. Bar elements are often made of bamboo or wicker, rather than traditional wood. Depending upon your budget and desire, you can be as subtle or daring as you want, with a few South Pacific accents or with a faux straw roof and coconuts.
An English pub-inspired bar. If you love British culture, sports and/or traditional elements then a pub environment is comfortable and classic. Accent dark wood with comfortable armchairs, keg taps, pint glasses and empire-themed décor.
A family/recreation room bar. If your whole family will be using the bar, then create a beverage center that has fun in mind. Decorate with posters, vacation photos and storage for every type of glass and drink.
A cafe-themed bar. Your bar may be inside, but you can give it the feeling of a street-side cafe in Paris, Florence or Prague. Choose a European country and look for décor in those languages. Purchase cafe tables and chairs, a chalkboard menu, flowers, an espresso machine and coffee cups.
Other possible bar themes include poker, sports teams, disco, ice cream bar, library or travel.

, It is a good idea to have a figure and price out all the options before making any purchases. For example, you should know whether you have enough money for a custom wine cooler, or if you should buy a mini-fridge.

, If you want to have a large bar, then you should consult an electrician about what is required to wire appliances, such as a refrigerator, cooler, dishwasher and outlets, into the area. Measure the free areas and go shopping for appliances that fit into small bar spaces.

, This step may also require help from an electrician. Your theme will have bearing on what type of lighting you choose.


For example, English pubs are known for their low lighting. A cafe or sports-themed bar may need bright lighting for use during the day and night. A romantic wine bar may require adjustable lighting for entertaining a group or a date.
There are generally 3 types of home lighting: ambient, task and accent. Ambient lighting provides the general lighting in the room, usually from large central fixtures. Task lighting may be required right above the work station or sink, but be distracting above a relaxed seating area. Accent lighting can draw light toward memorabilia, ceilings and art because small lights direct the eye to those areas.

, If your bar is filled with storage, then this might not be necessary; however, think of where you will store glasses, shakers, cutlery, wine openers, condiments and more. If you install cabinets, choose a wood that matches your bar and theme.

, If you want people to sit at your bar, then buy bar stools that match the theme and are the correct height. Other furniture options include cafe tables, armchairs or a bench.


You can place your furniture so that it faces the bar or faces away. If you plan to have a television nearby, you may want to turn armchairs away from the bar to create a comfortable place to watch a sports match.

, If you have a small space, then wallpaper the area between the cabinets and bar to create a feeling of a separate room. Frame your art and posters and hang them on the walls near the bar.

, The following are things that are important to serve drinks to people, but they also add to your style:


Buy glassware that matches the drinks you plan to serve. Most cocktails, wines and beers have a specific type of glass that is used in a bar. Invest in the right glasses for your favorite drinks.
Buy stirrers that match your theme. If you plan to serve cocktails, then you can find stirrers in almost any theme through party supply stores. You may want to provide coasters and napkins in the same theme.
Buy dishes that match your décor, if you plan to serve food. A cafe theme may have simple white plates, while a wine bar may opt for cheese trays and non-traditional shapes.
Buy drinks for your bar. Display fancy bottles of wine in an easily visible rack. Buy creative taps online or display your hard alcohol on a fancy bar cart.

, Choose books, knick-knacks, candles, vases, plants, trays, photo frames, a telephone, mirrors, flowers or other elements that match your style.

Work from either side.,
Pull away the top and bottom bars.,
Slide the side bars off.,
Separate the backing and the plexiglass.",How to Take Apart a Picture Frame1," Slide bar poster frames can be disassembled from the front or back of the frame, but either way, you need to work carefully to avoid damaging the plexiglass front.;
, Pinch the top bar between your fingers and pull it straight out. Repeat with the bottom bar, as well.


These slide bars are usually made from plastic and only held on by pressure. As such, you should be able to pull them off the sides of the frame without the use of additional tools.

, Grab one of the side bars with your fingertips and slide it along the edge of the frame until it completely comes off. When finished, repeat this step with the other side bar, too.


You may also be able to pull these two side bars off the frame in the same way you pulled off the top and bottom bars. Since the side bars are usually longer than the top and bottom ones, however, it might be easiest to slide them off instead of pulling them off.

, Once the slide bars are gone, only the cardboard backing and plexiglass front should remain. You should be able to simply lift one away from the other to finish taking apart the frame.


Note that if there's a picture inside the frame, you can remove it after separating the backing and plexiglass.

Group cleaning supplies together.,
Transfer bulk items to manageable sizes.,
Use laundry baskets to separate clothes.,
Label everything.,
Place a bowl or jar near the washer.,
Build up.,
Put your ironing board away.",How to Decorate A Laundry Room1," Separate your must-have cleaning items into different types, like pre-wash or treatment items, stain-removing items, and post-wash items. Organize them in their own containers for quick access and to prevent damage if something leaks out.;
, Buying in bulk can ease the financial strain associated with your chores, so divide dry items into smaller, refillable containers. They have a better appearance, and you will know when it’s time to replace them., Store these in open spaces to allow the laundry to breathe. This will keep your laundry from mildew and other odors. Line your baskets with cloth bags that you can occasionally wash so they can stay fresh.

, The best way to access what you need is to know what you are looking at.Even if you know what something is by looking at it, your brain still takes a moment to register it, or you might be distracted. Save your brain for thinking matters, like how to remove specific stains.


Label your cleaning supplies with the same symbols that you find on clothing tags for easier reference.Use small chalkboard labels for containers that house a hodgepodge of rotating items.

, Change and other small knick-knacks can collect in pants pockets, and having a small pile of junk can throw off a perfectly organized shelf. A vintage jar can add a nice minor source of inspiration and collect that wayward shrapnel., If you have the resources to create custom cabinetry, mix up drawers and shelves so you can store a larger number of items. If you don’t have those resources, search out shelves that you can build up to maximize your walking space.


Shelves can also be installed from above, which keeps the floor open and doubles as an area to hang dry.

, The ironing board is a hefty item that can easily take up space. Luckily, it can fit easily in narrow nooks behind your appliances. Alternatively, hang it up. Whichever you decide, keep your iron and a bottle of distilled water in the same area.

Look at the back of the frame.,
Cut away the dust cover, when applicable.,
Bend or turn the brads up.,
Remove the cardboard backing.",How to Take Apart a Picture Frame2," Set the frame down so that it lies flat on your working surface. Make sure that the back of the frame faces you and the glass front points downward.

, Some frames of this style have a back dust cover made with flimsy paperboard. Remove the cover by slicing it away with a box cutter or craft blade.Slide the point of the blade in between the paperboard and the frame itself. Carefully move the blade around the entire perimeter of the frame until it comes free. Working in this manner protects the contents of the frame while also making it possible to reuse the paperboard.
If you don't wish to reuse the paperboard, you could remove it by slicing into the cover from above it. Press as lightly as possible so that you just barely slice into the paperboard without touching the contents beneath it. You can either cut away the entire cover in this manner or tear away the paperboard by working from the hole you just created.

, Locate the brads along the sides of the frame. Bend the brads up or turn them in place until they no longer cover the backboard.


The number of brads will vary depending on the size and quality of the frame. Small frames may only use one brad on one or two sides of the frame, but larger frames will have brads on all four sides. Some may even have multiple brads on each side.
Test the brad to determine how you must remove it. Flimsy brads that do not rotate should be bent backward and away from the cardboard backing. Sturdy brads that do rotate should be rotated away from the backing.
Note that some brads might seem too sturdy to bend but too stationary to rotate. Carefully loosen the screw holding these brads in place by twisting it once or twice with a flat-head screwdriver. Once the screw is loose (but not removed), you should be able to rotate the brad away from the backing.

, Once the brads have been cleared away, you should be able to lift the backing straight out using only your hands.


Any existing picture can be lifted straight out, as well.
If you choose to do so, you can also remove the front glass or plexiglass through the back opening of the frame at this time.

"
"
Turn the frame over.,
Cut off the dust cover.,
Remove the staples.,
Lift away the cardboard backing.",How to Take Apart a Picture Frame3," You won't be able to take the frame apart while looking at it from the front, so flip it over to the back. Set the frame down on a flat working surface to make the disassembly process easier to complete.

, Most stapled frames have a back dust cover made of brown paperboard. Use a box cutter to carefully cut away the dust cover, working carefully to avoid damaging the rest of the frame components.If you want to reuse the paperboard cover, slide the box cutter blade beneath the paperboard and work it around the entire perimeter of the frame. Doing so should cut the adhesive without cutting into the cover itself.
Alternatively, if you don't care about preserving the paperboard, you can carefully cut into it from the front of the cover. Make a shallow slice into the surface of the paperboard to avoid damaging the contents beneath it, then cut or tear away the rest of the cover.

, Locate all of the staples around the inside perimeter of the frame. Pull the staples out of the frame using staple remover.In the absence of a staple remover, use a flat-head screwdriver and pliers to remove the staples. Slide the head of the screwdriver beneath each staple until it starts lifting away from the frame, then grab the center top of the staple with your pliers and lift it straight out.
Discard the staples upon removal. You'll need to fit the frame with new staples if you wish to reuse it.

, Once the staples are gone, you should be able to lift the backing away from the frame without the use of additional tools.


Save the backing for later if you plan to reuse the frame.
If the frame currently holds another picture, you'll also need to lift the picture out of the frame immediately after removing the backing. You can usually lift the front glass out, as well, if you wish to do so.

"
"
Flip the frame.,
Remove the wire mounts.,
Carefully lift away the spring clips.,
Unscrew one set of corner mounts.,
Slide the loose side out of the assembly.,
Remove the backboard.",How to Take Apart a Picture Frame4," Place the frame glass-side down on top of a flat working surface. The back of the frame and all its associated hardware should face you.

, If the picture currently has a hanging wire or wire mounts attached to the back, you may need to remove them before disassembling the rest of the frame.


You should be able to remove the wire mounts without clipping the wire off.
Locate the screw in each wire mount. Loosen the screw with a flat-head screwdriver, then carefully lift it and the corresponding mount off the back of the frame.
Set aside the hardware for later if you plan to reuse the frame.

, The spring clips are metal bars located beneath the top and bottom of the frame. They hold the contents of the frame to the front using tension, and you'll need to remove them to loosen those contents.Slip the head of a flat-head screwdriver or awl beneath the cutout area at the end of each spring clip. Press down on the end of the clip to loosen the tension, then gently drag the clip out from beneath the frame.
Work carefully as you remove these clips. Since they are spring-loaded, they can pop toward you and may cause injury if they do.

, Choose one side of the frame, then unscrew the corner mounts on either end of that side.


In most cases, you can choose any of the four sides. It might be easiest to choose either the top or bottom, though, rather than the right or left side.
You'll need to remove both corner mounts connected to your chosen side. Remove the screws with a flat-head screwdriver, then lift the loosened mount away from the frame. Set the hardware aside for later if you plan to reuse the frame.
Since the edges of these corner mounts can be sharp, you may want to wear gloves while handling them.

, Once the metal corner brackets are loosened and removed, you should be able to slide your chosen side away from the rest of the frame without the use of additional tools.


Grab the side with your hand and lift it straight away from the rest of the assembly. The remaining three sides of the frame should stay intact.
Set aside the loosened side in a safe area until you're ready to reassemble the frame.

, Slide the backboard out of the frame by lifting it straight out of the newly opened side.


You can also remove any existing picture and glass from the frame while removing the backboard. Slide each of these components out through the open side.

Paint one or more walls.,
Accessorize the wall.,
Add music.,
Spread soft, thick rugs around.,
Add tools to repair clothes.,
Provide a space to hang clothes.,
Decorate your ironing board if it stays visible.",How to Decorate A Laundry Room2," An accent wall used effectively will make your room feel bigger.For a fun touch, avoid traditional colors in favor of pastel shades or bright, energetic hues. Greens and blues, for instance, tend to be more soothing. Don’t rule out painting the ceiling a light color if you are looking to make the room feel airier and open., Round mirrors help create a bigger effect in a small room. If possible, try to leave up to 9 inches of empty space on each side so that the wall also stays open.Consider using a functional accessory like a cork board to rotate children’s art as well as to store quick reference guides for stains.

, Folding laundry can be very time consuming, and music can be a welcome distraction. Consider incorporating a Bluetooth-enabled portable speaker so you can stream podcasts or books on tape, as well.

, Standing in one space while treating multiple garments or folding a family-sized load of laundry can put strain on your feet and back. Find a nice-looking, comfortable rug or mat to use for these projects. If it will be a permanent fixture, find one that is water-resistant.

, Keep thread, needles, sewing scissors, a tape measure, and other mending supplies nearby. Make a sewing machine accessible to quickly repair a seam or hem pants., For clothes that must hang dry or that wrinkle easily, you will want to have a space to hang them. Most laundry rooms have a small closet, but if they don’t, narrow drying racks can usually fit into tight spaces.


Hang on to plastic hangers, but return clunky wire hangers to the cleaner.
If you're short on space, you can make a drying rack that folds out of the wall.

, If your ironing board hangs in view, give it a nice new cover. This is a simple way to add a pattern or another pop of color that complements the rest of your color theme."

Remove hanging hardware.,
Clean your surfaces.,
Apply the strips.,
Affix the picture to the wall.,
Wait one hour.",How to Hang Pictures Without Nails1," Adhesive picture hanging strips need flat surfaces to work properly, so remove any protruding hanging hardware that has been installed on the back of the picture.This includes nails, screws, wires, keyhole or sawtooth fasteners, or anything else that could make the back surface of the picture uneven.


Adhesive picture hanging strips (as well as adhesive nails and hooks) can be found in office supply stores, craft stores, hardware stores, and online.;
, Adhesive picture hanging strips require a clean surface to stick properly, so wipe down your picture and the wall where you’re going to hang it with a clean cloth and isopropyl alcohol.Allow the surfaces to dry before applying the strips.

, For each set of strips, press the two different sides together. One set at a time, remove one liner and press the adhesive to the back of the picture. Continue pressing for 30 seconds. Repeat until the required strips have been applied.









One set of strips will hold up to three pounds (1.36 kg), and most 8x10-inch (20x28 cm) pictures. If you only need a single set of strips, position it at the top center of the picture.
Two sets of strips will hold up to six pounds (2.7 kg), and most 11x17-inch (28x44 cm) pictures. Position one set of strips at each top corner of the picture.
Four sets of strips will hold up to twelve pounds (5.4 kg), and most 18x24-inch (46x61 cm) pictures. Position one set of strips at each top corner of the picture; position another set on each side of the picture, two-thirds of the way down from the top., First, remove the liner on the outside of the strips to reveal the adhesive. Then, press the picture against the wall. Slowly separate the strips on the picture from those on the wall by gently pulling on the bottom corners of the picture and lifting. With your fingers, press the strips against the wall for 30 seconds.







, This allows all the adhesive on the strips to set and dry. When the hour is up, replace the picture back onto the wall by lining up the strips.

Purchase your supplies and gather your pictures.,
Measure each picture and transfer measurements to the parchment paper.,
Cut out each parchment paper shape and then hang it on the wall.,
Leave map in place when you place/drill hangers into the wall.",How to Map out Where to Hang Pictures," You will need to have every framed picture you plan to hang on the wall in front of you before you create your map.


Buy a long roll of parchment paper and painter’s tape. Although you can pick up both supplies at a local craft store, you could also find these items at a hardware or even a drugstore.
Locate a very sharp pair of scissors, a pencil and a measuring tape. You will be measuring the pictures and then transferring the measurements to the parchment paper, which will be cut out.;
, Be as precise as possible in order to get an accurate idea of how each picture will appear on the wall.


Write down each measurement and then re-measure on the parchment paper. Use the pencil to create the shape on the paper.
If you don’t want to write the measurements and then transfer them, consider running your measurement tape along the side of the picture, locking it in place and then tracing it while holding it down on the parchment paper.

, You may want to first get every shape cut out before hanging it on the wall to create your map.


Secure each end of the paper down on the wall using painter’s tape. That way, when you remove the tape it won’t remove any of the paint or drywall.
Pretend the parchment shapes are your actual pictures as you hang them on the wall. Use a level to ensure each shape is not crooked.
Consider either putting the picture name or printing out a picture on computer paper to place on each parchment shape. That way, you can get an even better idea of flow between photographs/artwork.

, Parchment paper clears away easily so even if you drill through it, you will still have no problem removing the paper.


Consider leaving the parchment paper in place if the shape is slightly smaller than the real thing. Not only will the parchment act as a map, it can also protect your walls from scratches generated by the picture frames. If the parchment is a little too large, simply trim the edges while it is still hanging.

Clean your wall.,
Prepare the adhesive.,
Affix the adhesive hook or nail to the wall.,
Wait an hour for the adhesive to dry.",How to Hang Pictures Without Nails2," Like picture hanging strips, adhesive hooks and nails require clean surfaces, so wipe down the wall with a clean cloth and isopropyl alcohol, then let it dry.


Adhesive hooks or nails have adhesive backings that stick to walls, so that you can mount pictures using the hanging hardware attached to the picture. Depending on the hardware on your picture, make sure you purchase the appropriate adhesive hanging equipment.

, Remove the liner from the adhesive strip and affix it to the hook or nail.


Some adhesive hooks come with the adhesive already affixed to the back. Skip this step and move on to the next if that’s the case with the adhesive hook you have.

, First, remove the liner from the back of the adhesive that’s attached to your hook or nail. In the place where you want your picture hung, firmly press the adhesive hook or nail against the wall for 30 seconds., When the hour is up, hang your pictures normally based on the hanging hardware installed.


Make sure you know the weight of your picture before you purchase adhesive nails, as they generally only hold between five and eight pounds (2.26 and 3.6 kg), while smaller hooks may only hold one or two pounds (0.45 or 0.9 kg).
To hang a picture that’s heavier than what your adhesive nails or hooks are rated for, use more than one. Ensure the weight gets distributed evenly by using a level during installation.

"
"
Choose your hooks.,
Install your hooks.,
Hang your picture.",How to Hang Pictures Without Nails3," There are several brands that make hooks that are designed to be inserted into drywall without hammers, nails, or any other tools. These include Hercules Hooks, Super Hooks, Monkey Hooks, and Gorilla Hooks.They are made of different materials and rated to hold varying weights, but each one does require making a small hole in the wall. According to the manufacturers:


A Hercules Hook can hold as much as 150 pounds (68 kg).
A Super Hook can hold up to 80 pounds (36.28 kg).
A Monkey Hook can hold up to 35 pounds (15.87 kg).
A Gorilla Hook can hold as much as 50 pounds (22.67 kg).

, Push the long, curved (not kinked), tapered end of the hook through your drywall. Once you’ve pushed it most of the way in, position it so the small hook on the outside will be facing upright (so that you can hang things from it). Set it in place by pushing it in the rest of the way., Most press-in hooks come in packs of four or more. To hang heavier pictures using two hooks, measure the width of the picture and divide it into thirds. Place one hook at the one-third mark, and a second hook at the two-thirds mark. For even heavier pictures that require three hooks, measure the picture and divide it into quarters. Place one hook at the one-quarter mark, one hook in the center (two-quarters), and one hook at the three-quarter mark.

"
"
Select your adhesive.,
Prepare the wall.,
Prepare your picture.,
Mount your picture.",How to Hang Pictures Without Nails4," Double-sided tape will work to affix lightweight pictures to walls, though it’s not necessarily designed for that job and may strip paint when it comes off. Reusable adhesive, also known as sticky tack or poster tack, is designed to affix lightweight pictures to walls, but it can get gummy over time and be difficult to remove.


Reusable adhesives and tapes are strong enough to hold loose pictures or posters (not in a frame), but are not designed to hold much more than one pound (0.45 kg).
Single-sided tape can be converted into makeshift double-sided tape by taking a strip of tape, making it into a loop with the adhesive side out, and fastening the ends of the tape together to close the loop.

, Adhesives will work best with clean surfaces, so wipe down your wall with a clean cloth and isopropyl alcohol. While waiting for that to dry, wipe down the back of your poster or picture with a clean, dry cloth.


Wash your hands before handling reusable adhesive to prevent transferring dirt or oil onto it., Lay your picture face down on a flat surface. Press small balls of reusable adhesive or small squares of double-sided tape to the corners of your picture (on the back of the picture). If you’re hanging a larger picture, frame the back outside edge with adhesive or tape.

, Once you’ve got your tape or adhesive in place, pick up the picture, line it up on the wall, and press it against the wall to affix the adhesive or tape to the wall.

Find existing wall fixtures.,
Tie on your string.,
Hang your pictures.",How to Hang Pictures Without Nails5," Look for hooks, screws, vents, or knobs that are already in place and that could bear a few extra pounds. Note that this method will be most appropriate for lightweight pictures that aren’t in frames.


Look for wall features that are out of the way and that could have a string run between them without posing a strangulation risk.

, Cut a length of string, twine, or wire that’s long enough to span the distance between the two wall fixtures, plus some extra for tying knots. Tie each end of the string to a separate wall fixture. You can either pull the string taut or leave it slightly loose and droopy.


A taut string will look more rigid and uniform, while a droopy string will look more relaxed and artistic. The choice between the two is a matter of aesthetic preference.
Wire will be harder to tie than string or twine (it will be easier to wrap it tightly around your fixture than tie it), will provide an industrial look, and will allow pictures to slide around for quick re-positioning. Wire is thin and strong, but doesn't lend itself to the droopy look.
Twine and string will be easy to tie, can be left droopy or pulled taut, and will provide a more rustic look.Twine will be thicker than wire or string, but stronger than string. String will be thinner than twine, but not as strong.

, Use clothespins or clips to affix your pictures to the string.If your string begins to sag more than it's supposed to or the knots won't stay tied, you may have too much weight. Either use stronger twine or wire, or tie a second string to different fixtures for a second row of pictures.


To distribute weight and pictures evenly, place your first picture in the center of the string using your eye or a tape measure. Using the first picture as the center point that separates two halves, divide those halves in half again, and place one picture at each center point. Continue dividing your spaces in half and using the center points as picture locations until all your pictures are hung.

Start small and make changes over time.",How to Decorate," You can tailor your décor and your research based on 1 of these common styles, or a mix of a few.


Country. French Country and Americana both use rustic accessories with an emphasis on natural and painted wood. Furniture and accessories are weathered, but you can use white, pastels or more vibrant reds.






Minimalist. Unlike most other styles, the minimalist decorator wants a clean space with a few focal points. The furniture design is more important, because a sleek couch or Lucite coffee table doubles as art.






Retro or vintage. With this style, you want to comb the flea markets for older furniture from any decade you favor. Try 60s kitsch or turn of the century gilded looks. The older the age you want to replicate, the more expensive your vintage purchases are likely to be.






Contemporary. Take minimalist style and throw in some comfortable accents. Choose 1 bright color to make the room more interesting and plan to make a wall or 2 into an art display.






World Chic. Use Scandinavian, Asian, African or American Indian rugs, throws, vases and accents. A room that is decorated with cultural flair will intrigue guests and showcase your travels. Sophisticated. If you like a classic style, then you probably like white, black and grey with a few splashes of color in between. Use traditional lamps and well-made textiles for an upscale feel. ;
, For example, Country Living magazine is a good place to do research for country décor, while Handful of Salt is a great blog for contemporary decorators.


Get a library card and check out decoration and design books from your local library. Libraries usually carry magazine subscriptions for national magazines, like Country Living or Better Homes and Gardens.







, Go to Pinterest.com and start an account. Create boards for each room of your house.


Look through pins in your decoration style. If you can’t decide what your decoration style is, looking through home décor pins and pinning what you like will help you flesh out your eclectic tastes.







, If you are planning on replacing furniture, rugs and wall paint, make sure you set aside at least $1,000 per room. If you are doing superficial decoration, you can keep a lower budget of $100 to $500.

, Thanks to smart phones and tablets, you can find an application or website to take the guesswork out of decorating a room. The following are good decorating tools: Use the Autodesk Homestyler website if you are planning to remodel, put in new flooring or change walls. Go to homestyler.com.






Download the 3D Room Designer application by Crate & Barrel, if you are in the market for furniture and general décor.






Try to “Arrange a Room” tool from Better Homes and Gardens. This tool works well for trying new furniture and paint colors.







, Write “budget” next to items you want to keep on a low budget and “investment” next to furniture items, art or high quality paint you want to splurge on., If you like to work on home projects, then embellish curtains, make accent pillows or paint used furniture. You will save money and the décor will feel unique. , There are some general rules you should follow when picking wall and ceiling paint.


Use white or off-white colors, if you want the room to look large and bright.






Try an accent wall. If you want a certain wall to showcase a fireplace, piece of art or piece of furniture, paint a single wall a different color.






Use wallpaper in place of paint, if you want a pattern in your room. You can use the wallpaper on a single accent wall or on the entire room. Remember that painting or wallpapering a whole room can make it feel smaller.






Buy a paint that has primer and paint in the product. Although it is more expensive it’s likely to last longer.







, Replacing carpet or laying down wood/laminate flooring is a big job. Consider hiring professionals to make sure it’s done right.


Laminate flooring looks like hardwood flooring, but it is much less expensive and easier to install.






Consider an area rug, whether you like your hardwood or carpet, buying a large area rug can instantly change the look of a room. It can also protect the floor in high traffic areas.






Go to a home improvement store, like Home Depot. Choose a type of carpet you like and ask them to finish the edges for you. You can customize your area rug at half the price.






Don’t overdo it. If you decided to paint walls a color other than white or if you used wallpaper, you should consider going with a more neutral flooring choice.







, If possible, put extra time and money into pieces of furniture that you use a lot, like a couch, armchair or dining room table. These can be “investment pieces” that will add comfort and style to the room.


The architecture and design magazine Dwell has a guide about how to pick the right sofa for your style. Go to Dwell.com and search for “shop for a sofa.”






Shop Ikea or Target for accent pieces, like bedside tables, TV consoles and shelves. You can always paint these smaller pieces to accent your home.







, You can buy expensive art and have it framed, or you can make the art yourself.


Instead of buying a piece of art, find several images that compliment each other. Frame them in vintage frames, and then place them together on a wall.






Consider using a decal or a painted design in place of framed art. If you rent your space, then a customized wall decal may work the best. Use it on a clean white wall.






Keep some walls blank, and don’t be afraid to put wall hangings on the same wall. Art should accent your space and provide a focal point.

, Pillows, throws, curtains, ottoman, wine racks and knick-knacks are your final step. Use mirrored trays or hanging mirrors if you want your space to look larger.


Add a floor lamp for some mood lighting. You can find them at Ikea or through stores like Pottery Barn and Home Depot.
Keep a favorite vase filled with fresh or fake flowers. Just like other décor, flower arrangements can be done in almost any decoration style.

, You can always add more. Decorating is a process, best done over time, rather than all at once.


If your budget is small, replace furniture, lighting and flooring in steps, until you achieve your final look.

Decorate popsicle sticks.,
Glue the popsicle sticks together to form your frame.,
Decorate the frame.,
Attach your pictures.,
Add a magnet to the back.,
Finished!








",How to Make a Photo Frame2," You'll need six or seven large popsicle sticks for the best look, but you can also use smaller sticks. Cover them with washi tape or other patterned tape, or decorate them with markers, colored pencils, or paint.








, Lay two sticks down vertically, about five inches apart, and glue a decorated stick horizontally across the top. Glue the next decorated stick adjacent to the first, being careful not to let any glue show through the crack. Continue until the two vertical sticks are completely hidden by the decorated sticks.








, Glue wooden shapes, beads, paper, buttons, ribbon, or anything else you like to the front of the frame.








, Smaller pictures work better for this frame -- using a wallet-sized photo leaves room for more decoration, making both the picture and the frame look good. Use glue, tape, or a push pin to attach your pictures to the frame.








, Glue a strong magnet to the back of the frame, centered horizontally and near the top, so that you can hang the picture on your fridge or anywhere else magnetic.









You can use a hook instead of a magnet if you prefer, but the small size and light weight of this frame makes it a perfect addition to your fridge or school locker.

Gather 4, 8, or 12 sticks.,
Prepare the sticks.,
At one corner, lash the sticks together with twine.,
Glue the picture to the back of the frame.,
Glue a piece of twine to the top of the frame to use for hanging.,
Finished!








",How to Make a Photo Frame3," The number will depend on how thick you want the frame. They should be about a foot long and 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 inch (0.6 to 1.3 cm) in diameter. Choose sticks that are relatively straight and free of knobs, forks, or other unsightly features.








, Make sure they're all the same length, about 11 inches (27.9 cm) long. Remove any leaves or branches. Wash the sticks if they're dirty. Then divide the sticks into four groups (of 1, 2, or 3), and lay each group of sticks out to form the frame, with one group of sticks along each side of the picture.









Lay the sticks in each group next to each other rather than bunched on top of each other to create a wider frame.
Make sure your picture will fit in the rectangle at the center of the sticks you've laid out.

, Use a hot glue gun to glue one end of the twine to the back of one corner of the frame (You can also use hot glue to initially fix sticks in batches together). Bring the twine diagonally across the front of the corner. Then bring it horizontally across the back of the intersection. Bring it diagonally across the front again -- this time it should fill in the other diagonal (so if the first time you went top right to bottom left, this time you'll go bottom right to top left). Wrap it across the back vertically this time. Again, wrap diagonally, and then horizontally, and then diagonally, and then vertically. At this point the front of the corner should show two wraps of the twine across each diagonal, so the twine should form a thick X. The back should have one wrap along each side of the intersection, so the twine in the back should form a thin square. Secure the end of the twine with hot glue.









Keep the sticks on each side flat and close together. Make sure the twine is tight throughout the knot so that the sides of the frame are secure.
If you want to experiment with other looks, try any lash to tie the corners. Try out a square or diagonal lash, or experiment with one of your own.Repeat this for the other three corners. When finished, you should have a strong and secure frame.

, Trim the photo to fit, if necessary. If you don't want to glue directly onto the photo, or if you want to be able to change the picture in the frame, glue a larger piece of paper to the back of the frame instead. Attach this piece of paper on three sides and slip the photo in through the gap on the last side.








, This piece of twine should be six to eight inches long, depending on the size of your frame. Attach it at each of the top two corners, again using a hot glue gun. You'll be able to hang the frame from this handle.

Mount the picture if desired.,
Get two matching wooden slats or square dowels.,
Paint or stain the wood slats or dowels to your desired color.,
Glue the wood to the top and bottom of the picture.,
Attach string to the top piece of wood.,
Finished!








",How to Make a Photo Frame4," You'll be gluing the picture right onto the wooden frame. If you don't want to glue directly onto the picture, or if you want a border around the picture, mount it on, or simply tape it to, a piece of high-quality paper or cardstock.








, Use thin wooden slats about an inch wide, or 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 inch (0.6 to 1.3 cm) square dowels. They should be about an inch longer than the width of the picture.








, With the simplicity of this frame, staining the wood often looks best. However, you can also paint it a solid color or decorate it with paint if you want.








, Center the picture horizontally, and make sure the wood is perfectly straight and level across the top. Glue the wood on top of the picture so that the picture is visible underneath. If you find that you have to cover too much of the picture, use another piece of paper under the picture and glue the wood to that instead.








, Get a piece of string that you will use to hang the picture. It should be 8 to 12 inches (20.3 to 30.5 cm) long, depending on the size of your picture. Screw small hooks into the back of the wood about halfway between the edge of the picture and the edge of the wood. Tie the string onto these hooks.









If you don't want to use hooks, simply hot glue the string to the wood. This will be secure enough, and it won't show from the front of the frame.

Buy or make a basic frame.,
Collect several old magazines or other paper.,
Cut the paper into strips.,
Use a wooden dowel or skewer to roll a strip of paper into a tube.,
When you near the edge of the paper, place glue along the edge to hold the tube together.,
Repeat the above steps to roll enough tubes to cover your frame.,
Cover the basic frame in Mod Podge.,
Lay tubes along the edges of the frame.,
Fill in the frame with tubes.,
Cover the tubes with a layer of Mod Podge.,
Let the frame dry.",How to Make a Photo Frame5," Cut out a piece of cardboard as big as you want the frame to be, and cut out an opening in the middle for your picture. The frame can be as simple or creative as you want - go for the basic rectangle, or cut a large base with windows for two or three different pictures. Add construction paper over the back of each picture window to hold your pictures. Glue the paper on three sides so that you can slide pictures in and out of the frame.









You can also buy a simple wooden frame if you don't want to make one.

, The colors and gloss of magazines make them perfect for this frame, but you can also use old newspaper, cardboard paper, or any other scratch paper you have lying around.








, If you're using magazine pages, simply cut each page in half lengthwise. If you're using newspaper, cut strips about four inches wide and ten inches long.








, Place the dowel at one corner of the paper, at just more than a 45 degree angle to the page. Roll the corner of the paper around the wooden dowel. Keeping the paper tight, use the dowel to roll the paper into a tube.









As you roll, the edges of the dowel will be covered by the paper. Don't lose them, as this will make it harder to get the dowel out of the tube. Simply slide the dowel to one side to make sure you always have enough of a handle sticking out of the rolled paper.

, You can simply put a drop of glue on the opposite corner from where you started; this will hold the whole tube together. However, if you later cut the tube, you risk cutting off the glued part and unraveling the tube. To prevent this, put glue on the whole outer edge of the tube. This way, it will stay rolled no matter when or how you cut it.







, You'll need more than you think, so make sure you roll plenty of tubes before proceeding.








, You can use another glue to hold the paper tubes in place, but Mod Podge tends to be effective, secure, and easy to work with, so it's a great option for this frame.








, This will give the edges a clean, smooth look and feel, and you won't have to worry about perfectly trimming the ends of the other tubes.








, Cut tubes down to size before you attach them, or trim them to fit as you put them in place. For a simple frame, lay all tubes vertically on the frame, one right next to another. This will create a simple, classic look.









Experiment with laying the tubes diagonally or perpendicular to each other, or even use them to create patterns. For example, add a small square of tubes rotated 45 degrees from the rest to create a diamond in the middle of your frame. Bend the tubes to create corners, or let them stick off the edge of the frame. Get creative -- the layout of the tubes will define the look and feel of your frame.
Make sure to place the tubes tightly together so that there are no gaps or holes in the frame.

, When you've finished filling in the frame with tubes, a layer of the matte will act as a glue to keep them together and in place. It will also provide a shell covering that will strengthen the frame and keep it crisp and glossy.








, Once the matte has completely dried, slip your pictures into the frame.

Weigh the picture.,
Clean and dry the wall.,
Choose an adhesive hanger.,
Attach the adhesive picture hook to the wall.,
Hang the picture up.",How to Hang Pictures on Plaster Walls1," For these purposes, a picture is considered light if it weighs 5 lbs (2.25 kg) or less.Also consider the standard humidity of the room when choosing this method. If the room is frequently humid and the walls are often moist, this method will not work well, since moisture will cause the adhesive bond to weaken quicker.;
, Before you attach an adhesive to a plaster wall, you need to clean the surface of the plaster to strip away any oils and dirt. Dry the plaster thoroughly when finished.


Adhesive glue will not stick to a surface that is rough, dirty, or damp.
Thoroughly drying the wall is important for the sake of the adhesive, but plaster is also fairly porous, so mildew and similar problems may develop if you allow it to stay damp. As such, drying the wall after washing it is twice as important.
There are a few different ways you can clean plaster, but the simplest is to use warm water and mild liquid dish soap.Soak a non-abrasive washcloth in warm water, then place a bead of mild soap on the cloth. Work the soap into a small patch of suds on the cloth.
Rub the area of your wall down with your soapy cloth. Scrub gently, using a circular motion.
Rinse the cloth in warm water, then use it to wipe away any soap residue on the wall.
Use a dry non-abrasive washcloth to wipe away all the moisture on your wall, using a circular motion again. Be as thorough as possible.



, A simple adhesive picture hook should be enough to hang a light picture, but these hooks come in different shapes and sizes. When selecting one, look on the front or back of the package to determine whether or not the hook you've chosen is sturdy enough to support the weight of your picture.


Keep in mind the side of the picture loop or wire hanging off the back of the frame. You should try to choose a hook thickness that this loop or wire will be able to fit onto.
Extremely light pictures without frames might hang on the wall will nothing but a piece of double-sided tape. Similarly, moderately light pictures without frames might be able to hang directly on the adhesive square instead of needing a hook. If you want to be on the safe side, though, using the picture hook will still be your best bet under most circumstances.

, One side of the adhesive square should be labeled “wall side,” while the other should be labeled “hook side,” “picture side,” or something similar. Attach the wall side of the adhesive to the wall, then press the hook on the hook side of the adhesive square.


Place one hook on the wall at the location your picture loop or wire will sit.
If your picture hooks are too thick to fit into the hoop hanging off the back of your frame, consider placing two hooks on the wall where the bottom edge of the picture will rest. These two hooks will need to be evenly positioned horizontally, and the space between them should be just a little smaller than the bottom width of the picture.

, Once the hook is in place, all you need to do is rest the picture loop on the back of your frame on the wall hook.


If using two hooks instead of one, you will use these two hooks like a shelf by resting the bottom of the picture on top of them.

Sand the door thoroughly.,
Select a door stain appropriate for the wood.,
Wear protective eyewear and gloves.,
Apply a coat on stain.,
Let the stain set for a recommended time and wipe off with a dry lint-free cloth.,
Apply as many coats as necessary.,
Choose an appropriate urethane finish for the door.,
Use a bristle or foam brush to apply finish.,
Sand off any bristles that appear after the first finish coat.,
Reattach all hardware.",How to Stain Wood Doors," It's important to remove the door and lay it out flat to stain it properly. Most wood doors should be able to be removed fairly easily, without fear of damaging. Don't try to stain doors while they're hanging on the hinges.



To remove the door, pull the pins that hold the hinges together using a screwdriver. Push the pins up until they release the hinge plate on the door, then remove it.;
, To avoid staining the door knobs, knockers, locks, and other hardware, it's important to unscrew everything that's connected to the door and remove it so you can stain the wood and only the wood. Most hardware can be removed by unscrewing a couple of Philips-head screws and should come off quite easily. Keep everything organized so you'll be able to find it later, after the door has been stained.

, It's usually best to set up a sawhorse in a well-ventilated area before you stain it, as flat as possible and preferably at waist-height. Setting a door up on a workbench would be fine, but setting it up on some sawhorses would be even more perfect, if you have access to them.

, If the door is painted or has been stained previously, it's important to sand it thoroughly before you try to stain it. Even if the door hasn't previously been painted, treated, or sanded, it's also good to sand it down to open up the fibers and help it accept the stain more easily.


Use an orbital finish sander or sanding pad with 220-grit sandpaper to sand the door quickly and remove minor imperfections. Always sand with the grain of the wood.
Sometimes it's also common to wipe the door down with tack cloth before applying the stain. Tack cloth is a sticky piece of cheesecloth-like gauze that is yellow in color, helping to remove sawdust and other sediment to clean the surface. Wipe down your project with this and choose an area to stain that is dust free as possible.

, Always use a good quality stain with a petroleum base, such as Minwax, Craftsman, mixing the stain according to the manufacturer's directions. Some people think a gel stain is appropriate for smaller areas, while others prefer poly stains for their versatility. Go to the hardware outlet of your choice and shop around for a color and variety of wood stain that matches the type of wood and the kind of look you're going for with the door.

, When you're handling stain and sanding, it's important to wear protective clothing, gloves, eyewear, and respiration if you're indoors. Avoid getting wood stain in your face or on your skin.


If you're staining in your garage, it's also critical to wear breathing protection and to ventilate the area as much as possible. Take frequent breaks and make sure you're getting enough clean air into your lungs. Stop immediately if you start to feel light-headed.

, Paint the stain onto the wood with the grain, using a lint-free cloth folded into a pad. Paint evenly, with the door laid flat so the stain won't drip down the wood grain and stain at awkward intervals.


After the first light pressure wipes, without adding more stain from can, apply even pressure and wipe three to eight times with the grain. Always go with the grain of wood, and in a singular motion without stopping.
Some wood workers like to apply the initial coat with a brush, then go over the stain while it's still wet with a rag to smooth out the stain and create a more even look. If you're using a poly stain or a gel stain, it's sometimes recommended to use a brush, as opposed to a lint-free cloth. Always defer to the manufacturer's directions and use the appropriate tool and technique for the stain you're using.

, Depending on your project, the wood you're staining, and the variety of stain you're using, you may be ready to finish the stain, or you'll likely want to apply a second, and possibly more coats. If so, it's important to let the stain dry, sand over it with 0000 steel wool or 220 sandpaper, and repeat the staining process.


Use a clean lint-free cloth to wipe off excess stain as you're painting it on, to avoid uneven pools of stain that will form dark spots. As stain dries, a kind of ""peach fuzz"" will form as a result of stain, which you should work off with the steel wool, moving in gentle but even circles with the grain of the wood. Typically, you want to allow six to ten hours of drying time between coats.

, Now, if desired, you may dip your application cloth back into the can of stain, and repeat the process until the desired color is achieved. Continue staining the wood, rubbing down the wood between coats with 0000 steel wool, until you've gotten the stain to the color you like it.


Once you are happy with the look of the wood, leave it alone and stop touching it until it's thoroughly dry. Don't use steel wool or sandpaper or anything. Let it dry for several hours, then clean it up with a clean lint-free cloth.

, Stain colors the wood, but you also need to protect your hard work by applying an exterior urethane finish on the surface of the stain to seal and protect it. Finish comes in flat, semi-gloss or high gloss, and will need to be applied in several coats. Always follow the manufacturer's recommended directions.


Water-based finishes are somewhat more environmentally friendly, but can also result in that ""peach fuzz"" texture that the stain creates as well. Apply the finish using a similar application and buffing process, using the steel wool or sandpaper between coats.
Wipe down the surface with a wet rag. Allow the wood to dry thoroughly before applying finish, sanding it lightly if necessary before you begin.

, Follow the same basic procedure and pattern for applying the finish, using long even strokes and a uniform coat with the brush. Use a cloth to wipe off and smooth out excess finish if necessary.


Read the manufacturer's instructions to find out how long to wait between coats, usually somewhere between two and six hours.

, Apply at least two more coats for a thorough, even finish over the first coat. which will be more heavily sanded than usual for a finish coat. By the time you get to the last coat, you shouldn't be sanding at all.


When you've applied all the coats of finish, let the door dry thoroughly and wipe it down with a clean cloth to make sure it's completely dust free and clean before hanging it back in place.

, If you removed the hardware from the door, reattach it as before ad get your door ready to hang back up in the frame. Have a partner help to hold it in place while you screw the fixtures back in and reinsert the hinge pin into place to complete the job.

Determine where to hang your picture.,
Place painter's tape over the mark.Rip off a small piece of painter's tape and poke a hole in the middle of it using the tip of your pencil.,
Place another bit of tape below the hole.,
Carefully drill a hole into the plaster.,
Hammer an anchor into the wall.,
Fix the screw into your anchor.,
Clean the area.,
Hang up the picture.",How to Hang Pictures on Plaster Walls2," If you're hanging a notably heavy picture, you should locate a stud in the wall and prepare to hang the picture there.For most average, medium weight pictures, though, you should be able to use nearly any space on the wall.


Once you know where you plan on hanging the picture, use a tape measure to determine where the screw will go. Measure where the picture loop is on the back of the frame, then measure out the same dimensions on the wall.
After you have determined where the screw will go, lightly mark that location with an ""X"" using a pencil.

, Place the tape on the wall so that this hole lies over the ""X"" on your wall.


The painter's tape will provide an additional guide for you when you drill the hole into your wall.

, Ripe off a slightly longer strip of painters tape and fold it in half lengthwise, with the non-adhesive side folded in. Stick one half of this tape to the wall, just a little below the ""X.""


The other half of the tape should lie roughly perpendicular to your wall, sticky side up. The adhesive on your mock shelf should catch most of the dust and debris that you'll produce when you drill into the wall, making the clean up process much simpler later on. Strictly speaking, this step is not entirely necessary, but it can be a big help.
This tape shelf should be about 4 inches (10 cm) long or so, and positioned about 2 inches (5 cm) below the hole in your wall.

, Check the instructions on the back of your package of screws and anchors to determine how big the drill bit should be. Then, use this drill bit an an electric drill to drill into the ""X"" on your wall.


For an average set of wall anchors, you will usually need 1 3/16 drill bit.
The drill bit will usually need to be just a fraction smaller than the anchor you plan on using. Again, though, it is best to follow the recommendation on the back of the wall anchor package when selecting the right bit.
The drill will stop moving inward when it hits the end of the plaster. If it starts moving more slowly at some point, you may have hit a layer of lath beneath the plaster. You can drill into this layer slightly without causing much harm, but you should stop drilling once you feel it.
Drill as straight and cleanly as possible. The side of your hole should be the size of your drill bit and no larger.

, Place the anchor directly over the hole in your wall. Tap the anchor into the hole, using just enough force to drive it in without bending the anchor or cracking the wall.


Remove the tape covering your hole before hammering the anchor inside.
If your hole is not large enough, a plastic anchor will bend. If the anchor starts bending, you should take it out and make the hole a little larger. The anchor needs to be snug and straight inside the wall.
Note that the anchor should also be flush with the wall.
Wall anchors consist of a sleeve that expands into the wall once you drive a screw into it. As a result, the screw will sit more securely inside the wall. This sleeve also minimizes the amount of stress put on the plaster.
Plastic anchors are among the most common and will usually suffice for this project. Note that there are also anchors made from fiber, wood, and metal, however, so you have a range of options to choose from., Place the screw in the hole of your anchor and use a screwdriver to wind it in. Do not make the head flush against the wall, though. Instead, let a small portion of the screw stick out.


Since using a screwdriver can require considerable strength, you could opt to use your drill, instead. Make sure that you have the right size drill bit on it and work slowly to prevent the screw from driving too deep into the wall.
The screw should jut out from the wall by about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm).

, Carefully fold up your tape shelf to collect the dust, then remove it completely. Wipe away any stray dust from the wall or floor.


Most of the dust and debris should be on your tape. Fold the tape inward, sealing the dust inside the exposed adhesive. If you work carefully, you might be able to avoid spilling debris anywhere else.
Use a dry cloth the wipe off any dust that does get on the wall and a broom or vacuum to get any debris off the floor.

, The screw should be able to support your picture now. Rest the wire or loop at the back of your photo frame on the portion of the wall screw still sticking out.


This step should complete the process.

Examine the door with your eyes.,
Run a piece of heavy stock paper around the closed door.,
Look for sticking areas as you open or close the door.,
Listen to the hinges.,
Note the time of year.",How to Unstick a Door1," Look for scratches in the paint or any other noticeable damages to the door and frame. Also check for grime or any sticky buildup that may just need to be cleaned. Close the door and run your eyes along the gap between the door and the frame, noting places where the gap is very thin.;
, This is very useful if you can’t determine where the door is sticking by physically examining it. The paper should glide smoothly around most of the door. Wherever the piece of paper gets stuck is the problem area.

, Try closing the door with your hands on the bottom, the side, and the top. This will allow you to feel where there is the most resistance as you close it.

, Squeaking hinges can be causing the door to stick. If you hear this, it indicates that they need to be oiled.

, If the door seems to be only slightly sticking, it is probably caused by changes in humidity. Wood expands when humidity increases, and shrinks when humidity decreases.It is important to understand this, because a door that sticks in the summer may not stick in the winter. In this case, you would try a less drastic solution, such as lightly sanding the door, or else it may be drafty and shrunken come winter.

Rub the problem area with bar soap.,
Run your air conditioner.,
Invest in a dehumidifier.",How to Unstick a Door2," This should reduce the friction and allow the door to close more smoothly. Use a dry, moisturizer-free soap that leaves a powdery residue on the sides of the door.Of course, this is a gentle and temporary solution and will need to be repeated sporadically during times of humidity.

, One of the functions of the AC is to remove excess moisture from the air and decrease the humidity level in your home. While this can be a costly solution, it will help with your sticking doors. As the humidity in your home is lowered, the wood door will shrink in size.

, A dehumidifier works by sucking in air, removing the air’s moisture, and expelling the air back into the room. The main advantage of using a dehumidifier is that it is portable, which allows you to place it close to the sticking door."

Decide if the door hinges are causing the trouble.,
Lay newspaper on the floor.,
Apply petroleum jelly to the hinges.",How to Unstick a Door3," When a door is opened and closed repeatedly, it’s no surprise that they can start to tarnish. Scratches and other superficial damage to the hinge can create friction and cause the door to stick.If you are worried about the lubricant possibly staining the door, you can take the additional step of removing the door from the frame. You can find out how to remove a door from the hinges here.


, Just like the lubricant can stain the door, it can stain your floor. Cover the area directly under the hinges you are working on to prevent any dripping.

, After you’ve done this, open and close the door a few times to work the jelly into the hinge joints.


WD-40 would also have the same helpful effect on your door, but it is messier and dries out faster."
"
Examine the bottom and top of the door as you open and close it.,
Use a screwdriver to tighten each screw.,
Test your handiwork.",How to Unstick a Door4," The door may be sticking near the top or dragging at the floor. If this is the case, the screws in the hinges may have loosened over time., Do not use a drill, because over-tightening the screws can cause damage to the wood and cause bigger problems. Screw it in slowly to make sure you don’t tighten too much.


Hinge screws are known to strip out, so you may have to add a longer screw or plug the hole and then re-screw it.

, You may need to go back and tighten or loosen them. By loosening the screw you will reduce the gap between the door and the frame, and vice versa. Play around with it until it fits perfectly."

Confirm that the problem is not a temporary or more easily-solved problem.,
Mark the spot on the door where it is sticking, and remove the door.,
Use a sharp block plane to trim the door.,
Repaint or refinish the section of door that you have trimmed with the block plane.",How to Unstick a Door5," If you’ve checked that the screws are firmly in the hinges, the hinges are well-oiled, and determined temporary humidity is not the issue, you may need to trim your door. This is an intricate, and permanent, fix., You can find out how to remove a door from the hinges here.It is important to note exactly where the door is rubbing, so that you don’t over trim your door.

, A block plane is a simple woodworking tool that allows you to thinly shave wood.It is perfect for this task, because you can make tiny changes to the width or height of the door without causing oversized gaps between the door and frame.


If you’re an amateur or only have a little wood to remove from your door, you may want to try using a palm sander to do this instead.

, Don’t do this step until you’ve ensured that it is the correct size, or you may have to do it twice. After the paint has dried, your door will be looking- and opening- like it is brand new!

Consider what you intend to hang.,
Find a stud.,
Choose your fastener.,
Prepare your picture.",How to Hang Pictures1," Different items have different requirements and require different approaches to hang properly. The most basic type of wall hanging, the poster, will only require thumbtacks, but other decorations such as large framed portraits and photographs may require more secure fastening methods. Generally speaking, the most reliable way to hang a picture on a wall is from an anchor screw attached to a wall stud, which is what this guide explains how to do. If you are unsure of how you should hang your picture, this method is a good safe bet.;
, A stud is a reinforced part of the wall underneath the plaster and drywall finish that is designed to bear a heavier load than the rest of the wall. Studs are essential for all but the lightest pictures and frames, as hanging heavier objects from plain drywall can cause tears over time. Electronic stud finders are available in any home supply or hardware store. Most are used by pressing them to the wall and running them along it until a stud is found, whereupon the stud finder will beep and/or light up.


Read the instructions for your electronic stud finder carefully. Many stud finders have two sets of indicators: one for studs, and one for live electric wiring. Be sure you know which indicator is which before driving your fastener into the wall.
If you don't want to purchase an electronic stud finder, you can use your hand to estimate where studs are. Rap the wall with your knuckles and listen carefully until you get a very shallow and dull sound from it. That spot is where a stud is hiding. To double-check that you have found a stud and not something else, knock around for other studs. They are normally spaced between 15 and 24 inches from each other. If you are able to discern a regular pattern, it is likely that you have indeed found a stud.

, Assuming you will be using a stud to hang a picture, you will need a type of round headed screw called a drywall anchor. The humble finish nail, which is 1½ to 2 inches (5.1 cm) long and bears up to a few pounds even without a stud, is fine for lighter pictures, but a drywall anchor is the safest choice. There are a variety of other options for smaller pictures available at any hardware store, including various hooks, load-bearing adhesive tape, and more complicated devices like tremor hangers.

, If your picture does not already have a bracket, suspension wire, or other means of hanging from an anchor, you will need to install one. Solid brackets are a good choice, as they will hold a picture more steadily than wire or string if bumped. Attach your bracket well above the center of the frame on the back side, so that gravity will do most of the work of keeping the picture steady.

Position and flatten the next strip of paper on the wall.,
Repeat the positioning and flattening procedures with the remaining two pieces.,
Cut away the overlap at the corners.,
Let dry.",How to Hang Quilts With a Wallpaper Border1," You will need precise measurements for your quilt to determine how big the wallpaper frame needs to be. Measurements that are too short will create excess room in the frame, while measurements that are too long will cause the quilt to overlap onto the wallpaper border.;
, Take the width of the border and add twice that amount the length of your quilt sides to determine the length of your strips. For example, if the wallpaper border is 3 inches (7.6 cm) thick and the quilt sides are each 24 inches (61 cm) long, each strip should be about 30 inches (76.2 cm) long.

, In order to create a frame, the bottom or inside edge of each strip of border must be shorter than the outside edge. Cut into the edge of the strip at a 45 degree angle. The shorter inside edge should match the length of the quilt side it will frame, with 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) of excess space.

, Use a straight edge or a level to keep the border straight and draw the line lightly with a pencil. The sides of the frame should match the length of each side of the quilt.

, Wallpaper border comes pre-pasted and unpasted.Soak rolled up pre-pasted paper, pattern side in, in a tray of lukewarm water.
Lay unpasted paper flat, pattern side down, and apply paste to the back. Work from the inside out toward the edges.

, Match the inside corner of the border to the corner of the pencil line frame.

, Flatten the strip of wallpaper border on the wall, keeping the bottom edge even with the pencil line. Use a smoothing brush after flattening it to remove any bubbles beneath the paper., The bottom inside corner should match the corner of the pencil line frame. Some paper should overlap onto the first strip. Flatten the border out in the same way you flattened the first.

, Each corner should have about 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) of overlap.

, Use a sharp razor to carefully slice away the overlap without cutting through the bottom layer of paper.

, The wallpaper frame should be complete, but you should let it dry before attempting to hang the quilt.

Find the right height.,
Estimate where your picture will hang.",How to Hang Pictures2," Plan to hang most of your pictures at roughly eye level for a pleasing effect. The center of your picture should usually end up between 57 and 60 inches from the ground. Measure it out with a tape measure and lightly mark the proper height with a pencil.


Feel free to adjust the center height of your pictures based on your own height or the height of the room you are decorating. These numbers are only a guideline.

, Hold your picture up so that its center point is directly over the spot you marked with a pencil and ensure you like how it looks there. If you feel that it should be raised or lowered, do so. Once you have made a final decision, measure from the center of the picture to the top edge of the frame and note the height. Next, measure down from the top of the frame to the hanging bracket or wire on the back of the frame. Subtract this small measurement from the frame height measurement to determine where on the wall you should insert your anchor so that the center of the picture will be at the desired height.


If your picture has a wire hanger, pull the wire up towards the top of the frame until it is taut before measuring, since this is where the wire will be once it is hung on the anchor.

, Again, this is easiest with a power drill and a screwdriver tip, but a manual screwdriver can also be used. Set the point of the anchor screw into the hole you made and screw it into the wall. It will thread into the stud, creating a strong hanger for your picture. Once the anchor is set, continue screwing it until it is an appropriate length from which to hang your picture.

, If it slips off easily, unscrew the anchor a bit and try again. If there is a gap between the top of the frame and the wall, screw the anchor in a little more and try again. Once the picture hangs securely and flatly against the wall, no further adjustments to the anchor are needed.

, Set a level on top of the frame and gently adjust the picture until the level reads flat and even. Step back and enjoy the way your new picture hangs on the wall. Be sure to clean up any tools and debris afterward.

Don't stress studs too much.,
Plan ahead.,
Add interest by experimenting with layouts.",How to Hang Pictures4," When making a wall montage or gallery of pictures, it is unlikely that all of them will be so large as to require a stud. Plan to hang the largest picture or two on studs; once those positions have been established, the smaller pictures can be built around them.

, To ensure evenly spaced pictures, measure the distance between each picture's position in a group with a measuring tape before you actually hang any of them, and adjust as needed. Use square sticky notes to easily mark the corner positions of the pictures you plan to hang without making a mess of pencil smudges on the wall, and adjust these until you have an evenly-spaced layout.

, Three pictures of the same size can hang side by side to create a continuous, running effect; six or seven pictures of varying sizes can hang at different heights to define an overall space. Be adventurous and try a various different arrangements to see what creates the effect you like best. Remember to avoid hanging pictures so high or low that they seem out of place.


Work with the pictures you have. Several small pictures won't look good hung sparsely on walls by themselves across three rooms, but might look great on short walls or in concert with each other across a larger swath. Pictures that are wider than they are tall open up options that would never work with portrait-oriented pictures alone. Trust your judgment and experiment until you find the best way to display the pictures you have.
Tall furniture, shelving, lighting, and windows should all be taken into account when designing a spread of multiple hanging pictures. Very often, these elements already suggest some sort of definition for the remaining free wall space near them. Work with them rather than around them, and you will be creating a space that is uniquely and distinctively your own.

Use fans to move air around.",How to Stop Condensation on Windows," A hygrometer is a device that measures moisture levels in the air. Since condensation forms when warm moisture in the air collects on a cold surface, such as a window, tracking the humidity level in your house can help you stop condensation. When the moisture levels in the house get too high, take steps to reduce the humidity.


When the temperature outside is below 0 F (-18 C), keep the humidity in your house between 15 and 25 percent.
When the temperature outside is between 0 and 40 F (-18 and 4 C), keep the humidity inside between 25 and 40 percent.;
, One of the best ways to get humidity out of your house is to vent it outside through exhaust fans. Using exhaust fans is important in certain rooms and with certain appliances that produce moisture.Use bathroom vents and fans when you're bathing. Run them for at least 20 minutes after your shower.
Use kitchen and stove fans when you're cooking. Run them for about 15 minutes after you finish cooking.
Make sure your dryer vents to the outside for when you're doing laundry.
A gas fireplace must have a chimney that vents outside, and you should always keep the damper open when you're having a fire in a wood burning fireplace.

, Indoor plants can be great in your home, but if you have trouble with condensation, you should keep them outside whenever possible. This is because plants produce moisture, so keeping them inside can exacerbate condensation issues.


If you have a sun room that stays dry, you can also keep your plants there., Another cause of excess moisture in the house is clothing that hasn’t been dried in a drier. If you must line dry your clothes, take them outside to prevent water from evaporating off the clothes and adding excess moisture to the air inside.


If you must line dry clothes inside, keep them in a well-ventilated room, and open a door or window., Some of the most significant contributors to moisture in your home include showers/bathing and cooking. When you shower or bathe, close the door to the bathroom to keep steam and moisture from escaping into the rest of the house. When cooking, close doors to the kitchen to keep moisture contained.


When you are cooking or bathing in a closed off room, open windows to help remove the moisture., Another great way to contain moisture when you're cooking is to use lids that will keep liquids inside the pans and pots. This is especially important when you're steaming and boiling food.


When you do remove the lid from your dishes, do so in front of an open window, and make sure the exhaust vent is running.

, Humidifiers are designed to add more moisture to the air in your house, so they will cause more condensation to form on your windows. When you're experiencing moisture problems, turn off all the humidifiers in your house, including ones that are attached to the furnace., On the other hand, dehumidifiers are designed to remove moisture from the air, so these are ideal devices if your home is prone to condensation. You can either install a whole-home dehumidifier, or invest in a portable one that you can move around the house.Empty the drip pan or basin on the dehumidifier regularly to prevent that moisture from evaporating back into the air.

, Managing the temperature inside your house is an important part of controlling condensation. Condensation can only form if there's a cold surface where the moisture can pool, so keeping windows and walls warm is essential. During the cooler months, use your furnace to increase the temperature, especially if humidity levels start to get too high.Use a hygrometer to keep and eye on the humidity levels in your house. If the humidity levels start to exceed 50 percent, take steps to lower the humidity and increase the temperature until the humidity drops below 50 percent.

, This will prevent cold air from blowing in from outside and cooling walls and windows. Not only will weather stripping save you money on energy bills, but it will also stop condensation.Weather stripping is a protective strip that you can apply to doors and windows to prevent cold air from seeping in through joints and frames.

, Cracks and openings are another place where cold air can steal into your house. Around doors and windows, you can seal these with caulk to prevent walls and windows from cooling.To apply caulk, you'll need a caulking gun and a fresh bottle of caulk. After you apply the bead, smooth it down with a small knife or your finger to press the caulk into the hole.

, This is a heat exchanger with a built-in ventilation fan. These devices are expensive (a couple thousand dollars), but they will help reduce your energy costs by preventing energy loss. And because this device will increase the temperature of your house, it will help you fight condensation., Another way to prevent condensation is to stop the windows from getting cold, and you can do this by installing storm windows, or by replacing older single-pane windows with double or triple glazing.While replacing windows or installing storm windows may be expensive, it will also help to improve the energy efficiency of your home, so you'll save money on your power bills.

, The final piece of the puzzle when it comes to reducing humidity in your home is improving ventilation and circulation. The easiest and cheapest way to improve the ventilation in your home is to open doors and windows when the weather permits.For the most effective ventilation, open windows on opposite sides of the same room to create a cross breeze.

, Opening drapes and curtains will allow air to circulate against the windows, and this will dry out moisture on the windows and stop condensation from forming.The best time to open the windows and drapes is on sunny days, when the warmth and light from the sun will dry out moisture.

, Stand-up, oscillating, and ceiling fans are all great for circulating the air in your home. Not only will they help to reduce moisture, but they’ll also distribute hot air more evenly in the winter, and provide a cooling breeze in summer.


In summer, ceiling fans should rotate in a counterclockwise direction. In winter, switch the fans so they rotate in a clockwise direction, and circulate heat more efficiently."

Compare dealers.,
Ask questions.,
Ask for quotes.",How to Select an Arizona Window Sunscreens Dealer," This might go without saying. Yet sometimes consumers go with the first company whose name they pull out of the phone book. Shop around and compare prices. Don't assume that all AZ window sunscreens retailers are the same. By the same token, make sure you understand exactly what you'll get for the price you'll pay. If one retailer is significantly cheaper than another, find out why. It's not worth saving a few dollars if the product quality is poor.;
, Arming yourself with information will help you make the best decision. Some basic things to ask are: 


What are your products made of? * Do your prices include installation? 
How long is your product and workmanship guaranteed for?  
How long will it take to get my order? 
Do I have to pay up front or make just a down payment? The more information you have before you buy, the more intelligent a choice you'll be able to make. 

, Once you've narrowed down your choices to a couple of AZ window sunscreens dealers, ask for a custom quote. Naturally your final cost will depend upon how many windows you need coverings for. Your AZ window sunscreens retailer should be eager to supply you with this information. If you get quotes from multiple companies, compare them. If one is significantly higher/lower than another, it's time to ask more questions.

, Use a standard screwdriver to pry the spline, or black rubber seal, up from the frame. The spline holds the screen inside the window frame.


Scan each corner of the frame for a spline end. Once you find the end, slip the screwdriver underneath and pry it up. Once you have an end up, you can slowly pull the entire spline out from around the window frame.
The spline may be cut in sections. If this is the case, just repeat the process until the entire spline is out of the window frame grove.
Check for cracks or holes in the rubber spline. If it is damaged, purchase a new spline the same width as the one you removed.

, Cut out a section of screen that is large enough to cover the entire screen frame, with about 4-6 inches of excess. You do not want to cut the screen to the exact size because putting in the spline actually uses about a half inch of screen.

, This not only holds the screen to the frame, but it insures that when you are rolling in the spline on the other side of the screen, the screen will remain taut. Starting on the long side of the screen is possible; however, you will need more clips to ensure that the screen does not overlap when rolling in the spline.

, Start on the opposite side from where you placed the clamps. Using your screen roller, roll the screen into the frame. This is done so that when the spline is rolled in, the spline has a channel to fall into. After you roll the screen in, look down the screen. Make sure that there are no bubbles in the screen. If bubbles are present, remove the screen and roll it back in, this time, ensuring that you do not have any bubbles.


When pre-rolling the screen, it may be helpful to place a hand on the inside of the frame. This will help in keeping the screen taut, and preventing bubbles. This step is not necessary but will help later.

, Starting at one corner of the screen, hold the spline with one hand and roll the spline into the track with the roller. This may take several passes but make sure at the end that the screen is all the same depth in the track. Take your time with this step. If you go to fast or push too hard, the screen may rip on the inside of the frame and then you have to start all over. Screening is a slow patient process, take your time and do it right the first time.

, Starting at the opposite side from where you just rolled, remove the clamps and repeat the rolling process. By screening opposite of the side you previously screened, the screen will remain taut.

, If your screen has lift tabs, small plastic handles to help in the removal of the screen, place them in the track before you pre-roll the screen. You want these tabs to be on the opposite side of the spline, so that when the screen is put back into the window, the pull tabs will be on the inside of the house.

, Repeat the previous process on the long sides of the screen. Remember to ensure that no bubbles are forming during the screening process.

, After all the sides have spline in them, cut the excess spline from the screen. Using a flat blade screwdriver, push the remaining spline into the screen corner.

, If you are satisfied with your work, and there are minimal or no bubbles in the screen, cut the excess screen from the frame. Be very careful in doing this so that you do not cut the new screen. Then you'll be ready to put the screen back in your window.

Read through these instructions in advance so you're not stuck leaving a window open as you go out for a tool or parts.,
Purchase sash cord measured to match your original or to roll well in the pulley wheel.,
Start preparing the sash.,
If there are metal edge guides that the window slides along (similar to a T cross-section), remove the screws holding each vertical metal guide; you may have to bend one or two, but if the bending is minimal, this should not be a problem.,
Remove the temporary screws holding the sash in place with and carefully take it down.,
Remove the screw.,
Take out the weights on each side, which might be 5-8 lb cast iron solid vertical rounded cylinders with a loop at the top.,
Measure off the cord by raising the weight to maximum, then cutting it at a point slightly below (maybe 1-2"") where it would reach resting in the window's inside side channel with the window resting at bottom.,
Reinstall the bottom side wood pieces by temporarily putting in a screw into the center of their outer faces to help you maneuver them into place (you can fill the holes with putty later if you want), then pull the backing strips out toward window center again just enough to let you maneuver the bottom pieces into place; they may also drop down a little in order to seat properly.,
If you have to replace old metal strips taken out earlier, generously oil or trace thoroughly with pencil (graphite) all glide surfaces on both window guide fin and side guide and straighten any bends as best you can.,
Replace the inward trim strips you originally pried off, between you and the sash, by nailing them back in (don't use screws or glue, so you or anyone else can repeat this task when needed).,
Pour yourself a tall iced lemonade; if guide fins were involved, you probably started on this 2-4 hours ago.

",How to Replace Sash Cords on Hung Windows,"


The basic pieces you're working with are the window sashes (usually upper and lower frames for one or several window panes each), vertical cylindrical weights with a loop at the top, sash cord, pulley wheels, lower wood pieces affording access to the side weight travel paths, and in some cases, metal guiding strips that keep the window on a fixed track.
Windows will vary in some details, and these instructions describe replacing the bottom sash, but the same principles apply to replacing cord on an upper sash also and can be adapted to your window's particulars. This is a layman's guide but written from experience.;
, This might be 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) or for a larger window, 5/8"".


It must be cotton or cotton with a nylon core, because if you use nylon, it will jam up unexpectedly in the pulley wheel after you've completed the insulation, leaving you unable to close the window without cutting the cord.
(The same applies to flag cords on poles with pulleys, nylon cords can jam there too). Don't worry, the cotton should last for decades.

, On each side inward from the window there are normally two vertical trim strips to help keep the window sash gliding in place and reduce drafts.


If the sash does not run along any metal guides at its sides, use care so the sash doesn't fall during this step.

Score any paint on their forward edges with a sharp point to minimize flaking and pry them off with a paint scraper and small pry bar or screwdriver.
Then raise the sash to maximum height on its normal path and drive temporary screws sideways into the wood directly beneath it and/or in front on each side to hold it in place.

,


The bottom strip will not need to be pulled, though if bent, it should be straightened with pliers so the sash seats properly when closed.
Replacing these guides is annoying but can be done; keep the screws from it handy in a baggie or cup.
In an unusual case you might have to remove 2"" or so of one side by hacksawing it, but hopefully you can simply pull it down and out once all screws are removed. Ideally you should only have to remove one guide in order to remove the window.

, If you're replacing cord on both sides, it should just pivot forward. If you're replacing just one cord, look at the other one and seriously consider replacing it in parallel anyway.

, There will probably be a lower wooden piece on either side to give you access to the weights. It may be held in at its top with a screw; remove the screw.


The piece will probably not yet pry out willingly, however; you will have to score and pull toward the center the wooden strips outward from it that retain the sash at the exterior.
This should free up your lower side wood pieces enough to remove them. If you damage the wood a little it should still be usable, but try to pull those back strips out a little and keep any splintering minimal.

,


Cut off any old cord.
Remove any old cord remaining in the sash's upper side channels where they attach to it by pulling out on the cord, which is probably held with a pair of nails, and note where the nails were set (pen marks might help, but you should see the holes), and see if you can re-use the pair of nails that probably hold it.
You may need a screwdriver or pliers to pull the cord leftover.
Make sure the pulleys spin normally; chip or scrape any old paint that restrains them.
Now tape a heavy nail or screw onto a piece of mono filament fish line and feed it through the top pulley to let it down inside where the weights rise and fall; this will be faster and easier than feeding the cord straight through.
Tie off the opposite end of the fish line to some sash cord and pull it back down through the pulley with the fish line.
Detach the fish line and tie the cord's bottom end to a weight, two snug half hitches will probably do, and trim the excess to .25-.5""
Lean the weight against the wall in the inside side space it rides in.

,


Then tie a knot into the end to hold it while you get the other side so the cord doesn't disappear through the pulley hole (the weight will hang).
Now keeping a good grip on the window, since this is where extra hands would be useful, and ask for help if it's available, pull one of the knotted cords down again (lifting the weight), untie the knot and nail the cord sideways through its center to reattach it to the sash, nailing it about where the old holes were.
The nails should be flush and low enough on the sash to let its top edge rise above the pulley when fully raised.
Repeat for the other side.
Trim any excess cord in the side sash channels, but leave 1/2-1"" beyond the nails if it will stay in the channel.
Raise the sash back on its new weights while you work below again, though there should be no need now, with the weights attached, to hold it up out of the way with screws.
Vacuum out any dust and scrapings in the side enclosures and window bottom.

,


Let the outer vertical backing strips back in place and remove the temporary screws from the bottom side pieces.

, (Don't use WD-40, it may leave a residue.)


Reinstall them with the screws. To get the guides and sash to mesh together, you may have to slide the bottom few inches of sash into the top few inches of outer guide, enough to let you position it with the window and screw it into place in the side with the sash high, using the existing holes.
Meshing the strips can be trying but can be done. Then slide the window back down, which it should do without too much difficulty.

,


Lightly caulk and paint to seal the forward joint edges if desired.

Caulk the inside of the window and reattach the inside stops.",How to Replace a Window," To measure the height of the existing window, go from the top of the sill to the bottom of the head jamb.


For a truly accurate reading, measure the window at three locations — the left, middle, and right of the window — and then take the smallest measurement (the measurements may not be different).Use this as your reading.;
, To measure the width of the existing window, go from the jamb on left side of the window to the jamb on the right side of the window. Again, measure across at the top, middle, and bottom, selecting the shortest distance as your true measurement.

, Take a measuring tape and measure from the top left of the frame to the bottom right of the frame, and the from the top right of the frame to the bottom left of the frame.If there's a difference of less than 1/4 inch (0.635 cm) in the diagonal lengths of your frame, you can make small adjustments with shims when you install the new windows. If the difference between the two numbers is larger than 1/4 inch, you should consider replacing the entire window frame.

, This is why you measure the existing window before you remove it.

, If you can, remove them without damaging them, as you'll reattach them once you've installed the new window.


If you happen to damage the inside stop pieces while removing them from the window, take a bit of wood filler and mold it onto the damaged part of the stop. Once it's dried, sand it and the surrounding wood down. Consider giving the stop a new coat of paint before reattaching to the frame.

, Once the inside stops are gone, this should be a fairly easy procedure. If, however, the inside sash is connected to a weight by a chain, simply cut the connecting chain or chord and let the weight fall down to its well.

, Remove the parting bead and throw it away. Then, remove the outside sash in the same way that you removed the inside sash, slashing any chains or chords that connect it to a weight.


Do not remove the exterior stops from the window frame. These stops will help guide the window in installation and nest it afterwards.

, To get the window frame prepped for its new upgrade, do the following before proceeding to installation:


Remove any weights from their wells. Hoist the pulleys to the frame or remove the pulleys entirely.
Drive in any protruding screws or nails out. You may want to cover them with wood filler and a putty knife, wait the filler patch to dry, and then sand and paint over it to make it inconspicuous.
Remove all the old caulking with a putty or utility knife, if necessary. Make sure the opening is free of all caulking and other things that will get in the way of the new window.

, It's probably best to try not to attempt this task without professional help.

,, Locate the bumper stops and begin to slide them over into the middle of the frame. Do this until four mounting holes in the side jambs become visible.

, Some people prefer not to work with the expander, also called a header, because it decreases the available space in the window and makes replacing the trim harder. Use at your discretion.

, Check to see if the window is plumb and level (using a level, of course).

, There should be four mounting screws, one for the bottom and top of each side jamb. Install them gently, taking care not to deform the paneling on the side jamb.

,, If you do notice gaps or faulty motion on the windows, check for any adjustment screws built into the side-jambs, using them to correct the window frame.

Determine what type of wall you have.,
Weigh your mirror.,
Find a place to hang the mirror.,
Measure where your hangers should go on the wall.,
Drill your hangers into the wall.,
Put bumpers on the back of your mirror.,
Hang your mirror.,
Clean off your mirror.",How to Hang a Wall Mirror1," There are a variety of different wall types, including drywall, plaster, and masonry. A particularly heavy mirror will need a stronger backing like masonry to stay in place. The wall's material will also determine how big your screws and anchors need to be., Make sure you have a good idea of what your mirror weighs, which will help you get the right size hooks. Hanging hooks have a weight limit on them, and if you go over it, your mirror will fall off the wall, break, and probably damage your wall in the process. A bathroom scale should be enough to get a good weight., Make sure you have enough space on the wall for the mirror, and otherwise decide how you want it positioned relative to other items on the wall and in the room. Hold your mirror up to the wall to see how much space it will take up. Finding a stud can be useful, but not necessary if you have a strong enough hanger.Once you have a good place, mark where the top of your mirror will go with a pencil or some painters tape so you'll be able to measure for the hangers. You can also use those pencil marks and a level to make sure your mirror will be straight.
If your mirror is too large to hold up easily and mark at the same time, measure it with some measuring tape or a yardstick, and see how those dimensions fit.

, Your mirror should already have something on the back that it can hang with, either a wire or D-rings. In both cases, you should be sure to mark where the hanger will go, not the screw. You won't be hanging your mirror from the screw.If you have a hanger wire, probably only on a smaller mirror, you will only need one hole. Measure the width of your mirror, and mark a point in the middle of that line. Take the wire in your picture, and hold it taut from the center to measure the distance from the top of wire to the frame. Then, transfer that measurement to your markings on the wall so you know where to put the hanger.
If you have D-rings, they will be fastened to the mirror, and not move. Measure how far apart your fasteners are from one another, and how far they are from the top of the mirror. Once you have these distances, transfer them to the wall by measuring and marking from your earlier pencil line., If your screw is into a stud, you should be fine without additional support. If not, you may want to include a wall anchor with your hangers., These are little spots made of rubber or plastic that will help keep the mirror from tilting, and prevent it from leaving marks on the wall. You should be able to find them at a hardware or craft store., Line up your rings or wire with the appropriate hook, and hang the mirror. If your mirror is too heavy or large for you to lift easily, get someone else to help. You may also want another person to help look in the back to make sure you are placing the wire or rings in the right place, especially if the mirror is large enough that you can't see around it while holding it up.

, Now that it is in place, polish or wipe down the mirror so your surface is clean and reflective. Enjoy its new place on your wall.

Clear your room.,
Separate your belongings into piles.,
Plan the layout.,
Choose a color scheme.,
Recycle old items.,
Make a ""mood board"".,
Add small touches.,
Add glowing stars.,
Decorate your walls.",How to Redecorate Your Room Without Buying New Stuff," In order to redecorate your room, it is best to start from scratch and gather as many materials as possible. Wiping your room clean will give you a better view of its size, as well as allow you to plan the new layout. Although it may seem useless, the clutter filling up your room could be transformed into decorations if you take the time to sort through it. Take the time to gather all your belongings into one pile, removing items from the floor and furniture. While your room is cleared, run the vacuum over the carpet to remove grime and dirt.;
, Once you have cleared out your room, go through your items and categorize them according to their purpose (example: clothes, games, decorations). Set aside belongings that could potentially serve as decorations or materials for a project (example: empty photo frame). Dispose of unwanted ones in a trash bag for quick disposal. Avoid keeping them out of sentiment, as they only waste space in your room. If you have unwanted belongings in good condition, such as clean clothes and books, donate them to a charity shop or have a garage sale. You could also offer them to your friends and family.

, Once you have cleared out and tidied your room, decide on its new appearance. You have a variety of options to choose from, such as rearranging the furniture or putting up old posters and pictures. To give yourself a better view, you could sketch out a blueprint of an ideal layout for your room. If you plan on repositioning your furniture, be sure that you leave enough space for the rest of your belongings. You should also make sure that you have room to walk around without feeling suffocated.


Rearranging your furniture is a simple method to transform your room. It can give you a fresh change of scenery and costs no money.

, While this step is optional, finding matching colors will help complement your room and make it appear professionally decorated. Select a few decorations (ex: albums, posters, pillows) that have matching colors before setting them up in your room. Be sure that they match your furniture, as well as your bedspread., Search through your categorized piles for cheap decorations to use. Redesigning a room doesn't necessarily require many decorations, as setting out a few in an artistic manner can be more powerful than spreading them all over the place. Find a few eye-catching pieces to personalize your room. These could include photographs of your family, posters of your favorite singers, your favorite albums, etc.

, This is an easy, cheap way to decorate a blank wall. A mood board involves a collection of items that evokes happiness. They are pinned onto a large cork board, which can then be hung onto the wall. Simply gather together items that reflect your personality, such as photographs, old concert tickets, CD covers, quotes, magazine clippings/pictures from your favorite films and television shows. Using these materials, create a collage on your board, pinning each one securely in place. Don't worry if it seems cluttered, as its appearance is enhanced with each item that you add.

, These can transform your room and change your perspective of it, encouraging relaxation and satisfaction. Simply adding small items - such as photographs of your loved ones in frames or stuffed animals - can spark old memories and evoke feelings of happiness. You should remind yourself that your room belongs to you, which means that you should add small touches of your life to it.

, Pasting stars onto the ceiling is a popular method to spice up your room. They not only serve as wonderful decorations during the day but also glow beautifully when the night falls. However, if you don't have glowing stars, you can simply part your curtains to allow the moonlight to flood your room.

, A simple way to transform your room is to add a personalized touch to your walls. You could hang up photographs or art pieces, as well as a calendar or cork board. However, you could also draw on your walls, provided that you have received parental permission. Be sure that you are certain about the design you want, as it can be expensive to repaint your walls.

Apply adhesive.,
Push the mirror on to the wall.,
Clean off your mirror.",How to Hang a Wall Mirror3," Adhesives are most common with frameless mirrors, mostly because there is nothing else to put a bracket or screw into. If your mirror has a frame, you're probably better off using hangers or other tools. Frameless mirrors are most commonly used in bathrooms., Make sure you get adhesives specially made for hanging mirrors. It will need to stick to both the mirror glass and your wall. Plus, because frameless mirrors are normally in placed in bathrooms, your glue will also need to withstand the more humid environment.

, A ruler or tape measure should do. This will be important when you think about where the mirror needs to go. It should lay flat against the wall, so there needs to be plenty of space. There cannot be anything between your mirror and the wall if you are using adhesives.

, Use the measurements you got before and trace where you think the mirror would look best to make sure it will fit there. You can lightly mark the wall in pencil to see where it will go. You can also use those pencil marks and a level to make sure your mirror will be straight.Once your glue dries, you won't be able to readjust the mirror without damaging your walls (and possibly the mirror), so your measurements need to be exact. You only get one shot at this., Follow the instructions on your glue to make sure you use the proper amount, and put it in the right places on either the back of the mirror or the wall.

Examine the door frame and notice anything about the floor, threshold, or other surroundings that may cause trouble. Pull up a piece, A door, especially an exterior door, is large and heavy, and you'll need somebody there to help lift it into place. You and your assistant will also help each other to shim the door and spot alignment on both sides at once. Also, one of you can hold something up while the other fastens it in place. Do not try this job alone., This project involves taking the door all the way out of its frame, meaning that you'll have a wide, door-sized hole for a period of time. If you have the choice, avoid extreme temperatures and rainy weather., A door is not something you will change often, so choose a classical styling and a sturdy design, especially for an exterior door. It is worth investigating the relative merits of steel, fiberglass, and wood and making an informed decision.,, The moment with the door off or halfway up and the breezes blowing in is not the right time to stop and visit the hardware store., You'll need enough space on either side of the door to lay the door down, plus space for tools and materials. Plan in advance to move furnishings, flower pots, and any other obstructions out of the way., Rekey the lock, if you wish. Have it ready to go when the time comes to install it., If you will reuse this trim, take care to remove it gently and get it off in one piece. You can fill in old nail holes with putty before you repaint. If you will replace the trim, you may wish to save the old trim until you have measured and cut the new trim to the same size.,







Remove the old door from its hinges, then carefully lift it off. Exterior doors are heavy! Then, make sure the longest screws are out of the hinges on the jamb side. There are a few screws that just hold the hinges to the jamb, and there are others that go all the way through to the frame.

, Unless you can find and pull the nails (they were probably driven in and puttied over), use a reciprocating saw with a metal-cutting blade to cut right through the nails. The reciprocating saw can also cut through screws, but they are usually made from hardened metal, so it will take a long time., Remove the threshold if you are replacing it., Pull remaining nails or parts of nails, or pound them in, flush with the surface of the frame. Also remove any old insulation or caulk., Depending on the fit of the jamb to the frame, it may be necessary to remove this molding.

With your assistant, set it into place and see how it hangs. You will be adjusting this fit in subsequent steps, but you can get a general idea of problems this way. Remove the door again, for the moment., The rough opening should be about an inch wider and a half inch taller than the new jamb, make note of these margins. If you need to trim or build up flooring to provide a level surface for the door, do that now.,, Please note, some doors have adjustable thresholds, be sure caulk will not interfere with this mechanism. Apply generous beads of caulk along the sill, across the opening. This will be your weather- and waterproofing there, so be generous. Caulk is fairly inexpensive, and you can always wipe up excess., If jamb is narrower than original door, set jamb flush with out side wall., Stack wedge-shaped shims pointing in opposite directions and drive them in until they take up the required space. Start at the bottom on the hinge side, then at the opposite bottom corner. Proceed to the top of the hinge side, and the top of the opposite side. Then shim directly behind the top, middle and bottom hinges. You will be driving screws through the jamb, shims, and frame, so for the shim locations behind the hinges, put the shims directly behind the empty hole. Finally, shim opposite the top and bottom hinges and just above and below the deadbolt.

The objective of all this shimming is to center the jamb in the door frame and to square, plumb, and level the door. Use a piece of material of an appropriate thickness, probably about 1/8"", to feel all the way around the door, to ensure that the spacing between the door and the jamb is consistent and even. This is somewhat a process of trial and error. Use the door itself to gauge where the frame must be to be square. Be patient and make adjustments as necessary, pushing the shims further in or pulling them out. It is worth being picky at this stage, since these adjustments will affect the fit and operation of your new door for years to come.
Also adjust the door location front to back. If the door is weatherstripped, look for even compression of the weatherstripping from top to bottom. If not, look for an even gap when the door is closed. The door jamb should also be flush with the wall, as much as possible. Remember, the trim needs to go back on at the end.
If the door has pre-cut openings for the knob and deadbolt, make sure that they align properly as you shim the jamb.
Putting a screw through the jamb and shims will pull the jamb slightly towards the frame.
Shims can be used to correct the parallelogram of the jamb and to flex the wood in or out a little bit near the shim.

, Don't open it more than about 30º., These will hold the door in place. Keep in mind that the screws will pull the jamb toward the frame, so proceed this way: fasten, check, adjust, repeat. Here, the screws are hidden under the weather stripping., The door should be well supported now, so you can check opening and closing., See the related wikiHows for those procedures., You can use a small saw, but shims are generally made from soft enough wood that you can trim them by scoring them with a utility knife and snapping them off., You can purchase very small rolls of fiberglass insulation or you can use another material. Do be careful of using the foam-in-place insulation, the sort that comes in a spray can. Some formulations can expand enough to push the door jamb out of place. You should use the minimally expanding foam if you decide to., The trim in the photos was shortened a bit and moved down on the inside and extended on the outside because the new door rests slightly lower than the old one., On an exterior door, this is weatherproofing; on an interior door, it is more of a cosmetic matter, done to prepare for paint.,,, Measure distance from sill to hinges and note the measurements.,, This is the vertical margin., This is your shim-pack., These are the bottom shims.

Then stick more strips at regular intervals along the back’s top for extra support. Next, measure the distance between each strip. Then measure the wall and mark with a pencil where each strip will meet it. Attach corresponding strips on top of each marking and then hang your quilt by pressing the quilt's strips into the wall's.Be aware that some wall paint may be resistant to adhesive backings.Alternately, screw or nail a wooden board to the wall and attach the velcro strips to that. Choose a board that is 2 inches wide and a half-inch thick. Cut its length to 2 to 4 inches less than the quilt’s width to hide it from view.
Use more strips than you think you might need to ensure they will hold the quilt’s weight. Line the top at frequent intervals and/or double, triple or quadruple the number of strips used at each interval.
Strips can be doubly secured to the quilt by hand-sewing or pinning them.
This method is probably best suited for smaller, lighter quilts.

, Select a wooden framework that is slightly larger than your quilt. Place the framework face-down on top of a slightly larger sheet of washed cotton cloth. Fold the cloth’s ends over the back of the frame and staple them in place so that the cloth is pulled taut over the frame’s face. Next, place the framework face-down on top of the quilt's back and hand-sew the cloth to the back of the quilt. Sew parallel zigzag patterns from top-to-bottom or side-to-side across the entire quilt.Hang the frame by its corners with nails or screws, or according to the directions of any hardware that may be included.
Do not cover the quilt with glass. Blocking air circulation may lead to mold and mildew.
Use rust-free staples to avoid staining.

, Obviously, choose a wall with enough area to fit your quilt. Additionally, favor large, spacious rooms to hang larger quilts. Allow viewers to admire them both from far away and right up close., Favor those rooms whose colors will contrast those of your quilt. Hang your quilt where it will stand out against its surroundings and catch the viewer’s eye., Avoid hanging your quilt where it will come into direct contact with natural sunlight. Prevent it from fading by keeping it out of reach of ultraviolet rays. Use artificial lighting to illuminate your quilt instead., Favor rooms where temperatures are consistently moderate (65-75 degrees F or 18-24 degrees C). Avoid areas with poor air circulation and high humidity, which may lead to mold and mildew. Also avoid hanging your quilt near radiators, ducts for heating or air-conditioning, and other sources of moisture and extreme temperatures., Make sure the bottom of the quilt hangs high enough to keep it out of harm’s way. Consider both the floor and any furniture that your pets may climb, such as the back of your sofa, your bed or headboard, or shelving. Prevent your quilt from becoming a towel or toy., Expect the constant pull of a hanging quilt’s weight to damage and weaken its stitching over time. Take your quilt down once every six months to avoid extensive damage. Either alternate it with another quilt for the next six months or hang it back up, only this time upside-down., Remove dust to preserve your quilt’s fibers. Make sure your floor or table is clean before you spread your quilt on it. Use a handheld vacuum with low-suction to prevent damage to the stitching. Stretch a fiberglass or nylon screen (or even a coffee filter) over the vacuum’s small-brush attachment to further reduce suction. Keep your passes gentle and even as you go. Replace the screen or filter if needed as dust collects., For a deep clean, use a large bedsheet to line a clean bathtub, kiddie pool, or other container large enough to submerge the entire quilt. Place your quilt in on top and then fill the container with a mixture of a half-ounce of mild laundry detergent for every gallon of water. Let the quilt soak undisturbed. Drain the container and press the quilt between your hand and the container to get the soap out. Pat the quilt with a clean towel to remove soapy water. Collect the corners of the bedsheet together and lift the quilt out of the container. Spread the quilt by itself on a clean, non-porous surface and allow it to air-dry.Use vacuuming as your primary cleaning method to avoid damaging the quilt through excessive washing.
Do not soak your quilt if it contains: ink or dyes that may run; glazed, silk, or woolen fabrics; signs of weak stitching or other damage.
Washing machines, dryers, dry-cleaning, and ironing could all ruin your quilt.

De-clutter your bedroom.,
Give your room a deep clean.,
Consider painting.,
Make a mood board for your bedroom.,
Reposition your bed.,
Change your headboard.,
Rethink your functional lighting.,
Add decorative lighting.,
Change out hardware on doors and furniture.,
Hang pictures and artwork that mean something to you.,
Update your bedspread and pillows.,
Consider an area rug.,
Add life to your space.,
Add scent.",How to Spice up a Boring Bedroom," Even if you don’t feel like your space is overly messy, take time to intentionally de-clutter. You might be surprised by how much you have accumulated. Eliminating excess is an essential component of making your space feel peaceful.


Look to the cultural phenomenon, Marie Kondo, for her famous de-cluttering practices. Ask yourself what items in your bedroom truly give you joy.Put these items in a definitely keep pile.
Make other piles to donate, to recycle, and to throw away. Make an immediate trip to the donation center so that you don’t put it off. If there are any items you’re unsure about giving up, box them up, date the box, and put them away in a closet. If you don’t reach for any of them within six months, give the box away without even opening it.
Include furniture. Does your furniture add to the space? If not, do you need it, and if so, do you have funds to find something else?;
, After you’ve de-cluttered, this is a guaranteed way to make your space feel fresh.


Get to all the tasks you don’t think about in your normal cleaning routine.Dust your baseboards, molding, and ceiling fans, and clean the glass of mirrors and windows.
If you have curtains, take them down and wash them.
Sweep and mop hardwood floors, and thoroughly vacuum carpet. Make sure to also clean under your bed. If you have furniture against your walls, move it a few inches so you can clean behind it.
Use a magic eraser, like Mr. Clean’s, to get any scuff marks off your walls.

, If you compare effect to price, painting your room is an inexpensive way to make a drastic update to your space. Stick to more neutral colors that you won’t grow to dislike over time.


Shades of white work well in any space. White paint will make your room feel brighter and more open. It’s a calming color and good backdrop to make decorations pop.
If you want a little more drama in your space, try painting your walls a velvety black or navy blue.A darker room done right can feel cozy and timeless. Be wary of these colors, however, if your space already feels a little cramped.
If you don’t want to paint your entire room, paint an accent wall on the wall behind your bed.If you like your current paint color, just do a few touch ups with a paint brush.

, Whether you’re planning a complete makeover or just a small refresh, it can help to create your vision for the space. This will keep your process and outcome cohesive.


Choose a color scheme. Pick a neutral base and a few coordinating accent colors for decorations like coral, teal, and mustard yellow. When you are choosing items to bring to your room, refer back to see if they loosely fit this scheme.
Think about how you want your space to feel. Do you want it to be minimalist, crisp, and bright, or cozily full of sweet, quirky items and various patterns? Do you want wood in your room or accents of metal?
As you begin to update your space, think about whether the changes fit into your vision for the space.

, Just the small change of moving your bed can make you feel like you have a brand new room. Your bed should be the focal point of this space.Try to move your bed against a different wall, and reorganize your other furniture based on the placement of your bed.
You don’t have to place your bed against the wall. Consider putting your bed a diagonal or leaving it to float free in your space.

, Or, if you don’t already have a headboard, add one. This is a way to give plain furniture a little bit of style.


Your headboard doesn’t have to be a standard frame or hard headboard because it isn’t structurally important to your bed. Consider hanging a piece of art: an oversized poster or a woven tapestry work well.You can even hang a woven rug on your wall as a tapestry.
If you have a plush headboard, recover it. New fabric will give an instant face lift to your bed.
Use a corkboard or pegboard. You can paint it the color of your choice and constantly change the pictures and mementos you hang from it.
Paint a mural above your bed or adorn it with wall decals.This will give you a more intricate image than you’d get with a traditional headboard.

, The lighting in your bedroom creates ambience and mood. Consider adding new lighting for more sources of soft light. The more sources of lower wattage light you have in a room, the better.If you are able, install dimmers on your lights, so you can change the brightness of your lights.
Keep practicality in mind. You’ll need a lamp by your bedside, and you might want a stylish nightlight near your bathroom.

, Certain types of light can add decor even while off. Consider stringing up a few strands of decorative fairy lights. Depending on the style of your space, you can find different shapes and themes in these string lights.


Pretty candles, whether they are real or artificial, can add a soft, relaxing glow to your space at night. You can even keep an entire shelf of varying sizes of candles.

, This is a simple way to make your doors and furniture seem new.


Depending on your vision, choose sleek and metal minimalistic hardware or bright focal points like crystal door knobs and painted ceramic hardware.
You can even get creative and make your own hardware.You can use anything from ribbon to yardsticks or old cutlery.

, As you redecorate, don’t feel like you need to buy new pieces of artwork all at once. Fill your space slowly with things you love.


If you want a clean look to your walls, get your art and pictures framed and hang them equally spaced apart.For a more organic look, hang unframed artwork with pretty pins or washi tape tacked in the corners.

, A new duvet or quilt can make a huge difference in the way you feel about relaxing in your bedroom.


Think about getting a fluffy white comfortable and white pillowcases. The white looks bright, soft, and inviting. If it gets dirty, you can simply bleach it back to its original bright white.
If you don’t want white, choose a pattern you love. Feel free to mix a patterned quilt with different patterned pillows for a more textural look.
Get new sheets. This is a small luxury that can make you more comfortable. Opt for 100% cotton or linen sheets, which will only get softer with time and will last for years.

, Even if you already have carpet in your room, an area rug can add an element of comfort, style, and fun.Choose a bright patterned rug if the rest of your space is fairly minimal. This is a great way to add art and whimsy without cluttering your walls.
Add a soft, shag rug. These are great to put around your bed so that your feet will sink into them each morning as you get up.

, Plants not only make a space prettier, they also purifier the air and make you calmer.


When picking plants for your space, make sure to take into account the amount of sunlight your room gets.For lower maintenance plants, choose succulents and cacti.
Use large baskets and beautiful ceramic pots as decorative holders for your plants.

, Even though you can’t see it, scent plays a part in the decorative feel of your room. Using aromatherapy can help you create your ideal relaxing environment.Invest in candles, incense, or an essential oil diffuser for your bedside.
Scents like lavender, jasmine, and rosemary are calming and clarifying.

Decide on a budget.,
Look around your room and write down what you want to keep, even if you would like to improve an item you already have (i.e.,
All the things that you don't want to keep, give them to a sibling, charity, or sell them.,
Think about lighting options, such as chandeliers, lamps, sconces, and windows.,
Decide what new things you want.,
Decide what size bed you are getting.,
Think about what companies you trust for your furniture/paint.,
Choose a theme.,
Make a room plan.,
Get the walls painted first, you need to figure out whether the bedding will work with it or not.,
Buy the bedding theme.,
After buying the bedding, buy the mattress/bed.,
Buy the curtains/shades.,
If everything coordinates, buy new lighting.,
Buy an armoire/dresser.,
Buy the chest if you want.,
Buy a nightstand if you want.,
Buy the bookshelf and table.,
Finally buy the accents, and voila-you're done!

",How to Redecorate Your Room," This is the most important step of redecorating because it allows you not to spend excessively on things you don't really need. Your budget should only be a rough estimate, however.;
,: painting your existing wardrobe). If you want to totally start over, be aware that it will cost more.

, There's no use in throwing something out unless it is entirely unusable, such as an old, rotting basket.

, It is really much better to have at two windows, one large and one small in your bedroom. If there still isn't enough light but you can't afford lighting options like sconces, than try getting a very tall floor lamp that either has a wide, circular top that points to the ceiling or a floor lamp with three lamps attached to it.

, Some essentials that most people have and that I would recommend are: a large bookcase, an armoire/dresser, a vanity (if you are a girl), a large table, a nightstand, a chest to store your things in, a new mattress, sheet set, bed, new paint, three lamps, and three chairs. Remember that you could probably find a lot of stuff in the attic or basement.

, A queen size bed is a good size, because not only will there be a lot of space, there are also many more sheet sets and blankets that size than Full or Twin. It also costs less than King, but if you don't have the money or space, then just get a Twin. (To clear up any confusion, a bed is not the sheet set, blankets, pillows, and mattress altogether. It is just a frame to put the bed on.)

, Some stores that people like are Ethan Allen, Home Depot, and Benjamin Moore. It all depends on your budget and your tastes.

, This is almost always one of the fun parts. You could have a calm beach feel, a light, pink romantic theme, an autumnal feel, and many more. You can find a lot of them in an Ethan Allen catalog. If you don't want a theme, you don't have to have one, but a theme makes everything in your room come together. It doesn't have to be complicated, you could just have a simple colour scheme or a particular feel, like modern or classy. Another option is to have small themes all throughout the room, like polka-dot curtains and bedding and an ocean-themed desk and bookcase. Some themes complement each other, like polka dots and floral, while others look garish with each other, like stripes & stripes. Make sure your theme isn't too crowded or else your eyes will hurt.

, This will tell where everything goes in your room, and is very important. You don't need anything fancy, just a simple sketch.

, While the walls get painted, ask for the painters to also paint any furniture you want to paint.

, It's the first thing that people look at when they enter your room, so you have to make sure you get good bedding and a blanket/duvet that goes with it. A toss pillow or two couldn't hurt, either.

, This is because you need to know whether the bed will go with the bedding or not. Wooden beds look simple and country-style, while iron beds look elegant and sophisticated. Both can look modern if painted black.

, You may want to have only curtains, curtains and sheers, only sheers, only shades, or only curtains and shades. Sheers are a good choice because they cost less, look good, and they filter light while offering privacy. Country Curtains is very good for curtains and sheers, while Smith and Noble is good for shades.

, The lamps can look Asian, modern, elegant, etc. Chandeliers are very sophisticated, but simple ceiling lighting with white shades look modern.

, Dressers take up more room and are better for girls, as there is usually a mirror above one. However, armoires are good for both genders, takes up less space, and in my opinion, look better. If you have an armoire and are a girl, consider buying a vanity.

, The chest can be tall or short like a dresser. You could use a nightstand as a chest if you want.

, The nightstand could be a cross between a vanity/nightstand, having a mirror on the top, one drawer, and a chair.

, They can just be plain old tables and bookshelves, because they are only there for function, unless you really want a nice table/bookshelf.

Proceed with your bedroom's makeover.",How to Pick a Bedroom Theme," Your room is a picture of your personality, thus it should reflect you and what you care about. This is not about your parents, sibling or friend; it's about you. Focus on what you will be happy to live and work with; you'll have to wake up every morning to this, so choose something that you know you won't get tired of easily.;
, It can be ideal to associate your interest with your room theme. There are many possibilities here. For example, if you like soccer, you can get a whole line of soccer-themed room accessories if you are up to it. If you just love those giraffes, you can get creative with tall brown and yellow furniture. Alternatively, if you are a fan of antiques, try collecting them for your room.


Imagine what items are associated with your topic. List as many ideas as you can about how you can connect your topic to your room. Remember to be creative and see this in ways you never thought of before.

, Maybe you love puppies and you are obsessed with poetry. Consider having poems about puppies, puppies reading poetry, and poems written inside images of puppies. Get creative with the ways that you express your interests.

, If you are a fan, it might help to put them into your theme. Perhaps you can decorate your room with posters from theme or, if you want to, get a bed-set featuring your favorite singer or actor. You can have multiple favorite actors in your theme ideas list, or just one. That is your choice.

, Whether it is bottle caps or chocolate bunnies, collections are an interesting part of a theme to consider and can help personalize your room. It helps even more if you already started the collection, so you have something unique from the start!

, For example, if the budget permits, you could consider hiring a professional painter to paint your room with racing cars, cartoon characters, or famous gymnasts.

, If you are having trouble deciding between themes, write down everything in a list. A list can help you organize your ideas so you know which ones to choose from.

, Think about your favorite color. Often, themes are based on a color, your favorite color. If you can't decide on one color, you can always pick two.


If you are a girly girl, you might want to pick the color pink.
If you like calm, soft colors, blue,green and purple would work.
If you like bright, jazzy colors, orange, red and yellow would make your room pop!
If you like green, then your room can be based on green and white colors or green and black.


A good idea is to add a neutral color to the bunch, to make it easier to match in many items.

, You may want to consider the color of the carpet or furniture. If you have red carpet, for example, the color orange probably would fit more than green. If you have blue furniture, purple would look better in your theme than yellow. On the other hand, orange carpet with blue is a bright contrast for those who are creative with their color palette.

, Your room doesn't just have to be one or two colors. If you want, splatter paint your walls with all kinds of colors and make your own pillowcases. Your theme can be anything you want, it's all up to you. After all, you're the one who sleeps in your bed every night. Make it something memorable.

, Both the theme ideas and color ideas on this list will be worked through in Part Three.

, Take a good look at your list of ideas and colors, then take the time to decide how it will work as a whole. It's recommended that you pull together a plan, which will cover your topic, color, favorite actor, interests, and collections all in one mega theme.


Cross reference things on your list to see what fits together, what clashes and what doesn't work at all. Cross off things you either don't like or can't fit together well.

, Once you have done that, consider your budget and go over the list again. The budget will help you to decide what is realistic and what is not affordable. However, don't despair if something seems too pricey–-consider what other ways you can still achieve what you're after, including sourcing things secondhand, checking online trade and auction sources and doing things smaller instead of doing away with them altogether.

, Once you've reconciled both theme and budget, it's time to get out there and pull together your theme.

Don't overdo on decorations.",How to Make Your Bedroom Look Cosy," The color of your bedroom walls can have a big impact on how you feel. Warm colors like oranges, reds, yellows, and earth tones can make even large rooms feel cosy and intimate.;
, You will also be able to hang more pictures and photos without worrying if it will clash. Neutral colors make your room feel larger. If you have a dark color like black or purple, it will seem smaller and cramped.

, Is it a small carpet, pillow, painting or photo frame? If possible, take that item to the store with you to look for similar paint colors.

, Get a large paint chip, usually around 8 x 10 inches, from your local paint store before you commit to a new color. You will probably have to order the larger samples and wait a few days to get them, but most stores will provide you with these free of charge.

, Select a range of shades in that color. For example, if you are thinking about red walls, choose a number of paint samples in red hues. A shade you think might not work in your room might very well turn out to be the best one for your new space.

, Paint a large piece of the board with your chosen shade to get a good idea of how it looks.

, Paint color can vary depending on the light so make note of how it looks in both natural light and artificial light at various points in the day. In general, natural lighting tends to show the true color of the paint.

, Try reds and browns, yellows and oranges or browns and golds. If you like darker, more dramatic colors but are afraid of painting your whole bedroom, you can paint that color on just one accent wall.

, You don’t need to use a dark shade to make your room feel cosy.

, Having a variety of light sources creates a warm, welcoming feeling in your room. If you only have one light source in your room, consider adding something new. You can experiment with placing them in different places until you get that “just right” feeling. Here are a few options to explore:

, Have at least one table lamp and a floor lamp with a dimmer switch so you can adjust the brightness according to need. Reading lights next to your bed are not only practical items but add to the overall ambience of your room.

, If you are concerned about having an open flame in your room, there are many different types of flameless (battery operated) candles that are safer than regular candles.

, You may need extra money to hire an electrician to do the work for you, but the results will be really beautiful.

, These are mounted directly on your wall and provide warm, indirect lighting that looks inviting.

, Changing the type of covering you have on your windows can improve the feel of your room. Many of the newer types of window treatments are designed to conserve energy and keep the cold or heat out without sacrificing on style.

, They come in a variety of colors and styles, and look softer and better made than vinyl blinds.

, These are made with a heavy-duty material that keeps the temperature in your room steady. Although the backing (the part facing outside) tends to be a rather dull color, the front of the curtains come in a huge range of color and textures.

, Look at drapes and window valances made out of soft, natural fibers like cotton, silk or wool. You can use energy efficient shades to block the light out, and then frame them with soft valances and drapes to add a bit more style to your room.

, These options may be a little more expensive than some of the choices above but are long lasting and beautiful – as well as green!

, You can get colored curtains, as long as they aren't hot pink or any bright color. Getting a light color for curtains will make your room feel more open because you can see through the window with a sheer one. If they are opened or closed they will not make a difference.

, Sometimes just adding a few inexpensive accents to a room can make it more comfortable and inviting. Even if you don’t have a lot of money, trying just one or two of the suggestions below can make your room cozier.

, Shag or deep pile rugs look cosy and will feel great on your feet!

, As your bed takes up a large portion of your room, this simple change and addition of color will alter the feeling of your room considerably. If you don’t have a lot of extra money to spend redecorating your room, spend what you have on new bedding!

, If you have a floor lamp, place that next to the reading chair to create a cosy reading nook in your bedroom.

, You can use it to sit in to watch TV, read or as a luxurious footrest after a long day.

, You can choose from luxury cable knit throws that look like overly large sweaters or simple and inexpensive fleece throws. Handmade items like quilts and knitted blankets will also add a sense of homey comfort to your bedroom.

, Using pillows with various textures, shapes and sizes will add a bit of interest and keep your room from looking overly coordinated.

, Mirrors reflect the light from the window so it will make your room feel more bright and spacious.

, If it is the beach, put some seashells or other decorations in your room. You can buy them at stores or just go to the beach and get some shells, driftwood, etc., for free.

, If you have a clock on the wall, cut out the watches on the JCPenny or Macy's magazines that come in your mail and put them in a circle around your clock.

, If someone comes into your room and looks around, you want them to see the a cozy room, not just a crazy bunch of decorations.

, Because you have so little space in your dorm, your bed is also your couch, your office... and your dinner table. Getting bedding with dark colors or prints makes it easier to camouflage any spills or stains.

, A sheet set includes pillowcases, a flat sheet, and a fitted sheet. You aren't going to want to do laundry very often but your sheets do need to be changed, so don't wait until Thanksgiving break to come home and ask Mom to wash your sheets.

Change your duvet to a higher tog rating.,
Change your other bedding.,
Purchase an electric blanket for instant warmth.,
Open your window.,
Hang robes and dressing gowns on your door or near your bed.,
If you have a wooden floor in your room, buy a rug.,
Light scented candles.,
Make sure your room gets plenty of sunlight.,
Make sure your bedding smells nice.,
If your room is really cold you could buy a space heater, there are many different types from gas to electric and big to small, some can also be used for AC in summer.,
Consider putting up some thicker curtains.,
Add some more lighting.,
Use a draft excluder by your bedroom door.",How to Make Your Room Comfortable in Winter," A good winter tog rating is usually 12 and upwards. For medium warmth, get a 9-11 one. If you sleep with someone else who doesn't feel the cold the way you do, look for a duvet with a warm and a cold side. These clever marriage savers, (well, argument avoiders any way) have a different tog on each side so one person can be warm and toasty and the other is pleasantly cool. An alternative to this is to have the bed made up with two single duvets of a tog that suits either person, in matching single duvets covers. To feel more like you are in bed together, put a double sheet under the duvets.;
, Thin cotton isn't great for winter, try brushed cotton which is warmer, or try jersey knit. Cotton flannel is good for a winter comforter too. Choose warm rich colors like red, plum, maroon, and brown which will give a cozier feeling. White also looks good in winter. Buy some chunky knit blankets for extra warmth at night. Quilted throws, Micro-fleece blankets and faux-fur throws are all good to snuggling up with too.

, Make hot water bottles at night, but only use them before you get into bed - never use a hot water bottle at the same time as using an electric blanket. Make sure you know how to operate your electric blanket safely. Ones with timers and dual controls for either side of the bed are strongly recommended. Switching it on 20 minutes before you go to bed so you hop into bed and it's all warm is lovely.

, Even in winter rooms need airing, so open your window for 10-20 minutes each day. Don't leave it open for as long as is needed in summer, and don't forget to close it. If you don't want to open the window, get a fan and leave it circulating for a while.

, When you get out of bed in the mornings in winter, you get cold quickly so it's good to have something to put on fast to keep the warmth in.

, It'll be nice and warm to step out onto when getting out of bed. Buy one in a warm color, such as red. A faux fur rug would feel cosy to walk on too

, Choose wintery warm scents, like cinnamon, chocolate, berry, and festive spice. It'll make your room feel cosy and it'll smell good too.

, It'll make it seem lighter and it's essential to get sunlight during the winter months to increase happiness.

, Use a fresh fabric conditioner when washing your sheets, as it'll help you sleep better.

, However space heaters can be very heavy on electric so be careful.

, Thick curtains in a warm color will help to keep out drafts, keep the heat in and make the room look warmer. If you like, you can match your curtains and duvet cover for a co-ordinated look.

, On cold winter nights, and dark winter mornings you may be getting dressed or undressed when it's still dark. Make sure the lights in your bedroom are adequate and if possible, adjustable so they don't make you feel too awake at bed too, or to drowsy in the morning. Remote control multi-colored, programmable LED light bulbs are available that you can set to come on when you wake up and fade off when you go to sleep. You could use a bright white/yellow tone in the morning and a warm orange/gold tone at night.

, You can buy some fun animal ones in attractive fabrics, plain ones or, make your own.

Take out all of your child(ren)'s toys.,
Work with your child(ren) to decide what to keep and what to toss.,
Reward your child(ren) for giving up some of their toys.",How to Organize a Playroom1," Spread them out on the playroom floor so you can get an idea of what you're dealing with.
, This might sound like a Herculean task, but there are some methods, listed below, that you can use to convince your kids to get rid of some of their toys.

Show them how much they have. Indicate toys they haven't played with in a long time; tell them that other children would be happy to have those toys and (if they're little) that the toys will get to make new friends and start a happy new life.
Remind them of how difficult it is to play in a cluttered room. In a cluttered room there's no space for them to set up a dollhouse or a toy train track. They might trip and they can't move around well, and they might lose their favorite stuffed animals under a pile of other stuff.
Tell them that giving away toys that are ""too young"" for them or toys they just don't play with will make room for newer, more interesting toys they might get for their birthday or Christmas.
Tell them that giving things up is a part of growing up and being a big kid.
Stay side-by-side with them the whole time to keep their spirits up and encourage them. Try to make it as pleasant an experience as you can.
Start small; ask them to find five or ten toys (depending on how many they have) that they would be okay with giving up.

, Praise them and tell them how proud you are, and that they've made a big step in growing up. If they seem sad about it or you feel like they've earned a special treat, take them to get ice cream or get them a toy they've wanted for some time (and tell them that they can have it because there's enough space now)."

Sort everything in the playroom into categories.,
Get containers and shelving.,
Split larger categories into smaller categories.,
Consider getting a toy box for your child's favorite toys.",How to Organize a Playroom2," Make a pile of stuffed animals, a pile of dolls, a pile of board games, a pile of art supplies, and so on. Making a pile of your child's absolute favorite toys may be a good idea, too., Square or cubby shelving could work well, and clear plastic bins allow the child(ren) to see the contents of a particular container. (Make sure you measure both shelving and bins so you can be sure the bins will fit.) Label bins, too, if your child is old enough to read., You might not be able to fit all the stuffed animals, for instance, into a single container. If this is the case, divide this category further; for instance, into ""Dogs and Cats"" and ""Other Critters."", If a child plays with a certain toy every day, they probably won't want to pull out a bin from the shelves over and over again. A toy box  could be a good solution."
"
Avoid showering your kid(s) in toys.,
Establish rules about cleaning up.,Enjoy seeing your child's free, organized play space.",How to Organize a Playroom3," Your organizational efforts will go to waste if your child's toy collection outgrows them. Balance toys the child receives with toys he/she gives away., For instance, a playroom rule could be that only five toys can be out at a time, or that the room must be cleaned up before bedtime or leaving the house. Hold your child accountable for this; you have set up a simple system for them to follow, so they should follow it.,"

Match the frame to the fabric.,
Choose the best composition.,
Iron the fabric.,
Place the backing over the fabric.,
Trim the edges of the fabric.,
Put the frame back together.,
Use as desired.",How to Frame Fabric1," You might find it easiest to choose the fabric you want to frame first. After you've settled on one, look for a frame that coordinates well with the color and style of the fabric.


You have various options to work with when selecting the fabric you want to frame. For something easy to work with, a fabric with a continuous, symmetrical pattern is a good choice. For something bolder and more eye-catching, look for larger prints.
Home decorator fabric works especially well due to its dimensions and weight, but you can choose lighter fabrics, as well. You will need anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 yard (22.86 to 45.72 cm) of fabric.
The frame should also be the right size to adequately showcase the pattern of the fabric.
If you have an elaborate print, consider using a simpler frame so that the print becomes the focal point. In contrast, if you have a simpler or smaller print, try spicing it up with a decorative or vintage frame.;
, Remove the glass and place the frame over the fabric with both the frame and the fabric facing right-side-up. Move the frame around until you figure out the best portion of the fabric to frame.


You might want to consider wearing gloves when you remove the glass to protect your hands from any sharp edges.
Note that this step is much easier if you have a continuous, symmetrical pattern since there will not be much variation no matter where you place the frame. If you chose a fabric with a larger print, though, you might have to play around with it for a while before you find a composition that appeals to your aesthetic sense.

, After figuring out the portion of fabric you want to frame, make sure that this portion is wrinkle-free. Use an iron to remove any creases or wrinkles.


Alternatively, you could iron the entire piece of fabric before choosing your composition. Ironing it after you make your selection allows you to focus your efforts on one specific patch of fabric, though, thereby saving time.
Make sure that you pay attention to the make of the fabric before you iron it. Heavier fabrics need a stronger heat setting while light or delicate fabrics need very low heat, if they can tolerate heated ironing at all.

, With the fabric wrong-side-up, place the backing of the frame right-side-up on top of it.


Make sure that the portion of the fabric you selected for your composition is centered under the backing. You may wish to trim the fabric before doing this step, but make sure that you have plenty of overhang to play with if you decide to do so.

, Cut the edges of the fabric so that there are 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) of overhang past the backing on either side. You may opt to either attach the fabric to the backing or leave it free.


Trim the top and bottom so that they are practically flush with the backing of the frame. Doing so will prevent the fabric from bunching up.
Do not make the sides flush with the backing, though, since the fabric could end up sliding around inside the frame if it matches the dimensions of the frame perfectly.
If you want to attach the fabric to the backing, you could use spray adhesive or staples to do so.

, Carefully place the glass back into the frame, followed by the fabric and the backing. Pull the fabric taut once more before securing the frame to the backing.


You could also leave the glass off if you want the texture of the fabric to stand out more.
Make sure that a little of the fabric sticks out of the back on either side of the frame. This will help you tighten, straighten, and otherwise adjust the fabric after you place the frame on.

, This completes the project. You should now be able to use your framed fabric to adorn and beautify your walls.

Paint decorations, like flowers or stars, onto the wall.,
Add her name or other words to the wall.",How to Paint a Girl's Bedroom," Not every little girl loves pink. If you do not already know, ask the girl in question what her favorite color is before deciding how to paint her room. Either paint the walls with that hue or choose a paint color that could coordinate well with accessories in that color.;
, If the girl in question has a particular interest, you may want to consider filling her room with furniture and decorations that pay homage to that interest. Paint color can be used to tie a theme together.


Use pink or purple to complete a ballerina or princess room.
Stick with blues and sandy beiges for a beach theme.
Opt for greens and yellows to complete a garden theme.

, Choosing a paint scheme that specifically appeals to a little girl may mean that you have to repaint again in another few years, once her interests or tastes change. A neutral paint color may seem dull on its own, but you can jazz the room up with bright color accents in the form of comforters, pillows, lampshades, paintings, and other decorations.

, Pink and purple are the quintessential girl colors and create a classically girly room. Use soft pinks and lavenders for a delicate appearance or bolder shades for a more vibrant option.

, A light buttercup yellow reflects light and creates a more luminous area, a bolder yellow fills the room with energy and life, and a golden shade creates a warm, mature ambiance. Nearly any shade will add a hint of sunshine to a girl’s room, however.


Accent yellow with blues or greens commonly found in nature to invite the outside in.

, For instance, try painting one wall dark brown while painting the other three light pink. Doing this may extend the life and appeal of the color scheme. The boost of maturity provided by a sophisticated hue will allow an otherwise childish paint scheme to grow with her.

, Girlhood is often associated with innocence and delicacy. To draw out this mood, choose pastel hues of nearly any color, from powder blue to blush pink to peach.

, Sherbet hues like lemon, lime, and orange are cheery and playful, but with the right accessories, they can transform from a child's playground into a teen's paradise. As a result, you may not need to repaint when the girl in question gets older.

, Childhood is a time filled with energy and excitement. Bright colors can match this energy, and bright, contrasting colors are especially effective at doing so. Try high-contrast combinations like green and pink or yellow and purple.

, Use whites, creams, and blush pinks. The softness of this style appeals to traditionally girly girls, but the sophistication of this style may also make it desirable for older girls, as well.

, A standard white ceiling keeps the focus on the walls and furnishings, but a color grabs the eye and makes the ceiling a part of the décor.


In general, light shades work best because they keep the room looking open. Dark shades can seem overwhelming, if not threatening.
Blue can mimic the sky, giving the room a very natural ambiance.

, Patterns on the wall are an easy way to make a room look more playful and visually interested. Stripes are probably the easiest, but dots are also fairly doable.


Choose varying shades of the same hue for a subtle hint of contrast.
Use contrasting colors to give the room a funky, energetic twist.

, If you have a steady enough hand and enough artistic talent, you can paint pictures on the wall. Flowers, swirling vines, butterflies, and stars can transform even the plainest of walls into a magical scene, transporting the room’s occupant to a world of imagination.

, You can use stencils to paint letters on the wall, or you can try free-handing it if you feel confident about the steadiness and gracefulness of your strokes.


Including her name personalizes her room, making it feel as though it truly belongs to her and her alone.
Painting an encouraging quote, verse, proverb, or saying on a wall can act as a source of inspiration for the girl as she grows and goes about her days.

Iron the fabric.,
Choose the best composition.,
Cut the fabric.,
Place the canvas over the fabric.,
Staple along opposite sides.,
Staple along the top and bottom.,
Fold the corners.,
Use as desired.",How to Frame Fabric2," If the fabric has any creases or wrinkles in it, use an iron to remove them. Otherwise, these wrinkles could ruin the final look of your project.


Make sure that you pay attention to the make of the fabric before you iron it. Heavier fabrics need a stronger heat setting while light or delicate fabrics need very low heat, if they can tolerate heated ironing at all.
You could wait to choose your desired composition before ironing the fabric, if desired. Ironing the entire piece of fabric gives you more room to play with, but ironing it after you make your selection allows you to focus your efforts on one specific patch of fabric.

, Place the fabric right-side-up over the canvas. Gently move it around until you find a swatch of fabric that looks great when restrained to the dimensions of your canvas.


If you have a fabric with a small, symmetrical, and continuous print, choosing an exact composition is not as important since the final product will look the same no matter which section of the fabric you choose. This step is significant, however, if you are working with a large print or asymmetrical pattern.

, Trim the fabric with scissors so that you have 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) of excess fabric along each edge of the canvas.


Trimming the fabric with the right-side-up can make it easier to keep your desired composition centered over the canvas.
Make sure that you have enough excess fabric around each side to fold over the edge and onto the back of the canvas frame.

, Flip the fabric so that it is wrong-side-up and center the canvas, wrong-side-up, on top of it.


The canvas must be centered over the fabric to maintain the proper composition and to verify that all of the edges will be able to fold onto the back as needed.

, Staple the center left side of the fabric to the back of the canvas. Pull the fabric taut and repeat with the right side. Continue stapling the left and right sides in this manner, pulling the fabric taut before placing each staple.


Work from the center out, eventually moving toward the edge of the canvas frame.
You will usually need about five to seven staples per edge.
If you are working with an electric staple gun, you must put the safety on when you are not actively working with it. You should also unplug it when not in use or if you need to walk away for some reason during the middle of the process.
Pulling the fabric taut means that it should look smooth over the front, but it should not look stretched or stressed, either.

, Use the same procedure you used for attaching the sides of the fabric to attach the top and bottom of the fabric, as well. Continue pulling the fabric taut before placing each staple.


Staple the center top of the fabric to the back of the canvas frame. Pull the fabric taut and repeat with the bottom side. Continue stapling the top and bottom in this manner until the fabric is completely secured to the canvas frame.
Do not worry about the corners as you staple. Those will be taken care of afterward.

, Fold the overhanging corners “wrapping paper style” and tuck them into the fabric along the back to keep them hidden. They should not be visible from the front.


Fold each corner so that the tip points inward and the two edges creating it are smooth. Staple in place.
You can cut off the extra corner fabric afterward, or you can tuck it into the fold you just created and staple it in place once more.

, This completes the process. Your canvas-framed fabric should now be ready for display.

Iron the fabric.,
Position the fabric in the embroidery hoop.,
Line the wrong side of the hoop with glue.,
Press the fabric into the glue.,
Trim the fabric.,
Use as desired.",How to Frame Fabric3," If your fabric has any creases or wrinkles, iron them out before proceeding further.


Make sure that you pay attention to the make of the fabric before you iron it. Heavier fabrics need a stronger heat setting while light or delicate fabrics need very low heat, if they can tolerate heated ironing at all.

, With the fabric right-side-up, glide the embroidery hoop over it until you find a section you would like to frame and display. Open the hoop and slide that section of fabric inside before closing the hoop again.


Pull the fabric taut before closing the embroidery hoop. The fabric should appear smooth but not stretched.
If you are working with a fabric that has a small, continuous pattern, you only need to center the hoop in the middle of the fabric since the display will look identical no matter which section of fabric you place in the hoop. For larger or uneven patterns, you may need to spend more time choosing a portion of fabric to center and display.
Note that the fabric must be at least 2 inches (5 cm) wider than the embroidery hoop in all directions. Get an even larger piece of fabric if you need to play around with the the positioning since you will need at least 2 inches (5 cm) of overhang on each side of the hoop.

, Turn the fabric and hoop over so that the wrong-side of the fabric faces up. Apply craft glue to the backside of the inner ring of the embroidery hoop.


You could also use hot glue or fabric glue.
Apply a small yet continuous line all around the hoop, placing it just next to the fabric.

, Fold the excess fabric over the line of glue, pressing it in securely. Let the glue dry.


The fabric should be stuck to embroidery hoop ring all the way around. If there are any places that are not secure after the glue dries, reapply more glue to those places and try again.

, Cut away the excess fabric so that no ends are visible from the front of the hoop.


Make sure that you trim away enough fabric to prevent frayed edges from peeking over the sides of the embroidery hoop. If this is impossible, line the cut edges of the fabric with anti-fray adhesive to prevent the fabric from unraveling.

, This completes the process. You can hang the embroidery hoop framed fabric on its own or create several more coordinating pieces to display together.

Hang the mirror.",How to Hang a Mirror," The best way to use mirrors in decorating is to use them to create depth. Place them in smaller or narrower rooms to make the room seem larger.;
, Reflecting light is another great way to use mirrors in decorating. Place them opposite of a window, especially in rooms that have only one window, to double the amount of light in a room.

, If you have a large space to fill and you don't want to spend a fortune on a big mirror, you can also use multiple small mirrors to fill the space instead. Get mirrors in matching styles and hang them collage-style.


If the mirror frames don't match color-wise, you can paint them to all have the same frame color, creating a united look.

, Your mirror placement should also take practicality into account. Placing a mirror near, for example, the front door is more useful than in a room like an office.

, Too many mirrors in a home and you'll be venturing dangerously into 1970s decorating territory. A good rule of thumb is 2 mirrors per level on your house (not counting your bathroom).

, Studs are the wooden frame pieces which act as the structural support for a wall. If you're not anchoring your mirror in your studs, reconsider. If you put a nail in something that's not a stud, even if you use something like a screw anchor to add support, you run the risk of driving a nail into something you don't want to hit, such as a pipe or electrical wire.

, The stud is part of the inner frame of the wall and is usually needed to hang items that are on the heavier side. The easiest way to find the stud, of course, is to use an electronic device specifically for this purpose. You can purchase them from just about any hardware store and they range from $10-40 (USD) in cost.


There are stud finders that use a magnet to locate the stud based on nails that may be in the wall and stud finders that work by testing the density of the wall. The magnetic stud finders are usually cheaper but might not work as well.

, If you don't want to use a stud finder, you can locate a stud by using your ears. Knock on your wall with your fist. If the wall is made using modern methods (built after ~1950), you should hear a hollow, deeper, longer echo when you knock on an empty part of the wall and a short, higher-pitched sound when you knock on a stud.

, There are other indicators of a stud if the knocking method isn't working or you want to double check for the stud location.Look for outlets. Outlets will be built into a box which is anchored on a stud. If you find an outlet, the edge of the stud is probably within 2"" from the edge of plate.
Look for windows. Windows are also built between studs, so a window can similarly indicate a stud.
Look for molding nails. Molding and trim is usually nailed into a stud, so you can check your molding for nail placement.

, In most modern construction, studs are 16"" from center to center. In older homes (built roughly before 1950 or so) the studs are placed 24"" or less apart. If you find one stud, it will make it much easier to find another.


Studs are also located in the corners of rooms. Another way to find a stud would be to measure from said corner.

, Once you think you've found a stud, test to be sure by hammering a nail into the spot in question. If it goes in like a knife cutting through butter, you missed the stud. If, however, it gets more and more difficult to get it to go in, you found a stud.

, An extra hand (and eye) can be handy during this part of the process. Get a friend to help you!

, Will the mirror need a hook? A peg? One or two? You'll need to know in order to plan where you will place the anchor points., Trace the mirror onto a large piece of cardboard. You can then place tape on the cardboard and place it on the wall, moving it as necessary and even testing it out in different locations. Use a level to get it straight and then mark the location on the wall with a pencil., Place the mirror on the wall at roughly the height you'd like it to be at and then mark the upper or lower edge with a pencil. Next, use a level and a measuring tape to make sure that the bottom guide line is straight. Measure the height of the mirror and then mark the upper guide line using that measurement.

, The old adage holds true: it's better to be extra, super sure that everything is correctly measured and prepared than have your mirror come crashing down on your feet.

, There are a number of commercial adhesives which work well for hanging this type of mirror. Command adhesive strips are the most popular brand in the US and work well. Make sure that whatever strips you buy are appropriate for the weight you want to support.

, Place the adhesives on the back of the mirror as listed in the instructions for your product. You should have roughly one strip to each corner.

, Place the mirror where you want it to go. You'll essentially only have one chance, so this is a good reason to outline your mirror location on your wall if possible.

, With Command and similar strips, they can usually be removed without leaving a mark on the wall, so don't worry if you have to remove the mirror in the future. Just be careful to attach and remove them correctly.

, With heavy mirrors, it's a really good idea to have at least one contact point in a stud. Try to be sure that you place your mirror so that it can hang from at least one stud.

, Place a strip of painter's tape on the back of your mirror going just over or just under the hanging hardware. Mark on the tape the spots where the mirror will hang from. This will give you the distance between your two wall contact points.


Most heavy mirrors come with hardware attached at the back for hanging. If they don't, however, use the steps in Method 4 to attach a picture wire.

, Measure the distance from the top of the mirror down to where the attachment hardware is. Then, mark this distance on your wall down from the line you made for where you would like the upper edge of your mirror to be.

, Place the painter's tape on your wall, so that the marks are level with the hang height you found in the previous step. This will show you where to place your nail or screw. Mark this location with a marker or leave the tape in place. Just be sure that it is level.

, The contact points, in this case a nail or screw, will need to be placed securely in your wall. You will definitely want at least 2 points, more if your mirror is very wide. Insert a screw into a stud at the location you found, or, if you must install a contact point where there is no stud, place an anchor and then the included screw.

, Once you have your wall contact point or points in place, hang your mirror, being careful not to let the mirror go until you're sure it's firmly in place and the hooks are able to support the weight.

, If the mirror is heavy, you'll want to try to get your wall contact points anchored in a stud. Since the brackets that will support this type of mirror don't need to be anywhere to specific underneath the mirror, this is not as hard as it might sound.

, For the bottom, you'll want to get 2 J brackets, with a cradle wide enough for the thickness of your mirror. For the top, you'll want to sliding J brackets, which are J brackets that come with a separate piece that they slide and lock into.

, Install the lower brackets into the stud, at the line you measured in the section on lining up your mirror. They should preferably come at least 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) in from the outside corners. If you cannot install them into a stud, be sure to use an anchor.

, Install the upper bracket holder according to the manufacturer's instructions. Make sure that it is not too high. Place the J bracket just inside the holder, making sure not to lock it into a lower position.

, Slide your mirror into place. If it is heavy, get help.

, Lower the upper bracket until it holds the mirror securely in place.

, Attach D-rings or loops to the back of the mirror at two places so that they point towards where the mirror will be hanging from. A wire will go between the rings to hang the mirror on.

, Get a picture wire from your local hardware shop. Thread the wire between the rings then twist the end several times to create a strong connection.


Make it long enough to go between the two D rings and reach the place where the mirror should hang at. You will also need to leave some extra to wrap and attach to the rings.

, If the mirror is light, one hook should be enough. If it is heavy, you will need two. If placing two, try to place them around 4-8"" apart (depending on the width of the mirror). They should leave room for the mirror to hang, not being so high that you can see the wire once it's up or so low that the mirror is difficult to adjust or won't hang at all.


If your contact points are on a stud, a nail, screw or hook can go straight in and no other pieces of hardware are necessary.
If your contact points are not on a stud, you will need to use anchors or thick-threaded screws (anchors are preferable). Install the anchors and then hang the mirror from the included screw.

, Once you have your wall contact point or points and hanging wire in place, hang your mirror, being careful not to let the mirror go until you're sure it's firmly in place and the hooks are able to support the weight.

Clean up.,
Decorate your walls with art.,
Choose new linens for your bed.,
Put personal mementos on display.,
Use rugs to decorate the floor.,
Keep plants in your room for a natural touch.",How to Make Your Bedroom Better1," If your bedroom is dirty or chaotic, this is perhaps the most important thing you can do to make it look better. It's also an important first step before you do anything else in this article — it's hard to redecorate when you're stepping over piles of clothes on the floor.


See our article on cleaning your room for tips. If your room is just a little out-of-order, you may just need to put away whatever you have laying out. However, if it's been a while since you last cleaned, be ready to dust, vacuum, and clean your surfaces to get them looking as good as possible.;
, Are your walls bare and boring? Give yourself something more pleasant to look at. Artwork is great for giving your room a more vibrant appearance. Paintings, sketches, posters, and similar decorations all work well for covering up boring walls. You can even get creative here — for instance, a cardboard cutout from your favorite movie can be quite a conversation piece.


If you're an artist, don't be embarrassed to put your own artwork on the walls. You can also find wall art for fairly cheap at flea markets, thrift stores, and similar places.

, Since your bed takes up a lot of space in your room, sprucing it up can change the look of the whole room. Pick a new set of linens for your bed that pair well with each other as well as the other decorations you have in your room. Picking something dramatically different from your last set of sheets will usually give the most noticeable change.


The changes you make here depend on your budget. If you have the money, you can get new covers, new pillows, a new bed frame, or all of the above.
As a general rule, you won't want to pair too many eye-catching designs with each other. Try picking a blanket with a bright color or bold pattern, then using neutral colors like white, black, grey, and so on for the rest of your linens.

, One way to decorate your room and simultaneously make a statement about yourself is to show off things that you enjoy. For instance, if you're a track and field athlete, you might try displaying a competition javelin on top of your bookcase. If you're a musician, use a stand to display your guitar in the corner. If you love reading, fill a bookcase with antique hardcover books.


What you choose is up to you — only you know what you're interested in.

, If you have a hardwood floor, rugs are a natural choice of decoration. Old, intricately-designed rugs are sometimes for sale at flea markets, but furniture stores also sell good-looking modern rugs at reasonable prices as well. Rugs can also make rooms warmer and reduce annoying echoes from having lots of hard surfaces.If you buy a used rug, you may want to clean it before using it in your room. See our guide to cleaning rugs with vinegar for one low-cost option.

, Small houseplants can make rooms seem lively and inviting. Flowers can even add splashes of vibrant color for visual variety. Try placing a small potted plant near a window where it will get plenty of sun. Water the plant regularly and prune unwanted growth to keep it looking tidy. Pay attention to any special instructions provided with the plant when you bought it.


Be sure to discard any dead leaves as the plant loses them to avoid a mess.

Obtain the necessary materials.,
Bend the wire hanger into a circle.,
Bend the hook of the hanger so that it is at a 90 degree angle with the hoop.,
Cut the cardboard to the size and shape of your liking.,
Decorate the hoop and backboard to your liking.,
Tape the hoop to the backboard.,
Attach a net to the basketball rim (optional).,
Hang the completed basket to a wall or door.",How to Make an Inside Basketball Hoop for Your Room1," Though you don't need much to create a the basket, it will come together very quickly if you find all the parts before you start.You will need:


A wire hanger. It cannot be a partially metal hanger made substantially of wood or plastic.
A large, flat piece of cardboard.
The tape of your choosing. Marking tape may be the easiest to work with; duct tape would certainly make the hoop durable.
Markers or paint.
Scissors.
String (optional).;
, You do not even have to dismantle the hanger, but just reshape it into a hoop.

, Do not cut away the hook, as it still can be of some use.

, Standard high school, college, and NBA backboards are rectangular, if you are looking to replicate that appearance.


Try to make sure the relative scare of the hoop and backboard seem reasonable. For comparative purposes, an NBA backboard is 6 feet wide, while the basket opening is 18 inches (1.5 feet). That means the basket width is 1/4 (or 25%) as wide.

, Traditional hoops are painted red, but you can certainly customize it to fit whatever you desire. The backboard of most high schools, colleges, and all NBA franchises are now made of transparent glass; as there is no transparent cardboard, you can really be as creative as you want.

, You can attach the hook (which you bent up earlier) to lower back side of the backboard. Make sure the rim is as close to the backboard as possible.

, You can make make a net out of string, or even out of twisted tape.

, Masking tape will work well for this purpose, as it will not leave a sticky mess behind like duct tape would. There are two different taping methods you can employ.


You can tape along the front perimeter of the backboard and extend the tape onto the wall to secure it.
Alternatively, you can make tape hoops (by attaching a single piece of tape to itself, end-to-end with the sticky side out) and use these to attach the backboard to the selected surface.

Save any calendar pages that are suitable for framing in a file folder.,
Hang on to any frames that can be re-used and made to look like new, with maybe a touch-up of Antique Gold paint.,
You can go to any picture framing shop, in order to have your picture matted and framed.,
Framing the calendar picture yourself isn't a bad idea; however, you may still need for the matte to be specially cut.,
If you find the hole in the calendar picture to be disruptive, the easiest solution is to go to your local Home Depot or paint store, and match a paper paint sample to the color surrounding the hole.,
Another technique is to cut a sheet of poster board to the size of the frame you are using.,
A third technique is to cut a sheet of poster board down to size, and then glue fabric of a texture and color that complements the picture, and mount the picture on top of the poster board before framing.

,
An alternative great idea for old images from calendars is to carefully cut them out and then laminate them.",How to Frame Images from Calendars," Keep them in a file cabinet or in a carrying case until you get the supplies.;
, Wooden frames can easily be polished up to look like new, if they are not chipped. Look at this article: How to Restore and Use an Old Picture Frame

, (This can cost upwards of $75 for one picture, easily between $150 and $300). Keep this in mind when you choose your frame.

, Some art stores sell mat board, you can cut to size of the picture (the outer but not the inner cut). You can then attach the picture on top of the mat board and place it in an appropriate frame.

, Attach the colour square behind the hole.

, Depending on the style of the picture, you can design your own mat using various colors or patterns of paper.

,, They make unique and practical place-mats! Especially great for kids, because you can find really specific images to them and write on them as well, before lamination.

Remove or rearrange your furniture for more space.,
Change your lighting situation.,
Consider re-painting.,
Color-coordinate your room.,
Make a DIY piece of furniture.,
Consider keeping an indoor pet.",How to Make Your Bedroom Better2," Over time, bedrooms have a tendency to get cramped and cluttered. Try breathing new life into your room by removing unnecessary furniture until you're left with the ""bare necessities."" The extra space can make your room seem like a whole new (much larger) place.


You may also be able to simply move the furniture around to get a similar effect. For instance, if your bed takes up lots of space in the middle of the room, push it against the wall to free up floor area and create the impression of open space.

, There are many exciting ways to give your room a new lighting setup. For example, you might try stringing holiday lights along the ceiling for a festive glow at night. If you find that your room is a little dark and dingy at night, put a retro lamp from the local thrift store in the corner to give your room a little more light.


Changing your lighting can also mean changing your windows. For instance, a new set of curtains can be a good investment. Thick drapes can keep your room dark in the mornings to help you sleep in. Thinner curtains can let the light shine through, casting a colored glow across your room.

, Painting is messy and takes time, but it can make your room look like an entirely different place. Pick a light, neutral color for your bedroom. Shades like white, grey, light blue, sea foam green, and lavender tend to be best. Darker, more bold colors can be distracting and make your bedroom look more like a hotel room than someplace you actually live.


If you don't own the house (like if you're living at home or renting), ask for permission before you start painting.
See our painting guide for help.

, If you're willing to put in the effort, coordinating all the colors in your room can make it look like it's been professionally-designed. Pick two or three of your favorite colors, then pick furniture, curtains, and bed linens that mostly match. Again, lighter, more neutral shades tend to work best here.


wikiHow's guide to matching colors can help you pick colors that look appealing together.

, Building your own furniture takes time, energy, and know-how, but it will make your bedroom uniquely your own. The most difficult, time-intensive option is probably to build your furniture from raw materials like lumber, etc. A much easier option is to buy old or damaged furniture and fix it up, modifying it in the process. An added benefit of this approach is that worn-out furniture is usually quite cheap. Try looking in the ""free"" section of classified sites like Craigslist for great deals.


One fairly easy example is to make a backrest for your bed. In its most basic form, this can be made by nailing wooden boards together in a square panel. Paint or decorate the side that faces the rest of the bed, then connect it to the bed frame.

, Pets that can spend most of their time in a small enclosed area make good choices for bedroom companions. These sorts of pets require daily work to feed, clean, and care for, so they're semi-major responsibilities. However, with diligent care, they can make great companions for years (and you'll always have something to talk about when someone new your bedroom for the first time).


Fish, lizards, insects, and small mammals like hamsters are examples of animals that can be kept in a bedroom in a cage or tank.

Obtain the necessary materials to make the hoop.,
Cut the paper into a perfect square.,
Fold the paper in half top-to-bottom, and then unfold it.,
Then fold and unfold the paper again, this time left-to right.,
Fold and unfold the paper along both diagonals.,
Fold all four of the mid-side crease points together at once.,
Curt two adjacent tips of the paper toward each other to make a hoop.,
Attach the basket to a wall with tape.",How to Make an Inside Basketball Hoop for Your Room2," You will only need:Scissors.
Paper (best if it is somewhat rigid).
Tape

, Any size will do, but obviously a small sheet of paper will make a small hoop.

, You will create a crease that ends at the midpoint of the top and bottom sides.

, Make sure that you make all of your folds in the same direction; in other words, do not make one fold toward you and the other fold away from you. All of the creases (including those in the next step) must leave an imprint on the paper point the same direction.

, Make sure that each corner and the sides match up perfectly as you fold. The paper should now have four creases in it, and will almost take a pyramid shape if left to sit on its own. It will only come together correctly if all four of the creases meet at a single central point.

, Do not bent against the creases you created earlier. As you bend the four together, the diagonal creases will flow outward. The paper should appear to be a triangle if looked at from the side and a four-pointed star if viewed from above.

, You may be able to get the hoop to maintain its shape just by flexing the paper (especially if the paper is rigid). If the paper will not maintain the hoop shape on its own, you can tape the tips together.


The tip of the triangle or pyramid from earlier is now usually considered the top. As you fold the tips together you may note how easily they form a basket that opens wider toward the top.

, Again, masking tape usually works best."

Find the right wall space.,
Use a 4D or 6D nail.,
Drive the nail at a 45 degree downward angle.,
Attach a d-ring to the painting.,
Hang the painting.",How to Hang a Painting1," When you have a small painting, between one and three square feet, you shouldn’t hang it on a big empty wall by itself. You’ll make the painting look even smaller. So find a small section of wall or choose a few other paintings to hang with it. Hang the artwork at eye level, around 60”.Small paintings are great to hang around larger paintings to offset them and create some balance. You can also hang a collection of small paintings in a pattern.;
, As long as your painting is less than about 5 pounds, a regular finish nail will be sufficient to hold it, even in drywall. The nail should be around 1 ½”(3.8 cm). Definitely don’t use a nail that is over 2” (5 cm) because it will end up being too long.Don’t use a nail that is less than 1” (2.5 cm) because most walls will be at least that thick and the nail won’t be long enough
If you know that your walls are made of brick or plaster, use a screw rather than a nail. Use screws that still have a small head on them.

, Many people make the mistake of pounding a nail straight into the wall, but this is not the most stable way. Gently hit the nail into the wall so the head is angled up toward the ceiling. Leave about ½” (1.3 cm) sticking out of the wall.








If you have a small hammer, use this rather than a large carpenter’s hammer. A 20 or 24 oz hammer is too heavy and might damage the wall.

, These hooks are standard for hanging artwork. Measure the width of the painting and make a mark in the middle of the top on the back. Attach the hanger here. Make sure it is centered so the painting will hang straight.If you purchased the artwork or frame, it may have a hanger attached already.
You can pick up d-ring hangers at most hardware and home improvement stores.

, The d-ring hangs right on the nail. Step back at least five feet from the artwork and look at it to see if it is straight. If there is someone else around, it is good to have a second person take a look to see if they think it is straight as well.

Measure the plate.,
Buy a wire hanger.,
Attach the hanger to the plate.,
Hammer a nail into the wall.,
Hang the plate.",How to Hang a Plate1," Wire plate hangers come in different sizes, so you need to know the size of the plate before you can purchase the hangers. Use a ruler or tape measure to determine the vertical length of your plate.


If you have a simple circular plate, you only need to know the diameter. Similarly, if you have a perfectly square plate, you only need to know the length of one side.
If you have a plate with uneven sides, like an oval or a rectangle, first determine which side will be the vertical side when you hang it. Measure the length of that side and choose your hangers based on that.;
, You should be able to buy a standard wire plate hanger at most hardware stores and craft stores. Look for the size that best fits the dimensions of your plate.


Usually, the different size ranges are:

5 to 7 inches (13 to 18 cm)
8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm)
10 to 14 inches (25 to 35 cm), holding up to 30 lbs (13.6 kg)
14 to 20 inches (35 to 51 cm)



, There should be two wired ends attached by a long spring. The single wire piece with the pointed center should be hooked over the front top of the plate from the back, and the two-wire end should be hooked over the front bottom of the plate from the back.


Note that the spring connecting both ends should be hidden behind the plate.
Due to the placement of the spring, the plate will stick out from the wall a bit. Take that into consideration when using these hangers.
These hangers work best with plates that are fairly normal in shape and size. If you have to distort the springs too much to make the wires fit, the plate will be unstable and more likely to fall off the wall.

, Decide where you want the plate to be on the wall and mark the spot with a pencil. Hammer a nail into that spot. At least half of the nail should be inside the wall, but you should also make sure that there is plenty of nail space for the hanger to rest on.


To determine where you want the plate, hold it up against the wall and move it around until you find the right spot. Lightly mark the top of the plate with a pencil.

Set the plate down, then measure the distance between the top of the plate and the pointed top of the hook. Make another mark on the wall the same distance away from your original mark.
The nail should be hammered into this second mark.



, Carefully hang the pointed end of the top hanger onto the nail on your wall. This should complete the process.


Check the plate after you hang it. If it is not evenly aligned, you may need to readjust the positioning of your hangers on the plate.
If the plate does not seem secure, change the position of the hanger or nail until it does. Alternatively, try a different hanging method.

Weigh your picture.,
Determine the kind of wall you are using.,
Decide where to hang your picture.,
Mark where you will drill or nail your wall fastener.,
Add a second hanging point.",How to Hang a Heavy Picture1," The weight of your painting will determine what fasteners and technique you will use to attach it to your wall. Heavier pictures and mirrors require special materials based on their weight. Use a regular bathroom scale to determine the exact weight of your picture.


Pictures up to 10lbs are considered light loads, 10-25lbs are considered medium loads, and 25-50lbs are heavy loads. Check the packaging on the wall fasteners before using, as they will usually give a weight range for intended use. ;
, Older homes from the 1940s or earlier tend to have plaster walls. Most modern homes use drywall. You can also hang heavy pictures on brick, mortar, and ceramic tile with the necessary tools and approach.

, Find a spot where you would like to hang your picture or mirror and hold it against the wall. Consider hanging your picture at eye-level height as a general rule of thumb. Mark the top of the frame with a pencil or a piece of painter's tape. , Use a measuring tape to determine what point on the wall to hang your picture from. Depending on the kind of frame you are hanging, the frame may hang lower on the fastener.


If the frame has a D-ring or other metal loop on the back, simply measure from the top of the frame to the height of the ring. Measure this distance down from the mark you made on the wall with pencil or painter's tape. Mark this new spot in pencil with an X. This will be where you drill or nail a fastener into the wall. If the frame has a wire across the back, pull up on the wire with the tape measure to it's highest possible point. Measure from this point to the top of the frame. Remove the tape measure and measure this distance down from the original mark you made on the wall with pencil or painter's tape. Mark this new spot in pencil with an X. This will be where you drill or nail a fastener into the wall. , For added strength, consider hanging the picture from two points in the wall. This is especially recommended for heavy loads. If the frame hangs from a wire, use two fingers to hold the wire at the desired hanging points. The farther apart they are, the more stable the painting will hang. Measure from these two points with a tape measure to the top of the frame and transfer the measurement to the wall using a pencil.


You can also hold a scrap piece of wood about half the width of the frame under the hanging wire to determine the two hanging points. The two corners of the wood will be where you will hang the fasteners. Measure the distance between the wood and the top of the frame using a tape measure and place the wood on the wall underneath your original mark using that measure. Using a level to make sure it is even, draw a line across the top of the wood. The two end points of the line will be where you hang your two fasteners.

Hang the mirror.",How to Hang a Heavy Mirror," Pick a section of wall that's relatively free from clutter and large enough to accommodate the entire mirror with room to spare. You'll generally also want to hang mirrors high enough that people can look themselves in the eye as they walk by, though there are situations where you'd make an exception to this rule, such as if you want to hang a mirror over the mantle of a fireplace.;
, Make sure you have plenty of space to work around the area where you'll be hanging your mirror. Having a clear work space prevents you from tripping over furniture or any other items that may be in the way, which can be disastrous if your heavy mirror is an antique.


You may also want to clean the wall itself if it's dirty. Heavy mirrors can, understandably, be hard to clean behind, so use this chance for cleaning before the mirror's on the wall.
Set the mirror aside in a safe place to avoid damage while you're moving any furniture.

, Finding studs is a very important part of hanging a mirror. Behind most interior walls are evenly-spaced wooden support beams called studs. You need to make sure that the screws or nails you hang your mirror from are driven directly into the studs. Otherwise, they'll be supported by nothing but plaster and drywall, which won't be able to hold most heavy mirrors. Use an automatic stud finder (available for sale at nearly all hardware stores) to locate studs in your wall. Mark the outside edges of each stud in the area where your mirror will hang with a pencil. These marks will serve as your guide when you mount your mirror.


If you're feeling confident and for whatever reason you can't use a stud finder, it's possible to approximate the location of studs by tapping on the wall. Use your index and middle finger to tap firmly (but not violently) on the wall and listen to the sound your tapping makes as you move back and forth. When you're tapping between studs, your taps should sound more ""boomy"" or ""echo-y"", while your taps should sound flat and dull over studs. Note that this method isn't nearly as accurate as using an actual stud finder.

, Stretch a tape measure (or hold a ruler) between each set of pencil marks on the wall. Use this to find the center of each stud, marking with a pencil as you go. The center of the stud is the strongest, most stable place to hang your mirror from, so you'll want to mount your screws as close to the center of each stud as possible.

, Measure the length and width of your mirror - the middle points of these measurements, taken together, will give the exact center of your mirror. It's important to locate the exact center of your mirror so that you'll be able to accurately mount supports on the mirror's frame.


It's also a good idea to carefully mark the center of each of your mirror's edges on the back of its frame.

, Mark 2 spots about 6 inches (15.24 cm) from the top on either side of the center of the back of the mirror. Install two D-rings at these markings. These D-rings will guide the hanging wire once it's eventually installed, keeping it even and balanced.

, Mark two spots near the bottom of the frame, one on each side of the mirror's center.

, Double the wire and thread it through one of the screw eyes, up and through the D-rings, and then back down to the screw eye on the other side of the frame. Leave some slack in the wire, as it will eventually need to hang from a support mounted into the wall.

, Cut four medium-length lengths of wire. Wrap a length of scrap wire tightly around the hanging wire several times and crimping it closed with pliers, securing it to one of the screw eyes. Repeat for both spots where the wire connects with a D-ring.

, Cut and wrap the wire, securing it tightly. Crimp the wire closed with pliers.

, Carefully use a free hand or get a friend to mark the wall at the center of the top of the mirror. Carefully lay the mirror back down in a safe place.

, You want to draw a line on the wall that's exactly parallel to the floor - you'll use this line to judge whether your mirror is hanging straight or not. Position a level on the wall at the top-center mark you just made, then, when its bubble is perfectly positioned between the two lines in the horizontal tube, carefully draw a straight line along its edge.

, Find two studs that lie within the area your mirror will take up - the wider apart, the better, but they shouldn't lie outside the edges of your mirror. From the center of these studs, draw a straight line up to the top horizontal line. Mark a point approximately 4 to 5 inches (10.16 to 12.7 cm) from the top line along the center line of each stud.


These points are where you will install your supports into the wall, so use a level to make sure these points are lined up horizontally.

, Drive two heavy-duty hanging screws into the wall - one at each point you just marked. Use an automatic drill to bore a hole that's narrower than the hanging screws you've chosen at each mark, then use a screwdriver attachment to drive the screws in, making sure there's enough screw left protruding from the wall to catch the wire.


Before installing your hanging screws, make sure they're rated to hold an amount of weight greater than the weight of the mirror. Keep in mind that the effective weight of your mirror can increase when you pull it away from the wall to clean under it.
Not all hanging screws are the same. Defer to the advice of an experienced professional or the manufacturer's instructions included with your screws if you're unsure of how to safely install them.
Alternatively, you may choose to use heavy-duty nails, as pictured.

, Catch the mirror's wire on the two hanging screws. Make sure the wire lays on both hangers securely, then slowly and gently let go of the mirror, allowing the screws to hold its weight.

, Use the horizontal line on the wall and/or a level to fine-tune your mirror's position so that it hangs perfectly parallel to the floor. When you're done, carefully use an eraser to gently remove the lines you drew on the wall.


Some home improvement sites recommend specialized cleaning products for removing pencil marks, particularly the ""Magic Eraser"" and other similar melamine foam sponges.

, This method uses a special type of mount called a french cleat to hang your mirror, rather than a hanging wire. However, it still uses the studs in the wall for support, so it's necessary to prepare the wall and mark the studs and their centers, so proceed through Part One above as normal, cleaning the surrounding area and carefully marking your studs.

, French cleats are wide, notched supports made of wood (or sometimes metal) used for hanging heavy objects on the wall. They are usually available at most hardware stores - if you want to buy commercial cleats, look for a set that's rated for loads greater than that of the mirror you want to hang. However, if you have a suitable piece of wood and basic knowledge of woodworking, it's not hard to make your own. Follow the instructions below:


Cut a sturdy piece of board that's about 3/4 of an inch thick so that its length is slightly shorter than the width of your mirror.
Make a 30-45 degree beveled cut down the length of your board near its center. You should now have two pieces of wood, each with a wide face and a narrow face, and each with a slanted edge. These pieces of wood will fit together to create a sturdy hanging platform for your mirror.

, Using strong glue or appropriate screws, fasten one of your cleats to the back of your mirror - usually this is the smaller of the two. Position the narrow face of the cleat just below the top edge of the mirror with the slanted edge pointing down. Use a level to ensure it's perfectly straight. This should create a downward facing ""hook"", which you'll eventually catch on the wall-mounted cleat to support the mirror.


If using commercial cleats, defer to the manufacturer's instructions - however, the basic idea should be roughly the same - you want the ""hook"" of the cleat to point down so that it will catch on the cleat attached to the wall.

, When the mirror is eventually seated in its cleat, its weight will be supported along its top edge. if there's nothing to support the bottom of the mirror, the weight of the mirror can cause it to ""twist"" towards the wall, damaging the mirror or tearing the cleat out of the wall. Because of this, it's important to ensure that the bottom edge rests flush against the wall. Attach a length of board that's the same thickness as the cleat to the bottom edge of the mirror. This is called an ""offset board"" - it supports the bottom of the mirror against the wall.


If you plan to build your own mirror, one way to negate the need for an offset board is to fashion the upper edge of the mirror's wooden frame with a beveled edge so that it can act as a cleat itself.

, The wall-mounted cleat (usually the larger of the two) needs to be securely mounted to the wall to ensure the mirror is well-supported. Use a level to draw vertical lines through the center of your studs, then use the level again to draw a horizontal line through these new lines at the precise height you want your cleat to sit. Mark each intersection of your stud center lines and your upper horizontal line - these locations are where you'll secure the cleat to the wall.

, Use sturdy wood screws (rated for a load greater than that of the mirror) to fasten the cleat to the wall, driving the screws through the wooden cleat and in to the centers of several studs. The cleat should be positioned so that its wide face points out from the wall and its slanted edge points up, creating an upward facing ""hook.""


Again, if you're using a commercial cleat, defer to the manufacturer's instructions, but the general idea should be about the same.

, Lift the mirror into place and lock the two cleat ""hooks"" together. They should fit together like jigsaw pieces. Gradually reduce your hold on the mirror until it is fully supported by the cleat.

Note - if you've used wood glue to secure the mirror's cleat, be sure to wait until the glue is completely dry before hanging the mirror. Even if you're 100% sure that the glue has dried, hang the mirror very gently and carefully. If possible, have a friend with you who can help you catch the mirror, should the glue prove to be of insufficient strength.

Attach picture-hanging wire to the frame.,
Measure and mark a spot on the wall for the hanger.,
Use a sturdy hanger.,
Hang the painting.",How to Hang a Painting2," For heavier paintings, wire is a better way to hang them than just one ring on the back of the frame. Make a rough judgment about how heavy the painting is as this will determine the strength of wire you need. You can buy wire that will hold up a 100 lb (45 kg) painting. Attach a d-ring to each top corner on the back and string the wire through the hooks.








The point of this is that now the weight of the painting is distributed across two rings and a wire, rather than all being on a single ring.

, Paintings should be hung at eye level. The way to accomplish this is to measure the length of the painting and divide that by two. Add 60 inches (152 cm) to this. Using that number, make a small mark on the wall at that height.








For example, if your painting is 36 inches (91 cm), then half of it would be 18 inches (45.7 cm). So the hanger for the painting should be at roughly 78 inches (198 cm).

, Heavy paintings are not meant to be hung with a single small nail. Use a curved hook which you press into the wall and that braces against the inside of the wall. Another good option is to use a stud finder to sink a larger nail, perhaps a 10d or 12d, into a stud rather than only into the drywall or plaster.Depending on the size and weight of the painting, it is often advised to use two hooks or nails. This braces the painting even more. Split the width of the painting into thirds and put the hangers at those points.
For plaster walls, you may want to drill a hole first and then use a screw that has a plastic sleeve which expands when you screw it into the wall.

, Gently hang the wire onto the hook or screws that are in the wall. With heavy paintings, you want to hang them slowly to make sure that the hangers are going to stay. It can be good to set a level on top of the painting to see if it is hanging straight.









Large paintings will look more natural if you put some smaller ones around them to balance out the largeness.

Create a row of paintings.,
Design a cluster of paintings.,
Make a rectangular grid.",How to Hang a Painting3," If you have three or more paintings of the same size or similar size, you can hang them in a straight row. Measure to the same height and pound a nail for each one. Fill the wall space from side to side as much as you can. 








If you are able to reframe the paintings, it will look best when all of them are in the same type of frame.
For a few paintings that are not the same size, you want to arrange them in a way that seems balanced. If you have one small, one medium, and one large painting, hang the largest in the middle and balance with one of the others on each side.
This arrangement is good to accentuate a long piece of furniture in a room, such as a couch or dining table.

, Hang five or more paintings of various sizes in an asymmetrical cluster. You might put a large one in the center and arrange the others around it. Or you can make an organic shape with all of the paintings at different heights. Make the cluster look somewhat uniform by putting them all roughly six inches (15 cm) apart.This somewhat disorganized pattern works great when you have a lot of paintings to hang because the overall look ends up balancing out.

, If you have an even number of frames, and an even number of like-sized frames, you can build a grid. You can use as few as four paintings, hanging them in a square pattern. This arrangement is only limited by the amount of wall space you have to work with.If you had 30 paintings that were one square foot, you could line them in rows of ten, five, or six.
You can work with this arrangement with varied size paintings, but it will work better if you have frames that are all the same size.

Clean the plate.,
Choose the right size hanger.,
Wet the disc.,
Attach the disc to the back of the plate.,
Hammer a nail into the wall.,
Hang the plate.",How to Hang a Plate2," Thoroughly wash the entire plate with hot, soapy water, then dry the dish completely with a clean dish towel.


The adhesive may not stick to a plate well enough if there is any dirt, grime, or oil on the back of that plate.
For best results, use a scouring pad on the back of the plate in the general area the disc will be placed on.
Adhesive plate hangers work especially well with plates that are strangely shaped or plates with notably thick rims. You can use them with any shape or size, though.

, Adhesive plate hangers come in five basic sizes. Make sure that you choose a hanger size that will work for your specific plate.


The five sizes are:

1-1/4 inch (3 cm), for plates up to 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter
2 inches (5 cm), for plates up to 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter
3 inches (7.5 cm), for plates up to 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter
4 inches (10 cm), for plates up to 12 inches (30 cm) in diameter
5-1/2 inches (14 cm), for plates up to 6.5 lbs (3 kg) in weight



, Dip your fingertip in a little water, then rub your wet finger over the adhesive side of the disc. Wait three to seven minutes, or until the adhesive becomes sticky.

, Look at the front of the plate to determine how you want the dish to hang. Once you determine where the center top will be, press the adhesive side of the disc firmly onto the back of the plate at the center top.


Press firmly over the entire adhesive disc to ensure a tight seal.
You should let the adhesive dry overnight before you hang the plate.
Test the bond by gently tugging on the hook. If the disc starts to peel away, the bond is not strong enough. If the disc stays firmly attached to the plate, however, it should be safe to use.

, Figure out where you want the plate to hang and lightly mark that spot with pencil. Hammer a nail into that spot. At least half the nail should be inside the wall, but there should be enough nail hanging outside of the wall for the plate hook to rest on.


Make sure that the nail you use has a large head to ""catch"" the hook on so that the plate will not fall off. Alternatively, use a picture hanger instead of a plain nail.
Determine where you want the plate by holding it against the wall. Mark the top of the plate on the wall using a light pencil mark.

Set the plate down. Measure the distance between the hanger hook and the top of the plate, then mark out that same distance from the mark on your wall.
Hammer the nail into the second mark you made.



, Gently hang the hook on the nail in the wall. Step back and take a look. If you are satisfied with the results, the process is now complete.


If the plate seems crooked, you will need to remove the hanger start over.
If you ever need to remove the hanger, you can do so by soaking the entire contraption--both plate and hanger--in water. After a few minutes, the adhesive should wear away, allowing you to remove it from the back of the plate.

Bend framing wire into a hook.,
Hot glue the wire onto the back of the plate.,
Reinforce the bond with duct tape.,
Bend the hook back.,
Hammer a nail into the wall.,
Hang the plate.",How to Hang a Plate3," Use pliers to bend 18 to 24 inches (45 to 61 cm) of framing wire into a hook. The indentation for the hook should lie at the exact center and should be about 4 inches (10 cm) deep. Bend either end of to the side and away from the indentation in a spiral or curlicue.


Make sure that the framing wire is sturdy enough to hold your plate. Size #2 wire is usually strong enough and holds up to 51 lbs (23 kg) standard. This can vary based on the manufacturer, though, so check the label specifications before you pick the wire gauge.

, Look at the front of the plate to determine where the center top should be. Hold the wire against the back of the plate so that the hooked indentation lies at this center top, oriented upward. Adhere the wire to the back of the plate in this position using a hot glue gun.


Apply hot glue in between the wire and the plate. You should also get glue along the sides and top of the wire. The more you use, the more secure the bond will be.
Do not allow any hot glue to get onto the hook/indentation.
Wait 5 to 20 minutes, giving the glue plenty of time to cool and harden.
The hot glue can be difficult to remove later on, so you should only use this technique if you do not plan on ever using the plate for practical purposes.

, Apply several layers of duct tape over the glued wire and onto the back of the plate.


You should cover all parts of the wire except for the hook/indentation.
Make sure that none of the tape is visible from the front of the plate.

, Carefully bend the exposed wire indentation back, bringing it out at an angle. There should be roughly 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) of space in between the top of the indentation and the back of the plate.


The wire should not wiggle or break off from the plate as you bend the hook out. If it does, you need to use more hot glue and/or duct tape to secure the bond better.
This bent portion of the wire is where the nail will rest.

, Position the plate against the wall to determine where you want it to hang. Mark the top of the plate, then set it down and measure the distance between the top of the plate and the top of your hooked wire. Make a second mark on the wall matching this distance, then firmly hammer the nail into this second mark.


Trace your marks lightly using a pencil so that you can erase them later.
Use a nail with a large head or a special picture hanger.
At least half of the nail should be inside the wall, but you should also have 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) of nail extending out from the wall for the wire hanger to rest on.

, Carefully rest the hooked wire onto the nail in the wall. With this, the process should be finished.


If the hook seems loose as you hang the plate, reinforce it with more glue or tape. If the nail does not seem secure, you may need to use a different nail or choose a different spot.
If the plate appears crooked, try bending the top of the wire so that the nail rests on it differently. If this does not work, you will need to scrape off the tape and glue so that you can reposition the wire.

,
Spray the solution onto each piece of paper.,
Place each piece in your drawers and put clothing back into the drawer over the drawer liners.

",How to Make Drawer Liners," It is usually best to allow each liner to fold up a little on each side to aid a good fit and provide a little extra side protection from the sides of the drawers, which are usually painted or varnished.;
, Dip a teabag into the water for three minutes and then remove it.

, Good choices include lavender, rosemary, mandarin, orange, nectarine, rose, apricot, lemon or try a mixture of favourite essential oil scents. You will need to experiment with the strength of the scent depending on the oil used.

,, Allow to dry completely. It helps to be able to do this in a sunny, warm room to speed up the drying process.

Use a rod with finials if your tapestry has a rod pocket.,
Obtain a rod, finials and wall brackets.,
Determine where you would like to hang the tapestry.,
Iron the tapestry if needed.,
Find your studs.,
Attach your brackets.,
Push the rod through the rod pocket on the back of the tapestry.,
Hang your tapestry on the brackets and enjoy your beautiful new eye-catching piece of art!",How to Hang a Wall Tapestry1," Most modern tapestries will come with a rod pocket along the top edge. In this case you can use a rod, which will look a bit like a curtain rod. This is a simple and straightforward method for hanging tapestries.









Brackets can be added to the wall from which to hang the rod.
Keep in mind that this method will result in your tapestry hanging away from the wall, with the distance depending on your particular brackets. If you want you tapestry to hang flush with the wall, try another method.;
, Choose a rod with decorative finials that will fit in with the room’s existing decor. Although there are rods made specifically for tapestries, you can also use normal curtain rods. However, you must make sure the rod fits inside the pocket of the tapestry. The necessary rod diameter depends upon the weight of the tapestry and the length depends on the width of the tapestry.









A 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch diameter rod will hold an average or large size tapestry anywhere from 2 to 10 lbs.
The rod should be long enough so that the rod finials extend beyond the edges of the tapestry with the brackets meeting the edges of the tapestry. This will allow the tapestry to slightly shadow the brackets giving more focus to the finials than the brackets.
The wall brackets should stick out from the wall a little so that the tapestry will hang at least ½ inch (1 cm) away from the wall. This will prevent moisture build-up.

, You would usually want to hang the tapestry so that the center is at eye level for an average sized person. However, you can hang the tapestry however you wish so it fits in with the rest of your room.









You may have to hang the tapestry a bit higher if hanging over a sofa or if you have very high walls.

, Prior to hanging your tapestry, ironing may be needed to remove creases. Use a low to medium iron to test first and iron on the back of the tapestry. If creases do not come out by ironing the back, then use a dye-free bed sheet and place over the front of the tapestry to iron.









You may need to increase the temperature of the iron and use some steam to remove the creases but always test in a corner of the tapestry first.

, Find your wall studs using a stud finder so that you can attach your brackets to them. Drill holes spaced so that the brackets sit just outside the width of the tapestry. Use a level to make sure these holes are even so that your tapestry does not end up crooked.









Tapestries do not always need to be hung on wall studs. In most cases you can simply use drywall screws and hang the tapestry wherever you like.
If you do not have a level you can also measure from the ceiling down to where you would like to hang the tapestry. Make sure that the distance from the ceiling to the hole is the same on both sides.

, Attach the brackets into the wall using the holes you have drilled. Make sure you use the correct screws for your type of wall. These can be masonry screws, drywall screws or simple wood screws.








, Place the rod though the rod pocket at the top on the back of the tapestry. Attach the finials to each end of the rod.








, Place the rod securely into the wall-mounted brackets and check one last time that everything looks even and secure.

Put your bed back in place.,
Use different colors.,
Space the lights out more or less.,
Add embellishments.",How to Make a Light Up Headboard," Making your own light up headboard is simple, as long as you have the right materials. Before you get started, you will need:








a curtain rod
two 300 light boxes of white mini lights
a package of 18 small command hooks
two long sheer white curtain panels
a sturdy chair or ladder;
, Standing on your bed might not give you the height or the stability that you will need to create your headboard, so use a sturdy chair or ladder instead. Push your bed away from the wall and place your chair or ladder next to the wall.


You may want to have someone spot you and hold your chair or ladder steady while you hang everything.

, Measure the width of your bed and extend the curtain rod to this length. Hold the curtain rod up against the wall to get an idea of how high you want to place it. You can place the curtain rod an inch or two away from the ceiling or a foot or two below the ceiling. Just make sure that the placement will allow the curtains to hang down past the top of your mattress.








After you have decided on where to hang your curtain, use a pencil to mark the places you will need to drill and then drill the curtain rod in place. This will help to ensure that the curtain rod will be level and placed exactly where you want it to go., After your curtain rod is in place, you will need to secure the Command hooks. You will need the Command hooks to hang the mini lights. Place your Command hooks about an inch under the curtain rod.








To secure the Command hooks, take an adhesive strip and then remove the protective covering from the “wall” side. Press the wall side of the adhesive firmly against the wall. Then, remove the other protective cover and press the “Command hook against it for about 30 seconds. Repeat this process with all of the hooks.
Make sure that you keep the hooks on an even level and that you space them out evenly as well.

, Take your mini lights out of their boxes and stretch them out. You may need to detangle the cords a bit. Then, hang part of each string of lights on one of the hooks. Connect the ends so that you have one continuous chain of lights.








Make sure that you leave a plug available to connect to the wall. If an outlet is not within the area of your headboard, then you can either leave some excess cord to plug in the lights or use an extension cord to turn them on.

, Next, take your curtain panels out of their packages and fan them out. Then, thread the curtain rod through the openings at the top of the curtain panels. When you are done, hang the curtain rod back up.








Make sure that you hang the curtains so that the backs of the panels hang towards the wall. The back of the curtains should have a visible hem and sometimes a tag as well.

, To ensure that your headboard will look just how you want it to, take some time to arrange the curtains. You can fan them out or bunch them together in different ways to change the texture of your headboard.








As you arrange your curtains, make sure that the mini lights stay hanging straight down against the wall.

, After you are finished arranging the mini lights, your light up headboard is finished! Return your bed to its usual space, but leave a little space for the curtain to hang. Then, just plug in the lights and enjoy!







, If you want to go with white on white, it creates a really pretty headboard. However, you can also experiment with different color combinations to match your room décor. Choose something that matches your style or rotate the curtains and light colors now and then for a different look.


For example, you could use sheer pink curtains with purple mini lights, sheer blue curtains with blue mini lights, or even try some multicolor lights behind a sheer black curtain.

, You can also vary the look of your headboard by spacing out the lights or bunching them up a bit more. Using fewer lights will give your headboard a softer look, while using more lights will make your headboard bright and bold.Try using just one string of lights for a softer look, or, try using three boxes of lights for a brighter look.

, Another way to customize your headboard is to add some embellishments to the curtain rod. You can choose something that works with your room décor to create a customized headboard look. Some options include:


a garland of faux flowers or leaves
some strings of beads
feather boas
a colorful scarf or some long thin strips of colorful fabric

Hold the picture you have selected against the wall.,
Mark the wall along the top center of the picture with a pencil.,
Put the picture face down on a flat surface.,
Use this measurement (the distance from the hanging device to the top of the picture) to determine where you should place your nail or screw.",How to Hang a Picture1," It is worth spending some time considering placement, taking into account furnishings in the room, and the general environment and lighting. A good height for hanging pictures is often when your eye level is about a quarter of the way down the image, although this is a matter of taste.









If you have a friend or family member around, ask them to hold the painting against the wall for you so that you can see it from further away.
If you don't have anyone around to hold the painting for you, hold the painting against the all and mark where the corners of the painting are with pencil. You can then put the painting down and step back to look at the markings. Make any adjustments you see fit and repeat until you find where you would like the painting to be. Erase the pencil markings when you are done hanging your picture.;
, If you have trouble detecting where the center is by just looking at it, use a tape measure and make sure you make your mark halfway across the top of the picture. You do not need to draw a line along the entire top of the picture; simply mark along the very center of the picture.







, Hook a tape measure on the hanging wire attached to the back of the picture. Pull the wire up towards the top of the picture so that it is taut. Measure the distance from the top of the picture to the hanging wire.








If your picture has a crossbar instead of a hanging wire, measure the distance from the crossbar to the top of the picture.

, Measure the same distance down from the pencil mark you have made on the wall and mark this point with another pencil mark. This will be where you place your nail. When you make this measurement, try to keep the line as vertical as possible.

Hang your picture on a stud.,
Use traditional picture hangers.,
Use anchor bolts to hang your picture.,
Provide heavyweight support with a toggle bolt.",How to Hang a Heavy Picture2," For heavier pictures, it is best to hang your picture on a stud. Drywall has a stud, or wooden support brace, about every 16 inches (40.6 cm). Find a wall stud using a stud finder, or by gently tapping the wall until you hear a solid, rather than a hollow, sound. Plaster walls are more difficult to find studs, so consider another method if you have trouble.


If your picture is wider than 16 inches (40.6 cm), or the distance between two studs in your wall, Use a level and two screws to screw a narrow piece of wood into the wall. Make sure the screws are in at least two studs, for extra strength. You can then fasten picture hangers into the wood at desired intervals using nails or screws, depending on what the fastener requires. Hang the picture across both picture hangers. If your picture is narrower, use a mounting picture hanger to hang it from one point on the wall stud. Choose a hanger that uses several nails for added strength. Hammer the nails into the wall stud, then hang your picture on the hanger. If hanging on a plaster wall, make sure you use a hanger that uses screws, not nails.
It is unlikely that you will want to hang your picture exactly where you have studs in your wall. There are other strong, reliable methods for hanging pictures if you do not find a desired wall spot for your picture with a wall stud behind it.

, While traditional picture hangers may not seem like the most sturdy option, they are easy to use and cause minimal damage to your wall. Picture hangers with one nail can hold up to 25lbs, and hangers with two nails can hold up to 50lbs. While it is not recommended that you push the limits of these hangers, you may use them for medium load paintings. You can use them on plaster as long as the hangers have screws or anchor screws. Hammer or screw the picture hanger into the wall at the desired spot using the corresponding number of nails or screws. Hang your picture on this hanger.

, There are many different kinds of anchor bolts depending on the weight of your picture and the type of wall you are using. All anchors require pilot holes. You will need to drill a preliminary hole into the wall before inserting the bolt or screw and hanging the picture. You must use anchor bolts and screws with plaster walls. Using nails and hammers on plaster will only cause damage to the wall.


Plastic anchor screws are surrounded by plastic that expand into the wall after you screw them in. For drywall, choose ones with plastic wings that expand out behind the wall. Plastic anchor screws without wings work best on plaster walls, as they grip the plaster well. Drill a hole the diameter of the anchor. Insert the anchor into the hole and pull it back out. Screw it back into place to activate the plastic anchor. Screw it back out and attach a picture hanger, then screw it back in to secure it. You may also unscrew the anchor screw to the desired length and simply hang the picture from the hook it forms. Molly bolts are more difficult to use but hold heavy loads well. This kind of anchor bolt provides support by gripping the back of the wall. Drill a hole the diameter of the molly bolt. Insert the bolt and then tighten with the drill. The metal support behind the bolt will flare out on the other side of the drywall as you tighten the screw. Unscrew and attach a picture hanger, or simply hang the picture from the screw. , Toggle bolts hold the greatest amount of weight. They are spring-loaded and provide support from the back of the wall. They are also the best choice for plaster walls. They require a much wider drill bit to install.


Drill a hole the diameter of the folded toggle bolt. Fold down the spring-loaded wings and insert the bolt into the hole. Let go and the wings will spread out behind the drywall. Pull it back out and tighten with a drill. You can hang a picture hanger from the screw, or hang the picture directly from the screw. "

Use baseboard to hang a tapestry with a rod pocket directly against the wall.,
Get a piece of baseboard that is slightly shorter than the width of the tapestry.,
Drill holes in each end of the baseboard.,
Locate your studs.,
Mark the screw locations on the walls and drill the holes.,
Insert wall anchors if you are using them.,
Slide the baseboard into the rod pocket on the tapestry.,
Screw the screws through the baseboard and into the wall.,
Step back and make sure the tapestry is level.",How to Hang a Wall Tapestry2," This is a very inexpensive and easy method for hanging wall tapestries although it still requires the tapestry to have a rod pocket on the back.









Your tapestry will be hung very straight by using this method.
This method also ensures that the tapestry is hung flush against the wall., Cut a piece of baseboard or another flat piece of wood so that it is slightly shorter than the width of the tapestry.









The bar can also be made from metal or plastic but these are harder to drill through properly.
Make sure your baseboard fits in the rod pocket on the back of the tapestry., Drill holes at each end of the baseboard that are equal distances from the ends of the baseboard and centered. These holes should fit the size screws that you will be using.








, Use a stud finder to locate the studs in the wall. Although this is not always necessary it will help you to find the most secure location to hang your tapestry.









If you cannot use the studs, do not have studs or would like to put the tapestry in another location you can use drywall screws or masonry screws, depending on the type of wall you are hanging the tapestry on., Use the baseboard to mark the location of the screws on the wall. Once holding the baseboard level against the wall you can insert a pencil or screw to make a small mark on the wall. Drill holes into the walls at these locations to align with the holes made in the baseboard.









Make sure the baseboard is level while you do this to ensure that your tapestry is hung straight., If you require wall anchors, for example if you are hanging directly into the drywall or have masonry walls, then you should now insert these into the drilled holes.









Wall anchors will provide extra stability and ensure your screws do not slide out from drywall or masonry walls.

, The rod pocket should be located at the top on the back of the tapestry.








, Start with one side at a time and screw through the baseboard into the hole or wall anchor on that side. Repeat with the screw on the other side.








, Now that the tapestry is hung, take a step back to make sure everything looks even and level. If everything is good then you are finished!

Use this method to add a casing or rod pocket if your tapestry does not have one.,
Obtain a strip of cloth that is slightly shorter than the width of the tapestry.,
Hand sew the strip of cloth across the top back edge of the tapestry.,
Insert a rod into the rod pocket or casing.,
Make sure your tapestry hangs straight and even.",How to Hang a Wall Tapestry3," If your tapestry has no rod pocket then you can simply add one onto the top back edge of your tapestry to hang using the previous methods.









This is an easy way to prepare your tapestry for hanging either with a rod or using a baseboard., You can use heavy cotton, linen or even cotton twill rug binding. These materials will be strong enough to hold up your tapestry.









The strip must be wide enough to be wrapped all the way around your rod lengthwise with a little cloth left over. , Use heavy cotton button-hole thread to hand sew the strip across the tapestry. Catch at least two warp threads (the underlying straight threads) with each stitch so that it is strong enough to support the tapestry.









Use thread that is the same color as a dominant color of your tapestry so that it won’t be noticeable.
Make sure you sew the strip so that it sticks up along the middle. This will make room for the rod so that your tapestry lies straight when the rod is inserted.
Be very careful that your strip is straight, even if your tapestry does not have a straight edge. If your strip is not sewn straight, the tapestry will hang crooked as well. , You can either use a normal tapestry rod or a baseboard to slide in and hang as normal in the other two methods. Alternatively you can insert a rod that is slightly shorter than the width of the tapestry.









If using a short rod you can hang it on two screws attached to the wall at the ends of the rod. This way you cannot see any hanging apparatus from the front side. , Step back and observe the tapestry to make sure it is hanging straight. If it is not even try taking out the stitches and reattaching the rod pocket or casing.

Use Velcro for an easily alterable method for hanging the tapestry.,
Obtain a strip of Velcro.,
Sew the soft, fuzzy side of the Velcro to the tapestry.,
Get a piece of baseboard or strip of wood and drill holes in the ends.,
Staple the stiffer side of the Velcro to the piece of wood.,
Use the board to mark holes on the wall where the screws will go.,
Insert screws through the board and into the wall.,
Attach the tapestry to the board using the Velcro.",How to Hang a Wall Tapestry4," Velcro is an adaptable method, which allows you to change the locations of the tapestries from time to time. Velcro is also particularly useful when hanging tapestries on curved walls because it conforms to the wall on which it is mounted.









This method is preferred by many museum curators for tapestries. , Get a piece of Velcro that is the slightly shorter than the width of your tapestry. You will need both sides of the Velcro so they can attach together. The width of the Velcro will depend on the width and weight of the tapestry you are using.









Velcro comes in widths between ½ inch (1.25 cm) and 4 inches (10 cm). The longer and heavier your tapestry is, the wider Velcro you should use to support it. , Use heavy cotton button-hole thread to sew the fuzzy side of the Velcro to the back top edge of the tapestry. Make sure you sew over at least two warp threads with each stitch so that it is strong enough for hanging.









Make sure the thread is the same color as one of the dominant colors in your tapestry so that it blends in.
You can also machine stitch the Velcro to a canvas strip first and then hand stitch the strip to the tapestry in the same way. This provides extra stiffness and support for the tapestry to hang straight. , The strip should be slightly shorter than the width of the tapestry. Drill a hole in each end of the piece of wood. The holes should be equidistant from the ends and centered. 







, Use wood staples to staple the piece of Velcro along the wooden board at one inch (2.5 cm) spacing. Make sure the Velcro does not cover the holes in the board.









If you are attaching the tapestry to a curved wall you will either need to use a bendable board or simply attach the Velcro directly to the wall. , Hang up the baseboard on the wall, making sure it is level, and mark the locations of the two holes on the wall. Remove the board and drill two holes into the wall.









Insert wall anchors into the wall if you are drilling directly into drywall or masonry walls. , Screw the screws through the pre-drilled holes in the board and into the wall anchors to secure the board. Make sure the board is level before proceeding. 







, Simply press the Velcro on the tapestry against the Velcro attached to the board to secure. Make sure there are no bumps and that the tapestry is hung straight.

Decide whether you are going to use a simple nail or screw, or a traditional picture hook.,
Decide what hanging implement you are going to use for pictures that are heavier than 20 pounds.",How to Hang a Picture2," These options are good for hanging pictures that are 20 pounds or less.









If you are using a nail and hammer: Select a 1 ½-inch (4d) or 2-inch (6d) nail. Place the nail in the center of the pencil marking that you made in the previous step. Drive the nail into the wall at a steep 45-degree angle. The 45-degree angle gives the nail much greater strength than simply driving it straight into the wall.If you are using a drill and screw: Drill a hole in the center of the pencil mark you made. Screw the screw into the hole.If you are using a traditional picture hook: Insert the nail through the sleeve on the hook. Hold the hook against the wall at the desired height (where you made the pencil mark) and tap the nail into the wall (the hook will hold the nail at a 45-degree angle automatically). Be carefully to only tap the nail and not the hook, as the hook could cut your wall., Heavier pictures call for more durable hanging devices. Choose between a spiral anchor or a toggle bolt.









If using a spiral anchor: This method is the easiest way to hang heavy pictures. Drive the spiral anchor into the wall with a screwdriver. Drive a screw into the anchor with a screwdriver. Some spiral anchors come with special picture hanging hooks.If using a toggle bolt: Drill a ½-inch hole into the wall. Align the metal channel along with the straps and slide the metal channel into the hole. Hold the ends of the straps with your thumb and forefinger. Pull them toward you until the channel rests flush against the backside of the wall. Slide the plastic cap along the straps until the cap is flush against the wall.

Carefully position the artwork on the hanging implement of your choice.,
Use a level to determine whether or not your picture is hung straight.",How to Hang a Picture3," Make sure that the picture is firmly secured to the hanging device before letting go. If the picture is not firmly secured, it could fall to the ground and the frame or glass could break.









If you are using screws or nails, position the picture so that the screw/nail hooks on to the hanging device on the back of the picture.

, Place the level on top of the picture. If the bubble measure remains in the center of the level, then your picture is hung straight. If the bubble is off to one side, adjust the picture until the bubble is in the center of the level.

, Think about what kind of mood you're going for, and importantly, how a certain color makes you feel. Colors can bring out different moods in different people, but it's ultimately your mood that matters. Calm colors usually seem more sophisticated.

, There are hundreds of themes that you can apply to the color you would like. They range from contemporary to oriental to rustic or anything you would like.

, Avoid bedding that is all one color or out of place with the rest of the room. Your bed should incorporate the colors of your room. Solid colors are usually a good choice as opposed to bedding with pictures on it.

, If you're going for a sophisticated look, you should avoid things like band or movie posters, and go for things that make you seem educated and fit your room's theme.

, It's nice to have a spot within your personal room that isn't a bed. It can also make your room look more sophisticated and functional.

, Avoid putting in furniture that you will never use, as it clutters up the room and can be replaced with something you can use. Also be conscious of space; if a dresser's drawers hit the bed, you may want to rethink your design plans.

, You can add to the look of a dresser with a strip of cloth that is as wide as the top of the dresser, letting the edges hang down the sides. Trays are great for candles and pretty stones, while looking stylish and sophisticated in itself. Personal pictures are good for a standing picture frame and will give your room a personal touch.

, Look around the room and ask for opinions from those around you. Find areas that are lacking and improve upon them. Make sure the colors are balanced and things are arranged in a space-friendly way that is still appealing to the eye.

, Not only is it great to just relax in a clean room, it contributes to the sophistication of it. Messy rooms make you look like a lazy slob, so make sure everything is tucked away where it belongs and all of the surfaces in your room are nice and polished.

, Without a game plan, there will be more obstacles than even the best interior designer can handle.

, Try not to choose your favorite colors right now, because chances are you'll get over them in due time. Pick colors that you've enjoyed almost all your life and that have been cherished almost from your childhood till now.



Use a color wheel as a reference. Colors next to each other on the color wheel go well together. Colors directly across from one another contrast with one another. In other words, when they're put together the colors really stand out and seem to pop. A great trick for using colors correctly is the 60-30-10 rule. Even professional interior designers use it! The 60-30-10 rule explains to use 60% of the room in your main color. 30% of your room should be your secondary color. And 10% of your room should be in your accent color. This way divides up color evenly without going overboard by using too many different colors.

Keep a theme in mind, while picking out your colors. You don't necessarily have to have a theme like the 1980s or baseball. Just think of what type of room you want to have. If you want a room that seems sweet and innocent paint your walls baby blue and furnish it with lots of white decor. But if you want to convey a funky feeling, use bright, vibrant colors that contrast, like orange, lime green, and bright blue.
For inspiration, look to your favorite object in your room. You could base your whole room off of that one thing. For example, if you treasure your green and black lava lamp, then you could paint the walls green with black accents or have a 1970s theme. Again, don't pick some recent favorite that you might grow out of or get tired of in a few months; use something you've treasured ""forever"".

Decide which walls are what color. Make sure to figure out what color the wall with a window will be, and all other walls.

Be flexible with your color choice. When you take a trip to the paint shop, you might change your mind about your color scheme. So just be sure that you know what color you want.

Keep your furniture in mind when you decide on your paint. If your furniture is extremely dull and boring, you may want to stay away from poppy colors.

Try highlighting. Highlighting is when you paint only a small bit of your room, such as windowsills, in a very bright color when your main color is something plain, like gray. The colors will pop out and make a great accent to your walls.

, Also measure the furniture you plan to put into your new room. So say your room is 6 feet (1.8 m) by 6 feet (1.8 m). Cut a piece of paper, so that it measures 6 in. by 6 in. Do the same, except with your furniture. Label each piece with the appropriate name, for example, bed, desk, drawers. Now you can arrange your ""furniture"" in your ""room"" until everything is in its ideal spot.

, Do you prefer carpets, paneling, or tile? If you don't like your floor, you can change it's color or material if you can afford it. If you want carpeting, you can also lay rugs on the floor for multiple colors and patterns on your floor.

, Atmosphere is how a room feels. This is very important when it comes to making your room just right. If you want a cozier feeling room for example, try just covering your lights to soften them, hanging and draping fabric from your ceiling, and use small lamps instead of ceiling flood lights to dim your room. Or for a dark, foreboding room, play loud, harsh music, and leave everything somewhat messy. Try to use colors that are at the darker end of the spectrum. Colors, materials, lighting, and music play a big part in the atmosphere of your room.

,



Primer. If your walls are already painted, but you want to repaint it be sure to get primer. Primer is basically white paint that prepares your walls for the paint and guarantees that the wall's previous color won't show.

Paint. Look at paint samples and put all of your chosen colors together to see if they look good together. Remember you can easily change your mind about the color scheme until you start buying things. After that, each step makes it progressively more difficult to reverse your decision.

, To make life easier, just move all of your major things like your bed and desk to the center of your room, away from the walls, and pile as much stuff as you can on your bed and take all your other stuff out of your room.

,, First use rollers to paint the big open areas. Then paint your trim, corners and edges of your walls with a brush. You can make an accent wall by painting a pattern like polka dots, or stripes. Be creative!

, Remember that you don't have to shop at expensive furniture stores. Try to find bargains at places like Walmart, Target, or K-mart. You can even find good options at garage sales if you look hard.

, If your room has no chairs or comfy things other than your bed, you may want to consider getting something to sit on and relax. You can use beanbags, stools, recliners, loveseats, or even couches in your room to give you a good place to relax. It doesn't have to be fancy, though. If you're on a really tight budget you can just simply pile pillows in a corner.

, See if any lighting, paintings, or flowers go with your theme. A great way to showcase your flowers is to gather old, glass coke bottles, paint them a variety of colors, and use them as flower vases. If you added a design to your walls, be careful not to over decorate. Less is more!

, It's very important to get drawers and such, otherwise your belongings would end up on the floor. Storage can include book shelves, drawers, or even cardboard boxes. You can put gift wrapper matching your wall color to make you cardboard box attractive. If you don't want your storage to show, then buy big, but short, plastic boxes. Once you fill them with stuff, just push them under your bed.


Be careful not to get lazy here—simply stuffing your things into your closet and under your bed will make it impossible to find things. If you're going to use the space under your bed for storage, make sure you have enough storage containers to organize your things in. Closets, dressers, drawers, shelves, cubbies, and storage bins can all be used to organize your things. Ikea sells many interesting storage solutions, although you will have to assemble the furniture yourself.

The canvas fabric should be about six or seven inches wide, but if more support is needed for heavier tapestries then you can use a wider strip.
Make sure the stitches are straight even if the tapestry end is not perfectly straight or else you will end of with a crooked tapestry.
You may need several rows of stitches when sewing on the canvas, especially for heavier tapestries.
Make sure each stitch covers at least two warp threads and use heavy cotton thread that matches the dominant color of your tapestry. , Fold the ends of the canvas strip around to the back of the tapestry, enclosing the fringe and edges of the tapestry on the top.

Insert wall anchors if you are drilling into drywall or masonry.
Make sure the screws you will be using are strong enough if you have an especially large tapestry. Check the manufacturer’s label for their strength.

, Consider keeping the theme subtle and timeless.


For example, it might be tempting to make a kid’s bedroom princess or racecar themed while they are young, but when they get older, a theme that bold and age-specific might mean redecorating.
Simpler design themes like floral, nautical, or sea-themed can hint towards gender but can grow with you with time as well., Consider the makeup of your bedroom as a whole and allow it to guide you to how you want to lay out your room.


Some themes consist of a revamp of the entire room, i.e. painting walls, removing carpet, buying new items.
Keep bedroom themes surface level by just changing a bedspread or a lampshade.

Choose light colors behind your theme.,
Choose a bed that corresponds with your theme.,
Use accent pieces and colors.",How to Find a Theme to Decorate a Small Bedroom2," Choose a color palette for your theme that creates the illusion of space like neutral and muted colors.


For a small bedroom with a theme, gravitate cool, calming tones of soothing blues, sea greens, blush pinks, beiges, greys, and crisp whites.Paint your bedroom walls the color that you’ve chosen. With a small bedroom, a simple color scheme is advised. For example, white walls with one accent wall painted a different coordinating color.

, You don’t necessarily have to go for a day bed or a twin bed just because it’s a small bedroom. A bed can act like a focal point for the eye and design of the bedroom.


Iron bed frames or open canopy poster beds are great options to maximize space while being versatile enough to correlate with most themes.

, Play with patterns on your bed. Give a contemporary feel to any room by introducing a mixture of modern and more traditional prints.Incorporate accents in subtle ways, like with a wall (as mentioned in previous steps) or as pops of colors throughout the room: a lamp, accent pillows, a headboard, etc.

Remove everything from the room, if necessary.,
Think about the circulation of the room.,
Consider where the windows in the room are, or the view.,
Measure the space.,
Draw a layout.,

Choose your accent furniture.",How to Design Your Bedroom1," It’s best to start with a clean palette, so hire some friends and pay them in pizza to help you clear out your bedroom if you are doing a re design of the space.


If your room has not seen a duster or a broom in awhile, give it a good clean so you can get a clear sense of the space.;
, This means thinking about how a person will walk around or move around in the room. Get a sense of the pathway for someone circulating around the room. The goal is to try to make it as easy as possible to access the bathroom and the closet area, and still have enough room on either side of your bed to walk around.


Consider how you and/or your partner will access the closet and the bathroom. If you are an early riser but your partner isn’t, you may want to make it easier for you to get to the bathroom in the dark or access the closet on your side of the bed.Depending on the size and layout of your bedroom, as well as the needs of the occupants, try to use simple circulation, or circulation based on an entry way on one side of the room. Most hotels have a simple circulation floor plan for good reason, as it allows for an open, functional layout.
Circulation plans become a bit more challenging with en suite bedrooms (where the bathroom is attached to the bedroom) or bedrooms that have doors on the outside. You will need to focus on keeping a de cluttered space that is easy to move around in if your bedroom has either of these layouts.If you are designing your bedroom layout from the ground up in a new home, pay attention to where you locate the bathroom and the closet in your bedroom. Rooms with bathroom or closet access before the sleeping area require a longer hallway. But if you organize the circulation so the bathroom and closet can be accessed through the sleeping area, you don’t need a separate hallway and you can save on space.

, A bedroom often feels more relaxing and welcoming if the first thing you experience is a pleasant view out the window, as opposed to a view looking straight at the bed.Try to come up with a layout that showcases a large window with a nice view and doesn’t cover up or block any smaller windows as these are good sources of natural light that can add warmth to the room.
Keep in mind you can always add in light blocking design like long curtains or blinds to allow light in during the day and maintain your privacy at night., Once you have a rough idea of how you want to be able to move around in the room, get out your measuring tape and write down the length and width of the room as a whole. Focus on the space between the windows and the door, as well as the closet and the bathroom.


This will help you determine the size of the bed, the night stands, and any other accent furniture you are going to purchase for the room.
If you are using furniture you already own, measuring the space will help you determine if all your existing furniture is going to fit in the layout you’ve chosen and/or if you need to get rid of some of your furniture.
These measurements will also ensure you have enough space between your furniture to move around easily in the room.

, Working off a layout on a piece of paper before you move all your furniture in will allow you to tweak or adjust the layout without having to haul around a bed or side table.


This is also useful for determining if you are going to keep all your existing furniture or get rid of any items that do not fit within the layout.
Keep in mind if you decide to paint the walls, you do not want to have to move all the furniture out of the room again. So hold off on moving your furniture back into your room until you have finalized the layout and the color scheme for the room.

, Your bed is the key piece of furniture in your bedroom, so determining where it is going to be located in the room will then help you decide where the other accent pieces are going to fit. Thinking about circulation again, you have two main possibilities for the placement of your bed:Against the wall opposite your bedroom’s door. This creates a nice view when you enter the room as the bed will not be blocking any windows and there will be a very simple, open circulation to the room.
Along the room’s longest wall. Most bedrooms have one length of wall that isn’t interrupted by windows and doors. This layout gives you plenty of room to put a nightstand on each side of the bed.

, The next largest item of furniture in the room will likely be a dresser or armor for your clothing. If you have an attached closet, you may not need to worry about this furniture item. You have several placement options for the dresser, including:In the corner of the room, across from your bed. Be aware that placing a dresser in the corner may cut off the openness of the space. Try adjusting the dresser so it is facing the bed against a wall.
If you are using a wide chest or credenza, it can serve a double function as a television stand. If this is the case, you may want to place the chest or credenza directly across from the bed against the opposite wall for easy viewing of the TV.
If you are using a low dresser or chest, you may also want to place it at the end of your bed for easy access and to keep the walls open and not cluttered.

, Now that the largest furniture items have been situated in the room, check if you have space for side tables on either side of the bed, accent chairs, and standing lamps.Depending on how much space you have, you may be able to also include a small desk and chairs in the room.
You may also want to include an ottoman at the end of your bed or by your closet for extra seating.

, Children often like to be creative so take the ideas of the child on board. The child will have to spend a lot of time in the room so the interior design should reflect his/her preferences.

, Due to their boisterous nature, children have a knack of unintentionally damaging things! Make sure you only purchase furniture manufactured from robust and durable materials.

, How sturdy is the bed? Will it collapse if the child jumps on it? Do the drawers and dressers have sharp corners? If so, many companies offer to round them out to ensure they do not cause harm to children.

Pick an “anchor” color.,
Pick two complementary hues.,
Decide if you are going to paint the walls of the room.",How to Design Your Bedroom2," This will be the color you will then highlight, accent, or complement with other hues.Your “anchor” color is going to be the most prominent color in the room and will determine the overall feel or tone, so decide if you want to set a more calming environment with a neutral anchor color like off white or light gray, or if you want to create a vibrant atmosphere with a bold, bright anchor color like turquoise or orange.Of course, you can always just go with your favorite color!


Remember that even with a more neutral anchor color, you can add pops of bright, bold color to the room with accessories like throw pillows, bedding, and smaller decorative items.
You may want to also choose your anchor color based on a theme, like nautical, French provincial, or California chic.To get some ideas for possible color schemes, look online at sites that showcase different designs for bedrooms., Though you may decide to add more complementary hues, its best to start with two so the room does not become overwhelmed with color.


Use your anchor color as a reference for the two hues. If you used a more neutral anchor color, you may decide to use cool hues like blue and green or warm hues like red and yellow. If you used a more bold anchor color, you may decide to use neutral hues like gray or white, or you may decide to go very bright and use hues like apricot or turquoise.
Consult a color wheel to get direction on possible hues for your anchor color. When in doubt, look for examples online to give you some ideas.There are several ways to mix and match hues with tints, shades, and tones.

Stick to your layout and arrange the furniture accordingly. If you did your measurements right and considered the circulation of the space correctly, you should have a well spaced and easy to access layout for the room.

, Consider the lighting you already have in the room, such as a ceiling light or lighting attached to the wall, and decide if you are going to improve upon the existing lights with new fixtures or add in standing lights or table lamps to give the room different sources of light.


Ceiling lights offer even coverage for the entire room and will often provide the most light for the room. You can also customize the brightness or darkness of ceiling lights with dimmer bulbs. Ceiling lights can be great statement pieces for a bedroom, especially with a more neutral color scheme.Floor lamps are great for brightening up specific spaces and add a more intimate feel to the room, especially when placed by a bed or in the corner of a room.
A table lamp is also good for illuminating a specific area of the room, such as on a bedside table or a desk. They are also great for reading and working, especially at night, as table lamps are not too bright to interfere with your body’s natural sleep schedule and they won’t keep your bed mate awake., Bedding plays a major design role in your bedroom, as your bed will likely be the focal point of the room. Look for a pattern or design on a bedspread or duvet cover that works with the color scheme of the room.Of course you also want your bed to be comfortable and relaxing, so look for good quality sheets as well as pillows, throws, and accent pillows to really make your bed a spot worth lounging on.Think about also including accent rugs to add an extra sense of coziness to the space.

, Make your bedroom feel like a personal, intimate space by including personal items and keepsakes. Avoid a bland space by adding in details that show off your sense of style.


Hang wall art that you love, make space on a table or desk for books you cherish, and add a dash of nature with a row of potted plants or succulents on your dresser., Don’t feel pressure to make the room look at complete as possible. Like anything, the room will likely evolve over time, as you add or remove certain items of furniture or certain accessories. Great design usually takes awhile to figure out and will likely need to be refined, so take your time, don’t rush, and have fun with the design of your bedroom."

, If it's okay with your parents, and you can find some nice vintage curtains, this will help to give your room an instant vintage feel.


Another alternative, if you can sew, is to make curtains of your own using vintage style fabric.

, The bed can be made to look vintage in a variety of ways. Here are a few ideas for inspiration:


Change the bed cover. Use a lovely old quilt or one made using old-time fabrics. Or, you could purchase an old crocheted or knitted bed cover.
Find sheets with vintage prints on them, such as florals and pastels. Neutrals are good too, as they won't clash with the bed cover.
Choose old-fashioned cushions and pillows to decorate the bed with.
Throws are a nice vintage idea, or afghan blankets.


Keep your mattress new. Vintage mattresses are likely to be a bit lumpy and may harbor pests.







, There are lots of possibilities for vintage pieces and accessories, some of which is about reinventing things to serve a new purpose. Some ideas for vintage décor includes:


Add floral lampshades
Make a display (and storage) row of vintage tins from chocolates, candies, cookies, etc.
Hang up old pictures or photographs
Find old advertising items, such as posters and toys
Use vintage jewelry to add a touch of nostalgia; hang it around the mirror, leave it on the dressing table
Use old figurines and china ware for display and for keeping things in
Purchase a vintage lamp or two. (Just ask your parents to check that the electrics are safe.)

, For example, while changing your bed might be too pricey and out of the question, a new bedside table, a small wardrobe or a chest of drawers might be doable. By having just a few key pieces, you can help give the impression that the whole room is vintage.

, Although not vintage, they do help to set off the eclectic and fun atmosphere you've created for your room. Plus, they're just lovely to have.

Fabric bunting or garlands are nice too. A row of triangular flags made from old world fabric or blankets can be just the thing to add a sense of vintage to the room.

, If you're doing this on a budget, everything will need to be about making things copycat, at a low price (or even for free), so you'll need to use your imagination, not your wallet.

, Consider the space you have and how many things can actually be changed in your room. Some of the things you might be able to do include:


Rearranging existing furniture
Adding new pieces of furniture or homemade furniture
Pinning up pictures, photos and paintings on the walls
Adding rugs or wall hangings

Place lots of lovely pillows and cushions on the bed. These can help turn your bed into a place to lounge during the day as well.
Rearrange your shelves. If you have books, ensure that the ones about your favorite stars have prime position. Add bits and pieces to brighten up the shelves too, such as an imitation Oscar statuette, a camera, and perhaps some movie paraphernalia.

, These add a nice lighting touch and can be found in a range of styles and colors for very little cost.

, Even the stars like time out to get away from it all. Make it cozy and a little hidden away from everything else. Ways to make a nook include creating a tent from an old sheet, making a teepee shape from an old sheet, rearranging furniture to make a hidden spot or simply turning an old chair with its back to the rest of the room. If you have a window-seat, this could be the reading nook.

,


Use a square-shaped table. Staple or glue hanging fabric around the edges of the table, draping down to the floor.
Glue a large yellow star to the center of the table. Coat with Mod Podge or contact paper to protect the star and table surface.
Add a mirror behind the table. If possible, include clip-on lights around the edges of the mirror.
Arrange your makeup items on the little vanity table. You can use little jars for added effect; paint them nicely and keep your make up in them.
Add a little stool for sitting at the vanity dresser. Cover the little stool in fabric and frills.

, See How to make a Hollywood star nameplate for details.

, When doing up furniture, making soft furnishings and making your own decorative items, use such sparkling items as glitter, sequins, shiny beads, artificial gems, tinsel, colored cellophane and gold paint or fabric to help the items have star quality.

Make sure that you have all of the necessary equipment.,
Think about whether you have the necessary DIY skills to complete the project.",How to Give a Basic Toddler Bed a Designer Look," Most retailers only carry limited designs in toddler beds, limited only to the latest trends in comic, movie and cartoon characters.


Disney’s Cars characters are all the hype these days for boys’ toddler beds; Disney Princesses are all the rage for the girls’. When it comes to colors, you are limited to choosing between blue, red and green for boys; pink, yellow and white for girls.
Therefore, if you want to give your toddler's bed a more unique, sophisticated and designer feel, it's a much better idea to design and create the bed yourself. You don't even have to buy a new bed, you can just re-design an old one.;
, Most parents prefer wooden toddler beds, although there are other types such as plastic toddler bed, canopy bed, portable bed or cot.


Whatever the type you have, all of these beds have very basic features; all of them are low to the ground, have side rails to protect your little one from falling when sleeping, and a foot and head board.
If you are especially creative and if you have the talent, you can stencil your toddler’s bed frame with designs that you can download online or have made yourself.

, You can definitely paint over the original design of your toddler’s bed if it is made of wood, even more so if the toddler bed is painted white. White furniture is like a blank canvass waiting for the artist’s hand in creating unique patterns and designs.


You will want to choose a paint that’s water based (acrylic; latex) because this gives a better gloss and color retention. It’s also quick to dry so this fits your weekend project better. It has less odor and low on VOC’s (volatile organic chemicals) that are flammable.
These features are best suited to your toddler’s bed rather than oil based paints that are flammable and gives out a strong odor.

, You can choose from a variety of paint colors available at your local hardware or home shopping store. If your toddler hasn’t chosen his or her favorite color yet, go with gender-neutral colors like grey, plum, wine, aqua, ivory and tan.


These colors provide an additional canvas for your toddler’s bedroom color scheme. However, you can also work with whatever color palette comes to your imagination.
Ask your local hardware store if they can give you free paint swatches so you can decide which hues and colors you want.

, Choose basic, solid color fabrics that you can use as a canvas for your creativity. A simple white duvet can be embellished with trims, fabric flowers, or if you have the talent, you can embroider on the white duvet or bed cover.


If you want, skip using a duvet and create a quilt instead. It’s traditionally used as a bed cover but since this is a project you are doing on your own, you are only limited to your own creativity.

, Another vehicle to add a splash of color to your toddler’s bed are his or her pillows. Go with colors that compliment whatever color you've chosen for the bed cover or the duvet.


You can also go for pillows with white pillow covers and just add trimming and embellishments of your choice to the pillow covers to up the design factor.

, You can go with minimalist and contemporary designs, rustic and country styles or colorful and eclectic options. You can base the design on your toddler’s temperament and character.


For example, if she is bubbly and perky, then go with colorful and eclectic designs with splashes of color everywhere. If your toddler is contemplative, mild mannered and shy, you can go with a modern and contemporary or minimalist design where he or she can be most comfortable in.
Some decorations include a bookcase, a study table, a lamp, some decorative hangings such as buntings and even pictures of your toddler or the whole family in frames.

, Once you have chosen the palette of your choice and the paint for the bed frame, start by applying the paint to the bed frame.


You can use a HVLP (high volume low pressure) spray painter, as this is easier and less time consuming.
You can check your local hardware store to see if they can rent a HVLP spray painter; most stores allow rental for around a hundred dollars.

, You can place the bed frame in a well-ventilated area either inside or outside the house (the garage). Make sure to cover the floors and the nearby area with old newspapers and wear something that you won’t mind getting dirty.


If you have purchased a toddler bed that has a frame that has already been treated with lacquer or urethane, you will need to strip this down using a TSP or Tri Sodium Phosphate.
TSP basically is just a chemical that “rinses off” whatever chemical was applied initially to furniture. Just read the instructions on the TSP on when to apply the TSP and how to remove it afterwards.

, Next, you are ready to sand down the bed frame. You can definitely do this by hand or if you do not have the time, you can get a random orbital sander.


Again, check with your local hardware if and how much they rent this out. Just make sure to ask help from a professional if you are hesitant about using the orbital sander.
However, you can definitely sand down the bed frame by hand; it isn’t as hard to do.

, Next, clean the surfaces of the toddler bed and remove all dust either by using a vacuum cleaner or a tack cloth; even a cotton rug with rubbing alcohol will do. The idea is to not redistribute the fine dust all over the bed surface and all over the place.


The next step is to apply your primer. This is an important part of your project because it gives the bed frame a nice even and professional looking finish. You can apply the primer as you would the paint. You can use roller, brush or the HVLP sprayer.
Some of the best brands of primer in the market are Kilz and Zinsser. Both primers have a selection of low-odor types so you definitely want to use those.

, Professionals do one other step that distinguishes their work from the amateurs and that’s sanding the wood again after applying the primer.


No hard work necessary because you just need to re-sand lightly and smoothly. The goal is to make the surface as smooth to the touch as possible.
Once more, after sanding, clean the surface using a vacuum or cloth with rubbing alcohol.

, Now, you are ready to apply two coats of either glossy or matte wood paint using the HVLP or a brush or a roller; depending on how fast you want the job done and how comfortable you are using each of these tools.


When using a paintbrush, use a 2” paint brush for wide surfaces and a 1” paint brush for narrow surfaces. Make sure that your strokes are even and paint along the direction of the grain.
The same technique applies when using a roller. The trick to painting is sure, even and quick strokes. Avoid re-working over what you have already painted on especially if it has begun to dry.

, Afterwards, check your work to make sure that the overall finish is even and no signs of overspray are evident. Once you are satisfied with the paint job, let it stand for a couple of hours or a day or two, depending on the instructions at the paint can.

, You can use a variety of fabric decors and trims available to decorate your toddler’s basic white duvet. If you want to go with graphic designs, do not overload the duvet with a lot of it because then, it would look disorganized and loud.


Simple, one-theme graphic designs are best. If applying trims to the duvet, make sure that all trims are straight and aligned along the sides of the mattress (not the duvet itself) as you will want to create depth when applying these trims to the duvet.
You can also use piping, lace, jewelry, cord, tassel trims or the more playful venice trims. Most of these trims need to be machine sewn or if you have the time, hand stitched to the fabric rather than applying them using fabric glue. Stitching the trims makes it more durable, as machine washing the fabrics will remove the fabric glue.
Check the alignment of your trims – make the bed and cover it with the duvet you have embellished with the trims. Make sure that the outside edges of the trim details are straight and aligned with the edge of the mattress and the toddler bed.

, You can choose pillow covers that will compliment the style of the duvet you made or choose pillow covers in basic solid colors.


For example, if you have chosen aqua for the bed frame, then you can use light yellow pillow covers or white pillow covers with yellow trims or decors.
If you’ve chosen plum for the bed frame, you can partner it with ivory or white and brown duvet or bed covers and pillows with brown or ivory details.

, A bedside table that has the same or complimentary color to the bed frame, a stylish lamp, a wall clock and a bookcase are the basic things you need to complete the look.


If your toddler bed has a head board, this is another canvas that you can use for your creative mind.
You can either leave it wearing the solid color you gave the bed frame or you can also add details like stencils or pictures of your toddler or pictures of his favorite things.

, If your toddler's bed doesn’t have a head board already, you can use a bookcase that fits the width of the bed; this pulls double duty in being a head board and a place to stow away toys or books or stuffed animals, which your toddler has easy access to.

, If you have the budget and the time, you can always hire professionals to create a bespoke design for your toddler's bed.


This is a pricey project, but it is guaranteed to give you a unique bed for your little one. From castle designs, to princess carriages, jungle themes to race car designs, you are only limited to your creative imagination.
So as long as the professional or professionals you are going to hire can guarantee that they can deliver the look you want, then by all means, go to the drawing board and start designing.

, Some parents buy the Kura bed for their children, but these are mostly bought for slightly older children since the Kura bed is a loft bed. Loft beds are high off the ground so it may not be the most suitable bed for your toddler because there is the danger of falling off.


However, loft beds are the perfect canvas for creating a stylish and bespoke bed that can be transformed into a castle just by adding some wooden boards to emulate castle walls.
You can use the bottom space of the loft bed to store your children’s toys, books, bean bags, or; you can place a study table with lamp to transform the space into a study area or reading nook for your children.
If you decide to go for a loft bed, you could consider creating a sleeping space for your toddler underneath, and allow an older child to sleep on top.

, If you have a trundle toddler bed, you can apply the same techniques for decorating a bed as described in the section above. You can purchase a basic white trundle bed frame and just apply the paint of your choice.


Vamp up the mattress by creating or designing your own duvet or bed covers and pillows.
For plastic trundle beds, you can choose spray paint made especially for application on plastic surfaces then follow the basic guidelines listed above.

, Generally, if a project will cost you more than two days hard labor and will take too much effort on your part (think in terms of manual labor such as lifting heavy loads to and from your house), the project might best be done hiring a pro.


If a basic redo such as re-painting, sewing, embellishing and decorating with store-bought items, and if the project can be done within a day or two, a D.I.Y can be accomplished.
It is a good thing that revamping your toddler’s bed can mostly be done over the weekend, on your own or with a little help from a partner. Or if finishing the project over the weekend becomes overwhelming, you can opt to spread out the time when you will work on it.

, You should also consider the cost of your materials and the manual tools that you will be using for the D.I.Y project.


Most professional workers are able to score a discounted rate for some building and paint materials. However, with a little bit of effort you can find these same kind of materials in architectural salvage stores or reuse centers or even from your neighbor’s garage sale.
Decorating your toddler’s bed won’t be that pricey since it would mostly involve just re-painting the bed frame with whatever color your toddler wants and there’s a range of paint colors available in the market to choose from. You can hand paint or use HVLP (high volume; low pressure) sprayer.
Tons of duvets, bed and pillow covers are also available on the market. There’s an array of fabrics printed with well loved cartoon characters and fabrics in basic colors that you can mix and match with other decors in your toddler’s bedroom; and these come in affordable prices that can fit your budget.

, Generally, anything involving plumbing, lifting heavy loads, electrical and wiring should be done by a professional.


It simply isn’t worth your time, effort and money to try doing these things on your own, especially if you have zero knowledge on these skills.
Painting a toddler’s bed or any other furniture in your home can mostly be done outside in a well ventilated area or even inside, as long as you do it without the kids around and make the area is well ventilated as possible.

, Paint, a simple paintbrush and a roller tray are basically all you need in vamping up your toddler’s bed.


If you want to use a HVLP sprayer, ask your local hardware store if they can rent out this equipment to you for a day or two.
Sewing your toddler’s duvet or bed cover is something that you can do, or you can choose to buy basic bed covers at the local home shopping store and decide later on if you want to embellish or decorate the covers more.

, The last thing you should consider is you.


Do you have the time and patience see the job through? Can you make the necessary adjustments in your schedule to finish the job? What if it doesn’t turn out the way you want it to? Do you have a back up plan? Can you follow directions and are you resourceful?
These questions are here to help you evaluate your capacity to see a D.I.Y project through. If you answered positively to these questions then, by all means, decorate your toddler’s bed on your own. It might be a bit daunting at first, but you might be surprised to find out that you may have the aptitude for D.I.Y.

Select the mirror.,
Purchase and cut the molding.,
Center the mirror on the backboard.,
Glue the lattice pieces around the mirror.,
Lay the molding pieces on top of the lattice pieces.,
If you are framing a mirror that's already hung on a wall, apply your adhesive to the back of the molding, and press the frame against the mirror, leaving a one-inch overhang on all four sides of the mirror.,
Secure the molding to the backboard.,
Attach a hanging picture wire using two D-rings.,
Add finishing touches, and then hang the mirror.",How to Frame a Mirror1," It can be any size, since you can cut the molding to whatever length you need. The mirror does need to have straight edges, like a rectangle or square shape, as opposed to a round one.;
, You can find molding at a lumberyard or a home supply store, usually for just a few dollars a foot.


Choose a style of molding: There are traditional, unfinished styles and more decorative ones that come with rosette corners and different patterns. To determine how long each piece of molding should be, measure the length and width of your mirror, then add 2 inches (5.1 cm). Use a miter saw to cut the four pieces, and cut 45-degree miters on both ends of each piece. Check the opposite parts' lengths by holding them against each other to make sure they're equal.
Assemble the frame on a flat surface: Paint the inside of the corners with construction adhesive or wood glue, and then use painters' tape to hold the pieces together temporarily. After the adhesive dries, fill in any gaps in the miters with Spackle or wood putty. After the spackle dries, paint the frame, if you wish.

, Your backboard should be a piece of plywood that is also two inches longer and wider than the mirror. If your mirror is already on the wall, you don't need a backboard, and you can skip this step.

, Your lattice pieces should be two inches wide; two of the pieces should be the length of the mirror, and two should be two inches longer, so that they frame the entire perimeter of the square. This is another step you can skip if your mirror is already on the wall.


Use wood adhesive to attach the lattice pieces to the backboard. Make sure the mirror is fitted snugly inside the lattice pieces.
Secure the lattice pieces with spring clamps, and let the adhesive dry for about 24 hours.

, Line them up so that they extend just slightly over the lattice edges onto the mirror. Glue the molding to the lattice pieces.


Be careful not to get any glue on the mirror.
If you are using rosettes, glue them into each corner.
Weight the mirror with a piece of plywood, and let the glue set for about 24 hours.
Cover the molding with towels to protect the wood while the glue dries.

, Immediately check the frame with a level, and then make any adjustments before the glue dries.
Use painters' tape to hold the frame to the wall while the glue dries.

, Turn your molded mirror over, and use an electric screwdriver to screw a one-inch screw into the center of each rosette. Insert two evenly spaced screws into each horizontal piece and one into each vertical piece, about a third of the way from the bottom.

, Insert one into each vertical side, about a third of the way down.


Cut the wire long enough to run between the two rings, with enough for the peak of the wire to hit three inches below the top of the frame.
Twist the wire into each D-ring.
Attach vinyl picture bumpers to each corner, to prevent the mirror from scratching the wall.

, Finish the mirror by sanding the edges of the frame, if they are rough, using a sanding sponge or sandpaper. You can also opt to paint the frame with a glossy finish.

Find a mirror and frame that match.,
Remove the frame glass.,
Secure the mirror onto the frame backing.,
Test the weight.",How to Frame a Mirror2," Your frame should be a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) longer and wider than the mirror's measurements. Make sure your mirror is thin enough or your frame is deep enough to hold it.

, You won't want a glass in front of a reflective mirror.

, Then fit the frame over the mirror.

, A mirror is heavier than a picture, so make sure the hanging mechanism - the wire or the hooks - are strong enough to support the weight before you hang it to a wall.

Create a decorative frame with ribbon.,
Use a platter for a frame.,
Embellish the mirror with a stenciled overlay frame.,
Create a frame out of stones or shells.",How to Frame a Mirror3," You'll need a wooden frame that can fit around the mirror and ribbon that's slightly wider than that frame. Cut out a paper template of one side of the frame, including the mitered corners.
Paint the frame's inner and outer edges to a color that's similar to the ribbon's.
Cut the ribbon slightly longer than the paper template.
Iron on strips of fusing to the back of each piece of ribbon.
Use a pencil to trace the template onto the fusing. Cut the shape out of the ribbon. Repeat with three other pieces.
Press each ribbon piece, fusing side down, onto the frame. Place a towel over the ribbon and iron on a low setting to adhere.

, Repurpose an antique platter or plate by using its border as a decorative frame for a mirror. If the platter is broken, use ceramic epoxy to glue the pieces together.
Measure the perimeter of the platter's central well.
Draw the measured shape on a piece of paper; then cut out the shape to make a template.
Find a mirror that matches the template shape, or get a professional glass cutter to cut a mirror to the measurements of your template.
Create a braided trim by gluing pillow piping around the perimeter of the mirror.
Use ceramic epoxy to glue the mirror to the center of the platter. For a more temporary adhesive, use mounting tape.
Hang the platter mirror with a plate hanger.

, Use stencil patterns to decorate your mirror. Find a stencil pattern that you like on paper. Trace the pattern onto a piece adhesive shelf liner.
Cut the pattern out of the adhesive liner with a utility knife.
Peel the border of the liner back and adhere it onto the mirror.
Use a bristle brush to apply enamel paint over the stencil. Let the paint dry overnight, and then strip it off.

, Use a hot glue gun to attach a border of them around your mirror.

Cut glass or plastic.",How to Frame a Picture," If the room looks modern, you'll want to avoid ornate, wooden frames. If the room is classic, you'll want to avoid sleek or brushed metal, modern-looking frames. Of course, this rule can be broken in order to make a design statement.;
, Older style pictures will generally look more at home in older styled frames. You will also want to consider the color of your picture. If black and white, it will look better with a colored or black/white frame. If the picture has color, it can look better with either color frames or wooden frames.

, You'll have to decide if you want a thin frame, thick frame, shadow box frame, or other styled frame. Some pictures, such as printed canvases, might look better with no frame at all!

, Do you want the picture to feature prominently in the room and take up a large amount of space or do you want to have it be smaller and simply be a beautiful detail to the room? You'll have to decide what works better for your design.

, Think about how big the picture is going to be. Now, do you want there to be a lot of space between the picture itself and the frame? Or do you want there to be no space at all? 1-2"" of mat (or space between the frame an picture) is normal, as is no mat whatsoever. However, you can make a dramatic statement by having a larger gap (4-6"" or more).


Of course, this is relative to the size of the picture. If the picture is enormous, a 4"" mat might be very reasonable.

, Generally, black, white, and brown are considered good neutral colors that will generally match with most pictures. You can also go with colors, however. This is an especially good idea if you really want to make a picture pop, and draw attention to it in the room.


Generally, you would choose a color by finding a highlight or significant color in the picture and then making the frame that color. For example, if your degree has a red seal, you might make that pop by having it framed in a matching red as well.

, If you decide to have a gap between the frame and the picture, you'll need a mat. This is a piece of paper, cardboard, or cardstock which creates a secondary ""frame"" for the picture. You'll need to decide what color you want your mat to be. Usually, a white or cream color is used, but you can also use more brightly colored mats which compliment your picture.

, Take the measurement of your picture and add the width you want for your mat to get the mat size. Let's frame an imaginary 8x10 photo. For this photo, we want a mat with a 1.5"" width. So the measurements for the mat become 11x13"" (since the width needs to be added to each side).

, Measure a square corner, using a tool if you have one, and then cut the mat to the desired measurement. Use a box cutter or other extremely sharp tool in order to get a clean line. Our mat will be 11x13"" around the outside.

, Cut the inside edge where you want the picture to go. The usual advice is to have the gap on the bottom marginally larger than the one on top (this should be almost imperceptible). Dry fit it to figure out where you want it and then measure and cut a hole in the center of the mat that fits the measurement of your image.


A good tip is to measure the exact shape, in this case the 8x10 rectangle, and then make the actual cuts just inside of the line you drew. This way you won't accidentally end up with gaps where you made the hole too big.

, Fit the picture into the hole for the mat. Take two pieces of tape and use them to bridge the gap along the top line. These should be evenly spaced, towards the center. Next, take two more pieces of tape and place these over the top, mat-side of the first tape pieces. The long edge of these pieces should follow the line of where the picture and mat meet.


This is a safe way to tape photos to mats, since the tap can simply be cut where the picture and mat meet, leaving only minimal tape on the picture itself.

, We're going to make a frame for our theoretical 8x10 photo with our 1.5"" width mat. You'll need:


1x2 lumber in a wood type of your choice
1/4"" square dowels in a matching or pleasantly contrasting wood of your choice
5 mm diameter dowel rods
A miter box, saw, square measure, and measuring tape
Glue and rubber bands
Materials to make a basic jig, such as plywood.
Optional materials like paint or stain

, For now just think about the 1x2s. The inside measurement of that portion of the frame will be the same size as your mat, with the outside measurement adding the additional length for the miter. Cut the 1x2s to the size you'll need for the outside measurement of the frame. Once you have your 1x2s cut, cut your square dowels to the same measurement.


In our example, since the 1x2s are actually 1.5"" x .75"", we need to add 1.5"" to each end to get the outer edge measurement. So the short side pieces will then be 14"" and the long side pieces will be 16"".

, Glue the square dowel to the 1x2, so that the faces are flush.

, Using a box miter (or miter saw, if you have one), cut the ends of the four pieces so that they are at a 45 degree angle. The short end of each miter should be on the side with the square dowel. Sand any rough edges.


The measurement on one side of the short pieces should now be 14"", with the other at 11"".
The measurement on one side of the long pieces should now be 16"", with the other side at 13"".

, Set out a plywood sheet. Measure out the outline of the 14x16"" frame, as well as the inside 11x13"" shape. Nail small pieces of scrap wood at the center on both the inside and outside lines, so that the pieces of the frame can sit snugly between them with the mitered corners still accessible. Glue the mitered edges and then insert the pieces into the jig (careful not to glue them to the surface).

, Using a drill, make pilot holes and then drill a 5 mm hole for your dowels at each of the four corners. This should pass diagonally through the corner, passing at the halfway point along the mitered edge. Then, cover your dowel in glue and fit it through the hole. There should be some extra sticking out on either side. Stretch rubber band around the dowel ends on opposite sides of the frame to hold it together and then remove it from the jig. Allow the glue to dry.

, Score and snap off the extra dowel ends and then sand it down until it's smooth. You can now paint or stain your picture frame.

, You can get glass custom cut to the measurement of the larger square (so that it nestles in the recess created by the square dowels). You can also buy clear acrylic and cut it to size (score on one side and then snap). Place the plastic into the recess, followed by your mat and picture. A backing can be added or you can use nails or clips to hold the picture and glass in place.

Consider decorating the area around your bed.,
Throw on some decorative pillows, a throw, or a bed skirt.,
Hang some curtains behind the bed.,
Drape a floral garland or some string lights on the wall behind your bed.,
Stick some wall decals onto the wall behind your bed.,
Add a or make a headboard.,
Add some lights behind the headboard.,
Slide some drawers under your bed.,
Paint a metal or wood bed frame a new color.",How to Decorate Your Bed1," This can help enhance the look of your bed. This section will give you a few decorating ideas. You do not have to do all of them. Just choose a few that you like best.;
, These can make your bed look fancier and cozier. Tuck some decorative sham pillows behind your sleeping pillows. Drape a throw or cozy blanket over the foot of your bed. If you have a box-spring, then place a bed skirt over the box-spring, under your mattress. To get ideas on how to make your bed cozier with decorative throws and pillows, click here.

, Install a curtain rod above the bed, and slide some curtains onto the rod. The rod should be about the same height as the curtains; you don't want the curtains to puddle behind your bed. Slip the curtains behind your bed.


For an added touch, try using sheer curtains, and then draping white Christmas lights behind the curtains. The lights will shine through the sheer fabric for a soft, magical glow.

, How high you hang the garland or lights is up to you, but you might want to hang them closer to the ceiling than to the top of your bed. Stick some clear, plastic hooks onto the wall. Make them above a foot apart. Drape the garland or lights from these hooks. If you are using string lights, plug them into a wall socket.

, These can help enhance the appearance of your bed. Also, if you choose wall decals that look like a headboard or bedposts, they can look like they are a part of your bed.

, This can really tie your bed together. You can buy one from the store or make one yourself. You can even mimic the appearance of a headboard by hanging a large canvas or tapestry behind your bed. Just make sure that the canvas or tapestry is a few inches wider than your bed and that the bottom edge extends behind your mattress. To find out how to make a simple headboard, click here.


If you have an existing headboard that is made out of metal or wood, consider painting it a different color.
If you are using a canvas, you can paint it using stencils, a solid color, or ombre. You can even paint some abstract designs onto it.

, Find a tube of LED lights, and attach it around the perimeter of the back of the headboard. You can do this using strong glue or clear packaging tape. The lights won't show at all when they are off, but when you turn them on, they will glow from behind the headboard.

, Not only are they a great way to store extra blankets and save space in your closet, but they can help fill in the empty space under your bed.

, Remove all of your bedding and lightly sand your bed. Apply two coats of paint primer, and let it dry. Then, apply two coats of whatever color paint you want. Wait for the paint to dry completely before you put the mattress, sheets, pillows, and blankets back on.Try painting some designs onto your bed or the headboard.
Consider taking the entire bed frame apart before you paint it. This might make it easier to work with.
Just because a paint is dry to the touch does not mean that it is fully dry or cured underneath. Refer to the paint can for more detailed drying times. Some paints are dry and fully cured in as little as four to six hours, while others may require up to 72 hours.

Gather your supplies: A canopy is a great way to add privacy or a dreamy effect to your bed.,
Consider painting your embroidery hoop.,
Take apart the embroidery hoop if you have not already done so.,
Slide both curtains onto the open outer hoop.,
Tie three pieces of ribbon to the inner hoop.,
Tie the top ends of the three ribbons together in a tight knot.,
Slip the inner hoop inside the outer hoop.,
Close the outer hoop.,
Drill a hole into the ceiling and insert the hook.,
Hang the canopy from the hook and drape the curtains around your bed.",How to Decorate Your Bed2," This section will show you how to make a simple ring-based canopy using an embroidery hoop, some ribbon, and a set of sheet curtains. Here's a list of what you will need:1 large embroidery hoop
Acrylic paint (optional)
1 set of sheer curtains
1 ceiling screw hook

, Most of your hoop will be covered, but what shows from beneath the fabric may detract from the overall appearance. To paint the hoop, simply take it apart and paint both pieces using acrylic paint and a paintbrush or foam brush. You can also spray paint both pieces instead. Allow the paint to dry fully before proceeding.


You can paint the hoop the same color as your fabric. This will make it less visible.
You can also paint your hoop in a contrasting color. For example, if your fabric is white, then paint your hoop a bright color, such as teal or pink.

, Unscrew the hoop, and set both the screw and nut aside. Take the inner hoop out and set it aside as well.

, The curtains should have a a casing along the top for the curtain rod; slide the hoop through those casings. Make sure that the wrong side of the fabric is facing the inside of the hoop. The right side of the fabric should be facing the outside of the hoop.

, Try to space them as evenly as you can. The ribbons need to be long enough so that when you hang the hoop from your ceiling, the bottom hem of the curtains brushes against your floor.


You can also use clear fishing line instead.

, Make sure that each ribbon is the same length. If one ribbon is too long or too short, your canopy won't balance right., Move the curtains around on the ring so that they are evenly spaced. There should be no gaps.

, Slip the screw back through the metal holes on the opening of your outer hoop. Place the nut on the end of the screw. Keep twisting the nut until the outer hoop is closed tightly around the inner hoop.

, Some types of ceilings are very soft, and might need a plastic drywall screw first, in order to hold the hook.

, The bottom hem of the curtains should be brushing against your floor. You can pull open the curtains at the front, and drape each panel over the left and right side of your bed. The back part of the curtains should rest behind your headboard."

Gather your supplies: If you don't have a headboard, you can always make a simple one using some cardboard and colored fabric.,
Tape or glue two large pieces of cardboard or foam board.,
Consider painting the cardboard white if you are using a light-colored fabric.,
Sketch out the shape of the headboard.,
Cut the headboard out using a box cutter.,
Spread some fabric out on your floor or table.,
Spray the fabric and cardboard with spray adhesive.,
Place the headboard glue-side down onto the fabric.,
Fold the edges of the fabric over onto the back of the headboard.,
Hot glue the fabric to the back of the headboard, if necessary.,
Hang the headboard above your bed.",How to Decorate Your Bed3," This headboard my not last forever, but it is a great way to see what one may look like on your bed before you upgrade to a sturdier one made out of wood. Here's what you will need:


2 pieces of cardboard that are wider than your bed
Glue or strong tape
Box cutter
Fabric
Scissors
Spray adhesive
Hot glue (optional)
White paint (optional)

, If you are using tape, try to use strong packaging tape or duct tape. The double thickness of the cardboard will make your headboard sturdier., If you don't do this, the color of the cardboard may show through and make your fabric appear darker than it actually is. You can use white acrylic paint and a foam roller, or white spray paint. Be sure to let the paint dry before moving on.

, You can make it however tall you want, but it needs to be at least as wide as your bed. If it is narrower than your bed, it will look too small.


If you are making a curved/fancy headboard, make a template on a piece of paper for just one side of the pattern. Trace the template onto the left side of the headboard. Flip the template over, then trace it on the right side of the headboard. This will ensure that your pattern is the same on both sides., The box cutter may not go through all the layers in one go. If this happens, simply keep gong over the same area again and again until the box cutter goes through.


Consider working over a cutting mat so that you do not ruin your table or floor. Be sure to move the mat as you work, so that it is always under where the knife is cutting.

, Make sure that the wrong side of the fabric is facing you, and that there are no wrinkles. The fabric needs to be a few inches larger than your headboard all around. You will be folding the edges of the fabric over the headboard and gluing them to the back.


If there are any wrinkles in the fabric, you will need to iron them out.

, Use straight, even strokes, and always go in the same direction. Try to overlap each stroke by a little to prevent any gaps. If you painted the cardboard white, then spray the side you painted; this is the side that will be sticking to the fabric.


Consider covering your work surface with newspaper so that the spray adhesive doesn't get on it and make it sticky.

, Try to center it as much as possible, so the fabric boarder is the same width all around.


If you made a curvy headboard, then trim the edges of the fabric down to match the curves; be sure to leave a few inches of seam allowance, of you won't be able to wrap the fabric around the headboard.

, Pull the fabric as taught as you can. If there is a curve, you will need to cut little slits into the edges first; this will help the fabric curve better.

, The spray adhesive may not be strong enough to hold the fabric to the back of the headboard. If you see the fabric peeling up, you will need to glue it down. Apply the hot glue to the back of the headboard and press the fabric down onto it. Hot glue sets quickly, so only apply it ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) at a time.

, Begin by poking two holes into the back of your headboard, one on each side; be careful not to poke through the fabric on the front of your headboard. The holes need to be level, or your headboard won't hang right. Then, attach two hooks onto your wall. The space between the two hooks should be the same as the space between the two holes in your headboard. Hang the headboard onto the hooks; the hooks should slide right into the holes you made.


Be sure that the bottom of the headboard extends behind your mattress.

Consider adding a bed skirt if you have a box-spring.,
Cover your mattress with a mattress protector and a fitted sheet.,
Place a flat sheet down onto your bed.,
Drape a blanket over the top of the fitted sheet.,
Fold the top edge of the fitted sheet over the blanket.,
Consider adding some decorative pillows against the headboard.,
Place your regular pillows down in front of the decorative pillows.,
Consider placing a small, decorative pillow in front of your regular pillows.,
Place a decorative throw or blanket at the foot of the bed.",How to Decorate Your Bed4," Place a bed skirt over the box-spring and secure it around the top edges with upholstery twist pins. This will help keep the bed skirt in place. When you are finished, put your regular mattress back on top, right over the box-spring and bed skirt.


Choose a color that compliments the rest of your room, or your bedding.
The bed skirt can be simple and plain, pleated, or ruffled. It's up to you.

, The mattress protector will keep your mattress clean, while the fitted sheet will give it a new look. You can use a solid-colored fitted sheet or a patterned one. Consider matching it to your bed skirt; this way, the two will blend together and appear as one piece.

, Make sure that the top, finished edge is facing down against the mattress. You will be folding it over a blanket later.

, If you live in a cooler climate, consider using a down comforter. Be sure to cover your comforter with a duvet cover to keep it clean.


Duvet covers come in many different colors and patterns. Try using something that contrasts your fitted sheet.

, This will create a nice band of color at the top of your blanket.

, You will need to take these off when you go to sleep, but they can give your bed that final, luxurious touch. They should be lined up next to each other, and leaning against the headboard. These can be large rectangular pillows, or large square pillows.


Consider using something made from a fancy fabric, such as velvet or brocade.

, Be sure to place your pillows inside some decorative covers. If you can a more unified look, try to match the color or pattern of the decorative covers to your fitted sheet and flat sheet; most are sold as a set.

, Don't put too many, or your bed will start to look cluttered. You will only need one or two.


Try experimenting with different shapes, such as round, square, or tube.

, Fold the throw or blanket in half, so that it does not cover your entire bed."

Put out flowers.",How to Decorate Your Bedroom in Cottage Style," Wood flooring is the most common type of floor for cottage style bedrooms. Hardwood flooring can be expensive. An alternative to actual wood is to buy tile that looks like wood. Or, if the floor is not carpeted (concrete is ideal), you can paint a wood pattern on the floor. If that is still too costly or difficult, you can also buy a rug to convey the cottage style.To save money, you can install the wood flooring on your own. Or, install the tile on your own.;
, If you don’t want to do something as dramatic as changing your flooring, you can also choose to put a simple rug in your room. A large rug in a neutral color, like cream or beige, is great. If you want to incorporate a design, consider a floral pattern.A simple, striped rug is another choice.

, Pick one color for the entire room. One light color is an easy option for a cottage style room. Light yellow, off-white, and light blue are good color choices for cottage style bedrooms. Light blue is great for a beachy, cottage theme. Light yellow, beige, and off-white will work for almost any room., To make your walls look similar to old stone, first paint a light gray base on your walls. Then, use painter’s tape to create the shapes of the stones. Sponge on dark gray paint to create the stone texture. Then, remove the painter’s tape. Finally, use a cheesecloth to refine the texture., First, you will need to buy a three-piece wood-graining kit. Then, apply to coats of satin finishing paint in a brown shade. After that, mix acrylic glaze with white latex paint and apply it with a roller. Use the paint comb that comes in the kit by holding it at a 45-degree angle to create the veins in the paint. Last, use the heel of the rocker that comes in the kit to create the “planks.”Go back and use the comb after you’ve created the planks to vary the look of the planks.
A wood-graining kit can be bought at Home Depot for about $3.

, If you don’t have rustic-looking furniture or furniture that you can paint, check garage sales and vintage shops. Vintage shops may be pricey, so look at garage sales if you want to save money. Look for furniture that already appears distressed and furniture that you wouldn’t mind painting.


You can also look at shops like Goodwill for cheap furniture.

, A simple wooden desk and a chair are perfect for a cottage style. If you don’t want to have just a desk, consider getting a desk with a vanity mirror. To make the chair more comfortable, add a cushion to it. You can look for a cushion with a gingham pattern, floral pattern, or a cushion with animals, like deer or rabbits., Other than a bed, desk, chair, and a dresser, matching side tables would complete the furniture for the room. Look for simple, wooden tables that would match the rest of the furniture in your room. Inexpensive tables that you wouldn’t mind painting and/or distressing is ideal.You may also want to have a wardrobe if there isn’t a closet in your room.

, Look for a wooden wardrobe and/or dresser to put in your room. You can find a wooden dresser/wardrobe at any furniture stores, but it is better to look at vintage shops and garage sales if you are planning to alter the piece of furniture in any way. Unpainted wood, distressed wood, and wood that has been painted white are good choices for the wardrobe or dresser.You can paint a design, like flowers, on the dresser or wardrobe.

, Look for a bed with a canopy or wooden backboard. For the canopy bed, curtains that are cotton or netted fabric are ideal. If you choose to have a backboard, look for a wooden backboard. You can even make your own by nailing planks of wood together and painting them in the color of your choice.


Curtains made out of fabrics like velvet might look out of place.

, If you want a simple and clean look, use one color to paint wooden furniture in your room. White, cream, yellow, and robin’s egg blue are good choices for a cottage style. You can take it a step further by distressing your furniture., Once you have painted the furniture, consider using techniques to distress the pieces. The easiest method is to use sandpaper. Distress the areas that would most likely naturally begin to distress over time, like corners, sides, and areas where the handles are. Take the sandpaper and rub it over the paint until it looks as distressed as you’d like it to be. Then, finish with wax or varnish.Use fine-grit sandpaper. A sandpaper with a rougher texture could do too much damage to the furniture.
You only need to sandpaper gently. If you use the sandpaper with too much force, you could damage the furniture more than intended.

, There are several ways to achieve soft lighting in your room. During the day, you can put thin, cotton curtains over the window that will filter the sunlight throughout the day. For the darker hours, look for light bulbs with a Kelvin temperature of 2700 or less for warm, soft lighting. It is also an option to light candles in place of lamps at night., A fluffy, white comforter is ideal for a cottage style bedroom. You can choose to pair it with white sheets, or get sheets in a light color, like pink or blue. If you don’t want a white bedding state, beige, light blue, and green are good colors. You can layer the colors if you don’t want one solid color for your bedding. If you prefer patterns, floral, striped, and checkerboard patterns are great for this style.For instance, you can have a light purple comforter and pillows with light blue sheets and light yellow throw pillows.

, White or lightly colored cotton curtains are ideal for a cottage style bedroom because they let in natural lighting and work well with the design of the room. You can find cotton curtains at most interior design stores and stores like Target or Walmart. If you prefer a design, gingham curtains work well too.

, Some subjects that would work well are landscapes, pastoral settings, animals, and still life scenes. You can find inexpensive art prints at places like Goodwill, vintage stores, garage sales, and even online. Hang them up without a frame, or find a distressed wooden frame to hang them in.You can distress the wooden frames the same way you would distress the furniture. Use sandpaper to gently rub the corners and sides.

, Flowers will bring the room together and complete it. You can choose to put out fresh, dried, or plastic flowers. Daisies, carnations, sunflowers, and tulips are some good choices. Any type of flower will work, though."

Use a variety of shades.,
Mix cool neutrals with warm neutrals.,
Incorporate one or two accent colors.",How to Decorate Your Bedroom with Neutral Colors1," Use various shades of gray, white, black, or beige. However, don’t be afraid to step outside of gray, white, or beige. By tinting a bright color with white or black and combining it with another color, you can create a new hue.For example, you can turn red into a neutral color by tinting it with white and mixing it with brown.
Using a variety of shades will help your bedroom feel balanced, as well as unified.;
, Use both cool and warm neutrals to balance your room. Warm neutrals will brighten up a cool bedroom, while cool neutrals will tone down a bright room.For example, if your bedroom walls are painted a cool neutral color like navy blue, then brighten up the room with warm pieces of furniture like a white chaise lounge and gold bedside tables.

, Accent colors are a great way to prevent a room from having a washed out look. When choosing accent colors, use colors with brown or gray undertones.For example, if your color palette is cream, gray, and beige, include an indigo throw blanket, pillows, or rug to add color to your bedroom.

"
"
Use patterns.,
Include a variety of textures.,
Play with shapes.",How to Decorate Your Bedroom with Neutral Colors2," You can include patterns by choosing patterned wallpaper, a patterned comforter, or chairs with patterned upholstery. Patterned rugs, pillows, and drapes are also a great way to incorporate patterns into your bedroom., Fur rugs, leather headboards, and wicker or bamboo furniture are just a few ways you can add texture to your bedroom. Also, mix contrasting textures together like smooth textures with rough or matte with shiny textures.Different textures create a visual contrast that can bring a neutral bedroom alive.

, Incorporating furniture with distinct shapes can also take your bedroom to the next level. An armchair with a striking silhouette or a chaise lounge, for example, are just a few ways you can play with shapes."
"
Use artwork.,
Add unique pieces.,
Incorporate dark wood pieces.,
Choose metallic accessories.",How to Decorate Your Bedroom with Neutral Colors3," Artwork is a great way to add character to a neutral bedroom. Use a variety of artwork to add depth to your bedroom like sculptures, paintings, and photography. Also, try to pick artwork that matches the accented colors in your bedroom.For example, if you are using indigo as an accent color, then choose artwork that incorporates indigo as well.

, Unique pieces of furniture are another great way to add character to your bedroom. Incorporate found or antique bedside tables, lamps, mirrors, chairs, and even a chandelier to make your bedroom standout., Dark wooden bedside tables, lamps, chairs, and stools are a great way to make your bedroom pop. Additionally, when picking wooden furniture, pick pieces with different wood tones to add variety.This is a great choice for people who have wooden floors in their bedroom.

, Metallic accessories are another great way to make your neutral bedroom pop. Choose from silver, gold, copper, or bronze bedside tables, vases, lamps, drapes, and pendants, to name a few."

Gather your supplies.,
Cut a shadowbox to fit your picture frame.,
Insert a sheet of hardware cloth into the shadowbox.,
Secure the plywood backing to the frame.,
Paint your frame.,
Fill the living picture frame with potting soil.,
Poke small holes in the soil.,
Press the plant cuttings into the holes.,
Give the plants time to take root.,
Hang and care for your living picture.,
Plant your cuttings in an attractive pattern.,
Use contrasting colors.,
Mix and match plants of various sizes.,
Play around with negative space.",How to Plant a Living Picture with Plants," To put together your own living picture, you’ll need an old or unused portrait frame, four 1x3 boards, a sheet of ½“ hardware cloth, a scrap piece of plywood, a hammer, nails and wood staples. You’ll also need a bag of potting soil and a hook or length of wire to hang your living picture later on.Check for inexpensive picture frames of the appropriate size at places like flea markets, vintage stores and estate sales.As for the plants themselves, you can purchase or harvest your pick of any number of hearty succulents, or find rugged species of plants like grasses and small shrubs that can withstand the unique demands of vertical gardening.;
, Measure the 1x3 boards to the same specifications as the picture frame you’ve acquired for the project. Saw the boards into sections of the appropriate length to correspond to the sides of the frame. Attach the corners of the boards using nails to fashion a basic shadowbox.Measure each of your wooden components carefully before you make any cuts.
Use naturally water-resistant woods like cedar and redwood to encourage drainage and prevent overwatering the plants.The addition of a deep shadowbox will provide adequate room to contain the potting soil and roots of the plants, while also giving your living picture a more commanding three-dimensional appearance.

, Using the same measurements you took before, trim the hardware cloth so that it slides into place inside the shadowbox without bending or resistance. Staple the edges of the hardware cloth to the inner wall of the shadowbox.The grid like openings of the hardware cloth will be just narrow enough to hold compacted soil in place, yet just wide enough to insert the plant seeds and cuttings through.

, Once again, use the dimensions of the picture frame for reference when cutting the plywood to size. Align the corners of the plywood backing with those of the shadowbox and nail them down. Then, fit the shadowbox, screen and backing into the frame and use a few more nails to make sure they all hold together. Your living picture frame is now complete!You’ll need to remove the glass front and included backing from the frame before putting the shadowbox planter into place.

, At this stage, you can add some flair by customizing your frame with a special color scheme. Brush on a primer first, then layer on 2-3 coats of acrylic or latex paint until the frame is a uniform shade. Finish with a clear coat lacquer to waterproof the frame and make it suitable for outdoor use.Waterproof paints are preferable, as they'll protect the frame from damage caused by soil and water runoff.
Try color washing your frame for a more weathered, antique look.

, Snip the corner off a bag of soil to create a narrow spout. Starting with the edges, go around the frame and pour in the soil until it just touches the underside of the hardware cloth. Give the frame an occasional shake while you work to level off the soil and help it distribute more evenly.You can also add a small amount of fertilizer to the potting soil to promote the health of new plants. Look for nitrogen-rich fertilizers and mix a light sprinkling into the fresh soil before you fill the frame.
Formulate your own soil specifically for succulent plants by mixing two parts moist soil from your yard or garden with one part sand and small pebbles., Use a chopstick, screwdriver or slender wooden dowel to burrow into the soil about 1-1.5” deep. This will create a series of small holes that will make planting the seeds and cuttings much more expedient. Dig one hole for each plant you intend to grow.Make sure the holes are relatively narrow and that the soil around the opening isn’t cracked or loose.
Be careful not to make the holes so deep that you reach the plywood backing.
Confirm that the holes you dig are wide enough to accommodate the root bulbs of larger succulent species.

, Insert the cuttings through the wire screen of the hardware cloth root-side down. They should fit perfectly into the holes you just opened up. After all the cuttings are in place, pat the soil around the visible portion of the plants to anchor them.At this point, you should begin thinking about how you want your finished living picture to look. This will give you an idea of what type of planting pattern will work best.
Plant leaf cuttings at an angle to the soil, with the trimmed end below the surface., You won’t hang your living picture right away. Seeds and young cuttings will need two to four weeks of constant sunlight and daily watering to begin growing. When the roots have spread and found traction in the soil, the plants will be resilient enough to mount without coming loose.For the first week or so, aim to water your plants once a day. Simply wet the top of the soil around each of the plants. As they develop, they’ll require less and less water and general maintenance., Once the roots have secured themselves in the soil, you'll be able to mount the frame with no fear of the plants coming dislodged. Attach the hook or wire hanger to the upper portion of the plywood backing and display it in a well-lit section of your living room, kitchen, patio or garden. Take the frame down whenever you need to water the plants or add new fertilizer to the soil.You can also water the plants using a spray bottle. Give them a generous misting once or twice a day, and be sure to saturate the soil as well as the foliage.
Make sure the soil is adequately drained before rehanging the living picture.

, While you’re digging holes for the plants, exercise some creative forethought to make interesting designs and configurations. You could arrange different species in alternating rows, or sew brilliantly colored plants in dazzling sweeps and swirls. Remember, your living picture is as much a work art as it is gardening.Use small, vertical succulents to produce symmetrical designs like swirls or a zigzagging Chevron pattern.
Accumulate a gallery of living pictures and use each to explore a different style of planting and arrangement.

, Hearty flowering plants come in a myriad of unique and unusual hues. Japanese iris and begonias, for instance, are typically a delicate violet color, while Oncidium orchids glow a fiery red when they reach maturity. Incorporate the wide range of plants available to you into your palette and cultivate an arrangement that’s truly stunning.Succulents like lampranthus, clivia and balsam all produce large flowers with rich, bold coloring.If you’re unsure what a particular species looks like once it develops, search for photos online or consult the planting and maintenance info guide that comes with newly purchased plants., Look for combinations of plants with shapes and structure that offset one another. In a diverse living picture, Aeonium blossoms will burst forth from a sea of creeping green clover while spikes of spider aloe protrude tower-like from a ring in the center. The possibilities are nearly limitless—listening to your aesthetic sensibilities will help you piece together a one-of-a-kind display.Find out how big you can expect your plants of choice to grow before sewing them. You don’t want one oversized fern or aloe to dominate your living picture.
Prune your plants regularly to keep them from spilling over the edges of the frame., You don’t have to plant over every square inch of your frame. The soil itself can actually be used to enhance the look of a living picture by breaking up dense patches of color and adding depth and visual texture from. See how you might include glimpses of sandy soil and glistening wire to make your designs more purposeful and sophisticated.Embellish your living picture with colored stones, ribbons, pendants and other decorative accents."

Decide which type of storage will work best with your personality/schedule.",How to Store Toilet Paper in Decorative Ways1," Don’t worry about how you will store it, just locate an area near the commode, shower or sink that could possibly be turned into a small storage area. Remember--storage doesn’t mean it has to sit on the ground either.;
, How your bathroom is decorated will most likely dictate the kind of storage you will end up using. For example, if you have a lot of crystal and white towels, you may want to consider a clear vase or jar for the T.P. However, if animal prints or a wilder style is more your taste, you could get funkier and create a small print hammock for your supplies.

, Even though replacing toilet paper is one of the easiest “chores” at home, some people simply don’t do it. Make sure that the storage system you select is something that you will easily maintain and keep up.

Gather the supplies.,
Find the picture you'd like framed.,
Open up the CD case.,
Cut off enough foil to cover the back of the CD case.,
Cover the back part of the CD.,
Take your selected picture.,

Using the hanging thread that you have, create a hanging loop.,
Attach the silver rectangular piece of foil over the gap on the CD lid.,
Hang it up!,
Finished.

",How to Make a Picture Frame from a CD Case," These are listed below in ""Things You'll Need"". Lay them out on a flat, clean working surface.;
, Lay it on top of the CD case. Check to see whether it fits in the portion where the CD would normally go. If not, trim it to the appropriate size.

, Remove the CD holding portion (usually made from opaque plastic). Remove the paper artwork as well – see Remove the Back Art from a CD Case.


Take off the lid as well (the part that opens up). Do this carefully, so as not to snap anything.

, When you cut the square, leave a little extra around the edges, so that you fold the foil over the back.


If using brand new foil, you can either leave the tin foil the way it is, or squish it into a ball and re-open it to give it a crinkled effect.
If using the recycled foil, it will already have a ""crinkled"" appearance.

, Fold the foil around the edges to the back of the CD backing, so that it's secure. Tape if needed.


Smooth out any wrinkles or bumps, including down the edges.

, Double check that it still fits (it should do unless you've bungled the width of the foil when folding). Put 3 or 4 balls of tape on the back of the image; alternately, if the image fits snugly enough, you may not need to use tape - just check it first.


Press the picture into the tin foil portion where it looks best.

, You might need to unwrap a little of your folding work to locate it but it's fine to push right through the foil to reattach the lid. You will notice that there is a gap where the CD paper artwork used to fill.


Fold a rectangular strip the width of the gap, with enough length at each end to fold around the CD case. Don't attach it just yet, as you will need to open the case again for the next step.

,


Slide each end of the thread through the top slots (holes) of the CD lid. You can use a toothpick to help push through the thread if needed.
Tie knots in each end of the thread. If the thread you are using is very thin, you might need to wrap around tape as well to create enough of a knotted bump. Cut off any excess length under the knot.
Pull the thread up evenly and the knots should keep the thread from slipping through the slots.

, Use tape to attach it at the back for added security.

, It's all done. Now you can put it on your bulletin board or hang from nails on the wall; whatever you wish! It's funky and cool, and gives a nice feel to your room.

, This method may hold up to three or possibly four rolls (depending on the size) at once. Keep near the toilet or behind the tank.

, The top of a box of DVDs or CDs is the perfect size to hold a reserve roll of T.P. House it on the floor or the tank for quick access.

, Simply tip the hat upside down and place rolls inside. If possible, go for a larger hat for better storage.

Complement new fixtures and decorations.",How to Paint Bathroom Cabinets," Before you get started, take off the cabinet doors, pull out drawers and pop off false drawer plates. You'll also want to unscrew any handles, pulls, stops or hinges that might get in the way while you’re painting. This way, you'll be able to work without obstructions. Keep everything together in one place to avoid losing important pieces.Labeling the individual bits of hardware or placing them in separate plastic bags can make it easier to keep track of everything.If you’d also like to use this project as a chance to install new hardware, this would be an opportune time.;
, Go over the outside of the doors, panels and baseboards with a high-grit sandpaper. There’s no need to remove every trace of paint or lacquer—you just want to make the cabinet’s outer surfaces coarse enough for the primer to cling to. Work out any rough edges or irregularities and aim for a smooth finish.Sand using smooth, circular motions, moving outward as you progress. Run the sandpaper straight along edges and narrow panels.
Don’t forget to get inside corners and along the inner edges of the cabinet doors.
Use a Shop-Vac to deal with the dust and debris when you’re done.

, Apply a basic primer to the areas you plan on painting. One thin, even coat should do the job. Primer will be useful for protecting the cabinet’s underlying materials and getting the paint to hold better.Primers should be specially formulated for use with the type of paint you’re working with. Water-based primers, for example, should be used only with water-based paints.Lightly sand dry primer to make the painting surface more uniform.

, Use a few strips of painter’s tape to mask the underside and inner edges of the cabinets, including the area where the cabinet meets the wall. Make sure the tape is straight and even to avoid glaring mistakes. Painter’s tape will allow you to establish exact boundaries for your paint job and cover areas that you want to keep clear.Wider tape will give you a greater margin of error and can be useful for painting near walls and trim.
If you’d prefer not to remove your cabinet doors prior to painting, fold a piece of painter’s tape over the hinges to keep paint from getting on them.

, Make sure your paint is thoroughly blended and free of clumps or separation. You can do this with an electric drill with a paint paddle attachment if the paint has been sitting in storage for a while, or simply give it a stir if you’re just bringing it home. The better the paint is mixed, the smoother coverage it will create.Oil based paints may separate more than other varieties.
Do your blending outside and set down a few sheets of newspaper or cardboard to protect from splatters.

, Paint cracks, crevices and other hard to reach spaces first, using a brush to give you greater control. Afterwards, go over flat, broad surfaces using a dense foam roller. Let the initial coat set up for a couple of hours before applying subsequent coats.Don’t worry too much about making the first coat flawless. You can cover up any visible imperfections with later coats.

, Most cabinets will require two to three coats for a seamless finish. For the final coat, use a steady hand and a consistent brushing pattern. Watch out for drips, as these can permanently settle into the complete finish once it dries. When you’re done, the your cabinets should have a rich, uniform appearance.Use your best judgment after applying the base coat to decide how many follow-up coats will be necessary.
Many new types of paint are self-leveling, which means they won’t run or clot as easily. Working with these paints can save you a lot of frustration in achieving the perfect finish, as well as additional mess during cleanup., The paint will dry to the touch within 24-48 hours, though it may take up to a week for it to harden to the point that it becomes resistant to scuffs and other marks. Leave the doors open to provide air flow. Once the cabinets are dry, reassemble the doors, put all hardware back into place and enjoy the newfound beauty and relaxation of your bathroom!Keep small children and pets away from wet paint as it dries.
Leaving the fan running in the bathroom may help the paint set up at a faster rate.

, Most experts recommend choosing a paint with a smooth, creamy consistency, rather than one with a lot of luster or texture. This will make your cabinets easier to clean. It can also help diffuse the lighting in your bathroom and create a soft, warm atmosphere. Silky finishes also tend to last longer, as they don’t lose as much shine as time goes on.Smooth paints are easy to clean and resistant to mildew buildup, which will be a plus for humid bathrooms where bathing is done.
A single gallon of paint should be more than enough to redesign your bathroom and still have some left over for future projects.

, When picking out paint for your bathroom, listen to your gut and get as creative as you please. Now is your chance to reimagine the room with a beachy aesthetic complete with a seafoam green vanity, or lend it a peaceful springtime glow using lavender or other pastels. Feel free to explore new, daring ideas.Compare samples until you find a paint that really stands out to you.Don’t be afraid to experiment with different colors in order to find the right one. If it doesn’t come out the way you want, all you have to do is repaint.

, If you’ve traditionally had light or dark cabinets in your bathroom, switch things up and reverse the appearance of the room. Redo dark shades or wood stains in a light cream finish, or paint over plain white surfaces with sleek, attractive colors like gunmetal or hunter green. Taking your bathroom’s color scheme in the opposite direction will make it look and feel like a whole new room.Lighter shades will be good for country-style homes and bathrooms with large windows, and for making small half baths look roomier.Dark colors can be used to establish a relaxing spa-like atmosphere, especially when paired with natural hues and materials.

, Choose a paint that suits the rest of the decor in the bathroom. For instance, you could bring out the ruddy hues of a brass faucet with teal or rustic red paint, or use navy or charcoal gray to highlight the polished shine of chrome hardware. Look at the entire room as a whole and go with colors and finishes that look natural and tasteful together.Neutral colors will go with the widest range of accessories.
Bright colors should be chosen carefully so as not to clash with ornamental fixtures that attract a lot of attention."

Include a toothbrush case, toothpaste and a small glass in a separate basket. Place the more cluttered basket on a higher shelf so that the contents will not be within view.

Look for the right metals.",How to Make a Bathroom Look Vintage1," Detached tubs hearken back to a time when indoor plumbing was scarce. As such, built-in tubs were rare. The claw-foot tub is a classic design, and smooth porcelain was one of the most popular materials for early tubs due to the fact that it is an easy surface to clean.;
, Like detached tubs, detached pedestal sinks recall an era before the widespread use of indoor plumbing. Select a curvy design to give your bathroom a Victorian look or a straight-edged, boxy design if you want to give your bathroom a Craftsman look, which is the style that immediately followed the Victorian era. If you don't want to lose storage space, consider retrofitting an antique dresser into a bathroom vanity.

, The earliest toilets did not have a built-in tank. Instead, the tank and the bowl were separate, and the tank usually hung on the wall high about the wall. The handle was attached to the tank by a long metal chain.

, Chrome and other shiny metals tend to create a modern ambiance. For a vintage style, opt for dull metals instead, like copper, wrought iron, nickel, and oiled bronze.

This will help keep you from over spending, or over spending on an area that is less important. It's easy to lose track of money when decorating a room!;
, You should ask your child what they want their room to look like...they probably have a few ideas! But you'll want to keep in mind how the design can change over time. Remember, just because your little girl likes Princesses right now doesn't mean she won't grow out of it in a few years and decide she hates her room. Try to choose decorations that are easy to change, so that you don't have to spend a lot of money later.


This is also true with teens. They have their own style, but think about what you're going to do with the room once they move out.

, You can of course just go with a few colors that look nice and standard decorations, but choosing a theme can make your life a lot easier. A theme gives you a preset color palette or series of color palettes to work with, as well as a guide for furniture, toys, and decorations to buy.

, Whether you're going with a theme or not, you'll want to choose a color palette to help the room look unified and organized. If you're absolutely terrible with colors, use tools like the room palettes provided by paint companies or even free online tools like Adobe Kuler.

, Always talk to your child throughout the design process and every time you go to buy a new item. You don't want to end up with something that they hate and then both of you are upset! Giving them the feeling of choice is also important, as this helps them to grow and mature.

, Think about how your kid plays, how old they are, and how they could realistically use the space. It's easy to design a room that you'd like for yourself but remember that kids have very different needs than adults. Their personality will also play a big part in how they enjoy the room and what they'll need to get the most from their room.


For example, a bench at the foot of the bed is useful for you to get ready in the morning, but your child wouldn't use one.
For example, are they more bookish? If so It's probably more important to have a reading area with a comfy place to sit than a larger play area that they'll never use. But it depends on them!

, Kids benefit from open floor space in a way that adults do not, so try to find ways to give them as much space as possible. A good way to do this is to make some spaces do double duty. A loft bed, for example, is not only fun for your child but allows you to tuck away items like a dresser and a desk, so that your child has the rest of the room to play in.

, When arranging furniture in a room, it's a good idea to try to group the furniture items by function. For example, put the dresser and bed next to each other because those are the functional items of the room, and have another area that's for play and contains bookshelves and toys.


You can even use furniture to divide a room into smaller sections. Make a secret bed cove by placing the bed against the back wall and then placing big book shelves across in front of it. Your child will love their secret hide out!

, Remember: you don't want big furniture in a small room if you can help it. If your child's bedroom is small, don't take up all the space to move around with big beds and dressers that they don't really need. You should also remember that kids are small...a big bed that they have to jump to get in to isn't going to help them a lot, for example.

, Kids make messes: we all know it. So if you want to keep your child's room looking nice, it's important for any room makeover to include lots of storage. A great way to do this is to add under-bed storage. Get some boxes that fit under the bed and can slide out easily to store toys and winter coats and blankets. Better yet, invest in a captain's bed and save even more space.

, Even if your child is too young to read now, you should have lots of books that you can read to them and room for books to go in the future. Bookshelves are also useful for storing other items, like stuffed animals, dolls, or personal items. Although one thing about this is what type of book it also depends on them so you need to be careful here!

, A toy organizer, which is usually a series of colorful tubs on a shelf, is a great way to help create more space on the floor for your child to play. As they get older, it can be moved from organizing toys to organizing school papers or even clothes.

, Put some laundry baskets in your child's room and encourage them to use the baskets. This will help keep clothes off the floor, giving them more space to play and lounge around.

, Your child should have a space that's dedicated to working on homework. This will help remove temptations and distractions so that they can focus on what's most important. By having a dedicated study space, you'll help them build good habits and know that they have to focus when they're in that space.


For most kids this would mean having a desk in their room, but your child might do better with squishy floor seating like a bean bag chair and a lap desk.

, Their study area should be as distraction free as possible. This means it should not have toys or too many decorations too close by, and avoid putting it near major hallways or facing windows. It will also need to be well organized, with storage and places to keep everything they need.

, Make the desk area that you set aside for them as comfortable as possible. Having a sore bum can really make you not want to do homework anymore! Get a good chair and a desk at an adjustable height, if possible, so that they don't outgrow it.

, It's better, especially when your kids are young, to pay attention to what your child does on the internet, so keep their computer in a family area. Having a computer where they do paper assignments can also be very distracting. It is a good idea to have a big enough desk to put a computer on when they're older, otherwise it will become precarious and you might have to buy a new one or let them work somewhere else.

, Choose colors that are classic and bright for a theme that will last your child into their teens and beyond. Teal, bright green, white, and red make a good color palette that works for any gender child and will still appeal to a teen.

, A dark blue room with hints of silver throughout is a great basis for a room. Space is a fun theme for a kid that will still be ""cool"" when they're 16, if you do it right. Get items like a moon lamp, bedding with stars, icicle lights around the top of the room, and other details that draw the room together.

, And under-the-water look will appeal to lots of kids and it's easy to help it grow up with them. Use colors like light and dark teal, seafoam, and a few hints of green. This room works particularly well if you have beige carpets already installed. A couple of stuffed fish friends and something like a jellyfish lamp can further draw the room together.

, Excite your child's sense of adventure by giving them a room that any explorer would love. Paint the room with the muted colors of maps (off-white, light green, beige, and maybe some hints of red), and decorate with globes, vintage suitcase storage, airplane mobiles, and train maps.

, Some greens and browns, with a few hints of blues can create the basis of a room that your child can enjoy for years to come. This is a great room for a kid that loves stuffed animals, as they'll fit right in! Get a unique look by creating a wall tree out of paper, and a circular blue rug makes a great ""pond"" at the center of the room.

, If your little girl longs to be a princess, avoid painting the whole room pink by going with a fairy tale castle theme instead. Grassy green on the lower part of the walls and sky blue on the upper parts will create the look of rolling hills, some tall gray bookshelves can be painted to look like towers, and a stuffed dragon in the corner can complete the look.

Try oak or other varnished wood flooring.,
Consider marble-print tile.,
Look for hexagonal tiles.",How to Make a Bathroom Look Vintage2," Wood flooring was one of the earliest types of smooth flooring available, which made it a popular choice for early bathrooms. Choose a highly polished wood that will be easy to clean.

, Marble has a very Victorian edge to it, but marble itself can be rather expensive. If real marble is out of your price range, then look for cheaper square floor tiles that come in marble print.

, Hexagonal tiles primarily came onto the scene during the Art Deco period. You can go for a completely Art Deco look by selecting bright tiles, or you can mix-and-match vintage styles by choosing hexagonal tiles in a more subdued color, like white.

Install a small chandelier.,
Look for individual light fixtures that extend off the wall.,

Hang an ornate, beveled mirror.,
Line your shelves with old-fashioned glass jars.,
Take a seat on an antique chair.",How to Make a Bathroom Look Vintage3," A crystal chandelier can give your bathroom an elegant appearance, but make sure you choose a small fixture that does not overwhelm the space. Chandeliers predate the days of electricity, but even after electric chandeliers replaced their candlelit counterparts, they served as a desirable mark of high-class luxury.

, Globe fixtures, votives, and boxy lanterns are all potential lighting options if you decide against a chandelier. The fixtures should have noticeable metal settings, and you should completely skip bright bar lights that contain multiple bulbs in one fixture.

, White plastic and painted wood creates a more contemporary appearance. Varnished wood highlights the natural beauty of the wood and would have been far more common in vintage bathrooms, especially during the Craftsman era.

, Cabinets were somewhat rare in the earliest bathrooms, especially during the Victorian era. Instead of using cabinets, you can store your products on shelves. Polished wood and marble shelves look especially vintage.

, Early bathrooms rarely included cabinets or sinks with built-in mirrors. The mirror can be full-length or half-length, but the more ornate the surrounding metal frame is, the more antique it will look.

, If you want to give your bathroom an extra “oomph,” pour your soaps, shampoos, and lotions out of their modern plastic containers and into antique glass jars.

, If you have a large enough bathroom, an antique-style chair may be just what you need to complete your vintage look. Choose a simple chair with a linen-lined seat and back on a basic wooden frame, like a Louis XV style chair. Chairs have the added bonus of acting as another surface for you to store your linens on.

Go with an all-white motif to give your bathroom a Victorian ambiance.,
Add soft, pastel accents of turquoise, pink, and blue if you want a slightly modern twist on Victorian style.,
Look for earthy browns, yellows, greens, and reds if you want a Craftsman feel.,
Opt for bright colors, like yellow, green, blue, and pink, to give your bathroom Art Deco pizzazz.",How to Make a Bathroom Look Vintage4," Victorians were somewhat obsessed with cleanliness, and a pure white or ivory bathroom creates as clean and crisp an appearance as possible.

, Color would not be completely out of place in a Victorian-themed bathroom, but if you introduce color, you should select pastel shades and use them to accent the room’s white features.

, The Craftsman style drew inspiration from nature, and as a result, warm shades of green and brown were especially common.

, The Art Deco age brought about an interest in vibrant hues. Select tiling and wall paint in bright, eye-popping shades.

Instead, stick with cheery colors like sky blue, sunshine yellow, cream, aloe green, etc. (These are not real paint colors, or if they are it is coincidence that they are listed here--these were simply written as examples).


If light colors really aren’t your thing and you really want something darker, go with vibrant, bright colors like burnt orange, cherry red, or bright turquoise. These colors will make a bold statement without making the walls seem like they are closing in on a guest.





;
, Mirrors are an excellent way to make a room seem larger. If you already have a closet with a full-length mirror for a door, excellent! Do not replace it for anything. If you don’t have a mirror already installed, consider using mirrors as decorations. Make cool arrangements with odd shaped mirrors on your walls, or hang a large mirror somewhere. These additions really will help make your room feel like it has become larger.

, If your tiny bedroom has features like a fireplace, or an odd nook, use it to your advantage. Use the top of the fireplace like a bookshelf. Or, if it is a taller fireplace that has been sealed off, place your bed up against it, letting the moulding of the fireplace act as a headboard. Nooks and crannies can be filled with chairs, a desk, or even a small built-in and cushioned bench for reading, particularly in front of windows.

, As custom cubby design that incorporates your bed can go a long way in a small room. Imagine it as an extended headboard that doubles as a bunch of cupboards. Of course, its important to remember to build around your bed--leave enough room so that you can sit up in your bed against the wall without hitting your head on a shelf or cubby., Because your room is small, you will want to make it feel as open as possible. When too many decorations are hung on the walls, it can have a similar effect to painting your walls a very dark color--the room suddenly feels like a cave. Instead, go with a few wall decorations (like mirrors) and leave other decorations for the surface spaces.

, For most small bedrooms, the focal point will either be the bed or the window. Because you don’t want these two items warring with one another for attention, its best to choose one as the focus of the room. Whichever you select, dress the other focus point neutrally. For instance, if you choose to focus on the bed, play the headboard space up with a few bright throw pillows and a fun duvet cover. At the same time, use neutral colors like white, cream, grey, or tan for curtains on your window.You can also create a win-win situation by placing your bed under your window--the two will combine into one pretty focus point.







, While you may be inclined to buy a large bed (who isn’t?) you should probably stick to a smaller bed that can fit in the room without taking up all of the floor space. Fulls and doubles are generally the way to go in a small space. However, if your are decorating a kid’s small bedroom, definitely stick with a twin bed--they take up the least amount of space., If you really want to maximize your space, a loft bed is a great option. You can sleep up above and still have enough room for a desk, couch, yoga area, or any other item you are hoping to fit into your room.

, If you are short on floor space, you might consider a floating nightstand. Purchase a closet shelf, which can be bought at a home furnishing store, and install it upside down on your wall. This will provide you with a place to store things, put an alarm clock, or add some decorative touches to your bedside area.You can also install regular shelves that will work the same way as the closet shelf, but won’t have the blocked ends to keep things from falling off.

, If you do have enough space for a bedside table, try out a console table that has thin legs. Rather than having a bulky or cabinet-filled side table, this sleeker side table will take up less room while still allowing you to display keepsakes or place a lamp next to your bed.

, If you want to put a TV in your room, opt for a small flat screen that can be installed on the wall, placed on a thin console, or kept housed in a bookshelf cubby. The key here is to take advantage of the thinness of the TV--place it somewhere where a larger TV couldn’t go (like on the wall).

, Because you have such a small space, you will need to keep it neat and clutter free. While a pile of t-shirts might not look like much in a larger room, in your bedroom it could potentially look like a mountain. Make a point of keeping your area tidy by making your bed everyday, putting things away after you have used them, and hanging up clothes at night.It is also a good idea to have a laundry basket or bag somewhere in your room--like your closet.







, If you find that you don’t have much surface space to put a light on, you might want to install some wall lights or hanging light. In particularly, hanging lights, like a funky chandelier, can really spruce up a room. Because they are hanging from above or off the wall, they also take up less space than a standard desk lamp does.

, One of the most classic tricks to fitting everything you need into a small bedroom is by storing things under your bed. Of course, this requires your bed to be on a frame, which is a necessity if you are living in a small room. As for the boxes, boxes on wheels work well on wooden floors. Plastic storage bins are also great for under the bed storage.

, Shelving units can double as footboards. Place a cushion on top of the unit and it can even become a place to sit. These shelving units can have cabinets, cubbies, or both, for storing things you want put away and things you want to display.

, With a small bedroom you have to get sneaky about your storage. A headboard that actually acts like a cabinet is one of those great storage secrets. You can buy these types of headboards online or at home furnishing stores. Place it behind your bed, lift up the panel, and place the your stuff in the cupboard.You can also consider purchasing a headboard that has cubbies built into it. Place books, decorative objects, or bedtime necessities in the cubbies and cabinets.







, It is best not to clutter the surfaces of your furniture with the little trinkets that you hold dear but don’t necessarily need to see everyday. Instead of having them out all over the place, try out some unique storage options that allow you easy access to them when you want them. One of the best options is the hollowed out book method. You cut out the center of the pages so that a chamber forms in the middle of the book. You can then put small keepsakes in the book and place it on your bookshelf or in a drawer of your bedside table.

, If you don’t have enough space to hang shelves on your wall, why not make them inside your wall. To do this, you will need to cut a vertical rectangle out of the wall in between the studs in the wall. Once you have done that, you can recover the space with drywall or wood. In the insert you have now made in the wall, hang shelves. You have now effectively made a bookshelf inside your wall.You can also try out ‘invisible’ bookshelves. These shelves will help you store stuff you would normally put on shelves, without actually needing the wall space to put the shelves up. Click here for more information.

, If you have an angled or triangular ceiling, there are still ways you can make that low space for you. Because the ceiling is angled, you probably won’t use the space where the angled ceiling meets the wall very often. Install a built-in row of cabinets and cubbies along the wall. While doing this will take up some floor space, it will also provide you with plenty of storage and surface space, allowing you to use other parts of your room for things other than storage.

Ditch the dark colors.,
Lose the foot board.,
Remove clutter.",How to Decorate a Small Room Which Has a Large Bed1," Dark colors in an already small room can make your bedroom feel like a cave. If you like dark colors, use them in accessories like throw pillows, area rugs, and accents in drapery and bed linen. Consider using lighter colors on the walls and ceiling to open up the space visually. Bring in natural light as much as possible to illuminate the space and your mood.A light, neutral-colored carpeting will seem to disappear into the room, tricking the eye. Similarly, horizontal stripes will widen the room, making it seem larger.
Keep your bedding clean, neat, and simple. Detailed patterns and outrageous colors draw the eye to the largest item in the room, highlighting its size.;
, A small bedroom is not the place for a sleigh bed. It just takes up extra space and you'll find yourself moving around it, or, more accurately, running into it.


Head boards are fine. But as with everything, try to keep it light colored and not bulky; it's decorative, not necessary. You'll relish the extra 4 inches (10.2 cm) of space if you don't have one that's huge.

, Ever walked into a room that was messy and disorganized, cleaned it, and your mood automatically lightened? That goes double for a small room. Grab your little knickknacks that you don't actually use and put them away.


Get a bedskirt. There is so much space you can utilize under your bed. Buy some boxes or baskets and shove 'em under there -- it's easy access, too. If your closet is small, use it for your shoes. More room for your clothes!

Evaluate your space.,
Sketch out a design.,
Choose one item as a focal point.,
Arrange your items.,
Add final touches.",How to Decorate Small Spaces," What will you use it for? Does it have much light, or is it dark and cozy? Will you want to incorporate multiple uses in one area? Some furniture can do double-duty: Daybeds and couches may fold out to accommodate guests and coffee tables or end tables may include shelves for your books underneath.


How much space do you have? Measure the perimeter of the space and chart it on graph paper. This will help you visualize how to use the space efficiently.;
, You can either use a pencil directly on the drawing, or measure, transfer to graph paper and cut small outlines of the major items in your area - furniture, plants, storage areas, large rugs. You can then rearrange the shapes on the graph paper and tape them down when you think you like the design. If you are decorating one small corner of a larger room (like a reading nook or your half of a dorm room), decide whether you would like it to remain open to the larger space or whether you want to close it off.

, This is a small space, so too many large or brightly-colored items can be overwhelming and feel cluttered. If you have a cozy overstuffed armchair or a large poster that you want to include in your small space, use it as the ""center"" of your design. Consider the color and style of the object as you gather your smaller decorations.

, Take your paper plan and use it to rearrange or add items to the actual space. Ignore tiny decorations for now - just move the big stuff into position. Walk around in it, sit, or try the activity that the space will be used for. Is it comfortable? What is it missing?


Many small spaces lack storage. Does yours? If so, consider using furniture that doubles as a storage area. Ottomans may open to store cozy blankets; bookshelves can house shoe boxes, plastic containers or baskets.

, Use small splashes of color on larger neutral backgrounds - for example, coordinate a plain brown chair with a brightly patterned pillow, or use the color of your favorite throw in a small framed print or knick-knack on the bookshelf. Use clusters of both large and small objects as secondary focal points. A small amount of a bright color can draw you in and give the illusion of a much larger area.

Get pieces that multitask.,
Use your walls.,
Don't forget about the ceiling.,
Create a focal point.",How to Decorate a Small Room Which Has a Large Bed2," Each day you're running around doing two things at once, so your furniture should, too. You want pieces that are utilitarian and easy on the eyes.


When you are picking your end table(s), choose one that has drawers or multiple levels of shelving. There's no point in picking one that wastes the space underneath the legs of the stand. You'll be able to hide more clutter or display more things without taking up more space.
Choose an armoire that can double as an entertainment center or an entertainment center that can double as an armoire. You can hide your clothes away (if your closet is too small, especially) or hide your TV away, if you have one. Either way, avoid having these two large pieces of furniture to keep your room from being a maze to get into and out of.

, Thankfully, your room isn't just your floor -- you have walls too. How can you utilize them to your benefit? What ways can you take everything on the floor and move it up?


Don't waste space on lamps when you can install sconces. Have one on either side of an upright chair (linear chairs take up less space than their curved counterparts) to create a cozy reading nook.
One word: shelves. Your room can be utilized on all planes, so opt out of the tables and work with the space on the walls. It'll draw the eye up and off your large bed.

, In recent years, tray ceilings in bedrooms have become more popular. They add a fifth dimension to the room that is often overlooked. If you have the option of adding this into your bedroom, go ahead and see how much volume you will open up.


If you want to remain with a standard ceiling, consider using a lighter color to fool the eye into the illusion of space. The darker the ceiling, the more closed in the room will feel, and vice versa., The goal of your bedroom should be to draw away from its size. With a light primary color and a focal point (in any shade), this should be pretty easy to do.


If you have a fantastic piece of artwork, place it above the bed and draw the eye away from the rest of the room. If you aren’t too pleased with your bed but have an antique dresser that looks great, add a colorful vase to adorn the top. Use your imagination to accentuate the positive ambience about your room and remove emphasis from the small nature of your bedroom."

Decide on a colour theme.,
Tidy up!,
Go with what you've got.,
Shuffle your things around.,
Decorate!",How to Decorate Difficult Bedrooms," This may be a subtle theme or the entire base of your room. Most room decorating articles say this, but it is quite important, otherwise your room will look random and untidy. If your walls are non-paint-able you may wish to add a large, coloured pin-board to your room. If you're lucky, your room came with one of these, but they are relatively easy to make and a savior when it comes to colour themes.;
, You really should start over as new as possible. This means deciding what you don't need anymore, and what you can tidy away into your cupboard. Don't go too overboard though. You don't want to throw away things that you may want or need in the future. Create a storage space in your cupboard and hide away the things that don't suite your rooms desired look.

, Look over your room: the colour of the walls, ceiling and carpet, the window frames, the colour of the doors... everything matters. Usually most of the above are a white or creamy colour, which can be good or bad (you decide). Also look at the position of the windows in your room, and how much natural light is let in. This overview of your room will give you and idea of what extra furniture or decorations you will need.


If your room is small and doesn't get much light, consider it more of a ""night-time room"". If your room is airy and gets a lot of sun, it is most probably a ""day-time room"".
Some rooms are lucky enough to be both. Examples of this are rooms with slanting ceilings, skylights, or attic rooms. Although it may seem annoying, these rooms can look wonderful with the right decoration.

, Put all the small things in a pile outside your room (books, reading lamps, tissue boxes), leaving the big things (like beds, dressers or bookshelves) in your room. This way you will be able you move your furniture into the position you want it in freely. Once you have done this you will be able to bring in the necessities, like the lamp and the books for the shelf, leaving the decorations till last.

, Maybe you decided your room is a night-time room, so you got some fairy-lights. If it is a day-time room, you may have bought a couple of bean bags and made some tissue-paper fairy balls. Whatever it is, leave the decorating till last. If you don't you may later realize that that space is needed for something more important.

Deep clean everything.,
Add a fresh coat of paint.,
Hide unsightly items.,
Buy all new bath accessories.",How to Improve a Bathroom Without Remodeling1," You can often improve the look of your bathroom by simply cleaning it. Before you start making more significant overhauls, simply scrub, wipe, dust and polish everything in sight, from the grout in the floor tiles to the shower curtain liner. Chances are, your bathroom will look newer, brighter and more inviting when you’re finished.A thorough cleaning can be very restorative for bathroom surfaces, which tend to show grime and discoloration very obviously.
You should aim to clean and sanitize your bathroom at least once every couple of weeks.;
, Most bathrooms are finished in drab, sterile hues. Remedy this by adding a new shade to the walls. With just a couple hours work, a lifeless white washroom can be completely transformed with playful plum or rustic olive tones. Best of all, painting is something you can do as many times as you want, so you can continue to change the motif of your bathroom over the years.Painting the walls of your bathroom can create a day-and-night difference, even if you don’t change anything else.
You could also try repainting wooden floors, or treating them with a lacquer sealant to make them waterproof.

, It can be pretty unattractive to look around your bathroom and see it littered with toilet paper packages, dirty scrubbing brushes and bottles of cleaning supplies. Keep the kinds of things out of sight to highlight the comfort and serenity of the room. Use your available cabinet space or a separate supply closet to stash away items that make your intimate space look like a public restroom.Find unconventional means for storing bathroom necessities, such as a wicker basket for holding toilet paper or a multi-level fruit hanger for organizing shower supplies.Another creative (and easy) way to keep unattractive objects from intruding is to hang a sink skirt. This simple piece of fabric will cover exposed pipes and plumbing, along with anything else you tuck away under a mounted sink., Sometimes you just have to throw everything out and start over. Now is the perfect time to treat yourself to fresh bath towels, shower mats and curtains, soap dispensers or even a new toilet brush. Look for goods in different colors and styles than you’ve grown accustomed to in order to break up the monotony and get you excited about a peaceful escape to the powder room again.Updating little details is an inexpensive and immediate way to breathe new life into a tired bathroom.

Replace your fixtures.,
Put in a new shower head.,
Make use of racks, shelves and cabinets.,
Install a dimmer light switch.,
Put in new tile.",How to Improve a Bathroom Without Remodeling2," Do away with old hardware, like faucets, towel racks and sink and drawer handles. With time, these pieces can rust, stain or just become tedious, making them unpleasant to look at. Spend a little time and money picking out new eye-catching fixtures that more accurately reflect your evolving tastes and design ideas for your bathroom. You’d be surprised how much difference a new set of knobs or shower curtain rod can make.Though they’re small touches, your fixtures say a lot about the state of your bathroom. They tend to be in the areas that receive the most use, which means they’re one of the things people commonly notice.
Make sure you clean and polish your hardware regularly to keep it looking new.

, Chances are, you’re still using the original shower head your bathroom came outfitted with. While this is more equipment than decoration, investing in a new shower head can do wonders for both your physical comfort and the look of your shower area. Consider which practical features you like, then shop around for different sizes and stylish designs and finishes.You can readily find inexpensive shower heads in elegant finishes like brass or graphite, while more expensive shower heads will also allow you to control the flow and pressure of the stream.

, Forget about stowing everything away under the sink. Mount an extra rack or shelf, or make room for a small, open cabinet and use this to organize your bath items. With more storage space, you’ll not only be able to change the appearance of your bathroom, but also eliminate the kind of clutter that has a tendency to accumulate in the areas where you spend the most time getting ready.Hang a standard kitchen spice rack and use it to store hand soaps, deodorant, shaving supplies and other items.Stow away toiletries you don’t want out in the open in an old repainted nightstand., One simple trick that can make your bathroom more cozy is to soften the lighting. By swapping your standard light switch for a dimmer, you can fine-tune the brightness of the room, cranking it up when you’re shaving or doing your makeup and lowering it to a soft glow when you want to treat yourself to a spa-like experience. Custom lighting can lend a bit of class and tranquility to an otherwise unremarkable room.Lower light is perfect for taking a relaxing bubble bath, or for those times when you get up to use the restroom in the middle of the night and don’t want bright light shining right in your eyes.
A good contractor can install a dimmer switch in just a few minutes, or you can look up instructions for how to do it yourself here.

, Ceramic tile is a relatively inexpensive way to refresh the appearance of your bathroom, and, since it covers so much surface area, makes a big impact on the room's appearance without the need to knock out a wall or have the plumbing redone. Natural stoneware or bright, colorful tiles can be used to cover up time-worn walls and floors, giving your lavatory the dressing up it desperately needs. While installing new tile is a bigger project than simply buying a new set of towels, it can usually be done in a single weekend, and allows you to fully customize the final outcome.Provided you have the right budget to work with, you can install new tile yourself for only a few hundred dollars worth of tools and materials. This could save you thousands of dollars in contractor's fees.Compare tiles in different shades, patterns and configurations to find the perfect match for your redesigned bathroom.

"
"
Get color coordinated.,
Include some artwork.,
Add a little flora.,
Give the room a theme.",How to Improve a Bathroom Without Remodeling3," Even if you don’t lay down new tile or paint over your monochromatic walls, you can liven the place up a bit by simply introducing new color schemes. Keep things quaint and homey with bright pastels and elegant designs, or create an “executive suite” feel by doing your towels, mats, curtains and other accents in black and gold. Bath accessories come in a huge range of colors and patterns, so don’t be afraid to get creative when it comes to mixing and matching.Buy multiple sets of towels and other items and swap them out periodically to keep things looking and feeling fresh.
Different bath accessories can be used to alternately complement or provide a pleasant contrast to the color and lighting of the bathroom.

, It may be that your bathroom is just missing something. A few pieces of well-displayed artwork can really help tie together the furnishings of the room and make it feel more full. Keep an eye out for tasteful photographs, traditional paintings or zany modern works that you think might make your washroom more visually interesting. A single captivating piece can be the difference between empty and engaging.When shopping around for bathroom art, consider your own personality and go with something that reflects your own style and interests.

, Flowers aren’t just for your kitchen table. Try placing an arrangement of chrysanthemums on the counter alongside your sink, or work a fern or a few stalks of bamboo into a vacant corner or a nook opposite the shower. The natural appeal of plants can pleasantly offset a bathroom full of hard, flat materials like porcelain, tile and metal.Orchids make great flowers to keep in your bathroom because they develop beautiful, vibrant coloring and tolerate heat and moisture well.

, Devise a theme for you bathroom and hand pick your decorations accordingly. Why settle for a plain white-on-white when you could perform your daily hygiene in a hunter’s lodge or Victorian garden aesthetic? By choosing complimentary fixtures, accessories and ornamentations, you can distinguish your bathroom and give it even more personality than other rooms in the house.For example, you could deck out a half bath with a beach or nautical theme, complete with seafoam and coral tones, jars of sand and seashells and a framed watercolor painting of a schooner. You might also do a bathroom in a “farmhouse” style, with unfinished wood racks and cabinets and a repurposed old-fashioned toolbox to hold your soaps and shampoos.If you have multiple bathrooms in your home, decorate them all in different visual themes.

If you don't like the appearance of clutter underneath your bed, use a bed skirt or dust ruffle to conceal the space.


You may also want to consider choosing a bed frame with built-in storage. Lots of furniture companies make bed frames that double as dressers, with built-in drawers on each side.





;
, In a small bedroom, it's important to find every opportunity for storage---including the walls. Shelves and cabinets create extra storage space while also serving an aesthetic purpose.


You might want to consider building a wall of cabinets right behind your bed, letting them double as a ""headboard.""






Hang coat hooks on the walls for jackets, purses, and keys.







, If your small bedroom doesn't have a closet, then invest in a clothing rack. That way, you won't have to buy a bulky, oversized dresser to fit all of your belongings.

, This is a great trick to create more storage while also providing extra seating space. Place the ottoman against one of the walls or at the foot of your bed; whichever works best.

, Though your natural instinct might be to stick with white to make the room seem larger, adding some color here and there will add dimension to the room and, as a result, make it seem bigger.


The key is to find a balance between having too much color and not enough. For example, offset white walls and a white bedspread with colorful throw pillows and curtains.






Don't be afraid to mix and match colors. Sticking to only one or two colors will make a small room look drab.







, In order to avoid having a room that looks too ""busy,"" add one or two pieces that really stand out and draw the eye's attention. This piece can be a colored headboard, an accent wall, a painting, or curtains.


If you decide to paint an accent wall, we recommend doing it directly behind your bed. That way it will double as a headboard (or serve to frame an existing headboard) and create harmony.







, The key is to look for unique items that will add character and dimension to your room. Try adding a ruffled bedspread, textured throw pillows, a patterned rug, or woven wood items.

, If your room has a window in it, there are certain things you can do to enhance the light coming in. One trick is to hang a mirror on the wall opposite the window; the reflection will double the amount of light coming in. You can also add small decorative mirrors in whatever shapes and patterns you choose. These add some decorative flair and bounce light around the room, acting like windows to make the room seem more open and bright.


Avoid using heavy curtains or shades. Roman curtains block out some light even when they are open. Try using a sheer curtain instead.






Trim any hedges or branches right outside of your bedroom that may be blocking sunlight.







, If your room doesn't have windows, or if natural lighting isn't enough, then add extra light where you can. Try installing track lights, a chandelier, or extra lamps to brighten up the room.

, While a large bed is certainly luxurious, you don't want it to take up the entirety of your living space. Instead of a king sized bed, for example, try a queen or a full. You'll definitely be thankful for the extra space.


If there are two people living in the bedroom, consider buying a bunk bed.







, With such limited space, it's important to only bring what you really need into your bedroom. If possible, store items you don't use daily in a hallway closet or in the garage. These include camping gear, skis, musical instruments, bikes, suitcases, and so on.

You can get one with a large mirror on the front. This can reflect light and make your room appear larger.

, If you don't have a closet, you'll need an organized space to hold your clothes. Purchase a dresser that will hold all of the clothes you'll need for the season. If you need to, you could store unseasonable clothing in storage in another room.


Test the dresser drawers before you buy the dresser. Ensure that they open easily and close completely.

, Consider swapping out your bedside table for a nightstand that has storage. You can easily find nightstands that include storage compartments and small drawers. Many even have charging spaces for your technological devices.If you don't have enough space for a nightstand, install small storage cubes vertically, so you can make the most of the space.

Install floating shelves.,
Prop a ladder against the wall for shelving.,
Build shelving around your headboard.,
Place shelving units below the windows.",How to Create Extra Storage in a Bedroom2," If you don't have a lot of floor space for storage furniture, you can easily install floating shelves on your walls. Decide what you'd like to hang, so you can purchase shelving that makes sense for the items. For example, if you want to store shoes, you can install long strips of shelving that you can hang the shoes from.If you don't have space for a bedside table, consider installing two floating cabinet shelves on top of each other. You can install them in the corner next to your bed, so you have somewhere to put your things. For example, you could use floating bedside storage for a small lamp, a clock, your cell phone, and a pair of glasses.

, Purchase a decorative ladder that you can lean against one of your bedroom walls. Storage ladders usually have wide steps and are only half of a ladder, so they must be put up against a wall. You can store clothing, blankets, books, plants, or accessories on the ladder.


You can find sleek, minimal storage ladders or rustic wooden ladders. Try to find one that matches the look of your bedroom.
Look for decorative ladders at home improvement stores, home goods stores, or online.

, You can easily create storage space on the wall near your headboard. Purchase small shelving cabinets and install them around your headboard. This is a great way to get storage, especially if you don't have room for a nightstand.Consider installing shelving along the perimeter of your room. Install the shelving on the walls about 12 inches (30.5 cm) below the ceiling.

, Measure your windows and purchase shelving that will fit directly below them. If you have small windows, you may be able to fit a large cabinet or dresser below the window. If you have large windows, you may only be able to fit short storage cubes. Try not to block the windows, so your room can still get natural light.


Look for storage benches that you could fit under the window. This will give you somewhere to sit and a place to store things.

Organize your closet effectively.,
Use the space behind your doors.,
Store things under your bed.,
Hang your accessories on the wall.",How to Create Extra Storage in a Bedroom3," If you're only hanging things in your closet, you could probably be using the space better.

If you don't have much hanging space in your closet, consider placing an open clothes rack in the bedroom itself.

, You may have a mirror hanging behind your bedroom door. If you don't (or it's a small mirror), install small racks or pegs, so you can hang things behind the door. For example, hang pegs so you can store your laundry hamper or jackets.


Don't forget to use your closet doors for storage too. This works best if your closet doors open out, rather than slide across.

, You can purchase long, short storage boxes or clear bins to put underneath your bed. This is a great way to store things that you don't need to access on a daily basis. Consider storing unseasonable clothing or outerwear under your bed in zippered storage boxes or canvas storage bags.You can even buy beds that have built-in shelving below them. These are sometimes sold as captain's beds which are raised up on storage platforms.

, Instead of storing your small accessories in boxes that are difficult to get to, place them in plain sight. Frame pegboard or cork board and hang it on the wall. You can arrange and display jewelry, ties, scarves, or cuff links from the pegboard or cork board.Consider painting the frame to match the colors in your room.
You can hang several of these in different sizes throughout your bedroom.

Paint your room a plain colour. Try to go for a neutral colour that looks good with everything, like beige, cream, white, etc. This will make your room look less crazy.






Paint a world travel mural! This is very complicated, but if done right will make your room one to remember! Pick some of your favourite places in the world and hire a painter to paint them on your wall for you. Try to meld the scenes together, or have one wall devoted to one certain place, such as having one wall as a New York skyline, one wall as a Paris scene, one wall with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and another wall with the Sydney Opera house.





;
, Incorporate some Asian flair in your room by putting in some lanterns. Add some other lights too. These don't necessarily have to reflect your world travel theme.

, Buy some world travel-related cushions, such as Union Jack cushions. These would be relatively easy to find. Another easy thing to find would be Paris cushions with images such as Notre Dame and the Eiffel Tower on them.

, You could also buy a regular chair and throw a world travel-themed toss pillow on it.

, This will really tie the whole theme together, as well as provide a great storage space.

, Calendars are a great thing to have in your world travel themed bedroom, because it's easy to find New York calendars, Greek calendars, or calendars with pictures of different places in the world.

, If you want, personalize it by indicating all the places in the world that you've been (or would like to go) to.

Fill in the empty spaces with small items.,
Mix and match useful and decorative items.,
Add some variety with different colors and textures.",How to Decorate a Tiered Tray2," If you are decorating it for the holidays, keep the actual holiday in mind. Try a mini tree for Christmas, a heart-shaped topiary for Valentine's Day, and a bunny for Easter.The taller, thinner the item, the better. They will help keep the eye traveling upwards.
Flowers, figurines, and candles all make great top tier choices.

, Little collectibles, souvenirs, and knickknacks make great fillers, especially if you have a few large items on your tiers already.Don't get too carried away, however; if you only display small items, your tiers will look too busy and messy.

, If you are filling your tray with items that you use often, consider adding in some decorative items as well. Great choices include little figurines and bud vases.Try a glass with a sprig of your favorite herb in it. Then it becomes both decorative and functional!

, When filling your tray, it is easy to fall into a pattern and place like items with like. While there is nothing wrong with organization, too many blue or metal items on one tier can look a little boring. If you have too many items of the same color (or material) on one shelf, switch them around. This will help lead they eye around.


This same rule applies to size: play around with placing large and small items next to each other.

Clean the tray.,
Decide how you want the tray to look.,

Stain an unpainted wooden tray.,
Give an old tray a fresh look with a coat of paint.,
Add some design with stencils.,
Give decoupage a try.,
Add a trim.",How to Decorate a Tiered Tray3," Before you paint the tray, or add any embellishments, you need to clean it. Start by wiping the tray down with a damp cloth. Dry it off with a towel, then wipe it down with some rubbing alcohol. This will help remove any oils that might prevent paint/glue from sticking.

, You don't have to do all of the steps listed in this method; some of them may not even work for the type of tray you have. Figure out what sort of look you are going for first, then choose one or two of the ideas listed below.

, Use some coarse-grit sandpaper (suck as P80 grit) to lightly buff the surface of the tray. This will dull down the paint and reveal some of the wood underneath. Keep buffing until you get the look you want.If your tray isn't painted, paint it first using matte wood or latex paint.Consider adding some wood stain after sanding your tray. Be sure to seal it in afterwards!, You can use store-bought wood stain or make your own using vinegar, coffee, and steel wool. This is a great alternative to using paint that allows the wood's natural texture to shine through. It is great if you want a natural-looking finish.


Most stains need to be sealed. Choose a matte sealer for a more rustic look, and a glossy one for a fancier one.

, You can use regular paint or spray paint. Let the paint dry, then add another coat or two, if needed. Be sure to let each coat of paint dry completely before adding a new one.


It would be a good idea to seal the paint in afterwards with an acrylic sealer.

, If your tray is already the color you want, but is still looking a little dull, consider painting some designs using stencils. Place the stencil where you want it to go, then secure it with painter's tape. Apply paint over it using a foam brush. Peel the stencil off, then let the paint dry.

, Cut some scrapbooking paper down to fit the shelves on your tray. Apply a coat of decoupage to the shelves, then press the paper down onto it. Smooth out any air bubbles, then let it dry 15 to 20 minutes. Apply another coat of decoupage and let it dry.Cut down some more scrapbooking into individual designs and add it on top for a more interesting look.

, If your trays have thick sides, consider adding some trim. Great ideas include rhinestones, ribbon, lace, etc. Use hot glue to apply the trims, then pull away any threads left by the glue. Make sure that the trims match the tray's style and your room décor.

, Don’t leave out the ceiling when you paint all four walls of your room. This will add extra color and richness to the overall look.


If possible, you can even create patterns with stencils or by freehand on the ceiling, reminiscent of the beautifully decorated ceilings of the East.

Try a pattern, a complementary color, or a contrasting color.


Choose as your accent wall the one that has any interesting architectural details, other built-in focal points, or the most light.Try using a stencil to create a Moroccan-inspired pattern on your accent wall. Remember to paint the entire wall whatever color you want to show in the negative spaces of the stencil pattern, be it a white or neutral, or another warm complementary hue., Affix pre-made stencils to an accent wall or ceiling to create a Moroccan pattern. Carefully tape a stencil to one portion of the surface, paint, then move it to the next portion to keep the pattern consistent.


Try out a common pattern found in Moroccan art and textiles, such as the eight-pointed star, octagon, and other repeated geometrical patterns.You can also create your own stencil by taping shapes onto a wall with painter’s tape. With both this and pre-made stencils, you should always let paint dry completely before moving a stencil or removing tape.

Go for a high-gloss lacquer for a very polished look for your room, or stick to a rougher matte or even aged quality for more of a casual “shabby-chic” style.

, Choose furniture with carved wood designs, inlays, or other details if you can. Find these qualities on older furniture from vintage or antique stores.


Watch for any furniture with arched or scalloped details, a popular design in Moroccan architecture and furniture.
You can even affix carved wood pieces to a piece of furniture like a headboard or chest of drawers for an easy update to a plain piece of wood furniture.

, Use a large bed as the focal point of a Moroccan bedroom. Create an exotic oasis feeling for the room where you sleep.


Try a four-poster bed with a canopy for a dreamy touch. You can also get a canopy that hangs from the ceiling to drape over the bed.Find or make a headboard for the bed that will become a statement piece for the room. Look for ornate wood carvings or inlay details, or simulate a headboard simply by hanging a rich tapestry or rug on the wall at the head of the bed., Add a couple of tables or a chair in a similar style as your bed frame to complete the room. Keep furniture minimal and low to the ground.


Easily match your bed frame by staining a wood table or chair with a similar shade of stain.
Update an old table that doesn’t match your theme by repainting it in a new color or pattern.If possible, building in a window seat or just using a low bench thoughtfully can add to the soft and comfortable low-to-the-ground seating in the room.

Opt for cotton when possible.,
Try vinyl for a low maintenance option.,
Go for an organic option.,
Think about microfiber curtains.,
Select a solid liner material.",How to Choose the Right Shower Curtain for Your Bathroom1," While it's more expensive, cotton is generally a solid choice for a shower curtain. Cotton curtains tend to hold up best and are also easiest to wash. They can also give your bathroom a dressier feel.Cotton absorbs moisture easily. If you get a cotton curtain, make sure you get a quality liner to go with it.;
, If you don't want to spend a lot of time maintaining a shower curtain, vinyl curtains can be a great option. They can be cleaned and come in a variety of colors, making coordinating them with other bathroom decor simple.In addition to vinyl, you can try synthetic materials such as nylon or polyester.

, If you're environmentally conscious, you may want a curtain that reflects these values. Look for curtains made of environmentally friendly materials, such as hemp, if you want a curtain that minimizes use of chemicals and artificial materials.Keep in mind, organic curtains may be more expensive and more difficult to maintain.

, Microfiber curtains are more moisture-resistant than cotton curtains but softer than things like vinyl and polyester. Such curtains are heavier, so they may work well if your bathroom has heavy water pressure. They are also machine washable, which can cut down on cleaning time., Almost all shower curtains will require some kind of curtain liner. Take this into consideration as well. You want to choose a solid liner that will protect your curtains from moisture.Go for curtains that are clear or light. These allow more light in the shower.
Most liners are made out of vinyl. If you're environmentally conscious, it may be difficult to find an alternative. However, if it's important to you, try to seek out non-vinyl liners in a store or online, but keep in mind they will be harder to maintain.
Weighted liners work best, as these stay in place more easily.

Consider decorative curtains.,
Select a solid color for a minimalistic look.,
Keep colors consistent throughout your bathroom.,
Take bathroom hardware into account.",How to Choose the Right Shower Curtain for Your Bathroom2," If you want a very decorative bathroom, consider decorative curtains. These curtains usually have a pattern or texture that makes them spruce up a room and are made out of higher quality fabrics. These are usually a good choice for a guest room. Also, as such curtains are more susceptible to damage from moisture, they may work best if you use your bath more than your shower.Decorative curtains are more expensive and difficult to maintain. Therefore, you should only opt for them if you're looking to make a room really stand out for whatever reason. They are not the most practical choice.

, If your bathroom has a more minimalistic design, or if you're going for practicality over decoration, see if you can find a solid color shower curtain. A plain shower curtain that's simply a shade of, say, blue would go great in a bathroom with blue tiles. For simplicity's sake, a solid color curtain will work in most bathrooms when it falls into line with the existing color scheme., You want to make sure your shower curtain does not clash with the existing color scheme. If your bathroom is colored in neutral shades, like whites, you can try adding a splash of color with a brighter curtain. However, if your bathroom already has a strict color scheme, try to choose a curtain to match.For example, say your bathroom has yellow tiles and a yellow sink. Try to pick a curtain in a similar shade, like a yellow polkadot curtain, or a color that pairs well with yellow. A blue curtain, for example, may look nice in a yellow bathroom.

, Your curtain should not just match the colors in your bathroom. Think about things like light fixtures and mirrors in your bathroom. Most hardware in a bathroom is somewhat subtle. However, if you have very large mirrors or very ornate light fixtures, you may want to opt for a plainer curtain. This will prevent the curtain's design from being overwhelming."

Try a hookless curtain.,
Think about weights and magnets.,
Opt for an extra wide curtain if necessary.",How to Choose the Right Shower Curtain for Your Bathroom3," A hookless curtain is slipped over a ceiling shower rod. If you have a more modern style, a hookless curtain can reflect this. They provide a more seamless look and can cut down on cost as you do not have to invest money in shower rings., If your water pressure is very heavy, this can cause the shower curtain to fly away from the bathroom during a shower. To reverse this, consider investing in magnets or weights to hold the curtain down. You can find many weighted shower curtains to suit your needs in a department store or online., If you have a very large shower, you may need an extra wide curtain. This can cost a bit more money but will be worth it as it will more adequately protect your bathroom floor from moisture.Measure your shower before going out to purchase a shower curtain. This will help you determine whether you need an extra large curtain.

Choose white towels.,
Choose colored towels.,
Look for fun patterns.,
Mix patterns within your towels.,
Embrace floral towels.",How to Choose Bathroom Towel Colors1," If you are someone who likes the look of clean lines, white towels may be for you. White towels call to mind the look and feel of a hotel or spa bathroom, and they’ll go perfectly with any bathroom or preexisting décor.Light colored towels last longer and do not fade as obviously as darker colored towels do.
If your bathroom is already neutral, avoid white towels.;
, If your bathroom is currently neutral, colored towels are the easiest way to add visual interest. And because there are so many shades available, you don't have to tie yourself down to just one color.Create an ombre effect with your bathroom towels by buying different sized towels in various shades of the same color. Buy your largest towels in the darkest shade and lighten the shade as the size of your towels decrease.
If your bathroom is already brightly colored, gravitate towards more neutral towel colors.

, Patterned towels show a great deal of color interest and are a great way to tie the different shades of your bathroom together. Look for tones that already exist in your bathroom and try to find a towel that infuses those color tones into the towel’s pattern.If you have a tile floor, look to mirror the tile’s color in your patterned towels.
If you already have a heavily patterned shower curtain, steer away from using additional patterns in your towels.

, Layering patterns within your towels is a cool and easy way to make your towel display look more textured. Start off with a basic white bath towel with a colored accent, like stripes. Add an accent hand towel and top the whole thing off with a monogrammed washcloth.Monograms are an easy and classy way to lend some sophistication to a bathroom.
The more high quality your towels are, the more impressive your pattern mixing will look.
Mix polka dots with stripes for a preppy vibe.
Alternate chevron with stripes for a more modern look.

, Floral towels aren’t just for your grandmother’s bathroom; they’re also a great way to infuse your bathroom with a country-chic style. Set floral towels against solid towels to give your bathroom a vintage throwback feel.Do not mix floral patterns, as this will prove visually overwhelming.
Buy floral hand towels and set them against larger bathroom linens in a pale pink or ivory tone.

Clean out all clutter, distractions, and signs of work or chores.,
Make the bed.,
Scent your room for romance.,
Set the temperature and lighting.",How to Create a Romantically Decorated Room1," Before actively adding romantic decoration, you need to take away things that detract from the romance of the room. The best way to do this is to clean up the room and remove things that get in the way of romance. Stand in the room and look around at what is present. Let your eye linger on things that seem overly business-like or seem to represent work and responsibility. And consider moving those things to another room of the house.Remove things that are work related, such as a computer or printer, or are household chores, such as piles of clean or dirty laundry. These types of things will remind you of responsibilities and will take away from the romance of the room. Keep work out of the bedroom and get in the practice of finishing chores that must be done there rather than leaving them sit.
Get rid of excess stuff in your room. You most likely have things in your room that you don’t need anyway, so for the sake of romance, actively search the room and get rid of anything that you don’t use or need. Look for piles of papers, receipts, bills and put them in a box. Fill a trash bag with anything you don’t mind parting with and take it to a thrift store.;
, This may not seem romantic when you first think about it, but consider it a moment more. A nicely made bed looks fresh and inviting. It looks like it is calling you to lay down and pose in a romantic way. A messy bed looks like someone else has already been laying down, or rolling around in it.


If you want to maintain the romance day to day, get in the habit of always making the bed. If you want to enhance the romance for one night, then you only to need to make it on those occasions.
This could apply really well if you are wanting to create a romantic look for a night in a hotel room. Consider taking your own bedding to replace the standard, starchy hotel linens and comforter. Using your own soft sheets and more attractive bed spread will enhance the hotel room and give it a feel of home.

, Two main ways to do this are to scent the room itself and scent the pillows and sheets. To scent the room for a special night, or maintain this consistently, candles, incense, or scented plugins are all good options. Scent the pillows and sheets with the woman’s perfume to remind the man of his love for her.


There is not necessarily one scent that is automatically romantic, so you may need to experiment and see what scent works for you. Sandalwood and patchouli are both recommended as romantic scents. Vanilla is also usually considered relaxing and romantic. You may want to go with a woody evergreen that reminds you of a cabin in the mountains, or a beachy scent that transports you to a warm hideaway. The romance is in the scent that calms you and fits your relationship’s personality.
If you are planning for one specific romantic night, make sure you experiment with scent ahead of time to make sure both people enjoy it. A smell that one person doesn’t like will instantly ruin any potential romance, no matter how great the rest of the room is.
For a hotel room, or a room in your house that's larger than the bedroom, make sure you give the candles or incense plenty of time to burn and fill the whole room. The larger the room, the longer the smell will take to really cover the room.
If you are setting up a room besides the bedroom, like a living room, you can still scent the couch or seating. You may even want to spray a basic fabric freshener first to remove any lingering odors before adding a new scent.
When planning romance for a specific night, not just in general, consider if you want to leave the candles or incense burning when the night starts or only have them burn long enough to scent the room properly.

, This may be a step for occasional romance, rather than an all the time decorative option, but both the room temperature and the lighting are important. You want the room to be just the right amount of warm, but not enough to make you sweat. And changing the lighting from the usual can enhance the romance.Set the thermostat between 68 and 75 degrees, depending on the outside temperature. You certainly don’t want to be cold in the bedroom, but too much heat will be uncomfortable too.
For lighting, try changing out your regular light bulbs for ones that are a light, rosy pink, at least in bedside lamps if it’s an option. This shade of lighting sets the perfect mood and tends to make people look better. Also, 60 watt or less is best for bedroom lighting. You don’t want it to be too bright.
Consider what room of the house you are decorating and whether you intend for the changes to last or if they are for a specific moment. You could always move a lamp into a room if ceiling lights are currently the only option. This way, you can easily move the lamp after a specific romantic occasion.

Buy shower rings.",How to Buy a Shower Curtain," Measure your shower to determine the size of liner and shower curtain you will need. You will want your liner to fit in your shower for appearance and so it does its job of preventing water from escaping into your bathroom. Most liners for a standard size shower are 70 inches by 72 inches.


There are extra long liners that are 70 inches by 84 inches or 72 inches by 84 inches.
You can purchase an extra wide liner that is 144 inches by 72 inches.
If you have a stall shower, instead of a traditional bathtub size shower, there are shower stall liners that are 54 inches by 78 inches.;
, Most liners are vinyl, but you can also purchase liners in fabric (such as nylon or polyester). Some people think that vinyl liners look cheaper than fabric ones, but vinyl liners stick to the sides of the tub to help prevent water from spilling on the floor. Vinyl liners are also easier to clean because you can just wipe them down with a sponge or cloth.


Fabric liners tend to be machine wash only and blow away from the tub, which can cause water to spill. However, fabric liners are more durable and last longer than vinyl liners. , You can purchase liners that have magnets that weigh down the liner to help it stay in place. You can also purchase liners that have suction cups on the bottom to help it stick to your tub and not blow away., If your liner has grommets along the top, it is less likely to rip. Grommets reinforce the top of liner where the holes for the rings are. If your liner might face a lot of wear and tear (particularly in children’s bathrooms), you might want to opt for grommets., You can get a liner that is resistant to bacteria and mildew. The packaging on the liner will specify if it prevents bacteria and mildew. This is especially important if you live in a humid environment or don’t have good ventilation in your bathroom., You can get liners in many colors, not just clear or white, to match your shower curtain. You can also use a liner alone, and have no shower curtain to keep things simple.For simplicity, choose a white or clear liner.
You could also choose a solid color liner that coordinates with the pattern on your shower curtain.

, You should measure the size of your shower to see what curtain you should buy. When it comes to choosing a curtain size you have options depending on how you want the curtain to look. You can get a floor length curtain or have your curtain just touch the top of the bathtub. A standard shower curtain is 72 inches by 72 inches.


You can purchase stall curtains that are 54 inches by 78 inches.
Extra long curtains are 72 inches by 84 inches or 96 inches.
Extra wide curtains are 108 inches by 72 inches., You can get a fabric shower curtain in polyester, cotton, or a blend. They are usually machine washable but some are dry-clean only.Cotton shower curtains are easy to maintain, but need to be used with a liner. Vinyl shower curtains repel moisture and do not necessarily need a liner with them.


You can opt for fabric curtains in microfiber because they are soft and water resistant., You can get a curtain in many colors and patterns, from color blocking to holographic designs. Think about the overall appearance of your bathroom and try to coordinate your shower curtain. You can make your shower curtain the focus of your bathroom or just a subtle detail.For example, if your bathroom has a tropical theme, you might want to get a shower curtain that has an image of palm trees and the ocean.

, Instead of having one curtain for your shower, you can have two. Put one shower curtain on each side of the shower to frame your shower like a window.


You can cut a shower curtain in half then hem the edges and put them on each side of one rod if you want the curtains to open down the middle.
If you are using a liner, cut and hem the liner as well., Make sure to buy shower rings for your curtain and liner. You can get basic rings or more decorative ones. Have your shower rings match the decor of your bathroom and curtain.


You can buy a hookless shower curtain that does not need rings for a ceiling-track curtain rod."

Integrate your bathroom's current color.,
Be conscious of the size of your bathroom.,
Consider your location.,
Look online for inspiration.",How to Choose Bathroom Towel Colors2," If your bathroom is already painted or tiled, there are certain bath towel colors that will automatically work with your current color scheme. If your bathroom is painted gray, try adding canary yellow bath towels.If your bathroom is black and white, add pink towels for a feminine flair.
If your bathroom is purple, add towels in a chocolate brown color to bring some warmth to the room.

, Small bathrooms can easily look cramped and your colored bath towels can make a small bathroom look even smaller. If you have a small bathroom, stick with neutral shades for your towels; they’ll make your bathroom appear bigger and more open.Choose dark and bold colors for larger bathrooms. They’ll make your bathroom feel more intimate.
If you have a smaller bathroom, you may need smaller towels. Bath sheets (oversized bath towels) typically won’t fit on the hooks in small bathrooms, so buy bath towels instead.

, If you’re decorating a beach house bathroom, look for towels with a palm tree or seashell pattern. If you’re decorating a bathroom with Spanish tile, use lots of earth and jewel tones. Use your towels to support the design that already exists within the house.If you’re unsure whether a pattern will go with your already existing décor, it’s better to be too subtle than too bold.
Make sure to save receipts for all towel purchases, in case you don’t like the way your towels look in the space.

, The Internet is the perfect place to look for bathroom decorating ideas. Check out Pinterest for inspirational bathroom looks, or look on store websites to see which towels they recommend pairing together.


Remember, your towels should complement the bathroom you already have. Don’t buy towels just because they looked good in someone else’s bathroom; they will not look the same in yours.
Design sites like Apartment Therapy and Houzz are also good resources for finding inspiration and sharing your work with others.

"
"
Cover all your towel bases.,
Choose a bathmat.,
Skip toilet linens.",How to Choose Bathroom Towel Colors3," If you’re upgrading your towels, make sure you buy a wide variety of sizes. Every bathroom should be equipped with bath towels, hand towels and face cloths, at the bare minimum.Bath towels are generally 27”x52” (69 x 132cm) and are preferred for wiping down after showers.
Bath sheets are 35”x60” (89 x 152cm) and are ideal for people who prefer a bit more towel coverage after a shower.
Hand towels are 16”x30” (41 x 76cm) and are everyday towels for wiping hands.
Face or wash cloths are 13”x13” (33 x 33cm) and are ideal for spot cleaning, in and out of the shower.
If you’re feeling extra ambitious, add bath sheets and finger towels to your shopping list.
Buy at least four of each size towel. You’ll want to have extras in case your towels are in the wash, or for when you have guests visiting.

, Bathmats are necessary for protecting your floors from shower moisture, but they can also be another source of color. Your bathmat should compliment your towel choices, but not replicate them exactly.If you are using patterned towels, buy a bathmat in one of your towel’s color tones.
Do not select a bathmat that is not washable. There are some beautiful non-washable bathmats out there, but they’re not practical for most bathrooms. Only purchase a non-washable bathmat if you don’t expect anyone to actually use the bath or shower in that particular bathroom.

, Top, seat covers and rug bases used to be very popular bathroom accessories, but they’re not terribly hygienic. Bathroom linens like these trap moisture, dust and bacteria and are therefore not recommended for use in your bathroom.Add some color around your toilet by adding some greenery in the form of a potted plant or succulent.
If you’d like to add additional color by your toilet, hang some fun art across from the toilet (but not so high that your guests will have to break their necks to look at it).

Change your room’s layout.,
Install recessed lighting.,
Invest in a new bed.",How to Create a Romantically Decorated Room2," One thing that can dampen romance is the boredom of routine. This can apply to your bedroom if you have had the same setup for a long time. Try moving the bed to a different wall, facing a new direction in the room. Move dressers, chairs or any other furniture to new places as well. Giving the room a completely new look will make it feel almost like you are staying in a romantic getaway rather than your same old room.You may want to draw out potential room layouts before you start moving things to ensure that the setup you hope for is achievable. Maybe your options are limited but drawing it out can help you figure out what could be moved.
If moving the entire bed is not an option, especially if space is limited, considering moving the rest of the room around so at least the arrangement is new.
If you are working in a living room, you can move the couch to a new location, or maybe move two chairs close together so you can easily sit and talk. Don’t have them facing each other head on, but don’t have them completely beside each other either. Angle them toward each other while giving those sitting there the option to look slightly away, too.

, If significant remodeling in the bedroom is an option, putting recessed lights in the wall is great for establishing a better mood. Overhead lights tend to be unflattering, so moving away from those for the bedroom is smart. You will most likely not be able to do this on your own, unless you have specific electrical training, so consider the cost of a contractor and whether it fits your budget.


This is also a good time to evaluate the light bulbs you are using. Even if you can’t install new lights, you can change bulbs. Go for bulbs with a soft white/or warm white light and use 60 watt or lower so best brightness.
Overall, it is good to assess how your room is lit and what ways you can change it. Remodeling and adding new fixed lighting may not work, but consider adding a couple lamps if your room doesn’t already have them. For day to day routines, you can still use overhead lighting, but for times when you want to increase the romance, stick to low lit lamps.
Dimmer switches are a great addition to any room because they give you the option of having full light for regular daily activities and lower mood lighting for specific romantic occasions.

, This is obviously an expensive and long term option, but since the bed is the centerpiece of the room and the primary location for romance, it can really affect the mood of the room. The bed should ultimately be comfortable, but how it looks is important becuase you will see if before you feel it. Old or broken down looking beds detract from the romance of the room.A large, wooden, 4 poster bed will give the room a classically romantic look. You can add a canvas canopy which softens the look and feel of the room, as well. Hang drapes down each of the posts to enhance the look.
Maybe you can’t buy an entirely new bed but you can buy a new mattress. A comfier more inviting mattress will increase the romance of the room. Even if you can’t buy a mattress, considering buying a down-filled mattress cover which adds a layer of softness to the bed.
Lastly, if none of these purchases are within your budget, consider buying new sheets or a bedskirt. Higher thread count sheets are softer. You could buy some red silk sheets for special occasions. Again, the specific color of the sheets is mostly personal preference, but light reds and pinks are often considered the most romantic.
For rooms besides the bedroom, considering investing in other new furniture. Your mom’s old sofa that sat in the basement for two years is probably not the most romantic piece for you living room. The poker table that doubles as a dining room table may not set the mood you hope for. If it is within your budget, new furniture can be a great way to make a room more romantic.

Hang reminders of romantic memories.,
Create some art pieces.,
Make your own candle holder.,
Hand paint a mural of a love letter.",How to Create a Romantically Decorated Room3," A great way to add romance to a room is to decorate with reminders of your love and what you have shared. Hang up a small cork board and pin pictures from the best times you have had together. Use memorabilia like event tickets, wedding decorations, or gifts you have given each other. By making the room all about your relationship and the life you have built, you’ll add romance that goes beyond individual decorations.Have both people make a collage of their favorites pictures of the other person and hang in the room.
Make a collage of pictures of you together, especially on specific romantic occasions like high school dances, engagement, wedding photos, first date, weekend trips. The proper hint of nostalgia for good times can add romance to the room.
An option for applying this romantic touch throughout multiple rooms could be having a theme for each room such as first experiences (like vacations or activities), a hobby you both enjoy (like movie posters or band memorabilia), or specific occasions where you were dressed fancy (high school dances, weddings, parties).
You can also use this technique, maybe to a lesser extent, with a hotel room. By adding personalized touches like pictures, you can take the room to a new level beyond its impersonal basic setup.

, Depending on your level of artist talent, draw or paint something that specifically pertains to your relationship. It doesn’t have to be elaborate. It could just be the date of something special for you in fancy letters. It could be a special phrase you have always said to each other like “My one and only.”


The possibilities are endless for how you could add art pieces to the room. A fairly small wooden pallet is a great “canvas” for painting words of love. You could buy a wooden canvas frame and stretch a piece of white cotton t-shirt around it and paint a message on that.
Make a pennant banner with felt pennants, strung up with twine. With one letter on each pennant, spell out “love.” Or use them to show the date of your wedding. Or another significant word or phrase that means a lot to you.

, Flickering candlelight is romantic enough on its own, but this is a fun and creative tweak. Save a tin or steel can and reimagine it as a decoration. Here is how you do it: Clean it out well with soap and water and fully remove the top and paper label, if you didn’t already. Fill with water and freeze. Once the water is fully frozen, take it out and with a hammer and nail, punch holes through the can in the design you want. A simple heart is a good shape to go with. Put the can in the sink while the water melts and then dry it off. Place a small tea light candle inside and put by the bed. The light flickering through the holes will cast across the wall., On the wall behind the bed, paint the words of an old love letter one of you wrote to the other. Make it nice and large so it covers most of the wall. By doing this, every time you walk into the room you will remember the romance you have shared in the past.


If not your own words, paint the words of a favorite poem or love song, or a quote or scripture that speaks to the love you share.
This can work well as a decoration for a living room or kitchen/dining room, too. For the living room, you could use a favorite quote from a romantic movie and paint it over the TV. Or find a quote that describes the romantic aspects of food for the dining room wall.

Alternatively, you could pair the wall colour with beige or sandy coloured countertops.;
, Perhaps you take your inspiration from the sand, not the water. If this is the case, you should choose a warmer earth tone such as a light beige or pink. These warm tones can be paired with white trim and aquatic blue/green tiles., A nautical look using navy blue, white, and hints of red can also give a bathroom a beach theme design.

Look at websites and magazines.,
Decide how much work you’re willing to do.,
Make a model.,
Choose a color scheme.",How to Create a Romantic Bedroom1," People have different ideas about what might be a romantic bedroom. For some people, an uncluttered room with a few choice items and art pieces on the wall is much more appealing than a room with more traditional “romantic” decor like lace, tulle, and muted or pastel colors. If you share your bedroom, consult your partner. It needs to be a place that both of you find romantic and comfortable. Some questions that you and your partner might need to think about before you begin:What is your idea of romantic? Is it overtly sexy, or more cool and understated?
Will the room be private, or will people other than you and your partner enter it at times?
Do you use your bedroom to work on the computer, watch tv, or other activities that could be done elsewhere?;
, Are you going to buy all new furniture and repaint or wallpaper your room? Or are you looking for a few key pieces that will make the room more romantic? Before you begin, you need to create a budget and have an idea of what you are going to accomplish. Again, if you are sharing your bedroom with a partner, consult him or her about your plans.

, If you’re completely redoing the room, consider creating a model of how you want it to look and where furniture is going to be placed. It might be as simple as some sketches and a floorplan on a paper, or you might want to make some computer drawings of your plan. Try a free 3-D sketching program that can give you a complete picture of what your completed room could look like.

, Even if you’re just thinking in terms of a new comforter set and some new curtains, new colors in your bedroom can significantly help change the feel of any room. Think about what you find romantic -- do you lean more toward muted and pastel colors, or splashes of strong or bold color? Will you be using black or white as a contrasting color? If you’re going to be painting the room, go to the hardware store to check out some paint colors -- this can be a good way to get inspiration. Think about it being first and foremost a place where you will sleep, and choose colors that can help you and your partner be both passionate and relaxed. Some possible combinations might be:Traditional romantic -- pink, white, creamBeach getaway -- sand, turquoise, pink
Retro cool -- beige, blue, black
Dramatic sexy -- red, gold, black
Country house -- lavender, green, white

Focus on the bed.,
Choose your bed frame and mattress.,
Get romantic bedding.,
Focus on your pillows.",How to Create a Romantic Bedroom2," It is the focal point of the room and should not be overshadowed by other furniture or art pieces. The bed in a romantic bedroom is the ultimate place to express your inner spirits, closeness, and romantic feelings. A neat and well-dressed bed can enhance passion.


Try centering the bed on a wall with no doors or windows to make it a focal point.
Think about whether you want to place it directly in the center of the room and put a low couch or chest at the end of the bed.

, If you’re buying new items, be sure to lie on the mattress before you buy so you can be certain it’s comfortable. If you’re reusing old items, think about how to make your bed frame fit into your new romantic room. Some options for changing your bed frame might be:


If it’s wood, refinish in a different varnish or strip the varnish and paint a different color
If it’s metal, paint a new color
If it’s particleboard, consider some vinyl pieces to attach and create texture and interest.
Make a new one out of repurposed boards and paint a romantic message on it.Consider a four-poster bed with a canopy over the top of a fabric that goes with your theme

, Choosing the best sheets, blankets, and comforters you can is essential for a wonderful bedroom. Think about your color scheme and start looking for bedding. Feel the fabrics -- will they provide the textural feel you want in your bed? Think about what kinds of coverings you want -- whether it will be blankets, a comforter, or a duvet -- and how it might change with the seasons.


Do you like the feel of silk or satin sheet? Some people love them, while others find them slippery.
Have you tried cotton sheets with a high thread count? These are often chosen by both men and women as some of the most comfortable sheets -- many luxury hotels use them.
Do you need a lot of warmth in your blankets or comforters? Or will you be fine with a thin blanket? Think about what you will need year-round.

, Some people like to have many accent pillows on their bed, while others prefer a more minimal look. At minimum, you’ll need fluffy comfortable pillows for your head (and the head of your partner). If you want accent pillows, think about how many you want, their sizes, and their shapes. Think about buying the pillows to match your bedding -- either to echo the colors or textures you’ve already chosen."

Work on the walls.,
Figure out where other items will fit.,
Work on lighting.,
Place wall hangings.",How to Create a Romantic Bedroom3," To really change the feel of a room, you’re probably going to want to either paint or wallpaper it. If you’re not sure you want to do wallpaper on all of the walls, think about one accent wall with a special wallpaper. Paint and wallpaper are so essential to the way that the room will come together -- you must be very sure about the colors and paper you have chosen.You can create a classically romantic bedroom by including floral patterns or ribbons in the wallpaper and trim.You could create a beach retreat by using relaxing ocean colors. You can even include a mural or large photograph of an ocean scene., Decide if your furniture all fits together with your new look and color scheme. Will some of your old furniture need to be refinished or updated? Maybe it just needs to be put into a different location. Don’t clutter up your bedroom with too much furniture. When in doubt, leave it out. Once your furniture is where you want it, you can now place any other items you’ve decided to include in your new revamped romantic bedroom.


Be choosy about how much furniture you use in your bedroom. If you do need to include some, consider choosing it all in one style/color to help the room feel put together. If it’s in a variety of colors and styles, think about painting it all one color so that it feels like it goes together. Or if it’s all wood, varnish it all in the same shade.Don’t put too many accessories in your room and take the focus away from the bed. A few focused accessories, such as a rose-embroidered throw pillow or an elegant piece of driftwood, can make a bigger impact than a host of clutter.Try not to include a television or other electronics in your bedroom. Not only do they make it more difficult to sleep, they can severely diminish the romantic nature of the room.

, Romantic lighting is one of the most important elements in a bedroom. Think about how to have pleasing lighting -- stay away from strong overhead lights and consider recessed lighting or lamps with shades. If you do use lamps with shades, painting the inside of the lampshades pink can make an extremely pleasing glow. Try some of the following:Lamps with soft lighting and shades in the colors of your bedroom
Candles in holders that can provide both romantic lighting and wonderful scents
Vases for flowers or other arrangements
Photographs of you and your loved one

, Even if you only choose one or two pieces to hang, they can make a huge difference in your room. Think about hangings that can complement your color scheme, but not necessarily mimic it. For a bedroom that really goes together, it’s probably best to choose one organizing principle for the wall hangings.

A mirror is also a good option, either without a frame or with a frame in a color that is part of your color scheme. Some other choices might be:Travel posters of places you and your partner have visited
Concert posters of sentimental value to you and your partner
Photographs (either color or black and white)
Abstract art
Enlarged handpainted or framed love letter"

Enjoy it and sleep well.",How to Buy a Down Comforter," Down are the fluffy feather clusters that grow underneath larger feathers on fowl like geese and ducks. The more down in a comforter, the softer and more comfortable it is likely to be. Choose a comforter with a high or ""pure"" down content for the most luxury.Fill-power refers to the amount of down per ounce.


If you want an ultra-warm comforter, choose one with a fill-power rating of 650 or higher.A label stating 66% down means that the comforter is two-thirds down and one-third filling material, which may include another type of feather (which is usually larger and coarser than down) or a different type of material all together, such as cotton fill.;
, Thread count is an important consideration when purchasing a down comforter because the fine feathers, which compose the down, can poke through the fabric and work their way out if the thread count isn’t high enough.The higher the thread count, the tighter the fabric, and the less likely you are to lose down feathers. Therefore, be sure to choose a comforter with a thread count of at least 250 or higher.

, These two terms refer to a specific way in which a down comforter is sewn together. Baffle-boxing means that the top and bottom fabric of the comforter are sewn together in a uniform pattern supported by additional fabric strips to create “boxes."" Similarly, quilt stitching is used to create specific pockets of down with stitched patterns.


These two different binding techniques help hold feathers in place and keep an even distribution of down throughout the comforter.
Comforters without baffle-boxing or quilt-stitching will likely have down that shifts over time (especially at the edges and in corners) with normal use, and this will not only decrease the comforter’s warmth, but also its comfort level.

, Alternative-down comforters won’t be as warm as true-down comforters, but they will be cheaper and they are a great option for people with allergies. Alternative-down comforters are worth looking into if you have a tight budget or have feather or animal dandruff sensitivities.


Down alternatives are typically made from cotton, polyester, rayon, or combinations of the three.Not only are alternative-down comforters easier to wash and maintain, they are also guaranteed to be cruelty-free., Before following through with a purchase, decide on how much you’d like to spend – a good quality down comforter will cost approximately $250, depending on the size of your bed. The higher the down content, fill-power, and thread-count, the more expensive the comforter will be.


The presence of baffle-boxing or quilt-stitching will also increase the price, but it is important to remember that these factors all increase the quality and durability of the comforter, and so, a higher-priced comforter may be worth the investment.You may also want to factor in the price of a down comforter cover – known as a duvet cover – into your budget. Duvet covers help protect your down comforter and reduce the amount of washing required to maintain it.

, Whether you’ve decided to purchase a real or alternative down comforter, your brand options are limitless, so take some time to research online. Many major online retailers will allow you to set your budget and your bed size to make searching and price comparison easier. You can also enter your comforter specifications as search terms.

, Before settling on a purchase, be sure to read product reviews. A particular brand may come with all the specifications you are hoping for, but reviews left by previous purchasers may reveal other considerations, like the comforter’s wash-ability, long-term durability, and overall value-for-your-money.


If you’re still having trouble making a decision on what you want in a down comforter, visit a home or lifestyle store to see and feel different types of down comforters in person.

, Whether you’ve chosen to make an online purchase or buy directly from a store, your comforter is a big investment, and many retailers will offer coupons and discounts for free shipping, free duvet covers, and/or a percentage off your purchase. Some stores will even accept competitor coupons. Using coupons might allow you to purchase a better comforter while still maintaining your budget.

, Be sure to order the right comforter size for your bed. Certain companies use different kinds of terminology when it comes to bed size and comforter fit (for example, a “standard king” is not the same as a “California king”), so it’s better to look for and confirm actual measurements rather than going by labels., Some brands and retailers offer lifetime warranties on down comforters. Warranties may feature free returns, down refills, and/or exchanges and may provide you with additional confidence and assurance as you make your big purchase.

, Your comforter will likely come with care instructions, and it is important to follow those first and foremost (as they will be brand-specific) before seeking general care advice.This is especially critical if your comforter is under warranty. If there is evidence that your comforter was damaged because you breached the brand’s care advice, you may not be eligible for a replacement.

, Although down or alternative-down comforters might require extra considerations before purchase and require extra maintenance afterwards, they are well-worth the effort! Take pride in your final purchase and enjoy the quality, comfort, and coziness of your new comforter. Investing in a good night’s sleep is well worth it!

Make use of your bathroom's natural light.,
Replace yellowish ceiling lights.,
Choose paint colors wisely.",How to Decorate a Small Bathroom1," Even a small bathroom can be a peaceful, relaxing getaway in your home if it gets good natural light. If possible, don't cover up your windows with dark curtains or blinds.


Install curtains or blinds in a light color like oatmeal or cream; make sure they're thick enough to provide a secure screen, but thin enough to let some light in.






You could also install curtains that cover only the bottom half of your windows, letting light in through the top half.






If your bathroom is situated away from other people's view, go ahead and open the curtains or blinds to let the light shine in.





;
, If you have an old-fashioned, dull yellow ceiling light - which many bathrooms do - a simple way to transform your bathroom is to update the light fixture with something more modern. Choose a light covering that helps bath the bathroom in white light, rather than yellow, which causes rooms to look gloomy and small.


A small chandelier is a good choice for a tiny bathroom; it adds elegance without taking up too much space.






Track lighting can also help give the appearance of a bigger space., Painting a room with highly contrasting color can make it look smaller, so choose paint that isn't too wildly different from your bathroom tiles. For example, if you have cream tile, painting the walls dark blue might make the space feel claustrophobic; go for a lighter shade of cream, peach, pale blue, or another color that isn't too loud.


If you prefer bolder colors, consider painting the walls a neutral color and adding a more colorful trim or border.






You could also paint just one wall a bold color and leave three walls neutral, or use wallpaper in one area and neutral paint everywhere else.

Consider interest-free financing.",How to Buy a Bed," Inner spring is the most common mattress type, and almost every mattress store will carry this model. Chances are you have either seen or slept on this type of mattress before. The inner spring mattress is usually distinguished by coil count. Generally, the higher the coil count, the higher the price. However, these types of mattresses are available in all price ranges.;
, Foam mattresses are made of memory foam, which is soft and conforms to the body. It is good for people who desire extra softness. This type is often more expensive than the inner spring type of mattress because it conforms to people's bodies. This can be good for some people and a negative for others. For example, people with pressure points and joint problems may prefer a foam mattress. Some people find that this type of mattress makes them uncomfortably warm.Maybe your current mattress is quite soft, and you want to find a bed with adequate firmness. If this is your situation, then you may want to avoid memory foam and stick to an inner-spring type of mattress.

, Air mattresses can be adjusted by the user for an appropriate amount of softness. This is done with an electric pump. Sleep Number beds are the most well known type of air mattress. These beds are separated into 2 areas, which can be controlled by remotes. The air pockets above the coils can be firm or soft. Often times, mattresses like this will have a foam covering as well. If you disagree about the type of mattress you and your partner want, you should consider an air mattress., There are characteristics in mattresses that you may specifically want or need. For instance, you might want to make sure you are buying an “eco-friendly” mattress. In that case, research potential mattresses to see if they were built to either OE Standards or the Global Organic Textile Standards (GOTS).If you have pain or simply feel uncomfortable, you may want a bed with adjustable positioning. This type of bed will allow you to rest at an incline., You might consider a twin if you are by yourself. Maybe you’re alone, but you want some extra space. In that case, a full could be what you want. Queen size and king size beds are generally preferred by couples.


Twin, full, queen, and king are all standard mattress sizes. However, if these sizes are too small for you, then you may want to consider the California King size. This extra large mattress is 72 by 84 inches (182 cm by 213 cm)., Lie on the mattress in your regular fashion. Aim to spend at least 15 minutes on the mattress.You want to create a sleeping situation as close to the one you have at home. Make sure that you change positions frequently in order to imitate how you would normally go to sleep. Never buy a mattress that is untested.


If you will share the mattress, make sure both people try it before you buy.

, Look at the space where your bed will go, and measure it with a tape ruler. The size of the bed will depend on the size of the room. Another way to get an accurate measure of this, if you already have a mattress, is to place the mattress on the floor of your room. By doing this, you will see exactly how much space the mattress itself will take up. This will be incredibly helpful in choosing what type of bed frame to buy.


Common bed frame sizes are twin, full, queen, and king. A twin bed frame will fit in a space of 39 inches by 70 inches (99 to 178 cm). For a full bed frame, you will generally need a space measuring 54 by 75 inches (137 by 190 cm). 60 by 80 inches (152 by 203 cm) is a large enough space for a queen bed frame. A king bed frame will require 72 by 84 inches (183 by 213 cm). These sizes vary between the EU and United States. You should note this in case you buy the bed frame or mattress from a retailer in an EU country. , Then, determine if you need a high or low bed frame. So, if you have a mattress that’s four inches high, then you might want to consider a high bed frame. Using a low bed frame with this mattress might lead to your bed standing too close to the floor.


You don’t want the bed frame to be so high that it is difficult to get in and out. At the same time, you don’t want to get a bed frame that is so low that your mattress is touching the ground.

, Measure how tall you are. A bed frame that is too small will be uncomfortable, because you will consistently be banging your head or feet when you get into it. Use your height to decide if you need a bed frame with a foot board. If you don’t, you can buy minimal bed frames in both wood and metal.

, This type of bed frame has wooden slats that hold your mattress up. If you are in the market for a smaller frame, consider buying a platform bed frame. With some beds, you may not need a box spring in addition to the platform. Take into account that platform bed frames are generally closer to the ground than other bed frames.

, Depending on your living situation, you might need a bed that has multiple functions. If your apartment or room is quite small, then you might benefit from a bed that can store your things. A bed frame with bottom storage will have space under the bed for books, supplies, and other possessions. Usually, this storage area is located under the place where you will put your mattress.

, Pick a frame with colors and décor style that you like. Page through décor magazines such as Pottery Barn, West Elm, Ikea, Restoration Hardware and Crate and Barrel. Try to take detailed notes about what you like. Choose your style and then go comparison shopping in furniture stores or in box stores, like Target.

, Give yourself some time to buy the perfect bed. Don’t simply buy the first thing that you see. You want to make sure that you have done thorough research. The more rushed you are in making a purchase, the less likely you are to find a good deal.

, Buy your mattress in May if possible. Mattress companies often come out with new models in May or June. These are also months when retailers will mark down old models. Other good times include holidays, like Labor Day and President’s Day, when furniture stores have big sales. , Unless you are completely sure, it is best to avoid buying a mattress online. If you slept on the mattress while staying with friends or at a bed and breakfast, you may be able to order it at discount online without too much worry. Yes, there are definitely cheap options on the Internet; however, since you usually won’t be able to see the bed firsthand, you should be wary of online deals.

, After you test out mattresses at several stores, look online for the best prices. Make sure to include shipping costs and warranties. The price you calculate online may be cheaper than what is offered in-store, in which case you can bring the price into a store to ask for a price reduction. After going to several stores, create a comparison sheet between retailers.

, Talk to the salesperson and ask if they offer a comfort guarantee. A comfort warranty states that if the bed is not comfortable, then you can exchange or return it. If they do, ask for specific details. You want to know if you will need to exchange the bed or pay for the bed to be shipped back. Generally, this is included in the mattress price.


Give preference to any retailer that gives a comfort guarantee for 1 year after purchase.

, Look for any discounts available. For example, some stores give you a discount for buying a bed set. Sold separately, a box spring and mattress can be over $1,000 each. However, most bed stores are willing to make a deal when you purchase both at once. Some stores offer prices reduction if you find that another store has a cheaper price for the same item. You should also ask about payment plans, and if it is possible to sign up for one.

, Going this route depends on your budget. If you think you can pay for the bed immediately, then you probably shouldn’t use an installment plan. However, if you can’t pay for your bed up front, many furniture stores still offer installment payments. Speak to the salesperson, and ask for information about this option.


All plans are not the same. For example, stores will often ask you to go through a third party lender such as a bank or finance company. Usually, these institutions will need to approve you for credit. They may also have minimum purchase amounts and application fees.

Check a store specializing in organic goods.,
Buy an organic mattress online for variety.,
Be wary when shopping at big-box stores.,
Avoid buying used mattresses.",How to Buy an Organic Crib Mattress1," Natural health stores or organic retailers sometimes carry products for new moms. If you frequent an organic store with good selection, ask the employees if they carry crib mattresses. Even if they don't, an employee might know local options.

If you're friends with other eco-friendly moms, ask them where they bought their crib mattresses. They might point you in the right direction.;
, Online stores can give you the widest selection, especially if you're looking for a certain material. Often, buying online is the cheapest way to order organic materials. Browse several different retailer websites to make sure you find the cheapest option.

Make sure you order from a trusted website. Check out a company's online reviews and certifications before you buy., Large-scale retailers are great for buying cheap or bulk items but less-than-ideal for finding organic mattresses. Because organic materials are usually more expensive, chain stores might not carry certified organic items. Read the packaging carefully and research the manufacturer before buying., Crib mattresses made before 2009 can contain harmful chemicals like phthalates or banned flame retardants. Because mattresses are exposed to moisture, older mattresses can also harbor mold.Used mattresses will also be harder to certify as organic, especially if you don't have the packaging.

Add functional shelving.,
Get a shower caddy.,
Remove unnecessary furniture and floor cabinets.,
Replace large bathroom fixtures with smaller ones.",How to Decorate a Small Bathroom2," Small bathrooms tend to have limited floor space, but what about the unused area above the toilet or next to the window? If your bathroom has a spot on the wall that isn't getting much use, consider installing some sturdy shelves where you can store towels, extra shampoo and soap, or small decorations.


Be sure to place the shelving above your head level - you don't want to be bumping your forehead each time you step out of the shower.
If you have a free corner, choose corner shelves to maximize space even more.






If your bathroom seems too small for shelves, install some hooks instead. Choose a style that matches the décor of your bathroom and hang three or four in a row on the wall. Use them to hang your towels, loofah, body brush, or other bathroom equipment., The shower itself can be a storage area and a place to decorate. Hang a cute wire shower caddy over the shower head and store your shampoo and conditioner there. You could also look into installing waterproof shelving inside the shower to hold these items.

, If you have a cabinet under your sink, there's no need to have an extra dresser in another corner of the bathroom. Clear away decorative tables, laundry hampers (they can go in your bedroom instead) and any other piece of furniture that sits on the floor of your bathroom. You'll be amazed at what a difference clearing away even a small piece of furniture can make.


If you absolutely must keep a dresser or small piece of furniture in your bathroom, try to maximize space by creating a second level of usage. For example, a small dresser can double as a vanity if you hang a mirror on the wall above it.






If you have a large clothes hamper that you prefer to keep in the bathroom, consider getting a cloth laundry bag instead. These take up much less space than large basket hampers.







, If you're prepared to spend some money to decorate your small bathroom, you may want to look into getting a smaller bathtub, or converting your bathtub to a shower that takes up less space. You could also get a a smaller sink fixture to replace one that is large and bulky.

"

Decorate sparingly.,
Throw away old toiletries.,
Pare down your bathroom appliances.,
Keep items off the floor.",How to Decorate a Small Bathroom3," A small bathroom doesn't need too many decorations; your paint color, a pretty bathroom mirror, and a picture or two will be enough to create a functional, relaxing space. Avoid hanging large posters, light fixtures, or anything that sticks out from the wall too much.

, Do you hold onto once-used bottles of hair products that you hope may someday tame your frizz? Is the area under your bathroom sink crammed with 10 bottles of sunscreen and sticky bars of soap? Getting rid of these old products can clear up a lot of space and make your bathroom feel more comfortable.


Collect the products you and your family actually use - not products you might use someday, but those you really need. Organize them in a basket or drawer so they're conveniently accessible.
Donate or throw away products you haven't used in a few months.
Consolidate mostly-empty bottles of shampoo, conditioner or body wash into one bottle, then toss the empties out.

, That unsightly tangle of hair dryers, curling irons, straighteners, and other appliances is probably taking up too much space on your counter. Instead of leaving them sitting out all the time, find a box that fits them all. Store them in the box when you aren't using them, then place the box under the sink, on the shelf, or in another room.
, Hanging up your towels, putting your clothes in the hamper, and keeping books and magazines on a shelf can make your bathroom appear to be more spacious. In addition, go for a thin, subtle bathmat instead of a big, fluffy one, which can make the floor appear cluttered and small.

Avoid vinyl-covered mattresses.,
Check the mattress filling material.,
Pick a mattress made from organic cotton for breathability.,
Buy a mattress that is organic and non-toxic.,
Find a mattress that does not contain common baby allergens.",How to Buy an Organic Crib Mattress2," Most baby mattresses have a vinyl waterproof covering. Polyvinyl chloride (or PVC) is a non-organic and environmentally-unfriendly plastic. PVC is also toxic and a known carcinogen. When babies breathe in and absorb PVC through their skin, they are at a higher-risk for asthma, kidney disease, and liver dysfunction. Opt for a non-vinyl covering instead.Food-grade polyethylene plastic is a common organic and non-toxic covering alternative., Most crib mattresses use polyurethane foam as a mattress filling, which is highly-flammable and non-organic. Along with its main component (petroleum), polyurethane foam can contain additives like formaldehyde, benzene, toluene, and other toxic chemicals. Opt for a crib mattress filled with wool batting, cotton, plant foam, or coconut coir., Organic cotton is the ideal material for crib mattresses because it is non-toxic and breathable. Unlike foam mattresses, organic cotton does not release toxic fumes. Organic cotton is also sturdy and firm, which protects babies against suffocation.Organic cotton is not waterproof. Buy a non-toxic waterproof covering to protect the mattress from leaking diapers or bottles.

, Organic does not equate to non-toxic. Even organic crib mattresses can contain dangerous materials for your baby. Safety is most important for your baby, so check to see if the label has both certifications. If you're not sure what materials are used, check with the manufacturer for more details., Wool and latex are both known to cause eczema in children. If you find a wool crib mattress, look for wool that has not been treated with chemicals. Wool from sheep fed a natural diet is also less likely to irritate skin. Avoid synthetic latex completely.Natural rubber latex (which comes from rubber trees) is an organic alternative, but take caution: though rare, some children are still allergic."

Read the packaging description.,
Check to see if the mattress meets Global Organic Textile Standards (GOTS) requirements.,
Look for Greenguard-certified mattresses.,
Browse online reviews.",How to Buy an Organic Crib Mattress3," Some manufacturers may say that their mattress is filled with organic cotton but still use vinyl waterproofing. Check to make sure the mattress is one hundred percent organic. If you're confused by the wording, call or email the mattress company before you buy.

Do not buy crib mattresses made of bamboo rayon. While this may sound organic, bamboo is usually chemically processed before it is made into fabric., GOTS is the golden processing standard for organic textiles. To qualify, a textile must be made with at least 70% organic fibers. All dyes or chemicals used must meet certain environmental and toxicological standards. If a crib mattress is organic, it will be certified by GOTS., Greenguard is a separate organic textile standards organization with separate standards from GOTS. The aim of Greenguard is to certify that textiles are environmentally friendly and organic. All Greenguard mattresses must exhibit low chemical emissions based on established exposure criteria.Greenguard Gold is a subset of Greenguard textiles that pass even stricter requirements, including safety factors to account for children. For the ideal organic and eco-friendly crib mattress, look for Greenguard Gold-certified companies., Although online reviews are not certified as true, they can give you a good idea of what to expect from the mattress. If you notice angry reviews from moms who thought the mattress was certified organic, the manufacturer may be hiding something you haven't noticed.

Take all reviews with a grain of salt, and read many reviews to gain a rounded opinion.

Create space around your furniture.",How to Arrange Bedroom Furniture," Before you buy new furniture or try to fit your furniture inside the bedroom, you need to know how the bedroom is set up. Window placement or wall size will affect how you arrange the furniture. Things to consider when you are scoping the layout include:


The measurement of the walls. Use a tape measure to get a precise measurement of the wall space.
The placement of wall outlets and telephone jacks. You will need the electrical outlets to plug in alarm clocks, lamps, televisions, and other devices.
The placement of the cable input. You will have to place TVs wherever the satellite or cable connections are placed in the room, or else drill new holes and move your wires (best left to your satellite company or other trained professionals).
Windows. Take note of which walls have windows, how low they are, and how many are in the room.
Closets and other doors. Look at which walls have doors in them, where the closet is located, and which walls are uninterrupted by doors and windows.;
, Decide which pieces of furniture you would like in your bedroom. Measure those pieces and compare them to the dimensions of your bedroom.You have to determine if your furniture will fit in the room before you start moving heavy furniture inside.

, While you are planning on your bedroom, think about the area around the door. You want to make sure to keep that area clear of clutter. Don't plan on placing furniture in areas that will block the doorway; make sure that the door has plenty of room to open all the way., Sleeping is one obvious activity, but many people spend more time in their bedroom than just at bedtime. Will you watch television or read in your bedroom? Will you get dressed, put on makeup, or fix your hair in this room? Will the bedroom be for one or two people? Is it your bedroom or a guest bedroom? These things will tell you what furniture you need.

, Think about the size of your living space. Do you live in a tiny apartment with a tiny bedroom, or do you have a spacious house with a large, open room? Large bedroom suits might not be practical for small apartments, while small beds and desks might look awkward in a larger space. Match your furniture to the scale of the room and fit into the space you have.

, Some people like modern, minimalist designs, while others like a fuller, cozier layout. Some people like plain walls, while others like lots of photos and pictures. Remember that the bedroom is your space. You want to arrange it so it is functional, but you want to have it reflect your personality, tastes, and comforts.

, Generally the bed is the most important piece of furniture in the room, which makes it the most important for you to arrange. One popular placement of the bed is in the center of the wall across from the door. This makes the bed the focal point of the room.The other good choice for your bed is along the longest wall in the bedroom.If you don't have the room to place it in the center of the opposite wall, or windows or doors prevent that, you can place the bed off-center along one of the walls. You might also want to angle the headboard in one of the corners, but that can take up a lot of space.Another placement of the bed can be between two windows, if you have two windows along one wall. You might want to refrain from placing the bed directly underneath the window, especially if you leave your windows open often during warmer months. This might cause an uncomfortable draft.
Leave enough room around the bed so you can easily get up and down from the bed. If only you sleep in the bed, you can push the bed against a wall. If you share a bed with another person, you want to leave enough space on both sides of the bed so both people can easily get in and out of the bed.
Try not to block the natural light with the headboard., For most people, the dresser is the second largest piece of furniture in a bedroom. Place the dresser directly across the bed to balance out the room.If you have a lot of wall space, opt for a low, wide dresser.


If you are a TV watcher, you can place your television on top of the dresser. The television should be across from the bed if you plan on watching a lot of TV in bed. Placing it on top of the dresser saves you from needing an extra table for the television. If you don't watch TV but read a lot, then use the dresser as a bookshelf.
If you are tight on space, choose a tall, vertical dresser instead of a wide dresser. This takes up less wall space by utilizing height.You may choose to place your dresser underneath a window to maximize space.
If your closet is large enough, or there is limited space in your room, you can consider placing the dresser inside the closet.

, After placing the two larger pieces of furniture, you can start to fill in the room with smaller pieces. Nightstands are exceptionally important. They hold alarm clocks, lamps, books, TV remotes, cell phones, glasses of water, and anything else you might need access to while in bed. The nightstand should be placed on each side of the bed (on only one side if the bed is flush against the wall). Get a nightstand that comes up to the height of your mattress.Nightstands come in all different shapes, sizes, and colors. Think about what you need from a nightstand. Do you want shelves? Drawers? Just a small tabletop? Choose a nightstand that reflects your need.

, After placing these items, decide if there is room for other items. Also think about what other things you need in your bedroom. Do you need a desk to do work at? Do you want a chair to read and relax in? Finish off your bedroom by placing furniture that fits your needs.


Place a desk with a chair in the room. You can buy a flat desk that fits along an empty wall space or under a window, or buy a corner desk that fits snugly in a corner and out of the way.
Put ottomans at the foot of the bed for extra seating, or put a small armchair in the room for visitors to sit on, or you to relax in as you unwind.
Place a mirror in the room. This can accompany a vanity, be placed with the desk, or just hung on the wall.Add bookcases. If you need shelf space for books, photos, and other belongings, place a bookcase along an empty wall.
Create a seating area. In a small room, this can be something as simple as a stool or bench. In a large bedroom, you can have chair or a sofa for your seating area.

, You will not want bright lighting when you are trying to unwind, so consider placing lamps in places where you will be reading, watching television, or relaxing. You might want to mount lights in the ceiling or in the wall.

, If your bedroom is small, think about buying pieces that serve multi-purposes or save space. Try a bunk-desk combination, which has a high bed with a desk beneath it. Or try a storage beds if you don't have space for a dresser.

, Do not have the room cluttered so that there is not ample area to walk around the room or into other rooms. Keep at least two feet between the sides of the bed and the wall or other furniture."

Cool shades are believed to have a calming effect, so they can create a more soothing atmosphere for your bedroom. Choose cool colors, such as blue, purple, green, and gray with cool undertones, for your bedroom decor.You can use both light and dark cool tones, depending on your preference. Dark cool shades can help make a large bedroom feel cozier, while light cool shades can help make a small bedroom appear larger.
Neutral shades can also work when you’re trying to create a relaxing bedroom. Consider incorporating shades of white, ivory, cream, beige, tan, taupe, brown, and/or black in the decor.
Warm colors, such as red, yellow, and orange, are thought to be energizing, so they may be too stimulating for your bedroom decor. If you like those shades, use them in limited doses in the decor, such as a single throw pillow or rug.;
, When you’re choosing decor for your bedroom, it’s best to take a minimal approach. If you have too many accessories and pieces of artwork in the space, it can be distracting and keep you from getting a good night’s sleep. Focus on just a few key pieces of decor to create an attractive but calm space.When you’re keeping your decor to a minimum, it’s especially important that you really love all of the items that you choose for your bedroom. Make sure that the furniture, artwork, plants, and other pieces in the space make you happy or help calm you down.

, The bed is obviously the most important piece of furniture in any bedroom, but you may want to create another area in the room where you can relax without sleeping. A seating area where you can read or just take a quiet moment for yourself can be a very important addition to your bedroom.In a small bedroom, a single cozy chair beside a window can serve as your seating area.
In a large bedroom, you might add a couple of chairs or a loveseat to create a seating area.

, If you’re choosing minimal decor for your bedroom, you should make a statement where you can. Instead of a plain headboard, opt for one that adds visual interest to the space. A dramatic, oversized style is a bold option, while a simple upholstered style can add color and/or pattern to your bedroom.If you have a small bedroom, a headboard with shelving where you can display decorative items may be a good option.
If you’re on a budget, you can create your own statement headboard. Drape fabric on the wall behind your bed, repurpose an old door or pair of shutters, or mount foam tiles on the wall to create a headboard., To ensure that your bed is as comfortable as possible, opt for a plush comforter or bedspread. A down comforter is an ideal option because you can easily swap the duvet covers to change up the look of your bedroom when the mood strikes.A solid comforter or bedspread that matches the rest of the decor is a classic option, but your bedding is an ideal way to introduce a pattern to the room.
Avoid comforters or bedspreads that have beading or other hard decorative elements. They usually aren’t very comfortable to sleep with.

, While your comforter is a key piece of your bedroom decor, the sheets on your bed may be even more important when you want to create a relaxing space. Choose the best quality sheets that fit your budget to ensure that you’re as comfortable as possible. Sheets made with natural fibers, such as cotton or linen, are the best option because they are breathable and hold up well.For the most comfortable sheets, make sure that they’re over 200 thread count.
In most cases, solid sheets that fit the color palette you’ve chosen are the best option. However, if you opt for a solid comforter, you may want to use patterned sheets instead.

, In addition to the pillows that you sleep on at night, you’ll want to add some decorative throw pillows to your bed. Not only can they add color, pattern, and texture to the decor, but they can help make your bed more comfortable.Just as with your comforter, avoid pillows that have beading, sequins, or other hard details that may be scratchy and uncomfortable.

, You don’t want sunlight to wake you up too early in the morning, so it’s best to choose opaque coverings for the windows in your bedroom. Blackout shades are an ideal option, and are available in different styles that control how much light is filtered out.Opaque window coverings also allow you plenty of privacy in your bedroom.
If you aren’t a fan of blinds, opaque, floor length drapes that are easy to open and close are an ideal alternative.

, Choosing a throw or area rug that’s made from soft fabrics can help absorb sound and prevent echoing so your bedroom is more peaceful. Mohair and sheepskin work well to keep your bedroom quiet.Place your throw or area rug beneath or beside your bed to ensure that it blocks as much noise from reaching you while you’re sleeping

, If you share your bedroom with another person, there may be times when one of you is awake and the other is sleeping. To avoid disturbing one another, it’s best to use lamps rather than overhead light fixtures. Place a lamp on each bedside table and in other areas of the room that you want to highlight.If your bedroom has overhead lights, consider adding dimmer switches. That will allow you to control how bright the light is, so it doesn’t disturb you or your partner when you’re trying to relax.

, When you’re choosing paintings, posters, or other artwork for your bedroom walls, opt for pieces that you find soothing or relaxing. Landscapes and other nature scenes are often calming options, but choose pieces that speak to you.Make sure to include photos of family and friends in your bedroom decor. That can help make you feel more secure and relaxed in the space.
When you’re arranging the artwork in your bedroom, try to place your favorite piece(s) on a wall that you see from your bed. That way, it can be the last thing you see before you fall asleep and the first thing that you see when you wake up.

, The right scents can help create a more peaceful mood in your bedroom. When you’re decorating, include candles or a fragrance oil diffuser in your favorite scent(s) to help you relax at the end of the day.In addition to candles or a fragrance oil diffuser, you may want to use a linen spray to add a calming scent to your sheets and bedding.
Lavender is thought to be a very calming scent, so it’s ideal for use in the bedroom.Other scents that can help create a peaceful mood include clary sage, ylang ylang, bergamot, and jasmine.

, If your bedroom is cluttered or messy, you’re going to have a difficult time staying relaxed. Add plenty of storage to your room so you have place to keep all of your belongings and your room stays neat and organized.In addition to traditional storage options, such as a closet, dresser, or armoire, look for pieces that maximize space. For example, under bed storage boxes or containers are ideal for a small bedroom.
Pieces that do double duty can also help maximize space in your bedroom. For example, opt for a bench or ottoman that has storage inside rather than a regular piece of furniture.

Get your mirror(s).,

Put the body-length mirror behind a door to save space.,

Place the dressing table mirror as near to natural light as possible.",How to Arrange Your Bedroom Mirrors," Ideally there should be two mirrors in a bedroom - a body-length mirror and a dressing table or smaller mirror that you can get close to with ease.
, Either the bedroom door or a wardrobe door will do fine, as long as you can stand in front of them closely and some distance away to view your garments in full. This mirror does not need to be elaborate or framed, as nobody but you will see it. Just a rectangle hung vertically with screws in each corner will suffice. If it lacks sufficient light, install a light near it if possible., Preferably this mirror should be near a window.

Make your bed the focal point.,
Give away your dresser.,
Buy a small chair and table.,
Get a small folding table to use as a nightstand.",How to Affordably Decorate a Small Bedroom1," When you walk into a bedroom, the bed is the piece of furniture that instantly draws the eye. Situating it in a central place and decorating around it is the best way to handle having a big bed in a small bedroom. Place the headboard against one wall. Treat it like the mantle in your living room, which you use as a place to display treasured items and pretty decorations.


Since you have a small room, know that whatever wall art you choose is going to dominate the room. Limit your art to just two or three pieces so that you have plenty of bare wall, which gives the impression of more space.
Save money by making your own wall art. Try creating a silhouette of your pet or painting a landscape.
Black and white prints are affordable and a good choice for small rooms, since they don't demand attention the same way colorful paintings might.;
, It sounds crazy, right? However, having a big, clunky dresser takes up a lot of space in a bedroom, and you may be able to get away without having one, or at the very least, downsizing. Take a look at what you've got and figure out how you can store it differently. Chances are, you can store most of it in the closet or in another storage container. Try some of these space-saving tricks when it comes to clothing storage:


Hang up most of your clothes. Clothes take up less space when they're on hangers than when they're folded up in a drawer. Hang up t-shirts, jeans, and other items you'd normally store in the dresser.
Store your undergarments in a small cabinet or storage container in the closet or under the bed.
Use hooks. Scarves, coats, hats, and other items can be stored on hooks instead of taking up space in a dresser.
Store out-of-season clothing when you aren't using it. Place it in air-tight storage containers that will fit under your bed or on a shelf in your closet.
Regularly donate clothes you no longer wear. You probably have more clothes and shoes than you could ever use - if this is the case, take them to a donation center and free up some space in your bedroom.

, Choose a sturdy table that can double as a desk and hold the items you'd normally place on your dresser. Place it near a window in the part of your room that gets used the least. Get a small wooden chair that you can push in under the table, so it's not sitting out in the middle of the room.


Avoid getting a big cushy office chair, unless your bedroom doubles as your office. A straight-backed chair with a small cushion will take up far less space in your bedroom.
Choose a table and chair that match your bed's frame so that your furniture choices don't look mismatched. Cherry wood, blond wood, or wrought iron are nice choices.
Use part of the table's surface as a place to put your jewelry box, reading material, and other items you use on a daily basis. Don't let it get too cluttered, though!

, You can buy small slatted wood tables that are easy to move around and fold up when they aren't in use. Place it next to your bed and top it with a reading lamp, your glasses, and whatever items you need next to you at night.

Then fill these shams with pillows that are up to 1"" (2.54 cm) larger, to create a full, rounded look.Euro pillows are a good choice if you do not have a headboard.
This pillows also look good against most headboards, so long as the headboard is taller than the pillows.

, For a sleek and stylish look, try using just three square pillows. Stand two large Euro pillows up against your headboard (or wall) side-by-side. Then place one square accent pillow right in the center.A 20 x 20"" (50.8 x 50.8 cm) accent pillow is a good choice for this arrangement.

Select Euro shams and an accent pillow/standard pillow sham in complementary colors.

, To create a look with more depth and dimension, you can use two Euro pillows, two standard pillows, and one accent pillow. Stand your two Euro pillows up against your headboard (or wall).

Rethink your approach to lighting.,
Paint the walls a light color.,
Pick out linens with subtle patterns.",How to Affordably Decorate a Small Bedroom2," The lighting in a bedroom can make a huge difference in how small or large it feels and whether or not it comes off as ""polished."" To create a relaxing, comfortable bedroom in which you actually want to spend downtime, try making these changes:


Use minimal window coverings. Avoid having blinds, which block out too much light and make a room feel closed-in even when they're open. Go for breezy, light curtains in a neutral color instead. Hanging them a few inches above the top of the window can make the windows look bigger and increase the perceived scale of the room.Choose a bright table or floor lamp. Overhead lights seem to spotlight the flaws in a room, making it feel cramped and uncomfortable. It's worth buying a floor lamp or side table lamp bright enough to light the whole room instead.

, Light, natural hues like white, cream, pale yellow, pale blue, or another neutral shade will help make the room look bigger and brighter. Choose a color that doesn't contrast too much with the shade of your floor. Paint the ceiling white as well.


If you love bold colors, consider painting the walls a neutral color and using a bolder trim. You could also paint just one wall in a bold color (or paper it with a brightly patterned wallpaper) and paint the other walls a lighter color.
Consider adding color and interest by making a stenciled border around the perimeter of the room. You may not even need wall art if you go this route.

, You might be attracted to a duvet cover with a bright floral pattern, but in a small bedroom it will draw the eye and stick out from its surroundings. A better approach would be to get a bed covering in a more neutral hue and add throw pillows in bright contrasting colors for a decorative touch.


You could also add some color by choosing sheets with a fun pattern and making your bed so that the sheets are folded over the top of your neutral-colored comforter.
Choose linens that aren't too frilly or bulky, since these take up more space.

Keep the floor as bare as possible.,
Use mirrors to make the room feel larger.,
Use wall shelves instead of a bookcase.,
Choose just a few trinkets to display.,
Find a place for a plant or two.",How to Affordably Decorate a Small Bedroom3," If you have a hardwood floor (lucky you) a small throw rug next to the bed should be the only floor covering you need. Keeping the floor bare makes a room seem more spacious, while covering a floor with small rugs dissects it and makes it look cluttered. Plus, you'll avoid the expense of buying extra floor coverings.


If you have carpeting, avoid breaking it up with smaller throw rugs.
Keep the floor clear of random objects like bean bag chairs, piles of clothing, and other odds and ends.

, Investing in a few good-quality mirrors is a great idea when you're working with limited space. Mirrors really do trick the eye into thinking a space is larger than it is.

, Install sturdy shelves on the wall and use it for the books or trinkets you want to display. You'll free up a lot of floor space by getting rid of your bookcase.

, You may love your collection of vintage cuckoo clocks, but chances are they're taking up too much space in your little bedroom. Choose your favorite items to display and put the rest in storage. You can rotate them out after a few months to keep things fresh and interesting.

, Plants are an inexpensive way to add a beautiful decorative touch to a room, and they don't have to take up too much space. Go to your local nursery and pick out a few plants small enough to display on your windowsill or a shelf.


You could also consider installing a hook in the ceiling and buying a hanging plant to place near a window.
Succulents, such as air plants, require very little upkeep. You can hang them up or display them on a shelf in pretty glass containers; just spray them with water once a week to keep them green and healthy.

Find a good spot for your nook, such as a corner, alcove, or a box.,
Decide what kind of seating you want to utilize.,
Brighten up your space with light.,
Make it a place of comfort.,
Seclude the reading nook from other parts of the room if possible.",How to Make a Reading Nook in Your Room1," You may find it necessary to rearrange your bedroom furniture. Doing so will open up spaces that are good potential nooks. Pick a spot that's as quiet as possible. You do not want a lot of loud noises, such as a radio or TV, to disturb your peaceful little getaway., Do you want a big fluffy chair that swallows you up? Do you want a chair that you can curl up in? Do you prefer a bunch of pillows on the floor or a beanbag instead? Or do you want a woven bench that doubles as a coffee table and an ottoman?, Ample light is the perfect way to capitalize on moments of inspiration that might come to you as you read. Find a light that strikes a balance between lighting needs and your level of comfort.For daytime reading, nothing beats glorious daylight. If it gets too bright, pull across the curtains to prevent the direct sunlight from beaming onto your reading material.
For reading at night, a simple lamp will do, as long as it is adjustable. Another option is to buy a desk or floor lamp.

, The most important part of a reading nook is comfort. It must be something that appeals to you and encourages you to curl up in it time after time. Think of softness and textures that delight you. Do not use anything that you do not like or that gives you a feeling of unpleasantness.


Surround yourself with the things that make you the most comfortable, such as a plushy throw or soft pillows.
Use colors, patterns and textures that make you feel safe and warm.

, This can be as simple as putting a low dresser perpendicular to one wall to give the impression of division, or it can be as complicated as hanging curtains around the nook to create a canopy. The division will give you a sense of ownership of the nook and keep others from invading your private space.


Treat your nook like a hideaway and keep a snack nearby that’s savory and sweet, like cheddar popcorn with candy corn. Unplug from everything and don’t introduce phone or electronics to your quiet space.Surround yourself and your personal haven with sweet aromas. Purchase a season-themed candle and place it in your nook to help you further unwind.

However, most of the time a decorator will have to work within a budget. If you are on a tight budget, however, you might have to cut some corners. For example:


Instead of buying new furniture, you could repaint or refinish your old furniture.
Instead of repainting your walls, you could apply vinyl wall decals. This is a popular choice for youth, and for those who cannot paint the walls. also great for those who don't have a lot of time.
If you are crafty, consider some DIY decorations or furniture
Consider decorating your room a little bit at a time. Maybe you do not have $500 to spend on redecorating currently. But if one month you spend $50 on paint, the next $50 on new curtains, and so on, it can be more affordable.;
, While you do not absolutely have to have a theme, this will help you decide what furniture to get, and what sorts of colors and patterns to use for things such as walls, bed linens, rugs, and pillows. Start with something that you like, such as a favorite animal, interest, or color. Here are some places you can find inspiration and ideas:


Browse image saving websites, such as Pinterest.
Go through home decorating catalogs.
Visit some furniture stores and take note of displays that you like.

, If you are planning to stay in your house for a while and are uninterested in redecorating often, will you still like the theme you have now? If you go through different interests often, choose a general theme (such as colors and patterns you like) for the walls, rugs, and furniture. Express your current interests with smaller items you can easily change, such as lampshades, bed linens, or figurines.


If you are a teen, you are likely to change interests fairly quickly. What was your passions at 13 may be different at 17.
Be careful of over-committing to a theme. It is one thing to have your sheet set have a theme of horses. But if your bed, lamps, curtains, artwork, throw-pillows, carpet, and more have horses, that could be a bit too much.

, If your room is very messy or cluttered, you might want to clean it first. This will give you a blank slate to work with. It will be easier to move things around and see how they look.

, Review your room decor. Do you have a theme already in your room, or a mishmash of different themes? Consider getting rid of some items that you no longer use, or that no longer suit your taste or style. You can sell these items online or donate them to a charity center.


If you have something that you still like, but that no longer suits the current style of your room, see if you can re-purpose, repaint, or redecorate it.

, If you are on a budget, take a look at your current furniture, and see if you can re-purpose them to fit your new style. A simple wooden bed can easily be made to fit lots of different styles with the right paint job or bed linens. For example:


Paint your bed a solid color for a sleek, modern look.
Add a colorful quilt and lots of pillows with different patterns for a boho look.
For a vintage, country-chic look, you could paint your bed a base color, and then add a second coat of a crackle-effect paint to get that weathered look.
Make an inventory of what stuff you have already got (i.e. article of furniture, sheets, linens, pictures, plants and alternative ornamental things). You may get some ideas on the way to use your recent stuff in new ways.

, You can also paint the walls a solid color first, and then paste on a narrow strip of wallpaper going around the room. The strip can be in the center of the wall, or towards the top.


If you can't paint the walls or change the wallpaper, tack some fabric to the wall instead. Try to get it as smooth as possible.
If you have a small room, consider painting your walls one color, and leaving the ceiling white. This will make your room look bigger.

, Instead of painting your entire room one color, paint three walls white or off-white, and the fourth wall a darker, contrasting color. Place all of your statement furniture against this wall.

, Choose a base color for the background, and a contrasting color for the designs. Paint the background color first, let it dry, then apply the designs with more paint and stencils.


If you live in a rental unit, use wall decals instead. They are giant, vinyl stickers that peel off easily when it is time to move out.

, This is great for those who are on a budget or are unable to repaint their rooms. If you are living in a rental unit, use double-sided mounting tape, stick-on mounting hooks, or poster putty/tack instead.


If you are hanging the wall art above your bed, consider matching it to your bed linens. For example, if your wall art has a white background with blue flowers, consider getting white bed linens with blue flowers on them as well., Nightstands and adjustable lamps can be affixed to walls and are a great way to save space. You can also put some shelves above your bed to store some of your favorite, personal items as well.

, You can use ordinary Christmas lights, or decorative ones. Decorative lights come in all different shapes and sizes, and can be found in shops that sell light fixtures and room décor. They come in all sorts of shapes, sizes, and colors, such as flowers and butterflies.


If your room has white or light-colored walls, choose lights with a white or clear wire. If your room has darker-colored walls, choose lights with a clear wire.

, To get that luxurious, hotel-like feel, plan on having two to six pillows on your bed. Place the larger pillows towards the back, and the smaller pillows towards the front. Don't be afraid to mix and match different colors and patterns.Here are some more ideas to get you started:Mix large, bold prints with smaller, more intricate ones.
Combine organic prints with geometric prints.
Use contrasting colors. For example, you could get a pillow with a bright green pattern and a plain white pillow.
For accent pillows, consider using something with a textured fabric or an irregular shape. For example, you could get a velvet round pillow or a brocade tube pillow.

, Top your bed with covers made for snuggling like a down comforter.


For an added touch of luxury, consider getting a comforter with a duvet cover instead of a plain old bed sheet.

, Try to match the curtains to some aspect of your room, such as the rug, pillows, or bed linens. You don't have to go out and buy curtains; saris and shawls can make beautiful, graceful curtains.


If you live in a rental unit, you might already have blinds. See if you can place a curtain rod on top of the blinds.
Consider draping a floral garland or some string lights above your curtains for an added touch.

, Try to get a rug that matches some aspect of your room, such as the bed linens, curtains, or wall color. If the headboard is against a wall, get a rug that extends 18 to 24 inches (45 to 60 centimeters) past all three sides of the bed. The most common rug placement is just in front of the nightstands, with the rug extending past the foot of the bed. If you have a longer rug, consider tucking it under the nightstands instead; this will help ground them better. Here are some common rug sizes and bed sizes:If you have a twin, double, or full sized bed, get a 5 by 8 foot or a 8 by 10 foot rug.
If you have a queen or king sized bed, get a 8 by 10 foot or 9 by 12 foot rug.
If your room already has a carpet, consider placing a small rug on one side of the bed. Sheepskin rugs are great for this.

, Soft overhead lighting or a clip-on overhead lamp is a great way to accomplish this. You can also use tall, standing lamps in corners, or desk lamps on dressers. Fairy lights and string lights are a great way of adding some design and movement to your walls while making things a bit brighter.

, You can choose scented or unscented ones. If you own pets, or are hesitant about having open flame in your room, consider getting some battery-operated candles instead. Some of them come scented and even flicker, just like real candles.


Consider switching out candles with the seasons. Use fresh, floral or fruity scents for the spring and summer, and spicy or woodsy scents for the fall and winter.

, You can hang a small mirror above your dresser, or a longer one over the back of your door. Instead of getting a plain mirror, consider getting one with a fancier frame, an unusual shape, or some designs etched onto it.

, Your bed linens, pillows, rugs, and curtains don't have to be the only source of color and pattern in your room.You can easily make a boring, blank wall appear more interesting by getting a lamp with a colorful shade.

, If you want a nice, clean look to your room, but don't want to go mundane with stark whites, you can try mixing and matching different shades of the same color. For example, all of your bed linens, pillows, rugs, curtains, and furniture can be different shades of green, such as light, medium, and dark., This can be as simple as an accent wall or a bed, to something as intricate as a fancy headboard or light fixture. If you choose to make your bed the focus of the room, place it in the center of one wall, and decorate it with pillows and a blanket.A shelf with a collection of things you like can make a great focal piece. Try not to overcrowd the shelf, however, and consider layering items by placing smaller items in front of larger ones.

, This will make your bed space appear more luxurious and comfortable. Try to include a lamp, a clock, and some flowers, either in a pot or vase. If you like to read, consider having a stack of books. If you tend to get thirsty at night, have a glass and a carafe filled with water; this will save you late-night trips to the kitchen for a glass of water.


If you have a large bed set in the center of the wall, consider having one nightstand on each side of the bed. This will help create symmetry and balance.Keep scale in mind. The larger your bed is, the larger nightstand and lamp your will need., If you like to spend a lot of time in your room, you might want to get a comfortable chair to sit in, this way, you will be reserving your bed as just a place to sleep in. To make your sitting nook extra cozy, place it in the corner of the room.


You can use an armchair, a small sofa, or even a beanbag chair."

",How to Make a Teepee Bed Nook," You may want to design a teepee to cover your bed or a teepee in a small corner of the room. If you create the tepee over your bed, be aware that it'll make changing the bedclothes a lot more difficult. Also, for a larger or king sized bed, building a teepee may be not only difficult but it could end up looking overwhelming.


Consider a smaller hideaway in your room or another cozy room in the house. Choose somewhere you can curl up with a good book and relax generally without distractions such as the TV or games consoles in the same area.
Evaluate the room size to determine the best teepee placement. Depending on the size of the chosen room, you may want to build your nook near a warm part of the room such as a sunny window (but not too close to any open fire) or in a corner near your bed. Think of where it will feel most Zen to place the nook in this room.;
, Before gathering your supplies, you’ll need to have a good idea of the amount of room you have for your bedroom teepee. Measure the height of the room first, as you’ll need to use tall, ascending support poles while ensuring that the poles that will fit properly in the room. The support poles should fit in proportion to the room but not overpower it either––it's suggested that you leave some space between the top of the poles and the ceiling, to avoid a sense of it being too large.


Determine how much fabric you’ll need. You will be wrapping the strategically placed support poles in a circular fashion and then wrapping the fabric around, starting from the top. Once you have a good idea as to how large you want your teepee, determine how much fabric you’ll need based on that size. For best results, overestimate the amount of fabric––you can always reduce the size if you have too much. When choosing fabric, consider whether you want it to be opaque or translucent, light or heavy, depending on the atmosphere you want to create and how much pressure the fabric will place on the poles.






Decide how many support poles you’ll need. This is based on the size of your room and/or bed. Larger rooms may require eight poles or more, whereas for a smaller bed (such as a toddler bed) you may only need three.







, The types of support poles depend mostly on your individual taste and overall room design, as well as using support poles that have adequate strength. Bring your measurements to the store so you can either purchase the support poles in the right size or have them cut to size. Some ideas for appropriate nook support poles include:


Rough branch-like poles. Simply go into nature and select actual tree branches. Of course, if you choose this method, they'll need to be thoroughly cleaned and varnished prior to use. Or you can see what the local craft store or a local craftsman offers.






Modern metal poles. Chrome or metal poles wrapped with a soft fabric flush may create a cool modern, yet comfortable appeal. You could even reuse tent poles or similar that are no longer useful for anything else––think recycle and make poles from anything useful about the house.






Wooden poles. The local hardware store can furnish you with a variety of wooden pole sizes and shapes. You can use them in their naked form or paint a color(s) that will complement the bedroom. Bamboo poles are a fairly typical kind of wooden pole available from garden stores and similar places.







, Before assembling the teepee, there are a few important things to ensure that the support poles are in good shape:


Check the poles for dirt, blemishes, stains, insects, webs, etc. and do your best to clean them up. Some stains may simply end up being part of the charm of the final look, so don't worry too much if a stain won't budge––the most important thing is to ensure that the poles are hygienic for your bedroom space.






If sanding is needed to avoid catching the fabric, do so now.






Place small rubber stoppers on the bottom of each support so it adheres to the floor. Even though the teepee will be secured from the top you won’t want the bottom to slip and bring the entire teepee down. The rubber stoppers should help to keep everything in place.







, You may need to ask a friend to help you create the teepee as it will require you to assemble the structure and secure it in place at the same time, something that's a bit tricky to do on your own. Ask your friend to stand on a ladder to receive the poles, then build the tepee nook as follows:


Hand one pole end to your friend from the opposite side of the tepee area.






Work your way around the area with the poles. Place the next pole on the opposite side of the area. Have your friend hold the top in place along with the other pole.






Tie the first two supports in place. In order to secure the poles, have your friend wind the string around the top of the poles. Leave a few inches (centimeters) above the tied string area.






Place the next few poles, working across opposite angles. Tie every two poles until you have all the poles in place, teepee style.

, Make sure that the top is securely bound to prevent any of the poles from slipping out. Test the strength of the structure by pushing it a little and moving in and out between it, as you'll be doing when going in and out of it. If it wobbles any, secure it some more or consider reassembling the poles if it's clear that the tepee structure hasn't formed very securely; don't skip this step or the structure risks coming down on your head!

, Using the fabric that enhances and complements your room, drape it over the tepee. Place the top portion of the fabric around the binding used for keeping the poles together––don't place the fabric over the top of the poles. The fabric should sit as high as possible while still allowing for the tops of the poles above the binding to peek out, as with a real teepee structure.


For successful draping, try this method: Place fabric around the teepee from the middle of the sheet. Drape the fabric as though you are wrapping someone with a towel.






For the best stability, consider using a staple gun or wire to attach the fabric to the top of the teepee structure, then add binding simply for decorative effect.






Allow the fabric to drape toward the front and hang down.







, Depending on the amount of fabric flapping over the entryway, you’ll need to fold back the “door” and secure using either a permanent or temporary method.


If you want to keep the opening closed, you won’t need to secure the opening.






If you want to keep a flap opened, there are several ways you can secure the door.






Create a door that can be opened and closed. One way to allow for the door to remain open but also be closed is to either use double stick Velcro tape or you can add a button and button hole to secure the door. Map out the place for which area of the fabric you want opened and where you’d like to be placed.






Design a door that can be permanently kept open. If you want to keep the door open permanently, you can simply sew the flap to the side of the teepee using a thread that is the same color of the fabric.







, If you're creating a bed nook over a specific area rather than over a bed, then fill it with soft items such as a floor rug topped with pillows, cushions, throw rugs, a floor mat, etc. to make it an enticing place to crawl into and read, etc. If it's over your bed, then simply use the bed as the comfortable innards of the teepee.


A small table for placing drinks is a nice addition. A reading lamp is a good idea––look for lamps that have a clip, as this can be moved around the teepee with ease.

Clear everything out of your room.,
Use tatami mats for flooring.,
Paint the walls in an earth tone: white, beige, yellow, or brown.,
Replace your current doors with a Japanese-inspired sliding door.,
Leave the windows uncovered.",How to Create a Japanese Themed Bedroom1," Take out all the furniture, even the window decorations. Take down everything on the walls. Vacuum and/or mop the floors. You want to start this project with as clean and empty a room as possible.;
, Put tatami mats, which are woven straw mats, over the current flooring in your bedroom. Purchase them online or at a furniture store near you. Before you buy them, measure your room to see how many you need and of what size. Typically, they are about 3 feet by 6 feet.Tatami mats will complement almost any kind of flooring, but they look especially good with wood floors and earth tones. If you have a bright carpet or another type of floor that does not match tatami mats, consider replacing your floor.
If you cannot afford to put tatami mats in your entire room, put them in pertinent places in the room, such as near the bed or in a seating area., Choose a color for the walls that is warm and relaxing. The wall color should be simple, not distracting. If you so choose, consider adding a bamboo accent wall. You can later accent them with bright splashes of color, such as red, gold, or pink. The goal is to create a soothing ambiance, almost like the feeling one gets from viewing nature., If the architecture of your room allows, take out your current door. Japanese-inspired sliding doors typically have wood frames covered with either paper (so that they are opaque) or glass (either frosted or clear).If you cannot accomodate a sliding door, choose a Japanese-inspired swinging door.

, Natural light is important for the style of the room. Try to leave the windows completely without ornamentation or cover, if you can. If you need to cover the windows, use silk curtains in warm, neutral colors or rice paper or bamboo blinds."

Balance the shapes of your accessories.,
Coordinate the colors.,
Get creative with space.,
Decorate the surrounding wall space.",How to Accessorize a Nightstand1," Strike a balance between geometric and organic shapes. If you plan on stacking a few rectangular books on a square nightstand, try offsetting them with a circular alarm clock and curvy lamp base. You could place the books at either end of the surface and put the lamp and clock in the center as the focal points., Keep most of the colors on your nightstand within the same family as the bedding. Vary the color tones to keep the arrangement interesting. For example, if the dominant color in your quilt is red, you could choose a maroon lamp or bouquet of pink roses for your nightstand accessories.

Color coordination includes contrasting hues, too! If you have a variety of reds on your bed and nightstand, try adding a green alarm clock or picture frame., Think of space as a complementary element to the objects on your nightstand. This will allow you to keep the number of objects to a minimum. Place two or three objects in the center, leaving the surrounding space open. Alternatively, you could put some space in between the objects.

Don't limit your notion of space to horizontality. If you don't have much space by your bedside, try going vertical by using a bookshelf as a nightstand. You could place your alarm clock and reading material on the shelf closest to the bed. Lesser used accessories can go on higher or lower shelves., Include the wall space above your nightstand in your accessorizing. Hang a painting or print at a point that's neither too high nor too low. If you have a small bedroom, install a mirror to create the illusion of added space. If you use your phone as an alarm clock, hang an analogue or digital wall clock in this space."

Opt for furniture made of natural wood.,
Buy a bed frame that is low to the ground.,
Buy new furniture, if necessary.,
Consider a seating area.",How to Create a Japanese Themed Bedroom2," Your furniture should be simple and close to the ground. Stylistically, it should be modern. Do not clutter your bedroom with furniture., Go to a furniture store and find a bed frame that sits as close to the floor as possible. Dark colors look especially good here. If you do not want to buy a new bed frame, you can also put your mattress directly on the ground., Depending on the size of your bedroom, the style of your old furniture, and your personal needs, think about including a combination of the following items:


Bedside tables that match your bed and are close to the ground
A set of drawers that is wider than it is tall
A simple table and chair, to be used as a desk
A long, low, simply crafted bench

, If your bedroom has space, think about a buying a long, low, cleanly crafted wooden coffee table and floor pillows in warm, earthy colors (beige, brown, yellow, green, etc.). Many Japanese inspired bedrooms have small seating areas."

Leave space for the furniture to breathe when arranging your room.,
Opt for lots of natural light and simple, low-light lamps.,
Separate your room with partitions.,
Choose one or two striking pieces of artwork.,
Get a plant.",How to Create a Japanese Themed Bedroom3," A common theme in Japanese style is having as little furniture as possible. Choose the amount of furniture that suits the size of your room. Do not put so much furniture into the room that you cannot walk around freely. The room should look minimalist, but not empty.To achieve this balance, choose only the necessary pieces of furniture and do not pack furniture tightly together.Start with the absolute basics and add furniture only if you really need it. Look at pictures of Japanese themed bedrooms online to get a mental image of how much furniture should be in a room.

, Ideally, mostly natural light will illuminate your bedroom in the daytime. Choose lamps in natural colors that give off soft light, rather than harsh light. Another option is to buy Japanese-style paper lanterns, or light fixtures inspired by these lanterns., If you want to divide your room into separate sections or perhaps block a drafty window, use partitions.These usually come in natural colors, bamboo, or rice paper. Be careful of breaking up the flow of a room to make it look smaller, though. You want to maintain the simplicity and sleek design of Japanese bedrooms.


You can also use the partition temporarily, such as when you have guests over or when you’re changing in the daytime. They are useful to have, even if you do not use them as a permanent fixture in your room.

, Select this artwork carefully. It should go with the natural color scheme of the room, perhaps adding in a splash of red or gold. You could put a vase filled with sticks on a table or or hang a Japanese-style screen print.Many Japanese themed rooms also have murals. Find a mural like this online or at an art gallery.

, Japanese design often entails a mixture of interior and exterior elements, as well as inclusion of the natural world indoors. Buy a small plant or tree and place it somewhere prominent in your room.The color green goes well with the Japanese-inspired color scheme of beiges, browns, yellows, and greens.. Don’t feel that you need to get an elaborate orchid. A small plant, such as a bonsai tree, a succulent, or a small fern, will suffice and add a simple natural beauty to the room.

Choose a small lamp for narrow surfaces.,
Install a wall sconce for extra space on the nightstand.,
Pick a lamp with a wide base to fill open spaces.,
Balance the height of the lamp with surrounding objects.",How to Accessorize a Nightstand2," A small lamp will leave room for a few accessories on a small nightstand. It will also create a sense of balance with the nightstand's overall surface area. Lamps that are too wide or tall could end up dwarfing a small space and leave little to no room for accessories., This is especially helpful if you have limited space and lots of necessities that you must have on the nightstand. A wall sconce will free up space for your alarm clock, reading glasses, book, watch, and other objects. It will also allow you to add some decorative accessories around the things you need within reach when you wake up or turn in for the night., This is a good idea if you're a minimalist but don't want your nightstand to look too Spartan. This will allow you to add a small number of accessories without cluttering the surface. It will also nicely complement a wide or large nightstand., If you already have a unique artwork on the wall above the nightstand, you don't want to obscure it with a tall lamp. Aim for a shorter lamp whose light hits the bottom two-thirds of the painting. On the other hand, if you have a tall sculpture or flower vase that you'd rather not move, you should opt for a tall lamp for a balanced sense of height."
"
Place a framed picture within eyeshot.,
Add a candle to the mix.,
Use hardcover books as decorative elements.,
Place a sculpture in the arrangement.,
Set a tray for your jewelry or reading glasses within reach.,
Add a bouquet of flowers or basket of shells.",How to Accessorize a Nightstand3," Put a framed photograph in your line of sight. Choose whatever subject makes you happy. This could be anything from a family photo to an abstract print with a pleasing color scheme., Candles can provide less intense light if you want to relax or have a romantic evening. Scented candles can add a pleasant aroma to the area around the nightstand and bed. On the other hand, you can also use candles simply for their color, line, and shape to complement the overall composition of the nightstand., These could be books that you're currently reading. However, you could also use old exhibition catalogues or coffee table books. Stack two or three with the largest book at the bottom and the smallest one on top. Use them as bases for lamps and other accessories, as focal points, or as balancing elements.You could get really creative and use books as the base of the nightstand. Secure the stack and place a sheet of glass or wooden board on top as the table surface., Choose a small- to medium-sized sculpture to avoid taking up too much space. Keep its style in line with or complementary to the rest of the décor in the room. For example, if your bedroom is dominated by antiques and subdued colors, a bright or abstract sculpture might clash. On the other hand, an organic-shaped sculpture might provide a nice contrast to a rectangular nightstand or alarm clock., A tray adds an artistic accent and prevents clutter caused by your watch and other accessories you need to wear during your waking hours. Choose a round or oval tray to compliment the straight geometric lines of nearby books. Opt for something more rectangular to balance an organic-shaped lamp base or oval mirror., These organic objects will help to offset the geometric shapes and straight lines of books and rectangular picture frames. They will also bring the outdoors into the home, adding a natural accent to the décor. Choose colors that will either complement or fall in line with the bedding and other nightstand accessories."

Add colorful throw pillows to your bed. You can easily move them to a chair or a dresser at night before you go to sleep.

,, Disturbing themes and harsh colors are not calming.

, Paints with soft pale hues are considered to create a more restful and sleep-inducing ambiance.

, Replace harsh, bright light bulbs with soft, low-wattage bulbs. Replace broken, torn or shabby lampshades with fresh new lampshades.

,, If your bedroom has old carpeting and new flooring material is not in your budget, try adding a few throw rugs to breathe new life into your worn carpeting.

, Experiment with various heights, colors and textures. For example, pair a tall sculpture with a round woven basket placed on a crocheted runner, or put a few books next to a vase of flowers.

Work out your layout.,
Consider the shape of the room as to your purposes.,
Ensure there is access to water and drains in this room if you intend to make an indoor greenhouse.,
Aim to ensure that your space is attractive but also hygienic if you want to have many plants.,
Remove any existing benches made of woods (sealed & polished hardwoods are OK however) and laminates or anything that may possibly harbour fungus.,
If it has a window, this can be a large advantage, but it should have a double glazing to protect from temperature change.,
When the room is empty and is of a suitable well lit and warmed environment, consider on your space and style.

,
Choose rich colours, polished woods, fabrics and brass as other large decorative tropical-zone influenced things you may have.,
If you took over an unused bathroom, then it is useful to upgrade the sink into a smart looking basin for cleaning use as it won't detract from the rest of the room.,
Consider how the plants will live.,
Install your plants and potting arrangement, evaluate if it looks good and adjust to suit according to practical and good hygiene needs.

Now its just continued maintenance and enjoyment.

",How to Create a Tropical Area Inside a House," If you already have such a thing as an atrium, space for a greenhouse or an old, preferably large bathroom or kitchen that you don't use, then it's a lot easier. Its not essential if you want just the odd indoor plant. The more space you have, the better it can be.;
, Will you want to work in there, relax in there or just have it as a living enclosed space for display? Renovations may be required, or an enlargement.

, You will also have to install adequately lighting such as UV lamps and a heat regulator if required. Tropical plants in cold climates is an indulgent hobby as most don't like cold conditions.


If you have central heating already installed, then little additional work is needed as most tropical plants ""survive"" in the same cool conditions humans tolerate (around 15-25C - 59 to 77F) but many will not grow well or flower until minimum average temperatures offer at least 30C or 86F or more.

, In practice it should have ""wet area"" surfaces such as sealed tile, stone, metal or sealed plastic surfaces much like a kitchen, bathroom & toilet or laundry.


The reason is that densely planted indoor plants are infamous for pests and fungus problems as it offers ideal conditions. Regular hygiene such as mopping down the floors, scrubbing the walls and bench tops is recommended. Tiled surfaces makes this much easier.

, Any exposed plaster or brick surface should be sealed with a waterproof sealer if inside.

, Likewise an extraction fan can be useful, providing you can close it off to prevent heat loss. There are some fans with petal-like blades that open when turned on and close when turned off.


Airflow is essential as still environments are perfect conditions for mildew and weak brittle stems. Plants need wind to grow stronger, but not too much to dry them out or blow them over. A pedestal fan can be useful for a few minutes per day, or if you are lucky to have warm, humid conditions, open the windows often when there is a breeze.

,, Areas with weak or ""white"" natural light could also add filters to the window to give a more golden colour if the electric lighting does not cover this need. White light can make the place feel a little ""washed out"" like a faded photograph.


The usual recommendation for conservative displays is benches around the wall space and if suitable space exist, a bench in the centre for prime displays, or potting and pruning area. This is suitable for orchids, bonsai, small cordylines and other small flowering plants and cacti.
If you appreciate small Palms, hibiscus or other large shrubs, then ideally these should be at the back or the middle of a round display and smaller plants can be placed at the front.
If you appreciate larger palms, tree ferns or cycads, these can take up a lot of space, so would require a space with a 1.5 meter (4.9 ft) diameter (for young cycads this is generous, for mature cycads, this is conservative. The same applies for tree ferns. It is usual that these types are in the centre of the room in order to set their fronds out evenly.

, It may also serve as a possible water feature with modifications.


If you want to keep a messy work area, then invest in a tall bamboo screen to hide it.
Also invest in a small area for quarantine needs. Although this does not have to be inside the house it still needs a warm environment. Large plastic storage boxes can be acquired cheaply and work well, or a large rack with a clear vinyl-plastic zip up cover. Remove and destroy all infected foliage, don't compost it in your garden outside.

, Are you using a large trough or half-barrel style planter boxes or individual pots of small and large size?


Individual pots have the advantage that they can be turned for better access to light and can be changed to make a good display as your tastes dictate as well as easier to quarantine a plant. Other advantages is there is a wide range of styles of pots to choose from. The dis-advantage is that it can be expensive to have many pots and more maintenance watering each one.
Trough or planter boxes have the advantage that they are a large garden in one and that a large soil volume gives more freedom for plants to grow and store nutrients. However it can be harder to transplant out of these plants as the roots may weave with other plants, one infection means its likely the whole planter box is at risk (if not already exposed). They are better if you wanted to grow tropical herbs and vegetables however.
For watering, it is sometimes recommended to water just the root ball and avoid wetting the leaves on which mildew can grow. This can however make the leaves have unsightly dried edges. It is often easier to mist regularly or wipe gently with a moist clean sponge which also removes dust. Test the soil using your finger, if it feels moist, it does not require extra water.
Beware of salt buildup as fertilizer contain a lot of mineral salts. You may see a crystalline substance on the sides of pots where dissolved fertiliser has dried. If it is noticeable, then there is an excess. It might not be a large problem, simply cease adding fertilizers. If it is excessive so the plant suffers, replacing the soil, or soaking the pot and soil in several water changes to leach it out are good solutions.
Avoid splashing dirt onto the leaves or stem as this encourages the potential problems. A layer of mulch such as fine gravel can prevent this from happening, but will eventually mix into the soil if it is disturbed often.

Take down or change curtains.,
Install more light fixtures.,
Use light to accent dark areas of the room.,
Use lightbulbs that give off white light.",How to Brighten a Room After Painting It Too Dark1," Your first step after painting should be to evaluate the curtains and blinds you have in the room. Curtains, blinds, and other window treatments have the effect of darkening a room. By making small changes, you’ll bring more light into your dark room.


Remove fabric valances to allow more light in.
Take down curtains if they’re limiting the light that can come in.
Replace dark colored blinds with light colored blinds.
Keep your curtains or blinds open to allow a lot of natural light to enter the room.;
, The simplest way to brighten a dark room is by installing more light fixtures. Placed appropriately, your light fixtures will temper your dark paint and help you create an airy feel.


Have an electrician install recessed lighting, if you want.
Use desk or table lamps to add more light.
Add free standing lights to the darkest areas of your room., If you have a part of the room that is particularly dark, like an accent wall, you can focus your light there. This will temper the darkness of that part of the room.


Place a free-standing light near an accent wall.
If you have “eyeball” recessed lighting, point it toward the dark area of the room., Another way to brighten a room is to control the type of light your light fixtures give off. While traditional incandescent lightbulbs give off a yellow or goldish light, other types of lights spread a brighter and whiter light.


Use LED light bulbs.
Pick incandescent or other lights that are labeled “white” or “bright.”
Choose the brightest bulbs your fixture can safely handle. For example, if the fixture can take a 100- watt bulb, don’t use a 60-watt bulb in it."

Find a focal point for your patio.,
Measure the area you will use for your furniture.,
Decide how you will use the area.",How to Arrange Patio Furniture1," This can be your deck, a garden, or stone fireplace. This will be where you place your furniture.;
, This will ensure you get the right size furniture for the space you have.

, Will it be for relaxing, eating, or entertaining? This will help determine the kind of furniture to put in the space.

"
Empty the room.,
For most living rooms, select a few large elements and a few small elements.,
Select a center of attention.,
Leave space between the walls and furniture.,
Place your furniture for convenient use.,
Use symmetry to create restful designs.,
Use asymmetry to add excitement.,
Place furniture elements one by one.",How to Arrange Living Room Furniture1," Remove all your furniture using a furniture dolly or assistants. This will give you a better idea of the room's shape without the existing arrangement influencing your judgement.


If you don't have enough storage space, remove as much as you can, then place the remaining items in unobtrusive corners while you plan.;
, Unless you consider your living room extra small, extra large, or an unusual shape, follow these guidelines. A few large pieces of furniture should make up most of the furniture by volume. End tables, ottomans, and similar small items should complement these and provide footrests and drink stands, not obstruct passage through the room or turn a pleasing arrangement into a busy mess.


For instance, a couch, an armchair, and bookcase can outline the usable space and set the color scheme. Two end tables and a small coffee table then serve useful functions and provide smaller objects for more visual interest without taking attention away from the larger pieces.
See the Small Room and Large Room sections for advice on arranging unusually sized spaces. This can also apply if your living room is an odd shape, especially with angled walls that make the space appear too crowded or too spread apart.

, Every room benefits from a center of attention, or focal point, which can be any object or area that attracts the eye and gives you something to orient your other furniture around.Without choosing something to draw attention, the overall design can look messy and unplanned, and there may be awkward spaces that make guests uncomfortable.


The most common focal points are up against one wall, such as a television, fireplace, or set of large windows. Place seating arrangement along the other three sides of the room, at right angles or angled slightly toward the focal point.
If you don't have a focal point, or if you want to encourage more conversation, create a symmetrical arrangement of furniture, with seating on four sides. It is harder to accomplish an appealing design this way, however; consider decorating a bookcase or other tall piece of furniture instead to create visual harmony without distracting guests.

, If all your sofas are pushed back against a wall, the room can seem cold and unwelcoming. Pull the furniture inward on at least two or three sides to create a more intimate area. Follow the guidelines for distance below, but feel free to adjust these if you prefer smaller or larger spaces.Allow 3 ft (1m) wide spaces where people will be walking. If you have energetic kids or household members who require extra space, increase this to 4 ft (1.2m).
If you don't have the space to create walkways on three or four sides of the room, pull the furniture inward just enough place a lamp behind it, either standalone or standing on a narrow table. The light creates the suggestion of additional space.

, Some of this comes down to personal preference, and you can always readjust to match your household's habits. Still, these simple design ""rules"" are a good place to start:


Coffee tables are typically placed 14–18 inches (35–45 cm) from seating. Shorten this distance if your household members have short arms, and lengthen this distance if they have long legs. If you have both types of people in your household, place the seating closer on two opposite ends and further on the third, or vice versa.
Designers place side chairs 48–100 inches (120–250 cm) from the sofa as a default. Just make sure there's enough space to walk between them if you don't have sufficient room.
Television placement varies greatly with size of room, eyesight of viewers, and personal preference. As a rough guide, begin by placing the seating facing the television three times further from the TV as the height of the screen. For instance, a 15-inch (40 cm) tall screen should be positioned 45 inches (120 cm) from the sofa and then adjusted to suit taste.

, Symmetrical arrangements feel orderly and calm, and are great for resting the mind or low key activities. To create a room with bilateral symmetry, imagine drawing a line across the exact center of the floor; the furnishings on one side should be the mirror image of the furnishings on the other.


The most common symmetrical arrangement: a focal point in the center of one wall, a couch directly facing it on the other side, and two chairs or smaller couches on either side of the couch, facing inward. A coffee table and/or end tables complete the space.
You don't need identical furnishings to pull this off. For instance, you can balance an L-shaped couch by placing a low end table on the opposite side of the ""L"" arm. The overall shape is more important than the exactly matching elements.

, If one side of the room is different than the other, whether with completely different furniture or through smaller changes, the room seems exciting and has a sense of motion.This step is optional, but a minor asymmetry can add a nice touch even to a restful room.


Make small changes at first and keep adjusting until you find something you like. It's harder to create an appealing asymmetrical design than a symmetrical one, especially if you try to make it all in one go.
For instance, place a bookshelf against a corner instead of in the center of the wall. If this seems uncomfortable, balance it out with less obvious symmetry, such as one or two small paintings on the opposite side of the wall.
If you don't typically have many people in your living room, try placing seating only on two sides, in an L shape, with the center of attention on a third. The fourth side should contain the main entryway. This uses asymmetry to make it easy to reach the seating.

, Using a furniture dolly or strong assistants, bring your furniture into the room without dragging it. Start with the largest, major elements. This helps you get a feel for the room piece by piece, adjusting further elements as you go.


If your design includes new furniture, start by placing the existing or major pieces before buying the smaller ones. You may discover you changed your mind partway through the arrangement.

Arrange the furniture so the room seems open and airy.,
Swap dark furniture for light furniture.,
Remove some furniture.",How to Brighten a Room After Painting It Too Dark2," While it may not seem like much, by simply arranging your furniture a certain way, you’ll be able to create a more open and airy feel in the room. This is important, as furniture has the largest footprint and therefore exerts the most influence on a room’s character.


Move furniture away from a dark accent wall.
Make sure the room is open from the entry way. For example, wherever someone enters the room, they should be able to walk straight into the middle of it, instead of being blocked by a table or couch.
Don’t cluster too many pieces of furniture in one part of the room. For example, avoid placing an arm chair and side table next to a book case., If you have dark furniture in the room, consider switching it out for lighter furniture. The lighter furniture will temper the darkness of the room and create a brighter and more airy feeling.


If you have dark wood furniture, replace it with white or light wood colored furniture.
If you can’t swap furniture, consider changing small things. For example, you may be able to get a lighter couch cover for your couch. You might also consider getting a bright accent pillow for the couch., You may also be able to remove certain pieces of furniture from the room. By doing this, you’ll open the room up and create a more free and flowing feel.


Make sure to focus on dark pieces of furniture, if you can.
Try not to put too many pieces of furniture against your walls. Instead, make sure to keep large sections of wall open.
If you have a dark part of the room, try to keep dark furniture out of it. For example, if there is a part of the room that is not well-lit, don’t put a dark brown chair there."

Remove dark colored accessories.,
Declutter the room.,
Use mirrors or crystals.",How to Brighten a Room After Painting It Too Dark3," Dark accessories have the effect of intensifying and highlighting dark paint. By getting rid of dark colored accessories, you’ll make a step toward brightening the room.


Remove accessories that are darker than your wall color.
If possible, replace dark accessories with lighter ones. For example, if you have a black radio, remove it and use a white or silver one instead.
Use rugs to brighten the room. For example, if you have dark rugs, remove them or replace them with lighter ones. If you have a dark floor, add a light rug to the room., By removing clutter or other objects that fill the room, you’ll create the illusion that the room is larger or more spacious. Ultimately, the room will appear lighter, brighter, and more open.


Make sure you don’t have too many things hanging on your wall. For instance, you shouldn’t group more than 4 or 6 pieces of artwork together. In addition, if your artwork is dark, you should consider removing some of it.
Use file cabinets, bookshelves, desks, drawers, or other organizers to declutter and organize things in the room. For example, if you have a lot of books stacked throughout the room, place them all on a small bookshelf.
If you have an excessive number of decorative pieces, decrease the number.
Clean off coffee tables, other tables, and pieces of furniture of paper and other clutter., Depending on the room, you may be able to put up a few mirrors or crystals to lighten and open the room. They will give the appearance that a room is larger and brighter place than it is.


Crystals will reflect light throughout the room. Consider a crystal vase or a similar accessory.
Mirrors work well in dressing rooms, bedrooms, foyers, and hallways. For example, position a mirror opposite of a window to reflect light throughout the room.
In most cases, you’ll only be able to use one mirror per room.
If you install a framed mirror, make sure the frame is not a dark color."

Paint the ceiling.,
Use a light or bright color on the room's trim.,
Change windows or doors.,
Add an accent wall.",How to Brighten a Room After Painting It Too Dark4," By painting the ceiling bright white, you'll temper the darkness of the walls. Ultimately, painting the ceiling will help complete the transformation you initiated when you painted in the first place.


Use flat white ceiling paint to paint the ceiling.
If the ceiling is painted another color, or is bare wood, make sure to prime it before painting it., By repainting the room's trim a bright color, you'll be able to lighten the room up.


Many people rely on bright white trim paint to lighten up a room.
depending on the color scheme of the room, you may also be able to use bright blues, greens, or other colors.
Trim usually includes the baseboard, door and window framing, chair rails, and crown molding., You may also be able to substantially brighten the room by changing a window or a door. Ultimately, these changes should focus on bringing more light into the room and making the room appear more open and airy.


Replace any foggy windows.
Add a glass door. Clouded glass doors are especially appropriate for master bathrooms., One of the easiest ways to brighten a room is with an accent wall. By changing just one of the four walls in a room, you'll add new character and temper the darkness of the other walls.


Consider repainting one wall a lighter color. For instance, this could work well on a wall with windows or with a door.
Think about using wallpaper to brighten one wall or a section of wall. For instance, if you have a recessed area in a parlor, foyer, or entertaining area, you could wallpaper it to add some brightness."

Use less intense, neutral colors.",How to Arrange Living Room Furniture2," If you don't have the living room space to fit all the furniture you'd like, use multipurpose furniture so you can quickly alter the room when entertaining guests or whenever you'd like a change.Consider a multi part sofa that can be divided into two pieces or extended to create a foot rest.
Consolidate by having one object serve two purposes. Try moving the seating slightly to create a corner where one end table can serve two sofas, instead of having one end table for each.

, Lightweight chairs can easily be brought in when you have a large number of guests, without permanently taking up space.


Keeping a small couch or a couple of armchairs adds variety and comfort, but if you don't rely solely on cushioned, bulky furniture, you'll have more space.

, If some furniture is much taller than others, it can make the space appear cramped and claustrophobic.Stack books onto short end tables to raise their height without needing to replace them.

, Use lighter or more transparent curtains to make the space brighter. If you don't have windows that let in much light, adding more artificial light is an acceptable compromise, especially cheerier white lamps rather than yellow lighting.

, Sometimes the illusion of space is plenty to give a room an airy feeling. This is especially useful during times of low sunlight or when your living room has inadequate windows.

, Glass topped tables, glass doors, or open doorways make a room more spacious. Furniture with thinner bodies on raised legs reveal more space to the eye., Soft colors such as a cool blue or neutral beige make the space feel warmer and airier.Avoid dark or intense shades.


Cushions, drop cloths, and decorative objects can be more easily and cheaply replaced than furniture or walls, so begin by adjusting these.

Use large wall art or multiple smaller pieces.,
Add tall house plants to fill corners and bare areas.,
Place accessories on tables.,
Paint or decorate the walls and ceiling.",How to Arrange Living Room Furniture3," To make a large living room more livable and less intimidating, create two or more distinct sections. Backless or low-backed sofas, especially L-shaped ones, are excellent for dividing a room without blocking line of sight or creating odd, tall distractions in the center of the space.Dividing a large rectangular space into two squares often improves its appearance, as square spaces are almost always more appealing to the eye.
You can use one or more sections for other purposes as though they weren't part of your living room, although the overall color scheme should match.

, An extra large ottoman is better than a coffee table for making a large space between couches or chairs feel cozy. A small couch will feel out of place in a large room, so replace a larger one or buy a second matching one and angle them slightly toward each other to form one side of your furniture arrangement.

, If all your paintings or wall hangings are small, place them in groups to make a large, pleasing arrangement that fills visual space.Tapestries tend to be larger and cheaper than paintings.

, An indoor potted plant you're willing to care for can add color and visual interest where there used to be empty space.

, Decorative figurines, sculptures, or ceramics draw attention to a smaller scale. Don't clutter the table so much it becomes unusable, however; one to four pieces on each one is sufficient.

, If you're interested in a complete redesign, using rich colors, wainscoting, or multiple colors to make the space less bare. Drawing attention to the walls makes your guests feel encompassed by the space in an intimate environment.

Measure the dimensions of your room and doorways.,
Measure the dimensions of your furniture.,
Draw a scale outline of your living room on graph paper.,
Cut out paper models of your furniture to the same scale.,
Try out different arrangements on your paper map.",How to Arrange Living Room Furniture4," Using a tape measure and notepad, record the length and width of the room, including the dimensions of each wall if the space is not rectangular. Measure the width of each doorway or other entrance to the room, as well as the distance each door extends into the room when open.


If you do not have a tape measure, use a ruler to measure your foot from heel to toe, then walk heel-to-toe along each wall, multiplying the number of foot lengths by the measurement of your foot.Measuring your ordinary stride length and walking normally will provide a quick but less accurate number.
If you plan to use the wall space for items such as large paintings or a wall-mounted television, measure the height of the ceiling as well.
You do not need to measure the length of a door that opens away from the room.

, If you are arranging existing furniture, measure the width, length, and height of each one, or the length of each side for non-rectangular furniture such as corner sofas. Record this information carefully so you don't get the height confused another dimension.


If you plan to purchase new furniture, read Selecting New Furniture, then return to this section.

, Refer to your measurements to create a map of your living room. Use your measurements to make it proportional: if the room's measurement is 40 x 80 (in any unit), you could make your map 40 squares by 80 squares, or 20 x 40, or 10 x 20. Choose the largest scale that will fit on your graph paper.


Include a semicircle for each door that opens into the room, showing how much room it takes up as it opens.
The easiest useful scale to remember is 1 graph paper square = 1 foot, or 1 square = 0.5 meters if you are used to the metric system.
Write your scale (e.g. ""1 square = 1 foot"") outside your map on the same sheet of paper so you don't forget it.
If your room has a wall that isn't at right angles, draw the two walls that connect to it, mark the two points where that angled wall hits the other two, then draw a straight line between them.
If your room has a curved wall, you may need to sketch in a rough estimate of its shape after mapping its end points.

, Refer back to your earlier measurements and cut out two dimensional outlines of your furniture. Use the same scale you chose for your graph paper map.


If you are considering buying new furniture, play around with paper models of different sizes and shapes to try out a variety of possibilities.
If you'd like a rough idea of color scheme, cut each one out of fabric similar to that piece of furniture's appearance, or color the paper with markers.
Represent wall hangings, flat screen televisions, or fireplaces with rectangles 0.5 to 1 square wide placed over the wall of the map.

, Remember not to block the path of the doors. For each arrangement that you like, plan out how people would walk across the room through each pair of doorways, as well as how they would reach the couch, bookcase, or other functional furniture items. Make adjustments or reduce to smaller or fewer furniture items if these routes seem circuitous or narrow.


People typically require 3–4 ft (1–1.2m) for a comfortable walkway.

Choose plants you can pack in tightly.,
Arrange plants based on height.,
Mix and match different plant textures and sizes.,
Avoid overwatering your window box plants.,
Prune your plants periodically.,
Cover your plants in case of frost.,
Replace the potting soil each year.",How to Arrange a Window Box," You can either plant directly in the window box, or you can place potted plants inside the window box and fill the empty space around the pots with a filler material like moss or bark. Choose which option you like the best.If you plant directly in the window box, it will be harder to change things out when you want to or as the seasons change. Putting potted plants directly in the window box gives you more flexibility, but they may not grow quite as well.
Make sure your pots have small holes in the bottom – not big enough for the soil to fall out, but large enough to provide drain access for excess water.;
, Go to your local gardening store and choose a high quality potting mix for your window box. It may include peat moss, pine bark, or even a bit of fertilizer.And remember that potting mix is different than potting soil. Potting soil is intended for use in flowerbeds, while potting mix is made for planters and pots.
For window boxes, you should avoid using garden loam. This is because loam packs down more firmly over time and the window box plants won’t be able to grow their roots through it.

, If your window box is in a place that gets a lot of direct sunlight, you may want to consider adding a few water storing crystals to the soil. These crystals retain water longer than the soil does, so they help keep your plants hydrated.You should be able to purchase water storing crystals at any gardening or home improvement store.
You might also want to consider adding some water retaining crystals if you think you might occasionally forget to water your plants or if you travel often and are away from home.
When considering your plants’ water needs, you’ll also need to think about the location of the box and whether you’ll be able to reach it easily.
You should also make sure that your window box has the proper holes in the bottom for drainage.

, Different plants need different amounts of sunlight in order to survive. Think about the placement of your window box and consider how many hours of sunlight per day the plants will receive in this location. Choose plants that fit with this scenario.


Some plants that tolerate a lot of sun well include rosemary, lavender, daylilies, hibiscus, petunias, and geraniums.Some plants that will handle mostly shade well include creeping fig, maidenhair ferns, devil’s ivy, spider plants, and peace lilies., When arranging your window box, you should have a color scheme in mind so that the window box fits in with the rest of your exterior. Choose some leafy green plants and add some flowering plants too.Try to choose colors that match with your existing décor. Or, if the façade of your home is rather plain, choose some colorful flowers to add a nice pop of color.

, You don’t want your window box to look lopsided or haphazardly thrown together. Try to organize the plants in such a way that they look somewhat symmetrical in the window box. Include a variety of leafy plants and flowering plants on each side, not just each concentrated in one area.Try to get plants that will overlap each other slightly so there are no big holes in the organization of the window box.

, Remember that the key to a full, healthy looking window box is to include a lot of plants. Some plants may do poorly if they are overcrowded in a small window box space, so choose plants that are known to flourish in packed situations.Some good plants to choose for a packed window box include ferns, tuberous-rooted begonias, fuchsias, ageratums, geraniums, caladiums, and coleus.
You can also choose plants that seem to produce a “fluffy” growth, which will look more packed than it actually is like ferns, dracaena, frosted curls, and summer snapdragon. This will help your window box look more packed than it actually is.
Including quite a few plants will always look better than a sparse, underplanted window box., When deciding which plants to include in your window box, you should also think about the expected heights of the plants and how those plants will look together as a whole in the box. You might want to put a taller plant on one side with a draping vining plant on the other side to even it out. Play around with the combinations and decide what you think looks the best.Remember that hanging plants or plants with vines that drape down over the edge of the box can add dimension and an element of drama to your window box.
Very tall plants might not belong in your window box, depending on the location. They might also block the view of the windows.

, A window box full of very similar plants might end up looking a bit boring. Try mixing it up by adding a variety of textures and sizes of plants.You might choose one plant with beautiful colorful blooms, one with wide-spanning leaves, and one with a trailing vine. Or include some spikey succulents with some fluffy-leafed plants.

, You’ll want the soil in the window box to stay slightly damp at all times. But you don’t want to overwater it and drown the plants. You also don’t want the soil to get too dry. Check the soil in your window box every day to make sure it stays slightly moist to the touch.You will probably need to water it once every two or three days, depending on the types of plants you chose and their specific water needs.

, In order to maintain the beauty of your window box arrangement, you’ll need to perform routine pruning. Use sharp shears to make clean cuts on the plants close to the stem. Prune your plants just after they finish flowering or right before a new period of growth.Focus on discarding any dead or unattractive portions of the plant first. Then think about the overall look and appearance of the plant to make strategic pruning decisions.
For example, if one plant is growing much more quickly than the plant next to it and it is really overtaking the slower plant, you might want to prune it back a bit so the slower plant still has a chance to shine in the window box.

, Nothing kills outdoor plants quicker than an unexpected frost. If you hear that the ground will freeze overnight, take a moment to cover the plants in your window box. You can use a piece of plastic to cover the plants.This will help keep your plants warm and give them a better chance of surviving the cold winter weather.

, Since the window box is small, it might be a good idea to replace the potting soil each year to help replenish the nutrients for the plants. You don’t have to fully remove and replant each plant. But just carefully shovel out most of the loose soil and replace it with fresh, new potting mix.Be careful not to damage any of the plant roots during this process.

Begin with clean countertops.,
Cover any areas you don't want painted.,
Apply a bonding primer.,
Paint the countertops.,
Seal the paint.",How to Paint Countertops," It is not a good idea to start your painting project on a surface that hasn't been thoroughly cleaned, and kitchen countertops can have years of builder on them, especially the surfaces nearest the stove.


Use an ammonia-based cleaning solution to scrub the laminate and/or ceramic tile countertops free of all dirt, grime, oil and grease. Allow the surface to dry completely.;
, Using painter's tape, cover any trim, walls or cabinets that might get dripped on or accidentally painted, and protect your floors with a drop cloth. Expending the effort on this preparation will save you a lot of time and aggravation on touch-ups and cleanups after you refinish the countertops.

, Prepare the countertops with a good quality bonding primer that will improve paint adhesion, allowing the primer to dry for at least 24 hours before beginning to paint.


Ask the professionals at your home improvement store for suggestions on the best brands.

, Using the color you selected, you can start to paint the countertops now that the bonding primer is completely dry. Avoid applying the paint too thickly and paint 2 or 3 thin coats instead, allowing each coat to dry between applications.


For laminate countertops, use a water-based paint. For tile countertops, use an oil-based paint.

, In order to protect your painting project from chipping or scratching, use a water-based, non-yellowing polyurethane finish. Apply 3 coats of polyurethane, each coat drying before you apply the next. After the third coat has dried, wait an additional 24 hours before using your newly painted countertops.

Browse design blogs and magazines for inspiration.,
Create a notebook to store your inspiration ideas.,
Work your new design ideas around your existing décor.,
Introduce new pieces into your space gradually.,
Alter and improve your home décor as needed.",How to Be Your Own Home Decorator," Fortunately, interior design inspiration is abundant. Pick up a few interior decorating magazines at the store and browse through some design blogs online. Bookmark, dog-ear, and save photos that appeal to you, whether they depict entire rooms or simply a single furnishing or piece of artwork.


Another source of inspiration is TV programming that focuses on interior design. The only drawback to this type of inspiration is that you cannot easily save photos drawn from it for later use.;
, A great way to begin bridging the daunting gap between finding inspiring photos online and decorating your own home is by creating an inspiration notebook. Print appealing photos from design blogs and clip pictures out of magazines. Use paperclips or paste to secure these pictures into a notebook.

, Redecorating your home entirely from scratch is not generally feasible. The first important step when accommodating your existing décor is deciding which pieces to keep. Keeping large, basic pieces like sofas and tables will save you money, and their appearance can be changed dramatically through the use of accessories like throw pillows.


Furniture and décor in neutral colors can be accommodated in nearly any design scheme. Even a drab beige sofa can be livened up with brightly colored pillows. When a major piece like a sofa is brightly colored itself, this tends to constrain your design possibilities more.
Use your redecorating ambitions as an excuse to discard or give away any décor that you are tired of or don't like. Keeping too many of your old furnishings will hamper your ability to create a new space anyway.

, Avoid buying whole rooms full of décor at once; if you decide you don't like it, you'll have a tedious returns process on your hands. Rather, look to your inspiration notebook for some of your favorite pieces or motifs. Search for similar pieces online or at home décor stores, and begin introducing them into your room. As you work, decide what does and doesn't suit your taste, and which pieces work with your existing elements.


During this process of introducing new décor, you'll need to decide on a clear direction in which to take your style. Is it traditional or modern, subdued or lively, matching or eclectic, casual or formal, sparse or cluttered? When purchasing new pieces, ask yourself not only if you like them by themselves, but also if they'll fit well into your design scheme.
Work one room at a time. Note that each room of your home does not have to follow the same exact template; some rooms can be more formal than others or more sparsely decorated. However, you do want to consider some overarching theme that makes your entire home cohesive.

, Home decorating is best seen as something dynamic and fluid rather than something static. Even when you've completed your decorating, keep an eye out for new pieces and patterns that can be swapped out for stale ones in your home. As your tastes change, let your design change with them.

You can literally brighten things up by something as simple as changing that old light fixture to a more modern, clear one that lets the light shine through unhindered.

, Swap your existing bulbs for some with higher lumens to intensify the light in your room. LED and CFL bulbs are an excellent choice, since they provide the same quality of lighting you’re used to, but they use very little power. LEDs can last up to 6 times longer than CFLs and 50 times longer than incandescent bulbs., Mirrors are, hands down, the very best accessory you can add to help enhance existing light and make your room appear larger. Light that reflects off of a mirror doubles the light in any room! If possible, hang a large mirror directly across from a window to get the best results.

, Add crystals, rhinestones, and other shiny objects to lamps or vases. Place these on tabletops and bookshelves to bring a bit of light into areas that may otherwise be dull and boring. Add metallic finishes to shelves and frames to help reflect light and brighten up your room."

Painting just one wall can give the entire space a new look.Change old worn out color schemes for new ideas like pairing neutrals with a bright anchor color that ties everything together. Focus on a particular combination and develop your concepts from there. Consider painting your existing furniture a newer, brighter color.

Open your windows. It sounds silly, but fresh air can make any room feel brighter and more cheerful! So raise the shades, open the blinds, and air things out!

, You probably have too much stuff. Sometimes it’s time to do a major purging. Once you get started, it feels great to say goodbye to all that clutter!


Donate it. Give your extra clothing, books, housewares, and toys to a local collection for those in need. Some organizations will even come to your house and pick up donations.Throw it away. Do you really need to save those textbooks from 10 years ago or that half-roll of Christmas paper? Probably not. If no one can use it, just pitch it.

, The old saying is “there is a place for everything,” but you don’t really need a thing for every place!

Read the manufacturer's guidelines for painting your siding.,
Check whether your siding is un-primed (raw) or pre-primed.,
Visit a home improvement store or paint store to get samples of acrylic paint colors for your home.,
Buy an acrylic primer, acrylic paint and either an acrylic or oil-based topcoat.,
Patch any dents in your surface with a hard putty and a putty knife.,
Clean all surfaces of the concrete siding with a low-pressure spray from a hose and a nylon brush.,
Apply your all-weather acrylic primer if the siding is raw or you are repainting.,
Apply 2 coats of your acrylic latex paint to the surface of your siding.,
Apply an acrylic or oil-based topcoat if it is recommended by the manufacturer and/or the paint store.,
Allow the paint to dry thoroughly and then paint the trim of the house as needed.

",How to Paint Concrete Siding," Generally, they recommend that you paint fiber-cement siding within 90 days of installation, so that it adheres properly before being exposed to all weather conditions. Concrete siding differs greatly depending upon the composite mix, so follow these instructions as closely as possible.;
, If it is un-primed, you will need to buy and use a primer over all surfaces of the siding. If it is pre-primed, you can skip this step and go straight to the paint job.

, The manufacturer may recommend certain type of paint. The store may be able to give recommendations as well.

, Bring house and siding measurements to the store where you plan to buy the paint so that they can help you to calculate how much paint, primer and topcoat are needed. The following are good tips for paint shopping:


Flat paint is more likely to gather dust and mildew.
Satin topcoats may look blotchy compared to other finishes.
Paint that contains polyurethane may achieve a more durable and attractive look. It may negate the need for a topcoat as well.

, Some places may need more than 1 coat of putty. Allow the putty to dry thoroughly, according to package specifications, before moving along to the next steps.

, Make sure to remove all dirt from crevices. Allow the house and siding to dry for 2 to 4 days before starting to paint.

, Apply 1 to 2 coats, using paint brushes to ensure you get in all the crevices of the siding. Allow it to dry according to the product's instructions.

, If you started with pre-primed siding, you can go straight to painting after the siding is clean and dry.

, This may depend upon the paint you chose and the climate in your area.

",How to Paint Hardiplank," Unlike similar-sounding silicone caulks, siliconized acrylic caulks can be painted, so they enhance the finished appearance of the paint job. Note: Do not seal the side and bottom edges of the siding unless the manufacturer recommends it.;
, Apply the solution to the affected areas, leave it on for 20 minutes, then rinse it off thoroughly (wear eye and skin protection). If some areas of stubborn mildew remain, go through the same procedure and scrub off the mildew with a long-handled brush.

, Then rinse the surface thoroughly.

, If any old paint still remains that is flaking or showing other signs of poor adhesion, remove it by careful wire-brushing, working in the direction of the simulated wood-grain, if there is any. When doing this work, wear a dust mask, as well as eye and skin protection.

, To help the new paint adhere to the fiber cement siding and to get the most uniform-looking finish on your paint job, the best practice is to apply one coat of a quality exterior latex stain-blocking or masonry primer to all of the siding.

Remove the item if necessary.,
Move the item to a well-ventilated area.,
Scrub the item with steel wool.,
Clean the surface with a degreaser.,
Choose a spray paint in your desired color.,

Apply several thin coats of paint.,
Apply a protective clear coat.,

Maintain your painted brass.",How to Paint Brass," Some brass objects, such as door handles, faucets, and fixtures will be easier to paint if you remove them from where they are. Other objects, like furniture, utensils, and lamps, are already portable.


If you removed any screws, nails, or other hardware, store them in a safe place so you can return the item after it’s painted.
It’s also a good idea to test that your item is in fact brass. To test if something is brass, hold a magnet to it. Brass is a non-ferrous metal, meaning it contains no iron. As such, brass is also not magnetic, so a magnet will not be attracted to a brass object.;
, All paint projects should be done in a well-ventilated area, such as a garage with doors or a room with large windows that open. This will protect you from paint fumes.Place a drop cloth on the ground to protect the surrounding area from paint and splatter. Place the object you want to paint on top of the drop cloth, or on a work table or bench.
Before you start painting, open windows and turn on any vents in the room to help remove paint fumes.
Protect yourself with a mask, gloves, goggles, and other personal safety equipment when painting.

, One of the most important steps in painting brass is the scrubbing that happens beforehand. Not only does this help remove dirt and corrosion, but it also provides the paint with a good surface to stick to. Rub the entire surface with the steel wool, concentrating on areas that are especially corroded or heavily soiled.When you finished scrubbing the item, wipe it down with a damp, lint-free cloth.
Paint needs a rough surface to stick to, which is why you want to scrub it with steel wool. Scrubbing brass with steel wool is not advisable unless you're preparing it for painting.

, Removing oils, dirt, and grease from the surface of the metal before painting is integral. If there is oil, grease, or dirt left on the brass when you paint, the paint won’t adhere properly. Dampen a lint-free cloth with degreaser and wipe down the entire surface you wish to paint. Wipe the item again with a cloth damp with water, and set it aside for about 10 minutes to dry.

Good degreasers for brass include liquid deglosser and solvents like butanone., Pick a paint that is suitable for metal, such as an enamel paint, an acrylic- or oil-based product, or another hard-drying paint. Most paints that are suitable for metal will be spray paints, but some may come in liquid (roll-on) form.

Avoid latex paints for brass, as these don’t adhere as well to metal and aren't as durable.

, The best primer for brass is a self-etching primer. This is a mixture of acid and zinc, and it will adhere better to the brass than any other type of paint or primer. Shake the primer well and hold it six to eight inches (15 to 20 cm) from the surface of the metal. Spray in a sweeping motion, going from side to side, and apply a thin, even coat of primer onto the surface.


Let the primer dry for about 24 hours, or according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Wear all proper safety equipment when using spray paint, including gloves, safety glasses, and a mask.
Even after scrubbing with steel wool, brass still doesn’t have a great surface for painting, which is why self-etching primer is important., Once the primer has had time to dry, apply the paint in the same way. Shake the can, use a sweeping side to side motion, and hold the can six to eight inches (15 to 20 cm) from the surface to apply a thin, even coat.

Let each coat dry completely according to the manufacturer’s instructions (usually an hour or two) before applying a second or third coat.Depending on the effect you're trying to achieve, you may need anywhere between two and five coats of paint.
If your paint came in a liquid form, use a brush or roller to apply thin, even coats.

, Once the paint has had time to fully dry—usually about 24 hours—you can apply a clear top coat to finish the piece. This will help seal the piece, protect the paint, and make the finish shiny. Look for clear coats or enamel coats that are safe for metal.Shake the can and hold it six to eight inches (15 to 20 cm) from the surface. Spray the coat in a back and forth motion to apply an even coat on the metal.
Set the piece aside to dry according to the manufacturer’s instructions. These coats tend to dry quickly, sometimes in as little as 30 minutes.

, After all the paint has dried to the touch, move the piece onto a drying rack. This will allow air to circulate around and under the piece and help it dry more quickly and evenly.

Removing the piece from the position in which it was painted is also important to ensure it doesn’t stick to the drop cloth or work bench.

, Once applied, paint generally has two phases that it goes through, and those are drying and curing. The paint may be dry within 30 minutes, but it still needs time to cure. Once the paint fully cures, it will be set, hard, and less prone to damage or dents.

Depending on the type of paint you used, curing time could take anywhere from three to 30 days. Check the manufacturer’s instructions for specific curing times.Giving the paint time to fully cure is especially important for fixtures, handles, utensils, and other brass pieces that will be handled often.

, Once the paint has dried and cured, you can return the item, reinstall it, or put it back into regular use. Don’t forget to affix the piece properly using all the original screws, nails, and other hardware., The best way to keep your painted brass clean and new is to avoid touching it or banging it against other objects. For certain items, like wall fixtures, it will be easy to avoid contact. However, for things like furniture and door knobs, you can protect the brass and the paint by keeping it clean:Wash the surface with a damp cloth and soapy water.
Rinse the area with a clean, damp cloth.
Towel dry the surface to remove excess water.
Apply a fresh coat of paint as necessary to cover nicks and scratches.

Wear proper safety equipment if working with a power tool or chemical to remove the rust. This may include gloves, goggles and a respirator.;
, The sanding can be done lightly. Gather up and properly discard chipped or peeling paint, which could be lead-based.

, Remove any dirt, dust, stains, or other items such as cobwebs. You may need a brush to clean the cast iron.

, You may need to throw away the clothes after painting the cast iron.

, Use a flat surface or material to collect dripped paint as you work. A table or drop cloth material may be possible options.

, Use the rag to clean your hands while you paint. The spirits can clean your painting tools and thin your paint.

, Choose an oil-based primer. Follow the primer's directions for how many coats you need. Allow time for a coat of primer to dry before applying another if necessary.

, Dip 1/4-inch (0.63 cm) of your paintbrush into the paint at a time. This will help prevent less paint from running and dripping off the brush.


Give the iron 2 coats of paint. Wait 24 hours for the first coat of paint to dry before applying the second one.

Learn how to select a color that complements the room.,
Prepare your closet door for painting.,
Paint your closet door.",How to Paint Closet Doors," By matching the color of your closet door to other room tones, you'll give the room a coordinated feel.


The color wheel: All colors are based on the 3 primary colors: red, yellow and blue. Secondary colors are created by mixing 2 primaries together. (Red and blue make purple. Blue and yellow produce green. Yellow and red make orange.) The 6 tertiaries are created by combining a secondary color with its neighboring primary. The 12 colors make up the standard color wheel.
Monochromatic schemes: Colors from the same family naturally complement each other. Different shades of a single color can make excellent accents when you paint closet doors.
Cool tones: Colors with a blue base are considered ""cool."" These calming tones are often used in bedroom. Colors derived from red are ""warm"" colors. These colors may be better suited for a family-room closet door.
Muted colors: Select subdued tones for bedroom closet doors. This gives the room a soothing quality, making it easier for you to relax. In other rooms, a muted color on a closet door won't detract from the focal point of the room.
Neutral hues: Browns, grays and creams are neutral colors. Generally, the less saturated the intensity of the color, the more neutral it becomes. These colors mix well with others, and can allow you to change the feel of the room with the change in seasons.;
, Certain steps must be taken to make sure your paint job looks professional and lasts.


If possible, take the door off its hinges and set it on 2 sawhorses. This makes painting the top and bottom of the door easier. If you can't remove the door, you can paint it as is.
Gently sand the door with 120-grit paper. This prepares the surface for paint, making it adhere to the door better. Don't completely take off the existing finish.
After you sand the door, wash the door with a diluted detergent solution. Wipe the door down with a damp cloth and let the surface dry thoroughly.
Protect doorknobs or other hardware. Either remove the metal fixtures from the door before you start painting or cover them with painter's masking tape.
Consider using a wet-edge extender additive to latex paint. This keeps the paint from drying too quickly as you work on the different sections of the door.
Determine whether you need to give the door a primer coat. If the door is bare or stained wood, if it currently is a dark color and you want to make it a lighter shade, or it was painted in oil and you want to use a latex paint, you will need to use a primer.

, Most closet doors are flat, and therefore, relatively easy to paint. But some doors, particularly those in walk-in closets, have multiple panels that require a special painting technique. For intricate doors, following a painting pattern can produce high-quality results.


Paint the panels first. Use a small roller to cover most of the panel surfaces. Use a brush to touch up. Be sure to paint along the wood grain. This highlights the grain and gives a cleaner look.
Paint the center, vertical stile of the door that runs between the panels. Use a roller to cover this area quickly. Paint vertically.
Paint the horizontal rails in the middle of the door. Paint these sections horizontally with a roller.
Paint the 2 outside stiles vertically, from top to bottom.
Paint the header and footer panels between the outside stiles and the panels. These sections should be painted horizontally using a brush or roller.
Apply a thin film of paint along the edge of the door with a roller. Spread it evenly using a brush.
Let the door dry completely before adding a second coat.
On flat doors, use a roller to speed the process. Apply paint evenly, taking care to ensure that you don't leave roller lines on the surface.
Paint the other side of the door.

Cover the panels around the wheel with paper so you don’t get paint on the car.

, Calipers are exposed to very high temperatures during braking. Choose a paint that is heat resistant or developed specifically for calipers.Specialty caliper paints can be purchased from auto parts stores.
Purchase a heat tolerant spray paint from your local hardware store.
Make sure the paint is designed for use on metals.

, Spray multiple coats to achieve an even paint job. Do not apply spray paint in thick coats or you will get drips and runs in your paint. Spray smoothly and from different angles to get maximum coverage.








Shake the can and follow the label directions on the paint can.
Spray short bursts, not a continuous stream of paint.
Move the can from side to side as you spray.
Wait 5 minutes between coats of paint.
Spray 3 to 4 coats on the top side of the caliper.

, After applying multiple coats to one side of the caliper, wait for it to dry to the touch before turning it over.









Repeat the painting process on the opposite side of the caliper
Be gentle when turning the caliper so you don’t twist the brake line.
You do not need to paint the inner portion of the caliper as this isn’t seen and may affect the performance of your brakes.

, Depending on the temperature and humidity, the time it takes for your paint to dry may vary. You don’t want to ruin all your hard work, so make sure the paint is completely dry before replacing the caliper.

, This may be a good time replace your brake pads if they are beginning to wear thin.









Use a C-clamp to compress the caliper piston to position the brake pads properly.
Bolt the caliper back in place around the brake rotor. Place the caliper back around the rotor and replace the bolts that you removed to take the caliper off. Make sure the bolts are tight to securely reassemble your brake system.

Important:Take care not to twist or crimp the brake line.

, Place the tire on the bolts attached to the wheel assembly.









Hand tighten the lug nuts onto the bolts.
Use a tire iron or an air gun to tighten the lug nuts.
Tighten the lug nuts in a criss-cross pattern alternating sides rather than in a circular pattern.

, Slowly raise the car about an inch to slide the jack stand out from under the car.









Remove the jack stand.
Lower the car to the ground.
Double check that your lug nuts are securely tightened.

, It may be hard to resist taking your fresh calipers out for a spin, but waiting the added time will ensure that the paint cures to the metal and doesn’t peel off due to the heat of braking., Make sure your brakes are working properly. Enjoy the looks from the people you pass admiring your newly painted calipers.

Measure your dining room.,
Choose a chandelier that will fit comfortably.,
Consider your lighting needs.,
Look at dazzling traditional styles.,
Mount a simple one-piece fixture.,
Incorporate more modern designs.,
Complement the general look of the room.,
Hang the chandelier above the dining table.,
Light up an entryway.,
Adjust the height as needed.,
Offset other light sources.",How to Choose a Chandelier for Your Dining Room," Run a tape measure from wall to wall and from floor to ceiling. The resulting numbers will give you an idea of exactly how much space you have to play around with. Record these dimensions so you can refer to them later when browsing different types of fixtures.Measure the room in feet and the light fixture in inches.
One helpful guideline is to add together the room’s length and width and pick out a fixture with an equivalent measurement in inches; a chandelier for a 20’x25’ dining room should therefore be no larger than 45” in diameter.;
, As you look over your various options, picture how they would look hanging in your home. Overly large fixtures tend to feel cramped in averaged sized dining rooms. A chandelier that’s too small, on the other hand, may be dwarfed by the rest of the room’s furnishings.Since you can’t give chandeliers a tryout, it will help to stick closely to the measurements you took down.
In the end, you may have to eyeball and use your best judgment.

, A single fixture may be all you need to set the mood in a cozy nook. If you’re attempting to brighten a larger area, opt for a model that features multiple bulbs or reflects light in many different directions. The chandelier you settle on should enhance visibility without being harsh or glaring.You also have the option of choosing between conventional bulbs and powerful LEDs that give off more light in a smaller space.Connect your chandelier to a dimmer switch so you’ll have full control over the amount of light it gives off., Exquisitely decorated homes deserve chandeliers with just as much taste. Look for fixtures with eye-catching embellishments, such as the classic dangling crystals or clusters of blown-glass globes. They’ll provide the finishing touches for dining rooms with an air of sophistication.The more complex the chandelier’s design, the more you can expect to shell out for it.
Neutral tones like silver and chrome will mesh with other items more naturally than bright or oddly-colored finishes.

, Try out a light ring molded from brass or a similar material, or an impressive centerpiece of rustic wrought iron. An unobtrusive chandelier will allow the rest of the room’s decor to speak for itself.You can find more practical lighting solutions at most home improvement stores.
Sturdy fixtures with one-piece construction are often much easier and less costly to repair or replace.

, These can range from basic minimalistic shaded lamps to more artistic installations that double as functional sculptures. Contemporary accessories will arguably give you the greatest variety of options to match up to your home’s unique character.Unlike elaborate vintage chandeliers, modern fixtures won’t stand out awkwardly in newer homes.

, No matter what type of piece you choose, it should fit in with the furnishings and ornamentations that you already have in place. Take in the room as a whole—the “perfect” chandelier is the one that ties it all together effortlessly.A vibrant bronze fixture, for instance, will clash with decor decked out in warm hues.
Similarly, a stripped-down industrial fixture can create confusion in a dining room inspired by classic Victorian sensibilities., This is the most common placement, as it emphasizes the room’s purpose by keeping attention focused on its most important piece of furniture. Centering the chandelier over the table will offer a tasteful spotlight for rich holiday meals, light afternoon luncheons and even the occasional game of cards.For a more organic setup, have your chandelier measured, lined up and hung in relation to the position of the dining table, not the other way around.An overhead chandelier will look best when it’s about a foot smaller than the table on all sides., If your dining room is bordered by a vestibule or includes a short walkway, you may prefer to place the chandelier there. That way, it can be seen by your guests immediately upon entering.This arrangement will look most natural in rooms with long, open layouts.
Mounting a chandelier in another area of the dining room can act as a sort of visual welcoming.Change the focal point of the room by placing the chandelier over another prominent object, such as a buffet, wet bar or piano.

, Ideally, it should be low enough to cast light in a wide radius, but not so low that it gets in the way. Try suspending the fixture at different levels until you find one that allows the eye to transition seamlessly from floor to ceiling.A good rule of thumb is to find the height of your ceilings in feet, then multiply that number by 3 and convert it to inches: for example, a dining room with a 9' ceiling will accommodate a chandelier up to 27"" high.
Chandeliers are generally mounted to hang 30”-36” from the top of a table or other surface., If the chandelier is going to serve as a primary source of illumination, it should go as close to the center of the room as you can get it. Otherwise, it can bleed together with nearby ceiling lights and floor lamps, resulting in a washed out glare. Find a sensible spacing between individual lights so that no part of the room is either too bright or too dark.If you’re using a lighted chandelier, turn off some of the surrounding lights so they don’t end up competing.
Chandeliers comprised of lots of small crystal or glass pieces are designed to diffuse light with a sparkling effect, which means they often don’t even need an integrated light source.

Protect the area you want to paint.,
Paint with care.",How to Paint Cleanly1," Preparation is an important part of your plan to paint cleanly. You should take certain steps each time you paint to reduce the chance of mishaps.


Spread heavy drop cloths over the entire floor area. Don't substitute plastic covering to protect floors; it tends to bunch up when walked on.
Move lighter furniture out of the room you're painting.
Move heavy furniture to the center of the room and cover it completely with plastic covering.
Remove all wall decorations and area rugs.
Take down curtains and curtain rods.
Use masking tape to protect the trim and windows, door frames and baseboards. Also tape off fixtures that you can't remove.
Remove wall plates from electrical outlets and light switches.
Keep the area around the surface you're painting clear of all obstructions.

, You can take steps to greatly reduce the number of accidental spills. These steps differ depending on the method you use to paint.


Roll off excess paint on the roller grid. Drops of paint can go unnoticed and set in on surfaces.
Don't allow the roller to spin after each stroke. Spinning rollers often splatter paint in all directions.
Use a can roller grid instead of a separate pan. Grids that attach inside the paint can reduce paint splatter and also eliminate the need for pans. Pans tip over easily and people may accidentally step in them.

Remove any furniture that you can from the room.,
Tape the edges of the wall.,
Protect your floor.,
Wear old clothes or overalls.,
Use a paintbrush to paint towards the corner.,
Paint away from the corner.,
Paint toward the corner with a loaded roller.,
Reload your roller with paint as needed.,
Move in parallel strips to cover the ceiling.,
Evaluate your work regularly.,
Let the paint dry before deciding if it needs another coat.",How to Paint Ceiling Corners," Trying to paint ceiling corners with a bunch of furniture in the way will only make a hard job even harder. Plus, you risk dripping paint on your furniture by accident. Pull furniture away from the walls and move it to the center of the room before you get started. If you’re painting the whole ceiling and not just the ceiling corners, remove your furniture to another room entirely., Lay blue painter’s tape along the entire perimeter of the wall where it meets the ceiling. This will prevent the paint you’re applying to the ceiling from accidentally getting on the wall., Lay down a drop cloth before you start working. If you don’t have a dropcloth, use an old set of sheets.If you’re only painting ceiling corners, you can probably get away with just laying down some thick cardboard or a layer of newspapers beneath the corner in question.

, Painting ceiling corners can be messy. Wear heavy overalls or old clothes when painting. Do not wear new clothes or anything that you might be concerned about if it got paint on it.Disposable rubber gloves might also be useful.
Wear a hat, too, to protect your head.

, To start the process, dip a five or six-centimeter-wide (three-inch-wide) paintbrush into your paint of choice. Move the brush along the ceiling in one continuous direction, painting a six-centimeter (three-inch) margin of the ceiling.Use a ladder to reach the ceiling. Place your bucket of paint on top of it. If the ceiling corners you wish to paint are too tall to reach with a ladder, erect scaffolding.
Paint the edge of the ceiling as thickly as possible without the paint dripping., When you reach the corner of the wall, begin painting another continuous margin along the adjoining wall, heading away from the corner. Use your paintbrush to paint this strip, too. This second margin along the ceiling should be just as wide as the first strip you painted., After painting a strip of paint across the entire perimeter of the ceiling, dip your loaded roller into the paint of your choice. Roll it towards the ceiling corner you’re interested in painting in such a way that it overlaps a bit with the area you just painted with the paintbrush. Roll in one direction toward the opposite side of the room.Do not place the roller directly overhead or you risk dripping paint on yourself.
Use a roller with a nap of more than ½ inch (one centimeter)., You’ll be able to tell that you need more paint on your loaded roller when you notice that it is no longer applying paint to the ceiling. When this happens, dip – but do not submerge – your roller in paint., After your first corner has been painted, paint the ceiling in strips that touch each other, and that run parallel to the direction in which you painted the first corner. For instance, if you painted the ceiling corner by pushing the loaded roller from the front to the back of your room, continue applying paint by moving the loaded roller along a front-to-back axis.In this way, you’ll paint two corners, then the rest of the ceiling, then the final two corners.

, As you paint the ceiling, step back and examine your progress. Look for areas where the paint has been applied unevenly (that is, areas where the paint is too light). Roll the loaded roller across these areas when you detect them., If you decide to apply a second coat, use the same method you did the first time – use the loaded roller to apply the paint in parallel strips – but move in a direction perpendicular to the strips you applied the first time."

Choose which colors to use.,
Choose the right tools for the job.,
Paint your base color.,
Use a piece of cardboard to outline each square.",How to Paint Buffalo Check1," Painting buffalo check requires three different colors. For best results, choose colors that complement each other well. For instance, you might choose white, gray, and navy.A common combination is a base color of white and then two different hues of a given color. For instance, you might choose white, bright red, and dark red., You can best paint your wall using a roller brush and a bucket of paint. Lay down some cardboard and newspaper before you get started to catch dripping paint., If the wall or object you wish to paint with a buffalo check pattern does not already include one of the colors you want to include on your buffalo check wall, you’ll need to paint it to include one of these colors. Clean the wall with a damp cloth, then allow it to dry.When you’re ready, pour the paint into a tin paint pan. Roll the brush in the paint. Slowly roll the brush across the wall in “W” shapes of varying sizes to get the entire wall the right color.

, When your wall is dry, cut a piece of cardboard stock to the exact dimensions you wish each square in your buffalo check pattern to be. Starting at the top left corner of the wall, use a pencil to lightly trace the bottom edge of the square. When you’re finished, slide the square down so that its top edge directly abuts the bottom edge of the square above. Continue working your way down the column.There’s no need to trace the entire square. Just run your pencil along the bottom edge at regular intervals, keeping the left edge against the corner of the room.
For best results, your squares should be about seven to 12 inches on each side.

Scrub away any rust from the wrought iron.,
Sand the wrought iron.,
Apply a coat of rust inhibiting primer to the wrought iron.,
Sand the primer.,
Apply paint to the wrought iron.",How to Paint Black Wrought Iron," When left exposed to air (either indoors or outdoors), wrought iron will rust readily. If there is any rust present on your piece, you should remove it instead of painting over it. This is best done with a stiff wire brush, although it can be done more efficiently with a sandblaster if you have the required space to use one. Scrub the entire piece with the brush until all visible rust is gone. You may want to do this in a garage where you can easily sweep up the metal and paint flakes afterwards.


If the wrought iron is already painted, you will get the best results if you scrub away the old coat of paint with the wire brush.;
, To prepare the iron for painting, go over the whole piece with medium-grit sandpaper. This provides the ideal surface for the primer and paint to adhere to.

, After sanding the piece smooth, you need to apply a coat of primer. This will help prevent the formation of rust and make your paint color appear as it should. Rust inhibiting primer is a product specifically designed for use on metals containing iron, and it can be purchased at any hardware store. It is best applied with a brush in a single thin coat.

, After letting the primer dry completely, sand it lightly with medium-grit sandpaper. Clean the entire piece with a tack cloth before painting to ensure that metal flakes and dust do not mix into the paint.

, For painting wrought iron, use exterior-grade enamel paint. For best results, use a ""direct-to-metal"" (DTM) paint that contains a rust inhibiting ingredient. Using ordinary exterior paint will lead to chipping. The paint should be applied with a brush in long, smooth strokes. A second coat can be applied if desired.

"
Use care when painting near ceilings or windows.,
Reduce spillage.,
Clean up paint spills immediately.",How to Paint Cleanly2," Airless sprayers don't use compressors. A pump forces the paint through a high-pressure hose and out the nozzle. Although they produce less overspray than a compressed air sprayer, an airless sprayer will produce paint mist that can travel on air currents to areas you don't want to paint.;
,


Use a nail to punch a hole in the rim of the paint can. Paint tends to collect on the rim of the can after it's been poured. When the lid is closed, paint seeps outside the can. Creating the hole in the rim allows the paint drip back into the can.
Place the lid back on the paint can, drape a cloth over the can and tap the lid down with a hammer. This keeps excess paint from splattering as you tightly close the lid.

, Accidents will happen, but their effects can be ameliorated if you act quickly.

Orient your laser level to mark the horizontal edges.,
Tape the wall.,
Paint your second color.",How to Paint Buffalo Check2," A laser level is a device that emits a laser beam from a stable point. Simply align the laser level in such a way that it draws a steady line straight across the wall and along the first line you drew.As you proceed down the wall toward progressively lower lines, you’ll have to adjust the laser level accordingly.
You can get a laser level at your local hardware store. They can be quite affordable, though a range of prices exist. More functional laser levels will be more expensive, and more basic levels will be less expensive.
Tripod-mounted laser levels will rotate from a central axis across a given line that you select. Stationary laser levels must be held or attached to a wall or other surface and manually set at the height you wish to draw straight across.

, Guided by the laser level, apply a long strip of painter’s tape all the way across the room. The bottom edge of the tape should touch the first (highest) line your laser traces across your wall.Once you’re done, adjust your laser level so that it traces a line straight across your wall consistent with the second line in the column of horizontally-oriented lines you made using the cardboard square.
Instead of applying the bottom edge of this piece of tape to the laser line, though, attach the tape along the line so that its top edge touches it. Run the tape all the way across the wall just as you did with the first strip of tape.
Continue down the column in this way, placing your painter’s tape directly above, then directly below the laser lines you trace across the wall.

, When you’re finished applying the tape, you’ll have an alternating sequence of thin and wide strips on your wall. Paint the wider strips using a roller brush in the same way you painted the wall the first time. Be careful not to paint beyond the boundary marked by the painter’s tape.When your paint is still wet, strip off the painter’s tape. This prevents potential cracking or peeling that might occur if you strip the tape off when the paint is dry.

Trace your vertical lines.,
Orient your laser level to trace the vertical lines.,
Tape the wall.,
Paint the wall.",How to Paint Buffalo Check3," When your paint has dried, place your cardboard square once again in the upper-left corner of the room and lightly trace a pencil straight down the square’s right edge. When you’re finished, slide the square over so that its top edge touches the ceiling and its left edge touches the line you just traced. Run your pencil down the right edge of the square again. Continue in this way all the way across the wall., Adjust your laser level again so that it traces the vertical lines you partially drew across the top of your wall using the cardboard square. You might have to physically turn your laser level on its side, or you might be able to simply flip a switch to get your laser level to trace a vertical line., Once your laser level has illuminated the first vertical line, place a strip of painter’s tape just to the left of the line. In other words, the right edge of the painter’s tape should touch and run directly parallel to the laser line.Then, recalibrate your laser level so that it runs along the second vertical line in the sequence. Place a piece of painter’s tape just to the right of this line. Its left edge should run parallel to and touch the line.
Continue in this way all the way across the wall, alternately placing the tape just to the left or right of the line.

, After taping the wall, the vertically-oriented spaces between each strip of tape will have a different width. Some of these spaces will be wider than others. Paint the wider columns of space between the tape with your final color.When you’re finished, strip the tape off while still wet.

Prepare the statue for painting.,
Apply a base coat to the entire statue, using either a brush or a sprayer.,
Choose a painting method for the top coat.,
Paint the top coat.,
Seal the statue.",How to Paint Concrete Statues," Before painting concrete, you must take certain steps to ensure the paint will stick to it:


Allow the concrete statue to air dry.
Wash the statue with water, using a garden hose or shower sprayer. Do not use soap.
Blow any remaining dust or concrete flakes off the statue using a high pressure air hose.;
,


Use either a latex exterior paint or a paint formulated especially for painting concrete, in a color that is appropriate to the top coat color you will be using.
Coat the bottom of the concrete statue with a base coat first. Allow it to dry, then stand the statue up for painting.
Allow the base coat to dry, then inspect the statue for full coverage. Concrete is very absorbent, so you may need to apply more than 1 base coat. If you notice that an area seems dull or washed out in comparison to other areas, it is a good idea to apply another base coat.

, You may opt to use a paint brush or paint sprayer to coat the statue, or you can choose from other creative paint finish options:


Dry-brushing involves using base and top coats that are contrasting in nature, and swiping a partially-coated paintbrush over the concrete statue to create a weathered, striation effect. For example, you can use a black base coat for your statue, then dip your paintbrush in white paint, wipe most of the white paint off the brush and swipe the barely-damp paintbrush across your statue for a feathery look.
For an antiquing method, use a light or white base coat for concrete statues, then apply the colored top coat, let the paint sit for 10 minutes and wipe away the excess paint using a dampened rag. Apply and wipe away paint as necessary to get the desired effect.
Airbrushing is a technique that requires a paint airbrush. It is a learned skill that can create realistic effects for animal statues, and can work with either a dark or light base coat, depending on the subject.
Detailing involves using small brushes to create details in the top coat by hand. Concrete statues that are going to be detailed generally work best with white base coats.

, You can either paint concrete statues a solid color, or use a variety of colors for details. Use any type or variety of exterior latex paint and/or concrete paint products found in home improvement and craft stores. Allow the top coat to dry for 24 hours before moving on to the next step in painting concrete.

, Use a non-yellowing exterior concrete sealer. This will protect paint colors from fading and keep out harmful moisture. Place the concrete statue on a ventilated surface (gravel or rock will do), and allow the sealer to dry for 24 hours.

Clean the concrete surface with soap and warm water, removing any old paint.,
Remove dense areas of oil or grease with tri-sodium phosphate (TSP) to ensure that the paint doesn't discolor later.,
Apply concrete patch to fix any major defects such as cracks, gouges or uneven surfaces.,
Seal any indoor concrete to prevent moisture from coming through the cement.",How to Paint Concrete1," First, sweep away any surface leaves, debris, and dirt. Then remove any existing paint or gunk using a power washer or scraper and wire brush. Scrub away any dirt, grime, or gunk that is stuck to the concrete. You do not have to worry about stains, however, if they are set in and not some sort of object stuck onto the surface.


Yank off any vines, moss, or other plant life covering the concrete.
You want the surface to be as clean and bare as possible for the best coating of paint later on.;
, TPS can be purchased at most major home improvement stores. Simply mix it with water in the ratio illustrated on the packaging and wash away any oil stains, rinsing the cleaner off when you're done. Allow the concrete surface to dry completely before proceeding with the next steps., You want the concrete to be as smooth and regular as possible. Any breaks and cracks are places where moisture could potentially get under the paint, peeling it off your surface later on. Read the manufacturer's instructions to confirm proper drying time for the patch., Concrete sealant is expensive, but it is the best way to ensure that you don't ruin your paint job soon after applying it. Concrete is very porous, which means trapped moisture in the concrete could rise and ruin the paint. Follow the sealant manufacturer's instructions for the proper preparation and application of the product.

, Mix a small solution of ammonia and water together and sponge it all over the appliance. This will give it an easier finish to prepare and paint.

, Use a steel wool or something with strong, solid bristles that can scour the appliance for stubborn contaminants or food and debris left crusted to the appliance.

, Rub a course sandpaper all over the appliance, including handles and ledges. Dust away the debris with a clean paintbrush and sand the entire appliance a second time. Sanding it thoroughly is necessary for the paint to adhere to the appliance surface.

, Any knobs or buttons that will not be painted, or can be painted separately should be removed from the appliance.

, Any clocks, words, or other markings and areas on the appliance that will not be painted over should be covered with painter's tape.

, Self priming epoxy appliance paint is available at home improvement and hardware stores. This type of paint is available in a can to be painted with a brush, or in a spray can.

, Use slow, even strokes to put one full coat on the entire appliance if using a paint brush. If using the spray painting method, hold the can a consistent distance from the appliance and cover it with a complete coat. Allow the appliance to dry overnight.

Check the weather forecast to ensure you have 2-3 dry days in a row before painting outdoor concrete.,
Apply 1 layer of concrete paint primer with a paint roller.,
Purchase the right paint for the right concrete.,
Apply a thin, even coat of paint using a paint roller.,
Return the next afternoon and apply a second coat of paint.,
Let the paint dry for 1-2 days before stepping on or placing anything on the concrete.",How to Paint Concrete2," You'll need the paint to dry overnight on the first night, then you'll be applying a second and maybe a third coat. After each coat the paint needs to dry overnight then it needs roughly 24 hours to complete dry when you're done. Do some homework, and only tackle this project when the weather is right for it., Before adding your color, you need to use primer to ensure that the paint will stick. Apply a primer to the concrete to ensure strong adhesion of the paint. Again, follow the manufacturer's instructions to confirm the necessary application and drying time.


If you are painting over an old color, or you are working outdoors, you may have better results with 2 coats of primer. Be sure to let the first coat dry fully before applying the second., Your best bet, when working with concrete, is to use masonry paint, which is formulated to contract and expand as concrete changes temperature. It is sometimes sold as elastomeric paint or elastomeric wall coating. Since it is much thicker than regular paint, you need to be sure to use a high-capacity roller or brush., Start in one of the corners, or at the top of you are painting a wall, and work slowly and evenly across the entire surface. You don't need as much paint as you think in each layer -- you'll be adding 1-2 more layers once the first is done drying, so don't try and slather it all on now., Once the paint has dried overnight you can layer on another coat. You should add at least 1 more coat of paint, thinly, but you could add a third as well for a deeper color and a more even coating., Dry the final coat of paint for at least 24 hours before moving items onto or near the newly painted concrete to ensure a smooth, professional appearance."

Pour 1⁄4 gallon (0.9 L) of paint into a paint tray.,
Holding the pad vertically, run the pad along the baseboard.,
Keep dipping the pad into the paint.,
Wait at least 4 hours before pulling off the masking tape.",How to Paint Baseboards," Use painting pads instead of brushes or rollers. They will give you a smoother surface, and they are usually the same width as common baseboards, so you can paint the baseboard from top to bottom with one stroke.






;
, This type of paint will clean easily if you get scuff marks on the boards.








, You can use standard masking tape, but be careful because standard masking tape can pull the paint off of the walls. There are many specialty masking tapes that you can buy at any hardware store. Ask a store employee to help.








, The object is to avoid getting paint on the walls while you are paining the baseboards.








, Tape the plastic down with your masking tape, right where the baseboard meets the floor. You've now masked the baseboard.








, Push the paint pad into the paint, so that just the sponge part of the pad is covered in paint. Scrape the excess paint off of the pad by running it over the edge of the tray.








, You should be able to paint about 4 feet (1.2 m) of baseboard with each dip in the paint.








, Run the pad along the baseboard until the entire baseboard is painted. Make sure you overlap your strokes, and that each new section is blended together.








, That should give your baseboards time to dry.

Calculate the right volume.,
Order from the nearest supplier.,
Ask for 5 percent “air entrainment” in the mix.,
Get the right strength.,
Have your checkbook ready.",How to Order Ready Mix Concrete," In the U.S. Concrete is always ordered in cubic yards. First figure out the cubic footage, then convert to yards by dividing by 27. Here’s how: multiply the length of your project times the width times the depth (4 in. = . 33 ft.) and divide the total by 27. Using a sidewalk as an example: 60 feet (18.3 m). (long) x 4 feet (1.2 m). (wide) x .33 feet (0.1 m). (deep) = 79.2 cu. ft. ÷ 27 = 2.93 cu. yards.You can also figure your cubic yards by this example: length, times, width, divided by, 12, times, thickness, divided by, 27. using the figures from above example. 60 ft ( length ), times 4 ft (width), divided by 12, times 4 inches (10.2 cm) (thickness), divided by 27 = 2.96 cubic yards. Concrete is cheap and nothing is worse than coming up short (except rain). A good rule of thumb is to order an extra 5 percent rounded up to the next 1⁄4 yard (0.2 m). to handle spillage and uneven bases.;
, Get fresh concrete mixed near the site, not mixed across town by some company with a lower price.

, Suppliers add a chemical that traps microscopic air bubbles to help the concrete handle the expansion and shrinkage caused by climatic changes such as freezing.

, Tell them you’re pouring an exterior sidewalk and they’ll recommend the correct “bag mix” (ratio of cement to gravel and sand). In cold climates, they’ll probably suggest at least a 3,000-lb. mix. That means concrete that’ll handle a 3,000-lb. load per square inch without failing.

, You’ll have to pay on delivery after the concrete’s unloaded.

Determine what type of cement will work best for your project.,
Purchase the cement needed along with fine sand and gravel.,
Lay out the supplies.,
Open the cement, gravel, and sandbags that you will use for mixing concrete.,
Mix the ingredients thoroughly with your spade to ensure they are well combined.",How to Mix Cement1," Type 1 Portland cement is the most-popular option because of its mix composition, but there are other types available that offer sulfur resistance or temperature sensitivity. Research online or in the hardware store to understand what will work best for you.









Over 92% of Portland cement produced in the United States is Type 1, 2, or 3. Type 2 is specially designed to fight against sulfate attack, while Type 3 is typically used for added early-strength.;
, You will need to purchase twice as much sand and three times as much gravel in order to get the proper cement mixture.








, This includes bags for mixing and a heavy-duty wheelbarrow, since the mixture will be heavy once combined.








, Use your small spade to shovel a ratio of 1 part cement, 2 parts sand, and 3 parts gravel into the wheelbarrow.









For example, one wheelbarrow full should be a mix of 2 spades of cement, 4 spades of sand, and 6 spades of gravel. If you're working with bigger quantities of cement up front, you might have a ratio of 4 spades of cement, 8 spades of sand, and 12 spades of gravel.

, Though they'll be mixed later, it's a good idea to have the dry mix thoroughly incorporated before adding the water.

Pour a small amount of water, roughly half of a 5 gallon (18.9 L) bucket, into the wheelbarrow.,
Start with 3/4 of the dry mix.,
Once incorporated, add the remaining 1/4 of dry mix to the soupy cement mix.,
Pour the mixed cement immediately into your project's area.,
Clean up your supplies as soon as possible.",How to Mix Cement2," Be sure to measure out a known amount, so that you can replicate the same consistency with successive batches of concrete.









If pouring your water into a bucket before incorporating into the dry mix, mark the water level on your bucket with a marker. This way, you can quickly fill the bucket without measuring out the water each time you mix a new batch.













Cement that contains too much water is about half as strong as properly-mixed concrete. While it's tempting to just eyeball the amount of water, it could compromise the integrity of your structure. Be sure to read manufacturer's labels when adding the correct amount of water.

, In a wheelbarrow or other mixing container, agitate about 3/4 of the dry mix with all of the water. This first mix will appear a bit soupy because of the excess water, but it should be easy to mix. For best results, mix with a rake.








, Mixing will become a little more difficult at this point, but a trusty rake should make the job easier. Mix until the finished cement is thick and wet but no longer soupy.








, This step needs to be completed as soon as possible after mixing.








, Ideally, one partner starts on clean-up duty while another partner lays the concrete. But if that's not possible, submerge the wheelbarrow or cement basin with water immediately upon finishing. Then, scrub the wheelbarrow or basin with a stiff-bristle brush until it has been completely freed on any cement.









Dump the cement water somewhere inconspicuous, preferably where there isn't grass. (It will kill grass.) You can even dig a small hole, dump the water in, and then fill the hole afterward.

Understand the two factors determining the strength of concrete when used in building:


Compressive strength is obtained by design, using the cement to aggregate ratio as a base, then adding admixtures for increased strength.,
Determine the requirements for your project.,
Adjust the mixture you are using if you are mixing your own concrete.,
Use other admixtures like fly ash as a substitute for part of the fine aggregate in your mixture to increase the compressive strength if you like.,
Research chemical admixtures to find specific chemicals you can purchase to change the properties of your concrete.,
Add reinforcing to increase the strength of concrete in your project.",How to Make Concrete Even Stronger,"
Reinforcing strength is obtained by adding either fiber reinforcing, deformed reinforcing bars (rebar), welded wire fabric, or other optional reinforcing materials.;
, For foundations, slabs, and beams, you may simply order a high-strength ready-mix concrete from a ready-mix plant. This product is usually available in standard design mix strengths of up to 5,000PSI.

, An example would be to use more portland cement and less sand for a home made concrete mix. Large aggregate like gravel and crushed limestone do not affect the strength of concrete as much as the cement to sand ratio.

, The higher the cement/fly ash to sand ratio is, the stronger the resulting concrete will be.

, High-early additives, retarders, and other specialized chemicals are used in industrial concrete to increase its strength and regulate curing times.

, Up-sizing rebar, installing multiple mats of reinforcing, and decreasing spacing between bars.

Get the right concrete.,
Use the best ratio.,
Use sharp sand.,
Be sure that your mortar is dense.,
Add glass fibers (or fiberglass).,
Mix in the following ratio:


1 part type 1 (type N or type 10 depending on where you are)
3 parts sharp sand
1 part silica fume
1/3 part fly ash

This is the advanced mortar mix designed for strength.",How to Mix Concrete for Making Fake Rocks," The best concrete mix for making fake rocks from concrete is actually a mortar mix and not concrete at all.  Gravel is the main difference between a concrete mix and a mortar mix.  For making fake rocks you will want a mortar that is free of larger aggregates like gravel.  This allows you to trowel the concrete at any thickness without gravel disturbing the process.  ;
, The best mix ratio for faux rocks is the strongest ratio which is approximately 3 parts sand to 1 part cement.  This will produce a finished product concrete that is as strong, or stronger, than regular concrete containing gravel.  

, The type of sand that you choose will have a large impact on the workability of the concrete as well as the finished strength.  Sharp sand, like a brick sand is ideal as the sharp edges of the sand allow for a very strong finished product.  Using tumbled sand where the sharp edges have been removed such as with play sand will result in a substantially weaker mortar mix.  Using tumbled sand would be similar to attempting to glue rubber balls together.  The sharp edges of brick sand allow for a much better bonding process.


Another major advantage of sharp sand or brick sand over another variety known as masonry sand is that the brick sand is very well graded to remove any potential larger stones which could negatively impact your ability to trowel smooth, finish and stamp texture into the concrete rock.

, One of the properties that you are looking for in concrete for making artificial rocks is you want the mortar to be as dense as possible.  Using concrete additives such as silica fume (densified) as well as fly ash, water reducer and acrylic polymer can substantially increase the density, strength and ability to sculpt, texture and trowel the concrete.

, From a strength perspective the very best thing you can add to your concrete mix is the addition of glass fibers.  Glass fibers, or even fiberglass is fantastic for increasing the overall strength of the mix.  The glass fibers help to minimize hairline cracking as well as increase the tensile strength of the finished product.

,  The amount of glass fibers, liquid polymer and water reducer will depend on your application and how much strength and slump you want the mortar mix to have.

Measure the Length (L).,
Measure the Width (W).,
Measure the Height (H).,
Use a Construction Calculator.,
If you're calculating for Cubic Feet or Cubic Yards of Concrete needed, you will need to convert your inch measurements to Engineers Scale.,
For the L measurement of 12 feet 6 inches (15.2 cm), take the 6 inches (15.2 cm) and divide it by 12.,
At 15 feet (4.6 m) and 0 inches (0.0 cm) the W does not need to be converted.

,
For the H measurement of 3 and 3/4 inches, we will first need to convert the fraction 3/4 of an inch to a decimal.,
Multiply them altogether.,
To calculate the Cubic Yards take the 58.25 cubic feet and divide it by 27.",How to Measure Concrete to Be Poured," For an example lets say it's 12 feet 6 inches (15.2 cm).;
, For example lets say its 15 feet (4.6 m).

, Fro example lets say its 3 and 3/4 inches.

, Do search online to find them.

, Engineers scale is basically taking a foot (12 inches) and converting it into10ths. The engineers scale also eliminates the  fractions of an inch. (i.e. 3/4 of an inch is equal to 0.75 of an inch)

,   6 inches (15.2 cm) / 12 = 0.50 feet (0.2 m).  Put the .50 after the 12. Now we have 12.5 feet (3.8 m).

,, Take the top number 3 and divide it by the bottom number 4. 


3 / 4 = 0.75 of an inch. Put the .75 after the 3. We now have 3.75 inches (9.5 cm). Now take 3.75 and divide that by 12.
3.75 / 12 = 0.31 feet (0.1 m).

 Now we have L = 12.5 feet (3.8 m), W = 15 feet (4.6 m) and H = 0.31 feet (0.1 m).



, 12.5 x 15 x 0.31 = 58.25 cubic feet.

, 58.25 / 27 = 2.15 Cubic Yards.

Don't worry about cut-outs for things like sinks right now: just get the shape of the rectangular or L shaped piece that you'll need. Try not to do anything to big all at once, as this will be very difficult to place. If you can, break it down into smaller sections.









Keep in mind that there is usually a 1"" overhang from the edge of the cabinets. Make sure to add this into measurements for any sides not attached to the wall.;
, If you need to have a cutout for the sink, measure or trace the shape that you need onto some paper or cardboard. Then, transfer that shape to some high density, firm foam (like what is used in flower arranging) and cut it out.









This cardboard square will help your visualize the sink or other object and cut around it when preparing the countertop.

, Cut a base for your mold using the measurements that you took, but with 3/4"" added all the way around. You can cut the melamine using a table saw or similar tool.









For example, if making a countertop that is 25x60"" big, cut a piece of melamine that is 26 1/2"" x 61 1/2"".

, Cut the side pieces to the desired thickness of your countertop, plus 3/4"" on both ends and one of the sides to adjust for construction. Adjust the measurements for either the short or long ends, depending on how you want the boards to overlap. How this is done doesn't matter, just as long as they make the shape of the base.









For example, if you wanted 2"" thick countertops, the pieces would be cut to 2 3/4"" x 61 1/2"" for the long sides and 2 3/4"" x 26 1/2"" for the short sides.
We could then adjust the measurement of the short sides to 25"" so that they can nest between the long side pieces. You could also go the opposite way, and adjust the long sides back down to 60"". Either way, test out your measurements with a tape measure on the melamine base to make sure everything will fit snugly.

, Using basic butt joints, drill pilot holes and then screw the sides of the mold together. You can then attach the sides to the base in the same way.









1 1/4 inch dry wall screws should be more than strong enough.

, Using rubber cement or another strong, even-drying adhesive, glue the foam cutout for your sink to the location it will go for the counter. You need to make sure the foam is as least as high as your mold. When you pour the concrete in, the foam needs to prevent any concrete from getting into the sink area.









If the sink will go at the edge of the counter, it might be better to simply build this into the mold, cutting it out ahead of time.

, Tape around the inside seams of the wooden mold, leaving just a slight gap (about 1/8"") between the two piece directly over the joints. You should then run a line of caulk along all the seams and form it to the joint using your finger. Allow it to dry and then peel off the tape. This will prevent any concrete from leaking out unattractively.









Use paper towels to wipe up any excess as you work.

, Use a carpenter's level to make sure the top edge of the form is level all the way around. If needed, sand it down to make sure it is all nice and uniform. When done, clean the mold with a shop vac and a damp cloth. Let it dry before moving on.








, This little trick greatly reduces the final weight, and the necessity for more concrete. Take some more foam and cut it to be only half the height of the mold. Then, leaving 1-2"" between the walls and foam, glue down the foam. It will take up a lot of the space the concrete would have, but is much, much lighter. When done, caulk it down to the mold.









Take up all the foam pieces together on both sides with packing tape, including the outside edges.
Make sure you leave the gap around the edges -- you need to concrete around the entire perimeter.

, This helps for stability and shaping. You may need to cut and bend it a bit to fit it snugly into the molding. You don't want to add it in now -- you just want to make sure it fits.








, Use a mix for the color and additives that is especially designed for countertops or floors. This is important, as you'll want strengtheners and other filler materials to make your concrete function better for this purpose. You will also want to use a pre-mixed, high strength concrete. Your local home improvement store should be able to help you locate both of these products.









Mix the concrete in a moving mixer, in order to get the right volume and consistency. These can be rented from your local hardware store. You want a roughly peanut butter-like consistency.
Follow the manufacturer's instructions for mixing the concrete and additives. Generally, less water is used for high strength concrete than normal concrete.

, Using a shovel or scoop, pour your concrete into the form until it reaches the top edge of the form all the way around. Use a trowel or paving tool to even out the top and push all of the concrete out to the sides as you work








, You can also add extra strength by cutting and placing a steel mesh in the wet concrete halfway through the pouring process, so that it is completely entombed in the material. This isn't completely necessary, but is important for preventing cracks and creating a countertop that will last a lifetime.








, Err on the side of having too much concrete in the form. You can always skim some off, but it is much harder to add in later.








, Using the edge of a flat board, lay it across the top of the form on one end and then slide it back and forth as you move down the frame to the opposite end. This will take off any extra concrete and make sure the top is level. You can use the edge of 2x4, or speciality concrete working tools. Work the edge back and forth along the top, like you are leveling floor in a measuring cup, to distribute the concrete evenly.









Take any excess concrete and use it to fill in any low spots.
Extra concrete should be held onto for later, as it may help fill in spots.

, Vibrate the whole table your form is resting on if you can, but at a minimum gently vibrate the sides of the form to get rid of any bubbles. You can use a sander on a low setting, without any attachment, and run it along the entire edge of the form, for the easiest solution.









Your goal is to get an nice, even top. Even just lifting and dropping the whole table 2-3"" inches, bouncing it rapidly, is perfect.
You can also use a rubber mallet, striking the sides of the mold and bottom of the table.

, Smooth everything out, then create a nice, rounded edge around the entire mold. Then trowel out any imperfections created by the edging tool, and let it sit.









Repeat this process again, especially the troweling, after 2-3 hours.

, Cover the concrete with plastic and then allow it to cure as long as instructed by the manufacturer. This could be anywhere from 1-2 days to a week. However, you don't want the concrete to completely dry. When you can press into it and only create a small dimple, you're ready to move forward.








, Unscrew the sides of the form and gently pry the melamine off of the concrete. If the concrete starts to slump, put it back on. If not, use your trowel to smooth out the outside edge of the counter into a clean, even surface.









If you need, a small spray of water makes the concrete a bit easier to work with. You won't need much.
If a little concrete pulls off with the wall, you can trowel some of the excess concrete back on with a spritz of water.

, This final troweling provides some smoothness and character to your countertop. It is not entirely necessary, but will lead to a prettier countertop.








, You need the bottom of the countertop to dry, too. Once you're sure it is dried enough that it doesn't slump (in which case you would still have the side walls on, get a friend to help you raise the top of the countertop. Rip out the foam and pull off the molding, exposing the bottom of the counter top.









Don't rush this. Remember, the concrete should just barely indent under your finger.
Let the countertop hang over the edge, at least slightly, to allow air underneath to dry.

, Put on some rubber gloves and then wipe down the countertop with a mixture of 10 parts water to 1 part muriatic acid to remove any remaining residue and prepare the material for sealing. Remove the excess acid with a squeegee.








, Using a sander and increasingly high grit sandpaper (120, 180, 220), sand your countertop and the sides until it is completely smooth. Remove the dust with a cloth and some water.








, If you want to color the concrete, add it after everything has dried. You can use any sort of coloring you want, as long as it is made for concrete.








, Using a penetrative sealer, fold a rag as flat as possible and then saturate it in the sealer. Wipe this in long strokes, overlapping each stroke with the next, until the entire counter is covered. Allow to dry. This usually takes around 2 hours.








, Use a food safe wax and a buffer to finish the countertops. When they're shiny and the wax is absorbed, you're good to go!








, Carefully place the countertops in their final location. If they are small enough not to stay in place using their own weight, use adhesives. Check for level and if they are not, use wood shims underneath to get the desired level.

Decide on the area to be concreted, draw up a plan, and write in all measurements.
Determine the finished levels of the work and write these levels on the plan.
Determine the thickness (depth) of the concrete and write it on the plan. 4 in. (10 cm) depth is standard for driveways and garages used by passenger vehicles, but not for heavy trucks.

Remember to allow for drainage and ensure that water will not run to undesired locations. Provision a minimum drop of 1"" for each ten feet of slab (1.2cm per m), although 1.5"" drop for every ten feet of run (1.8cm per m) is preferred.;
, Generally, you will need Portland Type I (general use cement) or Type II (used for structures in water or soil containing moderate amounts of sulfate, or when heat build-up is a concern) cement, masonry/builder's sand or other clean sand, and gravel or crushed limestone.









Calculate the volume of concrete required by multiplying the thickness in feet by the square footage of the area to be concreted.
Purchase as much concrete as needed for your project. 1 square foot (.093 sq. m) of 4 in. (10 cm) deep concrete requires 50 pounds (22.7 kg) of concrete mix.

Portland cement generally comes in bags weighing 96 lbs (43.5 kg) and should be handled with care. Depending on the size of your project, a truck may be needed to assist in hauling.

, Build a mixing box from wood planks or use a sturdy wheelbarrow to mix the materials. If your project is large, rent a mechanical mixer to do reduce the human labor.








, In order to contain the wet concrete, assemble the forms along the outer edges of the area you will be placing the concrete in.









Use timber boards to assemble the forms.
Brace the boards securely, ensuring that they are strong enough to support the weight of the concrete.
Check that the form work is level.
If you are plumbing underneath the concrete, ensure it is in the proper place.
Confirm that the dimensions of the forms match the dimensions laid out in your plans.

, Prepare your dry mix by mixing the cement mix and sand. There are a few common mixtures and methods for concrete preparation.










Option 1: A basic mixture for mortar (not concrete) is made using a 1:2:3 ratio of water to cement to sand by volume.

Option 2: General purpose concrete is created using a 1:2:3 ratio of cement to sand to gravel by volume.

, Incorporate the gravel or crushed stone in the dry mixture.









Add gravel or crushed stone at a ratio of up to 5 parts gravel per 1 part cement and sand mixture.
The gravel doesn't adversely affect the tensile strength of the concrete unless you add too much. If the gravel doesn't leave enough cement paste to fill the cracks between the gravel, you have added to much.
Adding too much gravel can also make it difficult to get a smooth finished surface on the cured concrete.

, Begin by adding water to the mixture slowly, mixing continuously until the concrete becomes plastic enough to place in your form.









The plastic character of the concrete is measured in ""slump"", which is determined by filling a metal ""slump"" cone with the mixed, wet concrete, lifting the cone off gently, then measuring how far the concrete sags, or slumps. The typical ""slump"" of good structural concrete is about 3 or 4 inches (7.5 or 10 cm).


, Continue mixing until the concrete has a uniform consistency.









The texture should be even throughout the mix, with no pockets of dry material.
Continue mixing for two or three more minutes to begin the hydration process, which is ultimately what causes the concrete to harden.

, Add the concrete to your form, tapping all the edges to remove air pockets, and let it settle in evenly and firmly.









Using a magnesium float or a smooth flat board, level the concrete across the top.
Do this by dragging the tool, tilted slightly upward on the leading edge, across the surface of the concrete.
This process is known as ""floating"" and will float the fine cement paste to the surface.
The fine paste is malleable and easy to smooth and finish either by brushing, brooming, or troweling when it begins to ""set"" or harden.

, After floating, leave the concrete alone until it becomes firm enough to finish without leaving tool marks.









Lay out ""knee boards"" or pieces of plywood that you can walk on without sinking into the concrete.
Crawl onto the slab with the appropriate hand tools and finish the concrete into a smooth surface.
For very large slabs, you will need a ""bull float"" and possibly a power troweling machine. This is an investment that is better left to professionals.

After the concrete is placed and finished, cover it and protect it from extreme temperatures and rain for a few days.

, Gather and clean all the tools and the mixing container as soon as you are finished with them. Cured, hard concrete is difficult to remove.









Take special care to clean rented equipment, as the rental company often will charge an additional cleaning fee when you return them.

Use the following as an example.,
Determine decimal equivalence of thickness, This is done based on 1 cubic Ft. 12"" x 12"" x 12"".,
Do the calculations.,
Divide the result 47.952 Sq.,
47.952 divided by 27 = 1.776 Cu.,
Be sure to use all of the decimal points when doing your math.",How to Measure Concrete for Patios,"


patio example: 12' x 12' patio with slab 4"" thick

12' x 12' = 144 Sq. Ft. x thickness.

;
, Examples:


6"" thick would be .500
4"" thick would be .333
3"" thick would be .250 Etc.

,


12 x 12 = 144 x .333 = 47.952 Sq. Ft. This is now converted to Cu. Yds.
A cube 3' x 3' x 3' is one cubic yard. Take 3'x 3'x 3' = 27 cubic Ft. per cubic yard.

, Ft. / 27 Cu. Ft. to reach the Cu. Yards needed.

, Yds.

, The industry standard is to add 1⁄4 yard (0.2 m). to all material orders. You do not want to be short on your concrete order.


In this case your initial order amt. would be 1.776 Cu. Yds. + .250 or 1⁄4 yard (0.2 or 0.2 m). for a grand total of 2.026 Cu. Yds. The importance of using all of the decimal points is illustrated in this case scenario.
As you can see the 2.026 Cu. Yds . in the total amt is not necessary as part of your final order because you have over ordered by 1⁄4 yard (0.2 m). This will compensate for the 2.026 yards (1.9 m). Your final order amt. would be 2.0 Cu. Yds.

Understand footing.,
Prepare the 2x4s.,
Be aware of the area.,
Pour the base concrete.,
Wait for the footing to dry.",How to Lay Concrete Blocks2," Every block of wall needs to be placed on a secure footing, which is made from concrete. Footing should be poured twice as deep as the thickness of the wall and twice as wide. If you're using standard blocks (8""), then your footing should be at least 16"" wide. Footing is formed by using a frame of 2x4s and wooden stakes., Double the width of the concrete block with two strips of 2x4s. Hold the 2x4s in place using wooden stakes along the outer wall. The 2x4s should be positioned so that they're secured by the stakes.

, Make sure you aren't preventing natural run-off water from the position of the footing. Observe the land in question for a few days prior to doing any work. Pay special attention to the area after it rains. You don't want to disrupt the flow of water so that it floods into your neighbor’s property., This will secure your potential wall firmly to the base. Fill the frame up to the edge. Level the freshly poured concrete by running a 2x4 across the top. This will spread the concrete in an even manner. Fill any spots that are low with additional concrete., Before you can begin building, you'll need to give the concrete ample time to dry. If you expect the footing to hold a substantial amount of weight, wait up to three days for it to dry.

Plan and section off the corners.,
Determine the number of blocks.,
Prepare the cement mortar.",How to Lay Concrete Blocks3," Before you begin laying the blocks, visualize all the corners of your frame. Section off the corners with wooden stakes. Use a cord or string to tie off exactly where the corners’ edges will be. Attach a chord or string to the wooden stake used to mark the corners.The string should create a circumference around your work space.

, Lay out your blocks along the dried footing and see how many you'll need for the first layer. Don't seal these down. Use a 5x8 to separate the blocks to account for the mortar.


Use corner blocks on the corners if available.
After testing, remove the blocks and prepare for the real event.

, Take the bag of dried concrete and measure out one dosage. Look on the bag's specifications for the brand you choose. Prepare a container to mix the dried mortar with water. Use a five gallon bucket that you don't mind damaging.


Never mix more mortar than you can use."
"
Spread the mortar along the corner.,
Set the corner block.,
Apply mortar to the side.,
Continue to lay the concrete blocks.,
Check the alignment.,
Apply mortar to the top.,
Stack the blocks.,
Add reinforcement.",How to Lay Concrete Blocks4," Use your trowel to spread a few slabs of mortar around the corner's base of the footing. Spread the mortar 1"" deep and 8"" wide in the marked area. Continue to spread the mortar to account for the distance of about three to four blocks.

, It is important to lay the corner block down first. Again, use a corner block if they're available. Setting the corner first will ensure an even dispersal of the rest of the blocks.

, Apply mortar to each side of the concrete block using your trowel. You'll need to apply at least an inch to each side. Once applied, position the stone in the desired location. Try to align the corner to the string set up earlier.


Don't apply mortar to outer edge of the corner.
Try not to leave any gaps when applying mortar, or it’ll weaken the bond between the blocks.

, Start laying blocks from the corner or edge of the wall so you can work in one direction.


Apply mortar at the end of the block before you place the block adjacent to it.

, Before stacking more concrete blocks on top of your initial foundation, check if everything is aligned. Use your mason's level by laying it on the first set of blocks. Check both the outside and center section of the bricks.


Tap the blocks for any alignment adjustments while the mortar is still wet.
Do not try to move a block after the concrete has set.
Measure the length and height every two or three layers., Place the mortar 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep and use the same width as the width of the block. You can then spread the mortar so it covers the length of about 3 blocks in the direction that you are laying the bricks.

, Lay the block down on top so the edge of the top block aligns with the halfway mark of the bottom block. You'll recognize the pattern as a standard among the construction sites. The top block will fit in between two bottom blocks.

, If you built fairly high walls, consider adding reinforcements. You can also use reinforcements if the ground pressure on the site is not stable. Place the 1/4"" reinforcement rods into the openings with the ends overlapping about 2"" or 3""."

This hand-operated homemade cement mixer is very simple to make.,
You should be able to construct the entire mixer in an hour or two using just a pipe wrench, a drill with 3/32"" and 1/4"" bits, a screwdriver, a hacksaw, and an adjustable wrench.

,
Begin the mixer by fabricating the three in-the-drum paddles that will do the blending.,
Then , put together the iron pipe frame by threading the pieces together.,
(To be sure the large hubs are held securely in place, first slip the axle shaft through its tubular housing and put on the wheels and washers.,
The mixing drum rotates on the shaft fastened to the central pipe cross, and is brushed with a section of electrical metallic tubing.Grease the pipe slip the conduit over that, and lubricate the assembly yet again.Slide the tub over the shaft and thread on the pipe cap to hold the components in place.

,
Finally, you can paint the assembly if you wish, and—once you attach a set of bicycle grips to the handles.,
In any case, this simple piece of equipment is well worth the ten dollars or so (and the hour or two) required to assemble it.",How to Make a Cement Mixer,";
,, If you're lucky you'll be able to find some brackets, corner supports, or angle-iron scrap that can simply be trimmed and set up. If not, however, you'll have to cut the blades from 18-gauge sheet metal, bend them, and drill two 1/4"" holes in each section. Then dig identical holes in the tub and hold the agitators in position, using 1/4"" bolts. Once that's done, you can also liberally apply bondo to the bottom and sides of the vessel's interior to seal its holes.

, Mount the smaller rollers—by pushing a nail into the disks and tee fitting and fastening it with a nut—and attach the main wheels as well.

, Mark and then drill the cotter pin holes as close as possible to the disks, to prevent the shaft from having excessive end play and wobble, then grease the axle and secure the whole assembly with two cotter pins.)

,, (Hint: Rotate the drum in the correct direction. the angled paddle blades should bite into the gritty substance and then drop it from the top of the vat.) Of course, if you wish, you can attach handles to the outside of the drum—opposite each paddle—by using longer 1/4"" bolts to secure the ""mixers."" (Be certain that your grips clear all parts of the frame during rotation.)

, And—if you hose the drum out thoroughly after each job—you'll have a trouble-free tool for years to come!

Find your cement source.,

Find large rocks to make a kiln with, and wood to make a fire with.,

Build a kiln.,

Fill a metal container such as a bucket with your shells or other cement items.,

Heat your shells or other cement items (see step 1) for 4-7 hours, or until they start to become brittle and start to crumble in to sand like dust.,
Wait for the cement to cool before using.",How to Make Cement in the Wild," You can use many different items to make cement, such as:

A soft rock named limestone.
Many easy to recognize and find items such as sea shells including oyster, sea stars, reef corals and mollusks, crab shells.
Bones of animals, fish, birds, etc.
Chalk.;
,

Make a strong fire.

, Stack rocks on top of each other around the fire with an opening on the front and top (make it look like a fireplace),

Be sure that the metal container is not your food container. You can't reuse this container for anything else. It will only serve as a trash bid after this process.
If you don't have any metal containers, place your items on a large flat rock.

, To help make your shells or other cement into a more consistent sand, stir it every 30 minutes by mixing the shells (just like cooking).


Important: If some of your shells or other raw materials do not break down to the size of sand or smaller, remove them before sealing the cement inside an airtight container.
You can reheat them in the next batch.

,

Hide the cement in a dry airtight bucket with a lid. Store at room temperature in a dry location.

Cut a large plastic bottle down to the height you want.,
Choose a smaller plastic bottle for the inside of you vase.,
Mix the concrete in a plastic tub or bucket.,
Consider adding some color for a marbled effect.,
Fill the bottle ½ to ¾ of the way with concrete.,
Tap the bottle against your work surface.,
Push a smaller bottle down into the concrete.,
Add more concrete, if necessary.,
Smooth out the concrete, if desired.,
Let the concrete dry.,
Remove the outer plastic bottle.,
Cut down the inner plastic bottle, if necessary.,
Let the concrete dry further, if necessary.,
Consider painting your vase.,
Add some felt pads to the bottom of your vase to protect your furniture.,
Use your vase.",How to Make a Concrete Vase," Choose a large plastic bottle that you want to use as the base of your vase. Use a craft blade to cut the top portion off. This will not only make inserting the smaller bottle easier, but pouring the cement in as well., The bottle needs to be small enough to fit inside the larger bottle with at least ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) of space between the two.If the bottle has a label on it, be sure to remove it first, otherwise, it will show up on the finished vase.

, Follow the instructions on the container as each brand will be a little different. In most cases, you will need to stir 1 part water into 4 parts of cement.You can use a paint stick or even a trowel to mix the concrete.


Always wear gloves and protective goggles while mixing concrete., This works great with white concrete. Scoop out some of your concrete into a separate container. Stir in some pigment into it until evenly combined. Pour the white concrete into the dyed concrete. Stir it a few times until it starts to look marbled and swirly.Make sure that you are using concrete-appropriate pigments. If they are not sold alongside the concrete in the store, you will need to buy them online.

, Pour the concrete in slowly so as to minimize air bubbles. Don't worry if the concrete doesn't fill your large bottle all the way. The next couple of steps will fix that.

, This will remove any air bubbles and make the surface of your vase smoother in the end.Keep in mind that the finished product may still have some air bubbles. This is perfectly normal and part of the beauty of concrete.

, Do not push it all the way to the bottom of the vase, however. As you push the bottle into the cement, the cement will raise and fill the rest of the big bottle.If the concrete overflows, simply brush it away.Try not to get any concrete into the smaller bottle.

, If the concrete level isn't high enough, use a spoon to scoop more concrete into the large bottle. Keep doing this until the bottle is filled.Once again, avoid getting any concrete into the small bottle.

, Wet your finger, then use it to smooth down the concrete between the two bottles. You can also leave it as it is for a more jagged, rustic touch., How long this takes depends on what type of cement you used. Quick-set concrete can dry in as little as 15 minutes.Other types can take up to 3 to 5 hours, or even longer.Refer to the package your concrete came in for more specific drying times.

, Once the concrete is solid, use a craft blade to slice down the side of the plastic bottle. Tear it away in strips, revealing the concrete vase.You may have to use pliers to pull the plastic away from the concrete., You may have portions of the small, inner plastic bottle sticking out of the concrete. This needs to go. Use a craft blade to cut the smaller bottle down until it is flush with the top of the vase.Do not remove the plastic bottle. If you do, the concrete vase may absorb too much water.

, After you remove the concrete from the bottle, it may still feel a little damp. Set it some place where it will not be disturbed, and allow it to dry completely.

, You can paint it a solid color, or you can paint designs onto it, such as strips or spots. Painting the bottom of your vase a soft pastel color will look very chic!You don't have to do this, but it's a great way to make you vase look more interesting!

, You don't have to do this, but it would be a good idea if you plan on keeping your vase on surface on delicate or fragile surfaces. Simply turn your vase over, then stick 3 to 4 felt circles to the underside., You can use your vase to display fresh or silk flowers. If you use real flowers, fill the inner vase with water. The plastic, glass, or metal will create a barrier, and prevent the concrete from absorbing all the water.

Use a quality rake.,
Position your body properly.,
Transport your leaves with a tarp.,
Stomp on your pile.",How to Rake Leaves1," Many people have an old rake in the tool shed, but an older rake may not be as efficient as a new one. To make raking more efficient, invest in a quality rake.








Look for a rake that has an ergonomic handle and that is lightweight. This will help to reduce the strain on your back.
Choosing a rake that has a wide end will also help to ensure that you can rake up as many leaves a possible with every sweep.;
, Proper body positioning is also essential to successful raking. Some things to keep in mind when you rake include:








Your hand positions. When you hold the rake, grasp it with both hands and change your hand positions now and then as you rake.
Your knees. Keep your knees slightly bent. Try not to bend too far forward at the waist.
Your movement. It is helpful to move backwards as you rake. Try to rake the leaves towards you as you walk backwards.

, You can also save time and energy by raking your leaves onto a tarp, sheet, or canvas cloth. Before you begin raking, lay out a tarp or other large piece of material on the ground. Then, begin raking the leaves onto the tarp.








Rake one area of your yard until the tarp is full, then drag the tarp to your main pile.
If you prefer, you can also rake your leaves directly into bags. Then, you can transport the bags to a mulch pile or other disposal area.

, As you rake leaves onto the tarp or into bags, make sure that you stomp them down now and then. This will help to ensure that you have plenty of room for all of your leaves.To stomp on your leaves, simply step on them or put one foot into the leaf bag to stomp them down.
If you are using bags, just try to avoid filling the bags too full. You should still be able to pick the bags up easily."

Make a plan and decide on a theme.,
Measure and list.,
Before you move anything, design your room.,
Remember if your parents aren't too enthusiastic about the idea, now is your time to show them.,
Ransack the attic.,
Look at yard sales within walking distance.,
Go to the store.,
Find the paint you want.,
While the paint is being mixed, browse the other accessories.,
Pick up your paint and head on to the bedding section.,
Look at fabric.,
Start redecorating!,
Know that if you have old things that don't really fit your new room, don't throw them away!,
Try re-painting furniture!,
Start choosing different patterns.,
Perhaps you have clothes or small items you want to ""show-off"".,
Go shopping when it is Black Friday.,
Buy at places that allow double coupons!",How to Redecorate Your Bedroom Cheaply," How do you want it to look? Look through magazines or websites such as 'Pottery Barn Teen' or 'Delias' for ideas, since they often have pictures of rooms. Decide on things you like and things you don't, colors you like and design details. You should have a rough idea of how you want your room to look.;
, Did you ever wonder how big your room is? How much stuff do you have in it? Take a tape measure and find out how long the walls are. Make sure to write this down or you will forget it. Your room might be a lot bigger than you thought. Now, list every piece of furniture that you have in there. You might have a lot, but be patient. Also, measure your bed, dresser, and some of the larger pieces of furniture.

, You need to know what you want your room to look like, but don't get too set on one idea. If you are copying a room from a catalog, look at the furniture. Ask yourself, ""Well, they have a cast-iron bed, and mine is wooden. How would the room change if the bed was like mine?"" How would your white desk look if you painted it blue? You can give furniture a completely new look by painting it.

, If you have time, make a design board. Cut out pictures of things you liked from the rooms you looked at, and draw a floor plan and maybe a sketch of how you think it will look when it's done. Once they see how much work you put into this, they will probably be more willing to let you. Make sure you point out things like, ""See this? That's just like my bed right now."" If they don't like something, be willing to listen to their opinion. If they say no, don't complain, tell them calmly that you understand if they do not support your decision. Accept their decision maturely, and they might change their minds. If they don't, you got plenty of practice for when you become an interior designer, and you'll have a plan when they finally decide that you can redecorate your room.

, A lot of time there'll be things up there that have been forgotten but would go great in your room. Before you move anything down there, though, get permission. A good way to ask would be, ""Mom, I know you're busy, but I saw some things in the shed that would look good in my room. When you have time, can you come with me and tell me if I can move them into my room?""

, It's a long shot, but you might find the perfect chair, lamp, or picture frames there, and they'll be totally unique(and cheaper, too!)

, Start by making a list of everything you still need, and take pictures of things you liked if you can. Now, go to Target, Walmart, or some place that sells everything from paint to rugs to lamps, and sells it cheap.

, Make sure that you buy enough, but not too much. But, since you measured your walls earlier, you know exactly how many square feet of wall you have to cover. Also, get rollers and brushes if you don't have them, along with masking tape and anything else you'll need. If you're doing an interesting finish, like painted-on marble, ask the people how you would do that. If you aren't sure, stick with solid colors.

, Rugs, lamps, and translucent plastic boxes are always useful. You're probably going to need a cart. Keep a mental tally of how much this will cost you (just round up each item to the next dollar, you probably won't pay that much but it's always better to over-estimate it). You'll probably find some furnishings that are almost identical to what you picked out of the catalog. They might not be identical, but they have the same idea. Keep your eye out for these.

, Start with the bedding. Do you see curtains or sheets or a comforter that you just love? Keep these in mind while you head off to sewing.

, If you can sew, see if there's any fabric that would compliment your sheets or curtains. Make throw pillows out of it (You won't need more than a yard, probably). Now go over to the trim. Would that pom-pom trim look good on the bottom of your curtains? How would that gold braid look as a tieback?

, Take all the furniture out, and get to painting the walls. While you wait for them to dry, paint the furniture. Then set it up like you had planned. Put all the accessories up, make up your bed with your new bedding, and you're done!

, Keep them in boxes in your closet, or buy colored plastic boxes that coordinate and put it in there. The boxes can be left in your room and will look great.

, Your furniture may look ugly, the colors may not go with your room. Maybe the wood is chipping. If that happens, just sand the wood and paint to your desired color.

, Maybe you have one pattern that you like. It has very beautiful colors! BUT you can also try adding a whole different pattern (the same color of course)! This will make your room MUCH nicer looking. But be careful, you may clash colors.

, Okay, this probably sounds stupid, but maybe getting a jewelry organizer and buying hooks and mounting it up on the wall WILL make your room look nice. Perhaps you have clothes you want to ""show-off"". Taking off a closet door may look nice. (unless, of course, it's not organized and is messy.

, YOU SAVE LOTS!!

, You will save lots. Bed Bath and Beyond have a forever warranty AND addition to that you may use their $5 off your purchase of $25 or more several times. They ALSO allow coupons expired. I look at Bed Bath and Beyond and say, ""What an amazing place!""

Wait for all the leaves to fall.,
Mow early fall leaves into your lawn.,
Choose a calm day to rake.,
Ensure that the leaves are dry.",How to Rake Leaves2," It is a good idea to wait until all of the leaves have fallen to begin raking. Raking too soon in the season may be a wasted effort. If there are more leaves on the trees, then more leaves will fall.








Watch the trees to determine when they are mostly or completely bare. Then, start your raking.

, In early fall, there might not be enough leaves on the ground to justify raking your whole lawn. However, if you have some early fall leaves that are bothering you, then you can mow them into your lawn. This will help to give your lawn extra nutrients and save you some time.







, Windy conditions will make raking more difficult. If possible, wait for a calm day to do your raking. However, if you have to rake on a windy day, then try to rake the leaves with the wind and not against it.








For example, you could place your pile on the side of the yard that the wind is blowing towards. Then, rake all of your leaves in that direction.

, Check the leaves for dampness before you begin raking. If the leaves are wet, then they will be harder to rake. They will also weigh down the bags or other containers that you put them in, which will make it harder for you to move them.To make your job a little easier, wait until the leaves are dry to start raking them. Watch the weather and check the leaves before you get started.

"
"
Wear gloves.,
Put on some closed toed shoes.,
Wear long sleeves and pants.,
Use a mask if you have allergies.",How to Rake Leaves3," Holding the handle of the rake can cause blisters on your hands. Your hands may also get dirty from picking up leaves from your pile and placing them into bags. To protect your hands, make sure that you wear a pair of heavy duty canvas or leather work gloves.








You can find these gloves at any home improvement store.

, Rakes can hurt if you drag them across your foot. There may also be insects and other small creatures hiding in your yard. To protect yourself from injury and bites, make sure that you are wearing a pair of closed toed shoes.Work boots are a good choice for doing yard work.

, Wearing long sleeves and pants is also a good idea when you are doing yard work. Even if the weather is not cold yet, there may be insects, snakes, and other small creatures lurking in your yard. Wearing long pants and long sleeves will help to protect you from bites.A pair of jeans and a long sleeve shirt is a good choice for raking leaves.
You can wear a jacket and a hat too if the weather is cold.

, If you will be mulching your leaves or if you have allergies, then you may want to wear a mask over your face. This will help to protect you from breathing in the dust and allergens released as you rake and mulch your leaves.You can find a mask at a home improvement store.

Start with small objects.,
Use colors that compliment each other.,
Change the bedding.,
Manage the chaos.,
Maximize free space.,
Paint your walls.,
Align picture frames in a systematic order.,
Use lighting to your advantage.,
Add individuality.,
Bring an outdoor touch inside.",How to Redecorate Your Home Affordably," The first and foremost task is to give magnitude to small objects. The greatest changes occur through the presence of small objects. In order to make the home colorful, jovial, complete and spacious, people hang curtains, blinds or paintings. Such things are not time consuming, and by shopping at outlets, thrift stores, and relatively inexpensive home stores, you can make small changes without going out of budget.;
, No room requires everything to match, but having colors that go well together can really help the overall impression of the décor.


It doesn't have to be very expensive or laborious to choose color coordinate items. The trick here is to purchase neutral furniture which goes with different color schemes.
If a piece of furniture has an odd color, paint it and swathe with sealant. It does not only save the paint, but makes the furniture look new as well. In several cases you will have to spend as little as $30 to make an old piece of furniture look new.

, It seems like a small feature, but it is true that bedding makes a room more tidy, perfect and organized. You spend almost one third of your precious time in the bedroom. On a tight budget, the new wall paint and eye-catching bedding make a great difference. If your budget allows, purchase your desired bed which can fit in the bedroom properly., One of the easy-to-manage and budget-oriented tips is to control the mess. If you have purchased the best products and decoration pieces, but they aren't arranged well, they'll be less impressive. Avoid clutter. The unnecessary things can be sold online.


De-clutter your space to give a smart look. Organize your mail, deal with dirty clothes and organize anything that's lying around. Plan to spare 10 minutes after dinner for this task.

, More floor area can give a broad view of the room. The room seems larger and can become more luxurious as well. On the other hand, a reduced amount of floor space can make a room seem unappealing, smaller and cheaper.

, Consider having a creative accent wall, too, with a different color or decorative elements. A lick of paint can make a room seem like new. Excessive use of pictures can make a wall (and room) seem cluttered; however arranging a wall painting, a small beautiful shelf or a family photograph gives a personal touch.

, Whenever you add a wall hanging, position it at the center of the wall. It should not be too high up or too far down. The middle of the wall and the center area is the best area for hanging striking frames.

, One of the cost effective ways to ""redecorate"" is to light your house better. Try to avoid incandescent and overhead lights as these are harsh and give an uncomfortable appearance to a room. Room lamps have a diffuse light which gets balanced if lamps are placed on the two sides of the bed. Lamp shades help make a room warm, attractive and pleasant.

, There is a great difference between a hotel room and your personal room. Your room is personal as it gives a sense of individuality. For example, in your own room, you may have arranged photographs of memorable moments with family members. Moreover, the use of candles, flowers and favorite wall color gives your own rooms a more personal touch. Add the things you like the most in your room. It will give you comfy feeling and sense of individualism.

, The natural beauty of spring is a joy. Bring something fresh and natural into your home. Add some plants to your home. House plants make the surrounding fresh and change the mood.


In order to capitalize the outdoor view, hang a mirror diagonally across from your windows. If you are living in a busy or municipal area, add some photographs or paintings of landscapes/nature to your décor.

Select your color.,
Mix bright oxides with white cement.,
Combine gray cement with darker oxides.,
Obtain a high-quality oxide.",How to Oxide Concrete1," There are a multitude of oxides available that you can add to concrete. Choose from red, light brown, dark brown, yellow, and black, among other colors.Black is typically used in home driveways and gas stations because it hides oil stains and grime.
Brown hues are common in industrial flooring and some homes.
Colored concretes are common in concrete masonry units, concrete pavers, and other forms of decorative concrete.;
, Gray cement, when combined with a bright oxide, will detract from the brilliance of the color. The concrete that results will be dull in color. Therefore, if you want to create pink, blue, green, yellow, or another pastel or brightly colored concrete, use white cement when mixing your concrete.For an even brighter color, mix your concrete with a white aggregate.

, Gray cement works best in concert with oxides that are brown, black, or gray. Gray cement is also best when trying to achieve dull red, burgundy, or earth tones., High-quality oxides will bear a certification on the label confirming that the product meets the standards of the International Organization for Standardization. Only use oxides that bear ISO certification on their labels."

Consider buying a new bed.,
Look for sheets for kids.,
Make or buy wall art.,
Buy cheap furniture.,
Add some floral elements.,
Display some china, ceramics or pottery.,
Consider lighting.,
Buy a new computer.,
Get a Tv.,
Fill up your master bedroom desk.",How to Makeover a Master Bedroom on a Budget," If you want to get a new bed, don't go king or queen sizes. Try out a double. A double is big enough for you and your mate (if you have one), and can be as cheap as one hundred dollars or equivalent.;
, Try teen bedding, and you can find tons of (just as) mature bedding. And, children's bedding is often so much cheaper, my little pony bed sheets at 28, why not! (Unless they specialize for children)

, Do you like to show off your creative (and possibly artistic) side? If so, you must want wall art. But paintings and designs are SO expensive! Well, you can get original-artist paintings at art.com. They often have sales, too! Then provide all sorts of wall art.

, You may want new furniture, especially since it's been beat up over the years. Try Target, which has many sales and is, quite frankly, cheap! They have lots of selection, from shelves to desks to nightstands. Second hand shops are a good option too.

, If you enjoy that fresh look of gorgeous flowers, they also take lots of time to maintain! For rare-looking and pretty flowers, just buy plastic ones. This sounds cheap, but if you purchase at the right place, a bouquet of them can cost 5 bucks.

, If you enjoy pottery, you may want some extra inspiration, aside from your already-created masterpieces. If you head down to Target or Walmart, they have pretty vases in all sorts of shapes and colors, starting at 3 dollars.

, Night lamps? No problem! Check out Target's store and website. They have a hunk of colors, if not every single one. They also last long, and you just place in some batteries! (Switches come in different types)

, If you want a new laptop, don't always assume you must have a Macintosh computer. You can always pick a different kind! You can get the same great quality in a Dell. The cheapest computers I've ever seen are Fujitsu. They can be as low as one hundred and fifty dollars. And, what's the difference? Macs are just gadgets that you can get free if you have Google Chrome.

, For a TV, flat screens aren't so important. You can get a perfectly square, high-definition plasma screen for about 50 dollars cheaper. Stores will constantly try to get more out of you.

, You might find that you have beat up desk supplies, like notebooks or staplers. You may have run out of tape, and markers or sharpies can be running out of ink. Go to places like Office Depot, Staples, and Walmart for a huge selection of desk/school supplies. You can even get clear plastic binders and regular binders.

Measure your ingredients.,
Measure the oxide in an appropriate proportion.,
Choose your mixer.,
Mix dry ingredients first.,
Add the wet ingredients next.",How to Oxide Concrete2," The amount of each ingredient you decide to use will depend on the needs of your project. For instance, you will need more sand, cement, water, oxide, and aggregate if you are creating concrete for a large parking lot than if you are creating concrete to pave a backyard patio.To measure your ingredients properly, consult manufacturer instructions for your cement, oxide pigment, and other concrete materials before adding them to the mixer.
Generally, you can mix concrete that is one part cement, two parts sand, and three parts gravel (or some other aggregate). The total weight of the water you add should be about half the weight of the cement.

, When adding oxide to concrete, it’s important not to add too much. Generally, you should add oxide at a rate of 5% of the weight of the concrete’s cement content.For instance, if you have 100 pounds of cement, you should add 5 pounds of oxide.
Adding oxide at a concentration of slightly more than 5% of the weight of the cement content will result in a darker hue.
Adding oxide at a lower concentration will result in a lighter hue.
Adding too much oxide will negatively impact the quality and durability of the concrete.
If you’re trying to achieve a particular color, you might need to do some experimenting in order to discover the right oxide concentration.

, There are three main varieties of mixers. The type of mixer you decide to use depends on the type of concrete you’re mixing as well as your concrete needs.Drum mixers are used to produce large volumes of concrete. These can range from large drum truck mixers (which can produce up to nine cubic yards of concrete) to smaller non-tilting mixers (which produce about one cubic yard of concrete). One sort of drum mixer, the tilting drum mixer, is the best option if you’re using large-sized aggregate or very thick concrete.
Pan mixers use blades fixed to an assembly that stir the concrete as the vertical shaft rotates. Like tilting drum mixers, pan mixers are best used with zero-slump or relatively stiff concrete mixes. Pan mixers are best when you need to produce small or medium-sized batches that range from 0.25 cubic yards to 2.5 cubic yards of concrete.
Continuous mixers are typically reserved for very large projects (dams, foundations, retaining walls, and so on). They usually use a conveyor belt to continuously feed the mixer concrete-creating materials.

, Concrete requires three dry ingredients: powdered oxide pigment, sand, and gravel (or some other aggregate). These ingredients should be mixed for at least 30 seconds.The method by which you mix the dry ingredients depends on the total mass of dry ingredients you’re using. For large batches used to create, say, a parking lot, you will need a continuous mixer or a drum truck mixer.
If you’re adding dry ingredients to an older, less efficient mixer, your dry ingredients may need to be mixed for up to 90 seconds.
The aggregate you decide to use also affects the length of time you need to mix the dry ingredients. Consult the instructions for your aggregate before adding it to the mixer.

, After mixing the oxide and other dry ingredients, add the cement and water. Mix everything until is has an even texture. Your concrete will then be ready for use.If your concrete is too aqueous and sloshes about, you could add a water reducing agent (also known as a super plasticizer) to the mixture. The amount you need to add depends on the volume of concrete you are producing. Consult manufacturer directions for more information.
If your concrete is too thick, add water slowly in small amounts until it becomes more workable.
Adding more water will lighten the final color of the concrete. Using less water will saturate the color of the concrete.

Create a form.,
Level the ground.,
Pour your concrete.,
Level the concrete out.,
Finish the concrete.,
Protect the concrete from being disturbed.,
Cure the concrete.,
Clean the concrete.",How to Oxide Concrete3," The form is the wooden mold into which your concrete will be poured, and will give the concrete its final shape. The form you use depends on the needs of your project.All forms are made by simply nailing wooden boards together into the shape you wish the concrete to assume.
If you’re interested in creating a concrete walkway, for instance, you will probably make several small concrete squares of similar size. Therefore, you will need to turn four equally-sized two-by-fours on their edges so that the narrow part of the board is on the ground. Nail the boards together at their corners.
If you’re pouring concrete for the foundation of a home, you will use a single, much larger form.

, If you’re pouring concrete into an area of the ground that you want it to remain in, try to flatten the ground as much as possible. Use a rake and back hoe to achieve a relatively even surface on the area you will be pouring concrete onto., The method by which you pour your concrete depends on the mixer you used to create it. If your concrete is in a dump truck mixer, for instance, your job is easy, since you can just back the truck up to the appointed spot and press the dump button to pour the concrete from the truck. If your concrete is in a drum mixer, you will have to manually rotate the drum to pour the concrete out., Once the concrete has been poured, you’ll need to level and finish it. First, run the screed across the surface of the concrete, pulling it toward you. Discard excess that comes off the back end of the form. Then, sweep the darby across the surface of the concrete in overlapping arcs. This will fill voids, push down lumps, and flatten the surface.Two passes across the surface of the concrete with the darby should be enough.
After leveling out the concrete, water will pool on the surface. Wait for the water to reabsorb into the concrete before proceeding.

, Run an edger around the edges of the concrete to loosen it from the form and smooth the sharp edges. Next, if you want to subdivide the slab (as you might if you’re pouring concrete for a sidewalk, for instance), use the straightedge and groover to push cracks into the concrete slab to a depth of at least 25% of its total height.

Finally, smooth the concrete over one more time with the floater. Lift the leading edge of the floater and sweep over it in overlapping arcs, just as you did with the darby.
After the concrete has dried and hardened somewhat, repeat the smoothing-over process with your steel trowel. Make two or three passes with the trowel to get a smooth finish on your concrete.

, Once the concrete has assumed the proper form, leave it alone. Set up a sign alerting people not to step on the wet concrete if such a possibility exists.It’s impossible to tell how long it will take for the concrete to dry. The time it takes for concrete to dry depends on local environmental conditions. In hot, dry weather, concrete will dry faster. In cool or shaded areas, it will dry more slowly.

, Curing the concrete will produce a stronger and more durable slab. Cover the concrete with plastic and sprinkle it with water several times each day for about one week.After the concrete is completely dry and cured, remove the form.

, If you’ve added pure iron oxide to your concrete, it will not fade. However, after being poured and set, the concrete will collect dirt and debris that make the concrete appear faded. Every few months (or as needed), spray the concrete with a pressure washer."

Gloss canvas creates a work of art equal to something you would buy.
Important works of art or keepsakes will benefit from UV resistant canvas.;
, Visit art supply stores, galleries and museum stores to get an idea of what is offered. Select the fine art file you want for your new canvas print.


Saved or scanned images will print directly on canvas.
Make certain the file has good clarity and contrast at your desired size before making your final decision.

,


On a PC, open Windows Photo and Fax Viewer. Choose the right document or image from within this program and then go to ""Printing Options."" Choices will range from wallet size to full-page photos. Set your printer, too.
On a Mac, select ""Application."" Edit the graphic file so it is the way you want it and select your printer if it is not already chosen.

, Run a trial copy on plain paper to get the look and feel of the final product. You may want a border on all sides of your canvas if you're later turning it into a canvas print to hang.


If you do want a border, 1 1/2"" (3.75 cm) on all sides is a good amount, depending on the size of your canvas and how much of a 3D effect you're going for.

, This is your best option for fine art and canvas. It is capable of border-less printing and utilizes the entire printable area of each sheet.


This is the feed on the back of your printer, not one of the ones lying on top. It can handle thicker sheets much, much better.

, A small strip of paper will feed the canvas into your printer. It needs to run the entire width of the paper on the bottom. If you have a 13"" wide sheet of canvas, you'll need two strips of paper. Here's how to do it:


Each strip of paper should be about 1"" (2.5 cm) wide. Cut it straight with a pair of scissors.
Tape each strip of paper to the back of the canvas on the bottom, where it'll feed into the printer. They need to be flush against the canvas sheet and straight like a natural edge of paper – if they aren't, the paper will feed in at an angle.

, If you use Photoshop, click on the Image pull-down menu and choose ""Canvas Size."" If not, just open your ""Print Settings"" box and add an extra inch to the bottom.


Let's say you have a 13"" x 9"" sheet of canvas that you want to fill completely. With the extra inch at the bottom, you now have 14"". To keep it on your canvas, add the extra inch – more if you're not using the entire thing.
If you have an ""anchoring"" option, use it. This adds space to any size of your file, so click the bottom center anchor, adding space at the bottom. Again, set it at 1"".

, Insert the leader side first, with the paper facing up (if it prints face up, of course). Make sure it's going in perfectly straight, too.


Oh, and make sure your printer is turned on, there's enough ink in the colors you need, etc.

, ""Rear manual"" is likely not the default setting on your computer. Set up your printer so it feeds correctly. Adjust the color and gradient, too, and set the width of the paper as well, if possible.


Go into ""User Details"" and make sure your width and height of the picture (not of the paper) are set up correctly. Check your anchors, borders, and everything else as well.

, Let the canvas dry completely before you handle it in order to prevent smudging.


You can then wrap the piece around a small box frame or other support to create a stretched canvas, original piece of art.

Measure your space and cut your string.,
Hang your string using nails or tape.,
Hang your pictures.,
Change as needed.",How to Make a Picture Clothesline," Usually a wall works best for this project, but it's possible to use something else--a large bookcase, the back of a door, or across a window frame.;
, You'll need string, nails or tape (thumbtacks work as a substitute for nails), and clothespins. You can switch it up a little and modify these materials; use beaded string or strips of pretty fabric. You can decorate your clothespins with paint or markers. Get creative!

, This step is simple. You don't even need measuring tape for it--just unroll your string across your wall and cut accordingly.

, If you can use nails on your chosen space, that's your best bet. They will last longer than tape. Pound a nail in where one end of your string will be. Tie the end of your string around it, being sure it's sturdy. You might want to pound the nail up a little, so the string won't slip off. Then extend your string out to about the middle, and pound another nail. Pull your string taut to that spot and tie around that nail. Finally, pound a nail in at the end of your string, pull taut, and tie off. Whew! Now you've got your first clothesline! Basically you have three nails, with the string tied around each one to make one long, strong line.

, Use your clothespins to hang your snapshots. Horizontal pictures should probably be hung with two pins to keep them straight. Vertical pictures can be hung with one pin placed in the center.

, The best part about this project is how versatile it is. You can switch your pictures and change your whole room in a few minutes. Use all black and white pictures for a more formal look. Hyper-colored pictures can really brighten up a space as well.

Begin by making three lists.,
See how far items on the first list can cover for items on the second two lists.,
Start searching.,
Consider free furniture.,
Go curb shopping.,
Look for discounted furniture.",How to Furnish Your Place on a Tight Budget,"


List the things you already have.
List the things you absolutely need, such as a place to sleep and some way to cook food.
Make a wish list. Go crazy here: for example, ""I want a large white dresser in French rococo style."";
, This will immediately reduce some of your costs if existing things can do double acts, such as a bed with a bland cover and the right pillows along the back can be a couch, and so forth.


Throw rugs can become curtains, and bedspreads turned into drapes.
Paint on old pieces of furniture can make them seem new again, as well as suggesting new possibilities for ways of reusing them.
Throw slip covers over any chair and suddenly the chair becomes respectable again.

, Don't try to buy everything at once. If you snatch the first stick of furniture you find, you pay more than if you wait and look for bargains. When you buy or find any items, think beyond their immediate appearance. You can always paint or alter them. Paint a hideous ecru dresser white and add rococo touches.

, Look on Yahoo Groups for Freecycle. Find one that serves a place near you, for example, Michigan Freecycle. Freecycle is a group that uses email to hook up people who want to give or get something for free. You can also look at Freecycle's official website at Freecycle.org.


Look on Craigslist.com. If you open your local Craigslist under ""for sale"" you can find a subcategory ""free."" This is a great place to find freebies.
Ask your family and friends for furniture that they don't need anymore.
Get on Facebook and Twitter and let people know you're willing to take their old stuff off their hands for free. Be specific about what you need and let them know it's for a good cause!
Don't neglect the chance of trading or bartering your skills in return for furniture and appliances.

, Look for things left on the curb for pick up. Again, with these three entries, think of the long term. College kids leave stuff at the end of a school year, and other people may throw out perfectly good furniture when they buy new furniture.


Designated trash days can be a great time to pick up much needed furniture.
Visit recycling depots at municipal landfills. Many of these places keep furniture, appliances and other household items that are still in good condition and sell them for very low prices.

, If you don't succeed with Freecycle, Craigslist or your Facebook friends, then you could look at Craigslist in the ""for sale"" category or visit discounts stores.


Go the resale route. Look at thrift stores such as Goodwill and the Salvation Army.
Visit secondhand furniture stores in your area.
Don't neglect normal furniture showrooms. Ask them about their floor stock, damaged stock, and sales items. Ask for deep discounts!
There are also unfinished furniture stores with inexpensive unpainted and unvarnished items.

,, Place the strips on the side of the box you want to connect to the wall. Holding the strips firmly in place for about 15 seconds should suffice to keep them on the box.

, It doesn't need to be big, nor does it need to be clean cut, because it will also be on the side of the box that faces the wall. Just cut it about 1 inch by 1 inch and cut a piece of tape long enough to go over on both sides (as in the photo).

,, Place your fingers against the Command strip from the inside, and press firmly for thirty seconds. This is imperative to keep the box on the wall.

, This will help keep the box from collapsing under the weight of the figure, or bending to the sides.

, The adhesive on the strips needs time to cure for a while. Without this, there is a fair chance the box will peel off of the wall. You don't want to be woken up by Chewbacca falling on you in the night.

Gather your supplies.,
Print out your image on a laser printer.,
Use a thick coat of gel medium to cover the front of your canvas completely.,
Line the image up with the canvas — ink-side down — and press down to flatten.,
Allow canvas to dry overnight.,
Starting on one side of the canvas, lightly wet the surface with water from a spray bottle.,
Apply a final coat of gel medium to the canvas once you've stripped it of paper.",How to Transfer Photos Onto Canvas1," For this project, which gives you a beautifully rustic transfer onto canvas, you need four basic materials. See the ""Things You'll Need"" section. Nothing fancy — let's get started!;
, Laser printers work best for photo transfer onto canvas; ink jet printers will not get the job done, unfortunately. How do you tell which kind of printer you have? If your toner is large, it's most likely a laser printer; if it's small and compact, it's most likely an ink-jet.The size of your image and the size of the canvas don't need to be exact, although they look best when the two match perfectly. If you photograph is slightly smaller than the canvas — e.g. less than an inch (3 cm) — the final product will still look professional.
Get ready for the image to be reversed. If you think reversal will look strange, or you're partial to the current arrangement on the photo, reverse the image before you print it out.

, No need to spend a whole lot of time on this step, but do make sure that there are no gaps in coverage, or the photo ultimately won't transfer.

, Instead of trying to line up the whole image perfectly in one fell swoop, line up one edge first so that two corners of the canvas and two corners of the photo match perfectly. Once that side is put onto the gelled canvas, flatten the rest of the photo onto the remaining canvas in a sweeping motion.

, Place in a cool place devoid of excessive moisture while the gel medium dries.

, Using your hand, scrape away the wet paper to reveal the reversed image underneath. Continue spraying and lightly scraping until you've revealed as much of the image as desired.


Don't scrape too hard or you'll scrape away the underlying image. Expect for it to be messy.
Don't be afraid to leave a small amount of distress or paper on the canvas. This is what gives the image its rustic or vintage look, and it pairs especially well with black and white or sepia tone images.

, Allow the canvas to dry again overnight before hanging, gifting, or using."

Look at as much art as possible before you make your selection.,
Search for great art that you favor.,
Visit school art shows.,
Select art by size to fit a particular space.,
Choose artwork that harmonizes with the colour of your room.,
Opt for paintings that match the style of the paintings is your room.,
Amend your room if the painting doesn't suit.,

Experiment to learn what pleases you and what doesn't.",How to Select Art for Your Home," In addition to museums and for-profit galleries, check out local outdoor exhibitions, co-op and non-profit galleries, and art in public spaces such as banks, restaurants and libraries. The Internet is another great way to find a large variety of fine art available worldwide. One advantage of using the Internet is that you can search for the specific kind of art you are interested in, whether it's photography, impressionism, bronze sculpture, or abstract painting.;
, Online auctions sites are one great place to search. Check out the self-representing artists for your best values. Stay clear of the assembly line Chinese art, as these are mostly ripoffs from legitimate artists on eBay. There are many artists who represent themselves at a savings to you. Check out the S.R.A., Folk Art and Contemporary categories for your best buys! Don't forget to check feedback. Numerous negatives will often burn you. Read about the seller and ask questions before you bid. If they don't respond, look on down the line. You'll find a seller you like who will respond.

, If you live near a big city which has a well-known Art School, find out when students are going to exhibit their work and attend the show. Though students at famous European schools are likely to be asking more for their work than unknown small town schools, you are still going to be buying cheaper than at a commercial gallery, you know the artist is a top performer in their year, you can be sure they have put a lot of work into their piece, and who knows, they may become very famous and their early paintings will be sought after!

, Art that is too large will overwhelm and art that is too small will be lost and look out of proportion. The bolder the art, the more room it needs to breathe. Measure the space you want to hang the art and leave enough ""white space"" so that the painting will not feel crowded.

, When selecting a painting to match color, select one or two of the boldest colors in your room and look for art that has those colors in it. You're not looking for an exact match here. Picking up one or two of the same colors will send a message that the painting belongs in this environment.

, If your house is filled with antiques, for example, you'll want to use antique-style frames on the paintings you hang there. If you have contemporary furniture in large rooms with high ceilings, you'll want to hang large contemporary paintings.

, If you find that when you get the art home and place it on a wall or pedestal, it doesn't work with its surroundings. If you bring a painting home and it clashes with its environment, first try hanging it in various rooms on different walls. It may look great in a place you hadn't planned on hanging it. If you can't find a place where the art looks its best, you may need to make some changes in the room, such as moving furniture or taking down patterned wallpaper and repainting in a neutral color. The changes will be worth making in order to enjoy the art you love.

, As a rule, paintings should be hung so that the center of the painting is at eye level. Sculpture may sit on the floor, a table, or pedestal. Rules should be considered guidelines only, however, so feel free to experiment. One collector hung an acrylic painting on her bedroom ceiling so she could better view it while lying down.

, A room crowded with other colors, textures, and objects will take the spotlight away from the art.

, Selecting and displaying art is an art in itself. You will be well-rewarded for the time you invest by finding more satisfaction both in the art and in your home.

Gather your materials.,
Trim the tissue paper so that it's the same size as the canvas you'll be using.,
Straighten out any kinks or creases in the tissue paper with a clothes iron.,
Manually place the tissue paper into your printer tray and print out your desired image.,
Apply a thin coat of Modge Podge to the canvas, making sure to get even coverage.,
Working quickly, center the tissue paper picture over the canvas before pressing it down onto the adhesive.,
With a clean foam brush, smooth out any creases in the tissue paper.,
If necessary, trim any remaining tissue paper from the sides of the canvas for a clean look.

,
Cover with another layer of clear adhesive before letting dry (optional).",How to Transfer Photos Onto Canvas2," This special way to preserve color images requires only the following supplies: fine tissue paper; an iron or other flattering material like a stack of books; a canvas; and sealer glue, such as Modge Podge.

, Place the tissue paper onto a table or other hard surface and lay the framed canvas upside down onto it; the front of the canvas and the tissue paper should be touching. With a pencil, trace around all four sides of the canvas, and then cut around the four corners of the tissue paper.

, Use the high setting without any steam.

, This may take a few tries, but the end result will be worth it. Adjust your printer settings so that the printed image is only as big as the tissue paper.


For this reason, it's best to use a standard size when selecting a canvas to use. An 8 1/2 x 11 canvas, for example, would be extremely easy to work with, while a nonstandard-sized canvas would be more difficult to get a match for.

, Use a brush to get good coverage with your adhesive.

, Get one corner centered perfectly before placing the whole image down onto the canvas.

, Work from the inside and brush outward for best results.

If you have a lot of slides, the beauty of a professional slide digitizing house is that they can process them much quicker and generally better than you will be able to on your own. Here are some key points to consider:


Price. This can vary dramatically, from $50 for 400 slides, to nearly $100 for 250 slides. Considering the cost of home alternatives—and considering how often you'll be shooting slides in the future—these prices are very reasonable.
Delivery. How fast can they turn the job around? Some places will take a couple weeks, others just a couple days, and that may come at a premium. If you want better quality, you can make less of a dent in your wallet if you can afford to wait.
Quality. Slide-scanning services can deliver very high quality scans of your slides that will look good even when printed on 8x10 paper. Make sure they have the technology to reduce or remove dust spots, which is very important with these old slides.;

Purchase three stretched and pre-made canvases.,
Buy acrylic paint and paint brushes.,
Pick up a string of white twinkle lights (the 100 light mini strand works very well) and a screwdriver.","How to Design Three Panel, Light Up Dandelion Wall Art1"," The canvas size is up to you depending on the room you plan to display your artwork and how big you want it to end up being.;
, You will need enough black or dark blue paint to completely cover all three canvases, yellow, red, orange, white and green paint.

Check the fire codes in your city and state.,
Contact your venue to find out if there are any restrictions with what can be used and how it can be hung.,
Consult an electrician to see how many plugs are available for your use.,
Measure your space.,
Buy a large quantity of zip ties.,
Consult the bride and groom about the type of look they desire.,
Buy gossamer fabric, if possible.,
Buy gossamer fabric in rolls online.",How to Decorate a Ceiling for a Wedding1," Many codes require that all fabric that is used is flame retardant.;
, Many places do not want you to use screws, nails or other implements that might damage the ceiling.

, Remember that speakers, warming plates and other devices may need to be used in some outlets.

Do it yourself.,
Purchase a slide scanner.",How to Digitally Scan 35mm Slides2," While scanning companies can generally deliver better quality and make what might be a tedious task go much quicker, there is a certain satisfaction in doing it yourself, as well as other reasons:


It could be an opportunity to discard slides that should never have been taken, like that accidental shot of your tennis shoes or that ""artistic"" image of a dog and a fire hydrant.
There may be pictures in your slide collection that you simply don't want to share with total strangers.

, In the consumer category, these can range from under $50 to over $200, and generally, more money gets you better quality and easier workflow. Look for these features:


Speed. Some slide scanners require you to scan to your computer, one at a time. If it takes 30-60 seconds per slide, plus naming and filing time, it can take a considerable amount of time to process a box of 400 slides. Be prepared to give up a weekend for that. Some of the better slide scanners will scan a slide in just a few seconds, and save it to an SD card. When all your slides are scanned, simply open that card on your desktop, and drag your photos over.
Quality. Check out the megapixel number of the scanner you're interested in. They can range from 5 to 9 megapixels. Bigger is better, as they say: the greater the number of pixels, the larger print you can make from your slide.
Compatibility. Make sure that the slide scanner either doesn't require any specific software, or if it does, that it runs on your computer configuration. You don't want to sit down at your Mac this weekend for a massive scanning session only to realize that your shiny new scanner will only work on Windows. It will likely mean that you get to do yard work instead. And that, as they say, just doesn't scan.

Use what you have.",How to Digitally Scan 35mm Slides3," ""OK,"" you say, ""I have a scanner. Can't I just plop my slide onto the scanner bed, and do it that way? Of course, you can: but the problem is that the slides are very small.


You can check to see if there is an adapter available as an accessory to allow you to mount your slides into a mount holder and scan using your flatbed. This should provide you an opportunity to preview and save very easily, if not very quickly. If an adapter is not available you can make one using some household materials (e.g. paper, tape, etc.) see www.abstractconcreteworks.com/essays/scanning/backlighter.html. Scanning on a flatbed has inherent limitations in lighting and resolution, and will not generally give you a similar quality image to a digital photograph nor a professionally scanned slide.

Shoot it again, Sam.,
Using a slide viewer.,
Use a stand.",How to Digitally Scan 35mm Slides4," Set up your projector, screen, and tripod and digitally photograph your image as it is displayed on the screen. If there is a manual focus on your camera, use it to adjust for the distance to ensure the image is as sharp as possible.


If your camera permits, try bracketing your image exposure with slower and faster shutter times and a fixed f-stop, and then compositing the picture with image software such as Photoshop. The resolution will still be compromised, but you may have better dynamic range.

, Either zoom in or use the macro function of your digital camera to take a picture of the back-lit slide. The peripheral light present around the slide itself may need to be blocked/blacked out. Use some cardstock or paper and place it so that only the slide's image has any visible light behind it. This process typically requires a tripod to make a sharp image.

, If your lens permits you to focus within an inch of the lens, use a stand to take a close-up image of the slide. Capture is quick with a click of the camera's shutter. You can test your camera for slide, negative copying at www.shotcopy.com/compatibility.htm and build your own copy stand if you choose.

Decide if you want to go for a bold look.,
Flip through magazines to see what draws your eye.,
Check out style books.,
Decide if you want something classic or trendy.",How to Choose Wall Coverings1," Your new wall coverings should work with what you’ll be putting in your home, so take a look at what you already own. Try to determine your style aesthetic based on what you’ve gathered so far.


If you plan to put up a lot of hanging art, don’t install a busy wall covering that will compete with it.
If you have a bunch of modern furniture, an ornate print on a wallpaper might clash.;
, Some people like to make a statement with their style, while others just want to add a little personal touch to the room. Which type of wall covering you choose should reflect how you like to express yourself. If you choose a bold pattern, then you might not be happy with it if that’s not your style.For example, bright paint colors or stenciling can create a bold, trendy look, but pale gray, tan, or white paint is more classic and easier to match with other room furnishings.
Similarly, wallpaper is a more long-term style option than paint, so picking a bold print on a wallpaper is a big decision.

, Grab a few home style magazines and check out the photos. Note the shared features in the ones that you prefer. For example, do you notice that you prefer a vintage feel or a modern aesthetic? Do you tend to go minimal, or do you like your home to be a richly furnished? Create a list of your design preferences to help narrow down your choice of wall coverings.


While it can be helpful to pull out the pages you like the best, don’t feel like you have make a project out of flipping through the magazines. Just look at a few spreads to find what you like.

You can also find blogs and websites online that discuss home decorating topics, such as A Beautiful Mess.
Check out Pinterest to pin a few of your favorite looks.You may also be able to use the preview function to flip through style books on Amazon.
If you have a general idea about what kind of style you like, try googling a few keywords to pull up pictures of that style.

For example, prints such as chevron or animal print can be trendy and fashionable but then quickly go out of style, while soft colors like eggshell white, tan, or pale gray are classic and timeless.
When choosing a print, think about how popular it is and how long it’s been around. If you’ve recently started seeing it everywhere, then it is likely a trend.
Color schemes can also be trendy. If you are interested in a color scheme just because it’s fashionable, then it is likely a trend.
