Find out exactly how far it is from the ceiling to the floor of the wall you want to cover, and how wide side to side.,
Browse your local fabric stores or online and find a pattern of fabric that you like.,
Remember that while this is easier to put up than paint, it's more expensive and you won't be changing it very often.,
Figure out how wide the fabric is.,
Buy the fabric in one length or the lengths of the individual pieces you will need (width of the wall + a few inches).,
Buy a spool of upholstery thread that matches your fabric, and a needle for your sewing machine that will handle the thickness of what you're sewing.

,
Pin the pieces together lengthwise so that you can sew them into one large panel.,
Trim the end you didn't line up so it's mostly even.

,
Hem the bottom, and both sides.,
Buy screws.,
Lay the fabric out so that you can access the entire top edge.,
Hold the boards up at the top of your wall, against the other walls and the ceiling.,
Drill a hole through the front of the fabric, the board, and into the wall for the screw.,
Add those nuts to the bottom hem if the fabric doesn't hang straight enough.,
Tack the fabric to the wall down the sides in a few places if needed.,
Enjoy your awesome wall!",How to Decorate an Entire Wall Without Paint," The inch measurement here will likely be close but not exactly what the room is measured at on your floor plan. Write this information down to use later.;
, Upholstery weight fabric is good for this project, although lighter fabric could possibly work. Don't pick something too heavy, faux fur or leather aside from being insanely expensive are likely too heavy for this project.

, Be choosy, pick something you know; you will like for a while! All rules about good taste, tackiness, and matching your decoration apply here.

, Wider is better in this case so if you are torn between two designs, choose the wider one. Now, figure out how many ""widths"" of fabric it will take to add up to the height of your wall plus 2 inches (5.1 cm) at the top, 2 inches (5.1 cm) at the bottom, and an inch for every seam that will have to be sewn. For 2 widths- 5 inches (12.7 cm). For 3–6 inches (7.6–15.2 cm). The width of your wall * how many widths you just calculated will be the length of fabric you will need. If you are trying to match a pattern or stripes so they line up, you will need extra (how much you may want to ask a sewing friend for help if you can't figure out yourself - it will vary depending on the pattern in your fabric). Add about 12 inches (30.5 cm) to this measurement to be on the safe side.

, Try to avoid having any other lengths as it means extra seams. If you allow the person at the counter to cut your fabric, make sure they're reasonably consistent and straight with their cuts. (Some places are lazy and try to get away with otherwise).

,, Match all the sides up on one end, and if the others are a little uneven trim after sewing. Remember that we allocated an inch per seam of fabric total, so each side gets 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm). Sew one straight line over each seam to hold it better than the pins, then a triple straight line, followed by a zig zag stitch. This is a lot of weight to hold. Be careful, go slow, this is a lot of fabric to work with and handle, and a lot of seam to take out if you mess up. It's pretty simple though.

,, If you overbought fabric for reuse on a larger wall later you can make a huge hem to just fold it back.

, These need to be heavy-duty enough to hold the fabric and you may need anchors depending on your wall. If you have a choice of colors pick something that will match your fabric. You'll also need a drill and drill bit, a staple gun, and staples for the gun. If you used lightweight fabric, you may want to pick up some small nuts to sew into the bottom hem to weight it down if needed. You'll also need some 1*2"" boards, length total to the width of your wall (you'll probably have to cut one of the pieces but most hardware stores will make a cut for free like this- a handsaw will also do if you do it yourself.)

, Place the boards on top of the fabric at the top, so that you can fold the edge of the fabric over the side and onto the top of the boards. Use the staples and staple gun to secure the fabric, starting at one end and working to the other, and holding it taught (width wise not height.)

, Have 1-2 people hold the boards, while another person will be doing the securing.

, Take the boards down and mount anchors if you're using them. Put the screws into these holes. You will be able to see the head of the screw on the ""nice"" side of the wall. If the color matches, or coordinates, nobody will ever notice. If it doesn't, once you're finished mounting them take a bit of acrylic paint that matches your fabric and paint the screw heads. (Ok, we lied, you might use $1 worth of paint that never touches your wall).

, Only use enough to weight it down to hang straight.

, Tiny nails, staples, or thumbtacks will all do the trick. Whatever looks best and will do the least amount of damage to the wall behind it.

, To take it down gather your friends again and go in reverse, untack, then unscrew it, then take the fabric off the board and roll it up to cart off for whatever. A bit of DAP and touch-up paint will take care of the screw holes.

Make it an accent wall.,
Use an interesting wallpaper.,
Utilize color blocking.,
Place a mural.,
Create a two-tone wall.,
Use Washi tape to decorate the wall.",How to Decorate a Big Wall1," If all of the walls in the room are the same, neutral color (e.g. white or off-white), you could choose a bolder color to paint this wall.For example, cooler colors, such as blue and green, will provide a calming feel.For a more energizing feel, choose warmer colors.;
, If you don’t want to paint the wall, you could choose a bold wallpaper to make the wall more interesting. For example, you might find an interesting argyle pattern or one with a vintage pattern that will give you something to look at besides a plain wall., Color blocking means choosing two or three completely different colors, and then putting them together to create something that looks interesting.For a wall, this can mean painting the wall with different colors, or hanging squares (or whatever shape you would like) of each color. It can even mean simply choosing posters that are made up of one primary color., You can do this by having a picture that you like blown up to a very large, and having it printed as a poster that you can hang on the wall, or having it made into a wall decal you can stick onto your wall.This will make the wall very interesting to look at.


Alternatively, if you don’t already have a picture in mind, you can visit home decor stores, which commonly sell pre-made wall murals. Typically, these are applied as decals, which make it easy to stick to the wall.

, This is done by painting the bottom part of the wall in one color, and painting the top part of the wall in a different tone of the same color. Typically the wall is divided in half, but you can do it however you like.If your wall has wainscoting or bead boarding, which is the decorative panelling that is sometimes present on the bottom portion of a wall, you can use this as a guide to help you decide where to divide the tones.You can also have wainscoting installed to help break up the wall, if you don’t have it already.

, Maybe you rent, and aren’t allowed to paint or nail into the wall, or maybe you want to be able to change your decorations easily. Either way, Washi tape offers a way to decorate your wall in whatever way you want.Washi tape is essentially masking tape with different designs on it. It comes in many, many different colors and designs.
You could try taping large stripes on the wall, or creating a design of your own in the center of the wall.

Try wallpaper if it better fits the look you want.,
Use wood paneling.,
Invest in ceramic tile.,
Try vinyl for durability.,
Choose fabric if you want something dramatic.",How to Choose Wall Coverings2," Paint is usually the cheapest option for a wall covering.Paint is available in a variety of colors, as well as in several different finishes, including matte, satin, semi-gloss and high gloss. You may purchase washable paint for easy clean-up. It’s also easy to change if you find you don’t like the color or just want to try a new look.


Additionally, paint can be used in an artful way to create a variety of decorative wall finishes called ""faux finishes."" Examples of faux finishes include marbleizing, stone and faux leather.
For a bathroom, try gloss or semi-gloss finishes for easy to clean painted surfaces.Ask the paint specialist at your local home improvement store for advice on which type of paint meets your room’s needs. Different brands have different recommendations.

, Many people enjoy the look created by printed wallpaper, and it can be easy to create visual interest in your room. While it can be costly and hard to remove, wallpaper can be a good investment.Choose prints that work in the room. A large print can be overpowering, while smaller prints are easier to work with in spaces that have a lot of windows and doors. If you have low ceilings, a vertical print can look wrong.Consider using wallpaper to create accent walls or to make a small space special.
Don’t use regular wallpaper in a bathroom. If you must have the look of wallpaper, try a vinyl covering instead. Vinyl coverings work like wallpaper but are moisture resistant., While wood paneling may make you think of outdated brown paneling, you can create attractive walls with modern wood paneling. For example, white paneling can look great in a bedroom, and you can try creating a wainscoted look in your kitchen, dining room, or hallways with paneling. Paneling comes in an array of finishes and styles and can create a classic, durable finish for a wide variety of design aesthetics.


If you use wood in your bathroom, make sure it has a water-resistant coating., Ceramic tile is a popular choice for bathrooms and kitchen backsplashes because it offers a sleek, easy to clean, waterproof surface. While it’s expensive to install, it is durable and long-lasting.If you choose ceramic tile, make sure it is made for walls and not floors. The two types of tile are different.

, If you like the look of wallpaper or want to add a texture to your walls, vinyl can be a great option. It’s durable, easy to clean, and comes in a lot of fun prints. While vinyl may seem like an odd choice, once you look at your options you’ll see that it’s similar to putting up wallpaper.You can find several different faux finishes in vinyl that can create your favorite aesthetic. For example, you can find faux-exposed brick that you can easily install yourself because it has an adhesive backing.

, While fabric wall coverings are more common in commercial places, they can create richness inside your home. If that’s the look you prefer, then fabric might be the choice for you.


Using fabric can be costly, and it can be hard to clean if it gets stained.
Since it muffles sound, fabric can be a good option for loud spaces such as entertainment rooms or the hallway.
You can find acoustic fabric to coat your walls to muffle sound, or you can attach regular fabric to your walls just as you would wallpaper."

Set a budget.,
Go with what draws your eye.,
Think about how you use the room.,
Use your wall covering to change the space.",How to Choose Wall Coverings3," What you choose will depend partially on how much you can spend. Calculate a reasonable estimate of what you can afford before you start making purchases. Consider balancing a small budget with different types of wallcoverings in different rooms or by combining materials.


Remember that you can combine wallcoverings in the same room, so if you really want an expensive wallpaper but can’t afford to cover your whole room in it, consider doing one wall or part of your walls. For example, you could make the smallest wall in your room a focal point with a fun print.

, You may notice that you keep picking up samples that look similar to each other or that the pictures you chose to use for inspiration fit the same style. If you find yourself drawn to a particular print or style, trust your gut, especially if you notice that your other belongings also fit that style.Going back to the same print or color over and over is a good sign that it’s the right choice for you.


If you’ve gathered samples of wall coverings, go through them to look for similarities between prints and colors to see if you’re picking the same thing repeatedly.

, How you will use the room should help you determine which covering to choose. For example, you may want to use a calmer print or color in your bedroom, while your entertainment room can be covered in a more festive wallcovering.Make sure that bathroom wall coverings can resist moisture, heat, and cleaning. Look for durability in frequently cleaned rooms like your bathroom and kitchen, as well as high-traffic rooms.For example, a wall with light switches may show fingerprints, and a wall that backs dining room chairs may receive furniture scuff marks.
Choose child-friendly materials if you have children. For example, wallpaper in a child’s room can be removed or colored on by your child.

, If there is something that you don’t like about a room, such as it’s too dark, small, or boring, choose a wall covering that eliminates what you hate.You can use prints or colors to make the space better fit your style needs, or you can use design tricks to make the space look bigger.


Lighter colors or thin, vertical prints such as narrow stripes can make your room look larger.
You could also make a small room look larger with a small print or a bright color.
You could make a boring room fun with a stylish print.

Turn it into a bookshelf.,
Install sconces.,
Place tall items in front of the wall.",How to Decorate a Big Wall2," If you have a lot of books, or a collection of figures you’d like to display, shelves can really make the space look sophisticated.You can purchase a book shelf, and secure it to the wall, or you can install shelves directly on the wall.


You can then decorate the shelves with books, figurines, vinyl records, or a combination of many different things.
Make sure you clean the shelves often, as they tend to collect a layer of dust rather quickly.

, For a more regal look, you can install wall sconces.A sconce is a decorative wall bracket for holding candles or lights. These come in a number of different designs, and may have electric lights or a place to install a candle that you can light. Installing one or two large sconces will give your wall a new look, especially if you also install a large portrait or photograph.


Be careful when burning candles! Do not leave a lit candle unattended.

, If the wall is very tall, you can use tall furniture to help break it up. For example, by placing chairs or sofas which have high backs against the wall. These pieces will help break up the wall because they provide something interesting to look at, and take up some of the wall space.You can also try placing one or two tall plants next to the wall. These will have the same effect as the furniture, but make sure the plants can survive with the amount of light they will receive in that area.Be sure to keep the plant healthy and well-pruned! If the plant is brown and wilting, it will create an eye-sore in the room.

Make a grid photo.",How to Decorate a Big Wall3," You can either hang the picture or you can set it on the floor, if it is big enough. This offers a good alternative to painting or wallpapering, but still makes the wall more interesting.You could also do this with a large mirror.
Be careful if you choose to hang the picture! Some walls may not be able to support the weight, if it is heavy.

, Choose photos that you like of varying sizes, and put them in frames. Hang the photos in the center of the wall.The photos can be of anything you like. It could be family photos, vacation photos, photos of animals, anything!
You can buy frames that all match, or you can choose various funky frames to mix it up a bit.
On a large wall, it is recommended that you hang the pictures somewhat asymmetrically.Try arranging the photos in a mixed pattern on the floor before attaching them to the wall.

, You could choose a map of your city, of places you’ve visited, or of places where significant life events have occurred (e.g. where you were born, where you got married, etc.)More generally, you could consider looking for a map wallpaper, and install that instead.

, You could hang the drawings on the wall in a symmetric fashion.

, For some, using posters or photos might be too obvious. You can also try creating large panels and covering them in fabric.Be sure that you install the panels securely to the wall!

, Try hanging a tapestry on a large wall.The nice thing about this, is that tapestries come in hundreds of colors and designs. When/if you get tired of a particular design, you can change to a new tapestry.


Tapestries can also help to dampen the noise of a room, which can be helpful if you have an especially large room.
Be aware, though, that if the tapestry is hung on a wall that receives direct sunlight for much of the day, that it can fade the tapestry over time.You can occasionally clean the tapestry using a soft, dry brush., If you want to hang a large photo, you can have it printed into a grid (usually 3 or 4 photos, that when put together, make up the whole photo).This will require you to visit a professional photo printer, who can help you blow up the photo of your choice, and print it on canvas or paper.

Rearrange your furniture.,
Keep a small room sparse.,
Make use of hidden storage and multi-purpose furniture.,
Keep your furniture open.",How to Make Your Room Look Bigger1," When you have a small space, everything in it counts. By arranging your furniture to open up your floor space, you can make your room look bigger. If you don’t have a lot of room, place your larger pieces of furniture near the edges of your room, not in the middle.Sometimes, if you have a few smaller pieces of furniture, you can place these pieces away from the walls. Placing a piece at a diagonal angle toward the middle of your room can give the illusion of space.
Place your bed in a corner of your bedroom to open up the floorspace.
Push your couch up against a wall in your living room to provide an open floor and pathway.
One element of a larger looking room is the ability to move freely about it. Don’t place any furniture in areas that would block a view or ability to easily move about the space.;
, The more furniture you have in any room, the more cramped and smaller it will look. Keep a small room tidy and organized. Start with what you need in a room, these are usually the bigger pieces of furniture like a bed or couch.


If you have a smaller room, consider only having a couple pieces of furniture in it. Use this piece of furniture to create a focal point. This is one area that draws the eye to it. In your living room, this could be your couch and table. Don’t add unnecessary chairs and knick-knacks, these will only clutter your space.
Don’t hang too many paintings or pictures on your wall. Having a lot of items on your walls creates a cluttered look that makes the space feel more cramped.

, Place your bureau next to the bed and use it as a nightstand. Look for furniture that serves more than one purpose. Get a bed frame that has pull out drawers or is elevated enough to place storage boxes under.


Use a chest as a living room table. It provides a surface to place things on, but also opens up allowing you to store blankets and pillows inside.
Grab a storage ottoman. If you need an ottoman, get one with a lid to keep things out of sight when you don’t need them.
Use an extra kitchen chair as a small bedside table., Get furniture that has open legs, or tables that are glass. Furniture that is elevated with legs makes a room look bigger because it creates more air.Furniture with legs or glass tables allow light to travel around, through, and under the piece, opening up the space.
Attach a folding shelf beneath a window to use as a desk or ironing board. You can fold the desk up when you don’t need it
Ditch the drapes and rugs when you can. Keep a space uncluttered and allow more light in by removing your drapes and rugs. Keeping your windows open allows for more light and depth to your room. A rug with the right pattern can make your room look bigger, but it can also separate parts of the room, making it seem more cramped.

Install wall sconces along the stairwell.,
Wire some spotlights to highlight nearby artwork.,
Light the stairwell at ground level.,
Hang a series of pendant lamps over the stairs.,
Use touch lights for an easy or temporary solution.,
Dramatize the stairway using a large chandelier.",How to Use Accent Lighting in a Stairwell," A classic and simple way to use accent lighting in a staircase is to install a few wall sconces. Sconces can be placed at regular intervals along the wall, with their heights graduated to follow the slope of the stairs. This type of lighting scheme will cast a gentle wash of light upwards onto your wall, which often helps to make a cramped staircase feel more open.;
, You can both light a stairwell and feature some of your favorite photographs or paintings by using spotlight fixtures. Hang artwork along the walls of your staircase, keeping the height of each frame above the steps constant. Then, install small LED or fluorescent spotlights above each painting; these lights will both accentuate the art and provide some elegant down lighting on the steps.

, A unique way to light a staircase is to provide gentle lighting at the level of the steps themselves. You can install recessed lighting fixtures along the wall to achieve this effect, or even install very small LED string lights underneath the overhanging tread of each step. This type of lighting is excellent for providing safe visibility at night without illuminating too much of the space.

, If your stairwell has a very high ceiling, you can create a dramatic accent lighting setup by using pendant lamps. Use a single pendant lamp for every 4 or 5 steps, keeping each fixture's height above the steps constant. Matching pendant lamps will create a cohesive look, while contrasting fixtures could be used for a bold, eclectic statement.

, If you're looking for a temporary solution or one that doesn't require hardwiring, battery-powered touch lights may be ideal. These small, lightweight fixtures can often be affixed to walls using only adhesive backing. Used in multiples, they can create an elegant accent lighting scheme that belies their low cost.

, If you are hoping to add some drama and interest to the stairwell through accent lighting, try a single, large hanging fixture. A chandelier or multiple-bulb pendant lamp can create visual interest and light the space adequately as well.

Add shelves or hooks in the closet. Place small items in baskets or boxes on the shelves. A bureau may not be needed.
Add a hook to the back of your door for your coats and accessories.
Get a storage bed. A bed that has alcoves for storage, or an elevated one that you can place storage boxes under is a great space saver. If you want, you can even add a bedskirt to hide the boxes further., Either keep your wall shelves and pictures closer to the floor, or put shelves closer to the ceiling. Don’t put things in the middle as this will split the height of the room.


If you place any art on the walls lower to the ground, it will give your ceiling the illusion of being taller.
Alternatively, placing wall shelves closer to the ceiling will have a similar heightening effect.

Find a colour of paint that is almost what you want.,
Grab a store assistant for help.,
Test the paint.,
Order the colour you like.",How to Transform a Living Room from Ordinary to Extraordinary1," Rather than limiting yourself to the off-the-shelf colour choices, why not mix your own colour? Even if it's just adding white or black to one of their existing colours, a few simple tweaks can produce something unlike anything else in their colour repertoire - and unlike anything in anyone else's living room.;
, This could be a lighter or darker version of what you actually want, or a version with more or less of a certain colour mixed into it than you'd want.

, Ask if they'll either mix a new colour based on that colour, or if they'll alter an off-the-shelf tin of paint from the likes of Dulux, Crown and so on. They can be wary of doing this, so you might have to identify a colour and go elsewhere to get a new colour made up for you.

, Once they've mixed up a tin - go home and paint a small swatch of the colour on your wall to make sure that it is the colour you want.

Consider commissioning some pieces.",How to Transform a Living Room from Ordinary to Extraordinary2," Gone are the days of art being prohibitively expensive. There are now a number of art fairs and exhibitions that advocate affordable art. The definition of ""affordable"" varies from person to person, of course, and as such, even at affordable art fairs you will see some pieces with eye-wateringly high prices. Which is why you use art fairs as research opportunities, and then contact artists directly.

, See if you can find anything that sounds like it might specialise in reasonably-priced art.

, Often artists will have their own separate contact information and websites, allowing you to contact them directly and avoid gallery price mark-ups.

, More often than not, when you do this you'll find alternative colourings of popular prints of their own stores, along with leftover prints from limited runs - giving you more reasonably priced, limited-run prints to adorn your walls with.

, If you have a specific idea of what you would like the artist to produce for you, you can even commission them to make it for you - a truly one-of-a-kind and (hopefully) extraordinary piece!

",How to Make a Room Comfortable," Remember, though, to consider the flow of energy and the flow of physical spaces throughout the house. Consider incorporating feng shui principles elements in your design overview.;
, Basically each room should be designed by the primary users of the room and the focus should be on filling the space with the look, feel, and objects that provide pleasure and a quiet feeling of ""rightness"" for those individuals. Some possible designations which might make sense in your home:



For one family member - The room will be used, primarily, by one member of the family. Other family members and friends might visit the room daily or weekly to visit, convey messages, clean, remove clothing for washing, and similar activities.

Essentially, the room will be an individual space and should be arranged and decorated in according to the tastes and desires of that individual.
Provide a place where visitors can sit down and feel at home if this function is in the vision for the room.
Give primary voice to the individual who will claim the space as their own.
Examples of such rooms might be the bedrooms, kitchen for the chef of the family, laundry room for the designated clothes care person, the study for dad or mom or kids, the garage, the shed, the sewing room, the greenhouse, and other similar rooms which are mostly used by one individual family member.



Shared by family members - This could include a bedroom shared by siblings or mom and dad, a family room or den, the dining room or breakfast nook, and similar rooms around the house.

The design should strive to make all individuals who use the room feel comfortable.
Each individual should be a participant in picking the elements which provide comfort and should have the right to veto arrangements or items which make them feel uncomfortable. Some family members might not be too keen on having a stuffed elk head across the room or might have a personal objection to a proposed design element.



For guests - Keep things open, interesting, and inviting.

Special use rooms - Included here might be an exercise room, computer room, game room, home theater with surround sound, video or sound mixing room. These should meet the special needs of your family or individuals as well as remaining open, warm, and inviting.

, The feeling that is evoked when you enter a room will be a combination of the visual and audio. Primary elements are the overall lighting, be it natural sunlight or mood lighting, spot and task lighting, room color, furniture placement, sound dampening or masking, and the audio experience.

, Provide plenty of well-organized storage so that everything is at hand and the room stays naturally decluttered.

,, Angle chairs and couches so they are about three feet apart.

, Color is paramount in making your room comfortable. It will, in large part, set your mood.



Red is a bright, warm color that evokes strong emotions. It is associated with love, warmth, comfort and feelings of excitement and intensity.

Blue is described as a favorite color by many people and is the color most preferred by men. It calls to mind feelings of calmness or serenity. It is often described as peaceful, tranquil, secure, and orderly.Blue can often evoke feelings of sadness and aloofness. It has been claimed that people are more productive in blue rooms.

Green symbolizes nature. It represents good luck, health, and jealousy. Green rooms improve reading ability.

Yellow is a bright that often described as cheery and warm. It is also the color that is identified most easily and detected quickly. It is the most visible color, and can create feelings of frustration and anger. That said, a yellow room can be very cheerful with the right shade.

Purple is a symbol of royalty and strength and is associated with wisdom and spirituality. It often appears exotic or artificial.

Brown creates a feeling of strength and stability. It is often described as natural and down to earth.

Pink' is the color that's most preferred by women. It symbolizes femininity, and fertility. It is a calming color.

White represents purity and peace. It can make a room seem more spacious, however, it also makes it feel cold and bland.

, Use an odor-neutralizing spray like Febreze. Open a window to encourage air circulation. Burn incense or scented candles for a mild effect--keep in mind that a strong scent can make some people uncomfortable. Strewing herbs used as a dry potpourri or simmering on the stove are warm, inviting, and subtle.

, Avoid putting your things on those sitting spaces (don't throw your jacket or keys onto an open chair, for example). Add an ottoman so someone can prop their feet if they'd like. Keep a blanket nearby, or put a throw on the chair so a person can use it if they get cold.

, Use lint rollers often. Remember that some people are allergic to pets. Ideally, you'll want to keep pets off the furniture.

,, Many people put photo albums on side tables for people to browse through. They're great conversation starters, and a chance for guests to get to know you better. There are also coffee table books which are usually beautifully photographed, which makes them easy to flip through without requiring too much concentration. Adding a simple game like checkers or dominoes for people to play is also a good idea. A puzzle or brainteaser is a nice touch, too!

Put your finishing touches on the room.",How to Design a Room," Everyone is different when it comes to the type of rooms they like best. Some rooms are sparsely decorated with modern furniture and stark white walls; others are richly decorated with plush furniture, heavy fabrics, and dark colors. The key is to find what you love best and want to live in, then find ways to bring that to life in the particular space you are designing. There are many online quizzes you can take to determine your design esthetic; to begin, think about which of these best describes your personality:


Cozy and rustic: You might have a rustic design personality if you love the countryside and are drawn to natural surfaces like warm wood, rich leather, and stone.Modern and urban: You might have a modern esthetic if you love the big city, traveling, and are drawn to bold, crisp lines, geometric shapes, and surfaces like chrome and glass.Casual: You might enjoy a casual design approach if you like modern colors and textures, but with clean lines and sparse décor. Casual designs feature natural surfaces, cheery colors, and comfort.;
, If you're not sure what your home décor style is or how to begin with room design, you have to start by observing the types of things that you are drawn to. You can use a large cork board, a poster-board, or a virtual board (such as on Pinterest) as a place to organize your inspiration and figure out what unites the different things you like.It's best if you pin the items on the board temporarily (rather than attaching with glue) so that you can remove things as you like.


Look for things like fabrics, patterns, paint colors, photos of rooms, ""mood"" images of things that inspire you (like nature photos, pets, cityscapes, children, etc.), and pictures of furniture, appliances, or fixtures that you love.
As you begin to gather ideas, don't worry about price points; you can usually find something in the same style or color at various price points from luxury to bargain.

, There are many places you can look for professionally-designed and do-it-yourself ideas for whatever space you are designing. Cut out, print, or take photos of the ideas you find that you are drawn to, and pin them on your idea board. Consider looking in the following places:


Online. You can check out professional designer's websites, do-it-yourself home improvement blogs, or websites associated with television shows (such as HGTV's website). You can also search photo sharing websites like Pinterest or using keywords like ""living room modern"" or ""living room southern.""
Magazines and books. Visit your local bookstore or library to check out magazines and books dedicated to design, decorating, or even more general lifestyle categories. For example, if you are designing a kitchen, a cooking magazine may have great photos of actual kitchens, cookware, and appliances. If you are designing a living space, lifestyle magazines (such as women's magazines, hunting magazines, or parenting magazines) may have photos that inspire your space as well.
Showrooms and stores. Do a quick internet search to find furniture stores, design studios, and home boutiques in your town. Then take a trip with your camera at the ready, and get pictures of mock up spaces or particular items that you love. You can also visit big box stores for ideas, especially for particular colors and styles for paint, flooring, fixtures, and appliances.

, When you visit your friends and family, how do you feel in their homes? Are there homes that seem cluttered with decor, over the top, or too bold for your style? Are there homes that seem too sparse or minimal for your liking? Figuring out how you feel in actual living spaces can help you figure out which style you want to bring into your own home.


Is there a home in particular where you feel comfortable, relaxed, and rested? What elements of the living spaces do you like best, and which do you think are less ideal?
If you have a friend who has a style much like your own, ask him or her to help you as you work on your own room design. Even if all your friend can tell you is where he or she bought the furniture and décor in the room, you will have an advantage as you work on your room.

, When you plan your space, keep in mind that different colors, textures, and layouts can have an impact on the way people feel in your room. Color in particular has strong psychological effects on mood.For example,


Red is associated with passion, anger, and warmth. It also can be overpowering and cause headaches. It is a great accent color for one wall, or for a couch or other piece of furniture, but some experts suggest that you should not paint an entire room red.More significantly, studies have shown that red can impair performance on cognitive tasks, so it be used cautiously in rooms like an office or study.Green is associated with calm, rest, and balance, and is a great color for living rooms and bedrooms. However, too much green might take the energy out of a room, so combine it with a bit of red or orange to counteract its calming effects.Blue is known as a calming and intellectual color, but it can also appear cold and uninviting unless you choose a blue with a warm base instead of a cool base (for example, teal or aquamarine instead of true blue).Yellow and yellow-green are considered the least pleasant, but green-yellow (that is, more green than yellow) is considered to be an arousing, dominant color., Whether it’s a bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, or living area, each room has a function and a ""target audience,"" those people who tend to use the room the most. Your design choices need to reflect the target audience as much as possible in order for the room to remain functional.


The rooms in your house should complement the personality of the person or people who use them most. For example, if your space will be used to host dinner guests or clients, you will want to take a different approach than if it is used as a nursery or playroom. Similarly, if you are the only one who will be using the room, you might feel more free to design it to your own standards and not worry about how others will see it.

, Ask someone for help to make sure your measurements are accurate, and write them down as you go. Measure each wall's length and height, as well as any permanent fixtures to the room (like built-in cabinets, fireplace, bathtub, etc.).


Don't forget to measure windows and doorways, including width and height.

, Before you can plan your design, you need to know what you have to work with. If you have an unlimited budget, then you can skip this step! Otherwise, think about each part of the room's design, which you are interested in changing, and how much you can afford to spend. This will help you focus your design on those elements you can afford to update. For example, you may not be able to put in a new carpet, but you might be able to buy a throw rug to cover up the carpet and update the look.


Your budget should be a list that includes general categories and a specific breakdown of how money will be spent in each category. It will be unique to the room that you are designing, so it will differ depending on if it is a kitchen, living room, bathroom, bedroom, etc. Some aspects to include in your budget might include:

Walls: Do you need to paint? What about repairing, replacing, or adding features like wood trim, crown mouldings, or paneling? How about wallpaper?
Windows: Do you need new windows altogether, or can you keep the ones you have? Old windows can be drafty and dated, and hard to clean. But they can be disguised with good window treatments. Do you need new blinds? What about draperies, curtains, valances, or other window treatments?
Flooring: Do you need to replace the carpeting? Do you want to put down hardwood floors or tiling? Could you just get by with steam cleaning the existing floors and perhaps adding an accept rug or area rug to update the space?
Fixtures: Does the area have light fixtures or chandeliers that need to be replaced or updated? What about outlet and light switch covers? Does it have a sink, faucet, or bathtub that needs updating? What about countertops, cabinets, or appliances?
Furniture (couch, chair, table, bookshelf, bed, etc.)
Décor: This includes everything from the pictures on the wall to the throw blanket on the couch. In many cases, you can renovate the appearance of a room by just changing the décor items. Do you want to add photos or canvases to the wall or to shelves? What about figurines, wall hangings, or soft lines like throw pillows or blankets?



, Think practically first: What furniture do you need in order to use the space? Items like a bed, dresser, or couch might fit this description. Then, consider what furniture items would make the space more user-friendly or fun, like a coffee table, bean bag chair, or accent table.


As you write down the furniture, make a note of what you currently have and what you might need to buy.

, Using themes and designer tips from professional decorators will help get the creative ideas going.


Experiment with different furniture arrangement options using free room planning websites. Search online for ""interactive room design"" to get started.
You can also use these websites design a virtual room from flooring and paint colors to cabinets and counter tops.

, Know which cleaning supplies, painting supplies and any tools or equipment are necessary. Have someone ready to help you move any heavy or fragile furniture.

, Room design is different than decorating because it has to do with the whole space, including the parts of it that are permanent like the walls, windows, and floors. When you begin your project, you need to get everything else out of the way so that you can see the bare bones of what you have to work with.


Begin by moving furniture and every item of décor (including pictures on the walls) out of the room. Keep it in another room if you can, to give you time to finish your project before you decide what to give away or sell.
Give the space a deep cleaning. Clean the walls, windows, and floors and any permanent fixtures like lights, light switches, cabinets, or baseboards.

, In order to prevent getting paint or adhesive on the new floors, finish the walls before doing any work to replace flooring.You may need to remove old wall paper or old wood trim before beginning.
Prime the walls and paint the walls and trim.

, If you plan to replace carpeting, vinyl, tile, or wood floors, you should do it now, but take care to protect your new floors as you move in new furniture.


Make sure all paint is dry before you begin with the flooring, which can produce a lot of dust that will stick to tacky paint.
After you finish the flooring, be sure to vacuum or mop the floors before proceeding with the next steps.

, Start with the focal point of the room or the biggest pieces of furniture. Move on to the smaller pieces and accents.


Don't be afraid to re-arrange. Sizes and placements might not completely match what you were envisioning the first time.
Make sure seating arrangements provide opportunity for conversation and/or unobstructed views of the TV, if applicable.
Keep walkways clear for a natural flow of the room.
Determine if rugs or end tables and positioning of seats are needed to section off areas of the room.

, In almost all rooms, different levels of light are needed to create different moods or to light up only a certain section of the room.


Use dimmers on the main light and place lamps strategically.
Choose curtains, shades or blinds to control natural sunlight.

, Although it might seem like an afterthought, small items of décor and memorabilia are often what gives a room its character and livability. Plan these with care to match the theme and mood of your room and to make it enjoyable for you and your guests.


Hang pictures and artwork on the walls to complement the furniture placement.
Place pictures, keepsakes and other decorations on shelves and tabletops.
Use hideaway storage for blankets, coasters and other items that might need to be used but are not needed at all times.

Pick a kid-friendly paint.,
Choose sturdy fabrics.,
Lean towards easily cleaned floors.,
Pick dark-colored fabrics.",How to Make Your Living Room Kid‐Friendly1," Gloss and semi-gloss are your best bets when it comes to cleaning up after kids. These paints wipe more easily than matte finishes. However, if you must have matte, pick one of the new paints that are made for easier cleanup, called ""washable"" mattes., Leather is a good option for kids, as it is sturdy and it makes for easy cleanup. You can also use slip covers, so you can take them off and wash them as needed. You can also opt for heavy duty upholstery fabric meant for places like hotels, which are designed to stand up to wear., When choosing flooring, pick ones that are easy to clean. Laminate is a good option, as is tile or wood. Carpet is harder to clean because of spills. However, you can choose carpet tiles, so that you can get rid of tiles that become too stained., Darker fabrics tend to show fewer stains than lighter fabrics, so pick a darker tone if possible. Nonetheless, if you go the slipcover route, you could also choose white slipcovers, as you can bleach them to remove stains.Another good option for fabric is choosing fabrics with patterns, as stains don't show as much on these fabrics.


Another option is treating your fabric with a stain repellent, such as Scotchgard. You can also choose fabrics that are created to be stain-resistant and easy to clean, such as microfiber.

Add a kid corner.",How to Make Your Living Room Kid‐Friendly2," With kids, you're going to need to store things. Anticipate this need by adding in cabinets or bookcases to the room. Cabinets help hide clutter, but you can also use slide out boxes on bookcases to hide clutter, as well., Another way to contain the clutter is to make use of stylish baskets and boxes. If these items are large enough, they can be standalone items. The key is to make sure they are easy enough for kids to open if they have a lid., Kids want to be able to get to their stuff, so try storing it near their level. Bonus, if it's on their level, they're more likely to put it back afterwards than if it goes back somewhere they can't reach. Plus, they don't have to ask you every time they want to play with something., That is, pick pieces of furniture that are easy to move around. That way, you can move them out of the way if you need lots of floor space for a fun family project. It can also help if your kids want to do something like put on a play, as they can rearrange to make a seating area., When picking out items like side tables, try to make them as versatile as possible. For instance, small, light tables can sometimes function as extra seating, particularly if they're sturdy enough. When you have guests, just pull the tables into the circle for more seating. These chairs make particularly good seats for kids., When picking out couches and chairs, make sure that everyone will have a seat. That is, don't just get enough seats for the adults, as the kids will want to pile on the couches, too. It's even better if you can all pile one couch. If you don't have a lot of room, try a sectional with a corner piece to help save space., If your living room is big enough, you can add an area just for the kids. Use your furniture to help section off areas a bit, or put a brightly colored rug and small chairs in the kids area. You can have toys, a small desk or table for coloring, and/or a few shelves of books for your kids. It could even have something as fun as a small trampoline or a swing hung from the ceiling.

Hide wires when possible.,
Choose cordless blinds.,
Pick soft spaces.,
Bolt heavy furniture into the wall.,
Put hazardous items out of reach.",How to Make Your Living Room Kid‐Friendly3," Kids have a tendency to run into sharp things, and coffee tables are particularly notorious for this problem. Consider choosing round or oval coffee tables or one with rounded corners. You could also choose a sturdy padded footstool instead.You can also buy special guards for sharp corners if you don't want to change out your furniture., Wires are both a tripping and hanging hazard, so try to hide them away in cabinets. You can also use wire guards, which hold the wires down to the carpet or you can hold wires to the walls with adhesive hooks. Plus, hiding the wires away helps the room look less cluttered.It's also a good idea to replace your outlets with the kind that have a sliding cover. That way, your child can't stick anything in the outlets.

, Cordless blinds are becoming more common because the kind with cords are a hanging hazard for kids. If you have the kind with cords, make sure to switch them out to help keep your kids safe., Adding cushions and other soft spaces in is helpful, as kids tend to be rough and tumble, landing in places they shouldn't. You can also add some large pillows to the floor to create padded areas there., Items like large bookcases can pose a threat to your kids. They can pull on them with enough force to pull the furniture over on top of them. The best solution is to bolt these items into the wall so that they can't come crashing down.In the same vein, make sure to hide floor lamps behind furniture so your kids can't climb up them.
Close drawers after you use them because toddlers can use them to crawl upwards.

, Think about items that could cause harm to your kids. For instance, small items like paper clips or buttons could pose a choking hazard, while any kind of chemical could be poisonous. Make sure these are out of reach of your child."

Hang plates.,
Line the walls with books.,
Use frames to add an artistic touch to otherwise ordinary objects.,
Refurbish ordinary objects by hanging them in shadowboxes.",How to Decorate Living Room Walls," One of the simplest, most obvious options for living room wall décor is a wall painting. Depending on your budget, you can even consider asking an artistic friend to create something, commission an artist, or settle for a print of previously-created artwork.


If you have a young family, consider turning your living room into a kid-friendly space by featuring your kids' artwork on the walls. The pictures will likely add a bright splash of color and your kids will feel proud.;
, Shelves are a simple, inexpensive way to decorate your walls. You can place a variety of object on your shelves, from knick-knacks and photographs to lamps and mementos from family vacations. Line your shelves with objects that say something about your family to give your living room a warm, personal touch.

, You can go a standard route by hanging small photographs of loved ones on your wall, or you can make a more dramatic statement by enlarging a single photograph and centering it above a sofa or other large piece of furniture.

, If the walls of your living room are painted with a matte paint, adding a wide, horizontal stripe creates a subtle hint of texture. Choose a glossy paint color that closely matches the matte color already on your wall. Keep the stripe at eye level or higher to maximize the effect.

, Use interior latex paint to paint the canvas a bright color. Select a single large canvas to cover a wide living room wall, or speckle the wall in multiple canvases of varying sizes.

, Fabric is a unique alternative to paint or wallpaper, and it gives a wall texture and design. Start by upholstering one wall with it, since covering your entire living room space in fabric may make your space look too busy.


Stick with lightweight fabrics, like cotton or linen, since thick fabrics may look too heavy and overbearing.
For a less dramatic approach, hang a framed square of fabric on your wall instead of upholstering the wall itself. This option is less expensive and easier to change out.

, Select one wall, preferably one facing a window. Hang a variety of circular or rectangular mirrors on the wall to capture the light and send it bouncing around the rest of your living room. Your room will look brighter and more inviting, and by selecting mirrors in a variety of shapes and sizes, you can add more character to your wall.


Create a subdued version of this technique by hanging polished silver platters or trays on the wall. The silver will still reflect the light, but will not reflect images as well.

, If you have loved ones in other cities, or if you simply dream of visiting faraway places, incorporate the sentiment into your living room wall décor by hanging several simple analog clocks in a straight line above your sofa. Set the clocks to whatever time zone your dream destinations lie in, and place a small plaque beneath each clock to identify the city that each respective clock belongs to.

, Select plates in varying hues, and made of differing materials, to cheaply add both color and texture to your wall. Place the most eye-catching plate in the center to act as a focal point.

, Select sturdy shelves that can handle the weight of books. You can either line these shelves around the perimeter or focus them on a single wall. The books not only act as decoration, but as entertainment, making this an aesthetically-pleasing and practical option.

, Select a poster, vintage landscape blueprint, fancy calendar, or a greeting card with a nice front design. Fix these objects to the back of the frame. For calendars, remove the front glass so that you can still access the pages.

, Think along the lines of skeleton keys, plates, vinyl records, and vintage analog clocks. The more unique the object, the better conversation piece it makes to visiting guests.

When choosing a curtain rod, look for a rod that is at least 1 inch (2.54 cm) thick for good aesthetics and curtain support., Extending your curtain rod 3-6 inches (7.5-15 cm) beyond the frame of your window makes your window seem larger and allows additional light to stream in. This way, when your curtains are open, they will rest against the wall rather than blocking the light from the window., Select a rod with curtain brackets a maximum of 50 in (127 cm) apart for proper curtain-rod support. A rod that is longer than this without support brackets at this interval will have difficulty supporting the weight of your curtains., If you’re going for a designer look with your curtain rods, select a rod that picks up tones of the darkest furniture in your room. While this may not be your first instinct, it pulls the space together and creates pleasing contrast, a bit like eyeliner for your room.Note that if you choose wood curtain rods these require periodic turning so they don’t bow out of shape with the weight of your curtains. You’re better off going for a metal rod with a bronze finish if you’re looking for a brown-tone rod., If you have highly patterned drapes that are a focal point of your room, you can use your curtain rod to draw attention to them. Choose a color for your curtain rod that’s featured in the pattern of your drapes to highlight their hue.

, If you want your curtain rods to seemingly disappear rather than be a design element, choose rods the color your wall is painted. They will blend in seamlessly.

, Consider if the room where you’ll be hanging your curtain rod is casual or formal when you select a finial. For example, a crystal finial would likely be out of place on a sun porch. Similarly, a wicker finial would likely not be in keeping with the décor of a formal dining room.Take a picture of the room where you’ll be hanging the curtain rod, and bring it with you when you look at finials. This will help you visualize if the style of finial is complementary to the room or not.

, Finials come in many different materials: resin, glass, metal and wood, to name a few. You can choose a finial that will fit best with your décor by selecting a material that is already present in your room.For example, if you have a grand glass dining table, try selecting a glass finial for the curtain rods in that room to highlight your décor.

, Finials come in may different shapes, such as scrolls, leaves, and even novelty shapes like birds. Use your finial to highlight a pattern or motif already present in your room, perhaps a part of the upholstery or wallpaper, for a greater design impact.For example, if you have floral wallpaper, you could choose a fleur-de-lis finial to enhance the flower motif.

Determine the purpose and mood of the room.,
Get ideas from design blogs and magazines.,
Measure the length, width, and height of the room and make a floor plan.",How to Decorate a Room1," The vibe in the living room will be very different from the vibe in the bedroom. Think about how the room is used--is it a place to relax, a place to gather with friends, a place to work, a place to sleep--and how you want to feel when you are in the room.The function of the room is just as important as the overall look. The main function of your bedroom is as a place to unwind and sleep, so while you may be loving those loud prints, they might be better suited to a room with more action.
Make a list of words that describe how you want to feel in the room: productive, quiet, social, inspired. Keep these words in mind when you're decorating and ask yourself if the furniture, colors, and accents you are choosing support the mood you want.Do a little research on color theory to help emphasize mood. Bright colors encourage social behavior, so they work well in a living room. A room that is all one color isn't as exciting, but works well where you want a calm vibe, like a bedroom.;
, Use a website like Pinterest to collect images of rooms you like. Only select the rooms that really inspire you and look like places where you would enjoy spending time.Once you have a good collection, go through the pictures and pick out any common elements to incorporate into your own design scheme.Look at colors, textures, themes and styles (like rustic, modern, or nautical), furniture, lighting, or anything else that you notice popping up in your inspirational rooms.
Remember to consider the feel of the room. If one of your inspirational rooms makes you feel happy, try to pinpoint what it is about that space that brings out those feelings. Is it because there is a lot of natural light? Or the bright colors?

, There are tons of websites and apps that allow you to enter the measurements of your room so you can play around with furniture placement. You can see if a queen-size bed overwhelms your small bedroom, or if your desk looks better at the foot of the bed or against the opposite wall.


Take your measurements whenever you go furniture shopping, so you don't accidentally end up with furniture that won't fit in your room.
Consider the spaces just outside your room as well: you might not be able to get that huge sofa through the door if there are lots of tight corners leading to your room. Measure doorways and elevators, and find out if you can take larger furniture apart. Even unscrewing the legs off a couch may help.Mark the location of your outlets so you can plan where your lighting, television, computer, and other electronics can plug in.

Set a budget.,
Determine the purpose of your window furnishings.,
Consider the different types of window furnishings.,
Shop around for window treatment varieties and prices.",How to Choose Window Furnishings," Because window dressings come in such a wide array of types and styles, they also come in an equally variant set of price points. Before you shop for window treatments, you should decide how much you can afford to spend.;
,


If privacy is an issue, your treatments will need to address that. Consider what part of the interior space your window is in, as well as what portion of the outside environment it opens up to. For example, a bathroom window that opens out to a front driveway will need much more privacy than a library window that opens out to a garden.
Window coverings may be used to diffuse light, or block light out altogether. Consider how the sun rises and sets in relation to the room the window is in, and decide if it is necessary to manage that light using window treatments.
Window dressings can be used for decorative purposes, to frame a window, draw attention to the window's architectural details, accent an interior design and/or camouflage an oddly shaped or placed window.
It is possible to create interior design optical illusions by strategically choosing and installing window furnishings that lend to a desired effect. For example, you can make a ceiling appear higher by hanging vertical, floor to ceiling drapes.
Thick window coverings can be used to protect your interior space from the elements and regulate room temperature.

, Choose treatments that fit into your budget, compliment your décor and fulfill your intended purpose(s).


Sunscreens are fabric window dressings that come in different levels of opaqueness to filter light in different ways, and generally operate on a contracting roller that allows you to pull them down or release them up. Thin sunscreens provide minimal light filtering and privacy, while black-out sunscreens completely block out the light and the view.
Blinds are made of either vertical or horizontal slats that can be adjusted to allow light in or block it out. These window furnishings come in a variety of styles and designs in order to suit a multitude of design aesthetics.
Screen/blind combinations are fabric screens that are pleated for a blind effect. Examples of these hybrid window treatments include Venetian blinds, Roman shades and honeycomb blinds.
Curtains and draperies are fabric window dressings that can be used in a multitude of arrangements to create different decorative effects and fulfill different needs. For example, thick, lined curtains may be installed across the entirety of a large window to block out sunlight and to keep the interior space cool; additionally, this type of curtain treatment creates an impactful decorative effect.
Sheers are fabric treatments made of thin, translucent material. They are often used as minimal light filters, and in coordination with other window treatments for decorative effect.
Window treatment toppers are used primarily as decorative features to frame out the upper horizontal line of a window. They come in many forms, including valances, swags and cornices, and may be complimented by cascades or jabots, which frame out the vertical window edges.

, Explore your options from numerous sources, including window furnishings websites, home improvement stores, chain retailers and department stores.

Choose a ""lead"" piece for your room.,
Make lighting a priority and create at least three sources of light in the room.,
Paint your room a color selected from your lead piece.,
Don't be afraid of negative (empty) space.,
Consider the balance and flow of each room.",How to Decorate a Room2," Select a pillow, rug, fabric, artwork or furniture that will ""lead"" the rest of your decorating decisions. It should be colorful so you have a full palate to work with, and should tie into the energy and mood you want to set.Don't stop at colors--consider the pattern (geometric, organic) and texture of your lead piece and how to work those elements into the rest of the room.
Your lead piece doesn't need to be something new. It could be something you already own, or a vintage or antique piece you find on craigslist.

, An often ignored but essential part of decorating is having the right lighting. Rely on natural light from windows, table and floor lamps, and try to avoid harsh overhead lighting.Dorm rooms and rentals often have a single overhead light fixed to the ceiling. If you can, swap it out for something more attractive, like an inexpensive chandelier from Ikea (remember to save the original lighting to replace when you move), or soften the light by hanging scarf or covering it with a lampshade.Remember the lighting will affect how the colors appear in your room. That beautiful shade of green you painted your walls may look like swamp water in bad lighting.
Use mirrors and other reflective surfaces to create light sources., You can choose a brighter or more muted version of the color to emphasize different moods.Once you've selected a color, stick to complimentary or analogous colors (the ones opposite your color or right next to your color on a color wheel) to avoid clashing., You don't have to cram every square inch of your room full of pictures and furniture--your room will end up looking unfocused, busy, and cluttered.Having a lot of space in a bedroom can make the overall mood more calm and serene.If you have a large piece of artwork or something you want to stand out from the rest of the room, try surrounding it with negative space. It will draw attention to emphasize that particular piece., Sometimes a room can just feel ""off,"" and chances are it has to do with balance. A balanced room means that you don't have all your heavy furniture on one side, or all your exciting fabrics and artwork clustered together across from an empty wall. It can take a while to get it right, but try moving things around so that the things that dominate the room are equally spread out.Try walking through the room to make sure there aren't any obstacles and you can move freely into the next room, or to the table, couch, or bed.If you are using prints, try mixing to bring balance to the room. If you use striped wallpaper, try adding in less structured, more organic details, like a pillow with a floral pattern."

Find out what you're allowed to change.,
If you are not allowed to paint your room, get creative!,
Trade out hardware like cabinet knobs, light switch plates and doorknobs.",How to Decorate a Room3," Don't lose your security deposit because you broke the rules in your lease. Ask your landlord or review your lease to see if you are allowed to paint (and if you have to paint it back to the original color when you move out) or make any other major changes.

, Hang a colorful, textured rug. Put up temporary wallpaper or frame a sheet of wallpaper and hang it as an accent. Hang colorful art and photos to bring life to your blank walls.


Your landlord may agree to let you paint your walls a neutral color like white, cream, or grey.Add hidden pops of color by wallpapering the back of a bookshelf or painting sides and inside of your drawers a bright color.
Remember to keep anything you remove so you can replace it when it's time to move. If you swap out hardware, blinds, or lighting, keep the original someplace safe.

, Your landlord probably went with the most inexpensive option. Find hardware that fits into your design scheme and replace the old, cheap ones with something that is more ""you"" (again, remember to keep the original hardware to put back when you move out!).

Decide on the color scheme of the room.,
Create an attractive view from the room’s entryway.,
Provide ample space to move.,
Avoid cluttering your dining room.",How to Design an Inviting Dining Room," Before brainstorming for ideas, you need to design a budget. After designing a budget, you'll know the exact resources you have to create your dining room.


Start with savings or other money you've set aside for your dining room.
Allocate money for painting, flooring, and other structural elements. It might be best to get estimates from several contractors for these costs.
Determine how much money you have for major pieces of furniture. This includes your table, chairs, and buffet.
Figure out how much money you want to reserve for accessories like artwork, plants, or rugs.;
, Spend time browsing a variety of media in order to get ideas about how you'll plan your dining room. Without looking at how others have designed inviting dining rooms, you won't be equipped to prepare your own. Consult:


Furniture catalogs.
Home improvement magazines. Consider magazines like ""Better Homes and Gardens,"" ""Martha Stewart Living,"" or ""Good House Keeping.""
Websites. Try websites associated with popular magazines or TV channels like HG TV.

, The style of a dining room is largely responsible for the feel of the overall room. Thus, you need to make sure you are conscious of the style you are choosing when you design your dining room. If you’re not, your room may clash or send mixed signals to guests.


Consider styles such as neoclassical, Tudor, art deco, French countryside, or shabby sheik.
Your style may or may not reflect the overall style of your home.
If you choose a clashing style, make sure to clash responsibly and do so deliberately. For instance, you may choose to stick an art deco serving table into a room decorated with a Tudor style., As the centerpiece of your dining room, your table will set the tone for the whole room. If you choose an inappropriate table, you’ll inadvertently set a tone that you don’t want.


Your table should be an appropriate size for your room. You should have at least 36 inches (91 cm) between your table and the wall (or furniture). Ideally, you should have 48 inches (123 cm) between the two.
Think about whether you want an expandable table with leaves.
Consider the style of your table and whether it will match other accent furniture. Major styles include traditional (with many ornate details), contemporary style (relatively simple), transitional (some ornate details but relatively simple), and the country style (these might appear shabby chic or distressed).
Determine the material you want your table made from. While some people prefer a traditional wood, others might want a upscale mahogany, and some people may want a modern-looking glass or metal table.
Think about whether the table will age well. Ultimately, a cheap table that looks good today might look horrible in 5 years – forcing you to redesign your whole dining room., Seating is an essential element in any dining room. Thus, you need to put a lot of thought into the types of seating and number of options you’ll include. When picking seating, consider:


Provide seating for your average dining party. For most people, this ranges from 8 to 12.
Pick chairs based on style and comfort. The style should match or compliment the overall style of the room. In addition, chairs should be comfortable so people can relax and enjoy their meal.
Think about using benches or even stools as an alternative to table chairs.
Consider adding couches, loveseats, or extra chairs throughout the space. Couches and loveseats, in particular, can create a more intimate setting in a large dining room., After your table and chairs, you need to think about serving tables and side tables when designing your inviting dining room. These tables are important, as they’ll likely make your serving experience easy and more user-friendly.


Consider a buffet. A buffet is a long table or piece of furniture where you can store dishes (underneath or in cabinets) and place food before it is served.
Think about adding a simple serving table. Like buffets, simple serving tables are a place to stage food before it is served or a place to sit food and allow people to serve themselves.
Add side tables. Side tables are important if you have informal seating areas in your dining room. They may be a place for company to set drinks or appetizer plates while they chat., After picking your furniture, you need to pick accent pieces that will add more character to your dining room. Accent pieces will tie everything together, add your personal touch, and impress guests with your thoughtfulness.


Lighting fixtures.
Mirrors.
Artwork. Artwork could include paintings, pieces of pottery, glass work, or more.
Plants.
Rugs.
Remember to not add too many accent pieces, as you don’t want the room to feel crowded. This ultimately, is an art rather than a science. A typical rule of thumb, though, is to make sure there is plenty of wall space, floor space, and table space between each item or cluster of items., An important and often overlooked element of any inviting dining room is the drapery. Drapery can set the tone of the room and tie different, contrasting elements together. On the other hand, a poor choice of drapery can send negative messages to your guests.


Choose your drapery after you’ve chosen other major elements of your dining room, like the main pieces of furniture (seats, the table, and serving tables).
Depending on your taste and style, you may want to match your drapery to rugs or other accent pieces.
Your drapery should always be chosen when considering the color of your wall and floor., At its very core, your dining room is a place where people will experience the colors and textures you’ve chosen. Thus, you need to make sure the color scheme is appropriate, planned, and inviting.


Don’t mix warm and cool undertones. For instance, don’t choose a warm wall paint (tan) and cool drapes (light blue). Consider this when matching the floor, wall paint, and furniture.
Avoid mixing smoky or muted colors with bright colors. For instance, don’t choose a washed-out red for drapes and a bright lime for the wall paint. Think about this when you are creating a plan for the whole room.
Paint small rooms cool colors. Cool colors, like grey, white, or light blues, will make a smaller space seem larger.
Use warm colors in large spaces. Warm colors, like browns, tans, or reds, will make large spaces seem more intimate., When it comes to dining rooms – and other rooms – first impressions are very important. To create an inviting dining space, you need to make sure that the view from your entryway is truly inviting.


Avoid blocking the entryway with tables or chairs.
Make sure the space of the entryway transitions into the space of the dining room. For example, if you can balance the walkway space from the entryway and the space between your table and a side table or buffet, do so.
Pick a couple pieces of artwork or furniture that will capture your guests’ attention as they enter the dining room., As a place where food will be served and people will dine, your dining room needs to be a place where people can easily move around. Without ample space to move, your room won’t be inviting.


Space chairs so people can easily leave the table.
Don’t situate a table to close to a wall or piece of furniture.
Take out any pieces of furniture that inhibit the movement of people. For example, while you want to add a cute coffee table to your informal sitting area, it may hinder the movement of people through that corner of your dining room., The easiest way to turn an inviting space into an uninviting space is to clutter it up. By cluttering a space, you send the message that items are more important than people. You also distract people from all the planning you’ve done on your color scheme and furniture.


Don’t view wall space as something to fill or conquer. Position painting and furniture a couple feet apart.
Never try to cover table, curio, or china cabinet space completely. Focus on an elegant and balanced look rather than a full look. For instance, you don’t need to display all your rare salt and pepper shakers. Display your most cherished ones, and store the rest.
Ask friends and family if they think your dining room has a bare or cluttered look. Let them know that you just want their honest opinion. For instance, say “John, can you honestly tell me whether this room looks bare or cluttered? I’m trying to create an inviting dining space and I think I’m not there yet.”"

, This is what you love most about this room and where someone's attention is drawn immediately upon walking into the space. Some examples of focal points include high ceilings or beautiful windows. If you are not sure about a focal point, skip to #6.

, This is where the glamour comes in; if your focal point is a high ceiling, add a beautiful chandelier. If you have great windows, add dramatic curtains in a bold pattern or luxurious fabric.

, This is the key to taking your room from bland to fabulous. For your furniture, mix and match pillows of different fabrics and colors in your color pallet to add depth to your room. On a coffee table, add a few unique pieces that will add interest- books, serving tray filled with candies, or a set of candles of all different shapes and sizes. On an end table, add a quirky table lamp or flower arrangement, real or fake, in your color pallet.

, If you couldn't find a focal point, a rug, if the space permits, is a great option. Find one that is in a solid color with great texture, or one with a dynamic bold pattern such a chevron, overlapping circles, or an ikat pattern.

Measure your windows.,
Decide if vertical or horizontal blinds will work best.,
Consider your slat width.,
Choose a color.,
Shop around.,
Read the installation instructions.,
Ask about return policies.,
Consider custom vinyl blinds.",How to Buy Vinyl Blinds," Take measurements of all the windows that you will cover with vinyl blinds.


Use a tape measure to get the length of the window. Start at the top of the window, and pull the tape measure down to the bottom of the window.
Use a tape measure to get the width of the window. Start at the left of the window and pull the tape measure to the right until you get to the end of the window.;
,


Choose vertical blinds if you are covering a long window or a sliding door. Vertical blinds also work well in offices.
Select horizontal blinds for a softer, more modern look. Vinyl blinds that hang horizontally are used most often on windows in homes.

, Most horizontal vinyl blinds come with slats that are half an inch (1.27 cm) or 2 inches (5 cm).


Buy blinds with a larger slat width for extra privacy and to keep the sun out.
Look for a smaller slat size for more texture and style.

, Most vinyl blinds are available in a shade of white. You can find different colors to match your décor and curtains, however.

, Look for vinyl blinds in your window measurements at home improvement stores such as Lowe's and Home Depot.


Check department stores, such as Target, Sears and Walmart.
Shop online for a larger selection and lower prices. You may be able to find additional options for vinyl blinds online. You can also compare prices.

, If you will be hanging the blinds yourself, make sure you understand how to do it.


Check the packaging for instructions. If you cannot find them, ask a sales associate.

, You might get the blinds home and decide you do not like them. Make sure you can bring them back.

, If you have a window that is an unusual size, you might need to have blinds made for you. Talk to an associate in a store, or check online sites such as Blinds.com.

Choose light colors.,
Think in lines.,
Scale down your furniture.,
Get a large print carpet.,
Get multifunctional furniture.,
Choose portable pieces.",How to Decorate a Small Living Room1," Lighter colors occupy less visual weight, opening up the room. Use glass and thin-legged tables so the eye can see straight through to the floor, making it virtually invisible. Avoid dark stains, woods, or colors as they have a heavy effect, constricting the room.


Design with a cool eye in mind, but adding bright, warmer colors as accents. In general, cooler colors recede, letting the room take center stage -- so that wood floor shouldn't be stained any darker than it already is. Keep the colors to three or less, however; if you're a texture-lover, go monochromatic.;
, It's so easy to think about the square footage of a room and completely forget that there's way more to it than that: just look up. If you can get the eye to move up from the floor, you're good to go. Get a tall, simple floor lamp or vase, full-length curtains, and hang your paintings and mirrors the tall way.


This goes for furniture, too. Often streamlined furniture takes up less space but offers all the beauty and comfort of a curved piece.

, If your room is small, choose furniture that matches. Go for chairs that take up less space (without arms or thinner legs), loveseats, ottomans, etc. At the end of the day, there will be more space in the room. Consider a bench as opposed to a conventional coffee table; but if a table is more you, go for a glass or lucite one.


However, too many small objects will make it look cluttered. Just because you have smaller objects doesn't permit you to have more of them. Think of it like dieting -- eating a dozen low-fat Popsicles isn't a good idea, even though they're low-fat. Having a dozen small shelves is furniture overkill.

, If you have a dark wood floor, this is an especially good idea. A large print carpet, ideally with lines, will open up your space, in addition to brightening it up.


It does not have to take up the entirety of your room. Just a large rug that accompanies the main pieces of furniture will accomplish what you're looking for.

, Start seeing double. An oversized ottoman in the center of the seating area can serve as a coffee table with a decorative tray added, while the piece can also double for extra seating. Or, trade a coffee table for a woven trunk with storage space inside.However, when choosing your tables, opt for ones that have wide open legs. Being able to ""see through"" the furniture makes the room seem larger to the eye.

, Select smaller, portable pieces that can be rearranged. Three small end tables grouped as a coffee table are easy to sprinkle around the room to open up traffic flow when entertaining or to clear space for children to play.Utilize the space beneath tables and slide pieces in and out at your leisure. A decorative basket can be seen but still used as storage and taken out when needed.

"

Use mirrors.,
Layer your lights.,
Control clutter.,
Build in storage.",How to Decorate a Small Living Room2," Mirrors can easily make a small space look larger -- we've all walked into a room that, upon first impression, was huge, but with a second glance, it was just our eyes being tricked. If you can, use a mirror that expands vertically.


Sometimes it's not that simple, however. Mirrors work best by reflecting light -- so make sure they're facing light itself or a light-colored wall. Check to see what gets reflected in your mirror by standing in different points of the room.

, To really appreciate any room, the lighting has to be right, but this goes double in a small room. All curtains should be light and airy and able to be drawn back -- after all, natural light is best.


To avoid the space taken up by lamps, go for wall sconces; you don't need an electrician anymore for that, either -- the new-fangled ones can be attached anywhere. If applicable, get light over pieces of artwork, too. Think in natural light (from windows), ceiling lights (preferably dimmable), sconces, and table lamps. If there are no dark corners in your room, you've succeeded.

, There are going to be things you need in the room that you may wish you didn't, so get creative when it comes to storing them. Invest in some cute cubes, boxes, or baskets. They'll be less distracting and keep the room from feeling overwhelming.


Keep the knickknacks on your tables and mantle to a minimum. The less clutter in the room, the better you'll feel about being in it. Put away what you don't need and what doesn't heighten the ambience of the space.

, If your budget allows, design some light-colored cabinets or shelving you can build into the room. Not only will this draw the eye upward, but it gives the room character and function, too. And more storage for you!


If you don't have the option to build in, get creative. Utilize space under pieces of furniture or put up a shelf or two. Buy an end table that can double as a bookcase and place hooks on the walls.

,
Mount the shutter frame onto the window frame and secure it by screws or another method.

",How to Build Plantation Shutters,"


Begin with the four planks that will serve as the shutter frame. Your shutter frame should be about .25 inches (or .6 cm) narrower than the window frame.





;
,,, The length of the louvers should be 1/16th inch narrower than the opening between the two vertical stiles. The nylon louver pins that support the louvers inside the frame have a washer that is molded into the pin and is 1/32 inch in thickness. These washers prevent the lovers from contacting the inside edges of the stile resulting in smooth action. How many louvers you use depends on the size of the louvers and panel height.

, If starting from scratch, remember to leave room to securely attach pins with glue at either end of the louvers. Flat louvers are typically 2.5 3.5 or 4.5 inches in width.

,, The louvers should overlap by 1/4 inch. Take great care to line up the markings on either side of the frame so that the louvers will sit flat.

,, If you're having trouble getting the louvers in, drill the holes a bit deeper.

, A wooden dowel that can swivel easily is ideal.

Start with the inside top of the casing where the blinds will be mounted, and measure all the way to the windowsill below.;
, Measure from the top of the blind casing to the blind slat that most closely corresponds with the window measurements. Move downward 1 additional slat to allow a little room for error. Mark the first slat to be removed with a marker or pen.

, Mini-blinds are equipped with plastic plugs on the underside of the bottom rail. Most designs will feature 3 plugs along the length of the rail. Releasing the plugs allows access to the lift cord and the 3 string ladders on the mini-blinds.You can usually just pull out the plugs without having to do anything fancy.

, This action will slide the lift cords through the holes in the bottom rail and the slats immediately above the rail. Continue to pull the cords upward until the marked slat is freed from the cords.

, This will provide you with better access to the blind slats.

, With the lift cords no longer threaded through the slats, this requires sliding each of the slats out of the 3 string ladders.

, Slide the rail back into the string ladders just under the remaining blind slats. Trim off any unused sections of the ladders that you no longer need.

, Use the measuring tape to make sure the knots are in the ideal position so the cords are all the same exact lengths, and the slats will hang evenly.

, Take a moment to try raising and lowering the blinds, as well as opening and closing them to make sure they are functioning properly.

, Otherwise, don’t even bother to look towards the section selling such curtains.

,, Imagine placing them against the wall, which you had already visualized. Now confirm the one from this final list, which perfectly matches with the wall colour from every angle.

Examine the surface where your blinds are attached.,
Locate some tie-downs.,
With the blinds down, hold the tie-down in place and mark the corresponding screw holes with a pencil.

,
If you're attaching the hold-down to a steel door or a wooden window frame, you can just directly screw the holder down.

,
If it is drywall or plaster, you'll need to use an anchor plug.,
If it's brick or concrete, you'll need to use a special screw made for these surfaces (Tap-con).,
Once you have the hold-downs attached to the wall, simply snap them onto the bottom of your blinds to prevent them from blowing.",How to Stop Blinds from Blowing in the Wind," Is it a wooden window frame, drywall/plaster, a wood or steel door, brick, or concrete? This will determine the best way to attach them down.;
, Most stores that sell window coverings will also sell blind tie-downs. These are usually small plastic clips that attach to the bottom rail of your blinds. If you look closely at the bottom rail, you should see a small plastic cap on the ends that can be pried off. Purchase a tie-down that will match the color of your blinds.

,,, Drill a hole large enough to fit the anchor plug and pound it in with your fist or a rubber mallet. Pass the screw into the anchor plug - the screw will make it expand and grip onto the wall.

, These are special screws that will bite into concrete or brick. You'll need to drill a pilot hole (using a masonry drill bit) with a drill that can penetrate brick or concrete (hammer drill). Most good drills will have a concrete setting.

, You might need to bend the tie-down out slightly to securely attach them to your blinds.

Do not grab the shade to the left or right of this center point. Adjusting the shade from this angle can cause it to roll up at an uneven slant, which may cause long-term damage to your blinds system. For similar reasons, you should not grab the shade at its left or right edge, either.
Many rolling blinds have a small cord at the bottom center edge. If yours does, you can grab the cord here when making your adjustments.;
, Pull the shade down by roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm).









Do not hold the shade in place here. Immediately proceed to the next step. Pulling the shade down releases it from its locked position, but if you continue to hold it down, it will simply lock itself into this new position.

, As soon as you pull the shade down, let go of it. The shade should roll up on its own once you do.









If the speed and stop height are properly adjusted, the shade should roll up at a safe speed and stop automatically at the appropriate height without any manual guidance.
If the blinds roll up too quickly or too slowly, you may need to adjust the speed. Likewise, if the blinds do not automatically stop at the right position, you may need to adjust the stop height. Please see the “Common Adjustments” section for more information.
If the blinds refuse to roll up at all, they might be broken. Please see the “Additional Troubleshooting” section for additional help.

, Grab the bottom edge of the shade at its center point with one hand.


If the blinds have a draw cord at the bottom center edge, pull on the cord when drawing the blinds down. If the blinds do not have a draw cord, you will need to grab the material along the bottom edge directly.
Try not to grab the shade to the left or right of the bottom center point. Making adjustments from an angle can cause the blinds to unroll unevenly and become slanted. In the worst case scenario, this can even cause permanent damage to the rolling mechanism.

, Pull the blinds down the desired length. Hold the shade in that position for at least two seconds.









The blinds should unroll and lower without any resistance.
Briefly holding the blinds in position should lock them into place.

, Let go of the blinds. If you locked them correctly, the blinds should remain in place even when you let go.









If the blinds roll up again upon being released, try unrolling them in the same manner and holding them in place for a longer period of time.
If the blinds will not lock into place no matter how long you hold them, they might be broken. Please see the ""Additional Troubleshooting"" section for additional information.

, You can usually change the point at which the blinds stop (the ""stop height"") on blinds that are wider than 2 feet (60.1 cm).

Roll the blinds up as far as they will currently go.
Locate the stop controller dial on the side of the roller tube.

Rotate this dial clockwise to lower the fabric level and the stop point.
Rotate the dial counterclockwise to raise the fabric level and the stop point.


Lower and raise the shade as usual to check the new stop point. Repeat the steps you just followed as needed until you are satisfied with the new stop point.

, When the blinds roll up a little too quickly or too slowly, you should be able to might small alterations to the speed without too much effort.

Raise the blinds as far as they will go and remove them from their wall brackets.
Place the blinds on a flat surface and locate the black knob on the left side of the rolling mechanism. Identify the winder handle on that knob.
Turn the winder to change the speed.

To increase the speed, pull the winder while rotating the black knob once or twice in a clockwise direction.
To decrease the speed, pull the winder and make a half-turn clockwise. While still pulling the winder, make one or two rotations counterclockwise.


Place the blinds back into the wall brackets and check the speed again. Make further adjustments as needed.

, When roller blinds will not completely roll up, the problem is usually caused by loose spring tension. Increase the tension of the internal spring to fix it.Pull the blind down 18 inches (45.72 cm).
Remove the brackets holding the blinds together and take the blind off the wall.
Use your hands to manually roll the fabric around the roller, winding it snugly and evenly.
Place the blind back into its brackets and test the tension again. You may need to repeat the process several times to get the tension right.

, When blinds roll up much too quickly or do not stop on their own when released from a locked position, it usually means that the internal spring has too much tension. You will need to decrease the spring tension to fix this issue.Pull the blind down by 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm). Make sure that the blind locks into that position.
Remove the brackets and take the blind off the wall.
Manually unwind 18 inches (45.72 cm) of the blind using your hands.
Place the blind back in its brackets and test the tension. You may need to repeat this process several times, unwinding more of the shade each time, until you achieve the right tension.

, If the internal tension spring has become completely uncoiled, the blinds won't roll up at all. You'll need to manually coil up the spring again.Remove the blinds from the brackets and take the blinds off the wall.
Unroll the blinds roughly halfway.
Using pliers, grab the pin on the spring-side of the shade. Rotate that pin counterclockwise until you feel a little resistance or tension develop, then ease off enough to allow the directional latch, or ""pawl,"" to hook into the rolling ratchet.
Loosen or tighten the spring tension as needed before placing the blinds back into the wall brackets.

, When the blinds refuse to move down at all, it is possible that the spring has become locked into a tight coil. You'll need to release the coil to fix the problem.

Remove the blinds from the wall brackets.
Using a set of pliers, grab the pin on the spring-side of the blinds and rotate it clockwise until you feel the directional latch/pawl free from its position. Once you release the pawl, the coil should unwind.
Loosen or tighten the spring tension normally and mount the blinds back into the wall brackets.

, If you've corrected the spring tension and you still have difficulty raising or lowering the blinds, the next thing to do is to check the clutch and the roller chain.

Make sure that the chain is in good shape. If some of the beads have broken off, that could be the cause of your problem. Replace the chain to fix it.
If the chain is in good shape, check the position of the chain stopper. If it runs into the rolling mechanism as you roll and unroll your blinds, it could be the source of the problem.

If the shade won't go up, pull on the chain until the stopper hits the rear top of the chain. If the shade won't go down, pull on the chain until the stopper hits the front top of the chain.
Remove the blinds from the brackets and off the wall with the chain in this position.
Manually roll the blinds in the direction they needs to go. If you've had difficulty rolling the blinds up, roll the fabric up by hand. If you've had difficulty unrolling the blinds down, unroll them to your desired length, but always leave at least two full rotations of fabric around the roller.
Place the blinds back into the brackets.


If nothing is wrong with the chain, the problem probably lies with the clutch mechanism. That mechanism will need to be replaced.

, Telescoping occurs when the blinds roll up unevenly, drifting to one side or the other. This can usually be remedied with masking tape.Check the brackets first. If the brackets are loose, manually remove and re-mount the blinds evenly in the brackets. Tighten the brackets to make sure that the blinds remains level and snug as it rolls.
If the brackets are not loose, unroll the shade as far as it will go, revealing the bare roller tube. Put one to three small pieces of masking tape where the fabric meets the roll, positioning it on the side that slants down when you operate your blinds. This should fix the problem.

You can typically find it in the fabric paint section of a fabric store or an arts and crafts store. If you have any inner shapes, like spots on a ladybug, trace around the inner shapes too using your outline color.It might be a good idea to make a few practice strokes on a piece of scrap paper first.This will allow you to get a feel for the puff paint and prevent it from gushing out.
Puff paint is not the same as glitter glue. You can, however, use glittery puff paint, if you'd like.

, Make several thick lines, then use the tip of your puff paint bottle to spread them around.Don't skimp on the puff paint; make it as thick as you can. If it is too thin, it will be hard to peel off.Make sure that all of the colors are touching, or your design will fall apart.

, Extra-fine glitter would work best for this, but you can use other types as well. Don't remove the excess glitter just yet.

, It will take at least 48 hours for the paint to dry. You can test smaller pieces after 24 hours.Most puff paint will look darker and slightly more translucent once it dries. Carefully peek under your design. If the puff paint still looks ""milky"" from behind, it is not ready.


If you added glitter, shake the glitter off after the paint dries., If your piece is very big, peel it off bit by bit so that it doesn't stretch or rip.If the window is stuck and won't come off easily, put it into the freezer for a few hours, then try again., Press the smooth side (the side that was against your template) against a clean window.

, Add the gelatin into the water first, then stir it with a whisk until it is completely dissolved. Make sure that you are using the clear, unflavored kind. You will be adding color later.If you wish to make a smaller batch of window clings, use 3 packets instead.Remove any bubbles with a spoon.

, You want it to be about ¼-inch 0.64-centimeter) thick.If you can't find a baking sheet, you can also use a casserole dish or pie pans. The goal is to get a thin layer of gelatin that is about ¼-inch 0.64-centimeter) thick.

,, You can do this with a skewer or a toothpick.You can also use liquid watercolor, but food coloring will be safer for younger children who are still teething.

, If your child is still on the teething stage, consider using edible glitter instead. Work quickly, however; the gelatin will harden up after 30 minutes., If your window clings are too soft or wet, they won't stick well to the windows. Let the gelatin dry for another night., If the shapes are too big, they will be to heavy and slide down your window.

, Lift away the excess gelatin from around the shapes first. Next, slide a spatula under each shape, then use it to lift them out.Set the shapes down onto a smooth surface, such as a plate, baking sheet, parchment paper, wax paper, etc.

, Keep in mind that these window clings are delicate and easily torn. They also do not last a long time. If they aren't sticking to your window, they are too wet and heavy. Let them sit, uncovered, for another day or two, before trying again.These window clings are safe for teething children because they are made from gelatin. It is not recommended that you munch on them, however; they likely don't taste very good.

Covering a patio will require a larger awning than an awning covering a window or doorway. When making an awning above a window, you don't want to prevent all light-just the majority of the heat.
Estimate your dimensions.

,


Purchase 1 inch wide by 6 inches long (2.54 cm wide by 15.24 cm long) boards to create the awning frame.
Create a 2-dimensional square frame and attach an equally sized square frame to it so they share a middle spine.
Make 2 identical 2-dimensional right triangle frames attached to the ends of your square frame. This makes a 3-dimensional right triangle frame.
Attach a perpendicular board from the middle spine. This board will attach to the house for support.
Affix metal elbow joints to each angle on the frame for sturdiness.
Place 3 metal brackets on the interior side of the frame for attaching to the house.

Measure the window’s width then add a few inches to compensate for that. Add another one or two inches for the thickness of the boards you’ll use to make the cornice.A good rule of thumb is to add six inches onto your initial width measurement.;
, It’s up to you what material you choose and how much you need to design the cornice, but the cornice itself can be done with three cut pieces of wood. You’ll want to buy a board that is as long as the measurement of your door, but you’ll also need two cuts on the ends about three inches long.


Cornice material is often a soft wood such as pine or poplar, but it can be made from other material such as foam.
Get wood for any decorations you choose, such as a top shelf or crown molding.

, You’ll need to find a way to make the cornice hang on the wall. One way to do this is to buy brackets and half-inch screws. You can also buy a thin piece of board where you’ll rest the cornice before securing it from the top with more screws. All of these options can be found at local hardware stores.


No option is preferable or sturdier to the other, so this depends on how you wish to screw into the drywall of your house.
Bracket mounting can become complicated, as this includes finding L-shaped brackets and screwing these into both the wall and the cornice.
Board and screw mounting is simple and good for cornices with tops, but getting the screws close enough to the walls can prove to be a tight fit.

, The fabric is what you’ll wrap the cornice in before stapling it together. This forms a simple but patterned decoration. The thickness of the fabric is up to you, but the fabric will have to be cut and stapled in order to make it go on smoothly and evenly.


Any fabric can be used, but engineered fabrics are more durable than natural fabrics. Some cottons are durable, but if you have pets and kids, it may be worth avoiding silk and rayon, for example.Fabric isn’t a mandatory choice. You can also paint the cornice or stain it.

, Batting is cotton wadding used to insulate quilts. It has the same effect here, providing a layer of extra thickness between the cornice and the fabric. Any sort of quilt batting is appropriate for this project and is common in craft stores.If you’ve chosen a thick fabric, you may not even need the batting to get the cornice to look the way you desire.

, If you haven’t had this done, you’ll have to do it yourself. For a three-piece cornice, lay the board flat. Using a hand saw or circular saw at a 45 degree angle, cut three-inch panels off both ends. These will be the boards that connect the cornice to the wall., Where you drill the holes depends on how you want to assemble the cornice pieces. These holes can be drilled directly into the small pieces near where they will attach to the larger board or they can be drilled on the larger board over where the small pieces will attach., Using 1.5 inch wood screws, fasten the three pieces of the cornice together. Wood glue is useful for extra security. At this point you should have a flat board attached to two legs.

, The options for decorating a plain cornice are limited only by the imagination. Choose a coat of paint that goes with your room or buy a wood stainer. You can apply sealer and let it sit for a few hours before applying stainer, but this isn’t necessary to make the color even.


With a brush or cloth, paint the cornice evenly on all sides.

, Once the cornice looks complete, bring it up to the wall. If you are using brackets, slide it over the brackets and screw them together. Another option is to use a thin base of wood secured to the wall. For this option, put screws on the roof of the cornice as close to the wall as possible. Screw them down through the cornice and into the wall mount.

, Lay out the fabric and, with a pair of scissors, reduce it to the appropriate size. Both the fabric and batting will wrap around the cornice, so you’ll want to make it proportionately bigger, for example six inches wider and 12 inches longer than the cornice board.Remember that you’ll have an opportunity to trim the fabric later.

, Keep it laid out on a flat surface. Pass an iron over it to remove any wrinkles. This ensures the fabric looks its best when you hang it.

, Lay the remaining batting out flat. Put the cornice in the center of it. Pull one side over to the center, then do the same with the other side. The material should fit snugly. With a staple gun start in the center and move outward, stapling the material on opposite sides at intervals.Other adhesives, such as glue and tape, can be used.

, At the corners where the cornice will meet the wall, fold the batting downwards onto the wood. Cut what you don’t need. Fold the remaining batting so that it appears neat. It should not be sticking up anywhere at this point.

, Place the fabric print-side down, flat, and center the cornice on it. Do what you did to the batting again with the fabric. Pull one side over the center, the pull the other side over to meet it. Keep the fabric firm so that no area bunches and becomes uneven.

, Trim off the excess at the corners. The fabric should securely wrap all the way around the cornice and lay flat. Take the staple gun and, starting at the center, staple it to connect the ends and the batting., Secure the cornice to the brackets with screws, if you used them. Another option is to use a thin base of wood secured to the wall. For this option, put screws on the roof of the cornice as close to the wall as possible. Screw them down through the cornice and into the wall mount."

, Before you apply a decal, clean the area where you will put the decal. Clean the area only with either rubbing alcohol or soap and water. Don’t use a window cleaning product on the window because the residue it leaves will prevent the decal from sticking.







, Prepare the decal before you place it on your window. Use something with a thin edge, like a credit card. Take the credit card or other object and rub it along the side of the decal with the clear tape. The goal of this process is to remove any air bubbles.








Make sure to use enough pressure to smooth out the air bubbles.

, Large decals are much more difficult to place on windows than smaller ones. With larger decals, measure the decal and the window area where you wish to place it. Make sure the decal will fit.

Iron pleats to make them more pronounced.",How to Iron Curtains," Unwrap the curtains if they are still packaged. After that, you should wash your curtains on a cold water delicate cycle and then dry them with low heat or no heat on a gentle cycle. Beyond removing residue from your curtains, washing will also make stubborn wrinkles less difficult.If your curtains are especially dirty, as might be the case if you're swapping in old curtains that have been in storage, you may want to wash them in warm water, but only if the label recommends doing so.
Generally, you should wash your curtains in cold water. This will help prevent fading and shrinkage in your curtain fabric.
For best results, you should use detergent intended for delicate fabric. With curtains that have dark or prominent colors, you might also want to use detergent formulated to keep colors from fading.If care instructions are included with your curtains, keep these. Some kinds of fabric or styles of curtain may require special treatment. If yours do, this information will be included in the care instructions.
If there aren’t care instructions on the packaging or a separate sheet of paper, look for a small tag on your curtain. This should have information like the material your curtains are made of and recommended washing and ironing procedure.;
, Much like you've laid your curtains out close to where you intend to hang them, you'll also want your ironing board set up close to the hanging location. This will create less opportunity for wrinkles to form while transporting your curtains between the ironing and hanging location.


If you're having trouble setting up your ironing board, look for a catch or button underneath the board. Many boards have this feature to prevent the legs from extending while you are moving it.
You may find it easiest to set up your ironing board in its tallest position to make transferring your curtains from the board to the curtain rod easier., Depending on the age and brand of iron you're using, the time it take to heat up can vary. In many cases, five minutes should be sufficient for your iron to heat up.Then turn your iron’s dial to the appropriate fabric setting.


Most irons have a dial with which you can select a setting for the kind of fabric you'll be ironing. Common fabrics that are likely listed on your iron include cotton, linen, and synthetic fabrics.
Check the tag on your curtain or its care instructions to determine the fabric you'll be ironing, and set your iron to that fabric.Never lay your iron so the metal, heated part of the iron rests on your ironing board. This can cause your iron to burn the board.

, A little spritz of water to dampen the curtains will help your iron work its magic. Regular water from your faucet should work fine for this purpose, but if you have hard water, you may want to use distilled water to prevent discoloration in your curtains from mineral buildup.Feel free to use the spray feature on irons that have one in place of a spray bottle. However, a spray bottle will come in handy if you have to spot treat wrinkles that form after you iron.

, There are many ways you can lay out your curtain, and you may find that some work better for you than others. To prevent missing wrinkles and make hanging the curtain easier on yourself, you may want to work from the top of the curtain down.


You can identify the top of the curtain easily by looking for the curtain rod loops or pockets.
When ironing from one end to another, you'll likely need to reposition your curtains several times throughout the process.

, If your iron doesn't have a stream or spray feature, take your water bottle and spray the curtain with clean water a few times until it is damp. Pass your iron back and forth over the width of the curtain until wrinkles are smoothed and work your way toward its bottom.It's unlikely you'll be able to iron your entire curtain on your board all at once. As you work farther down the curtain, you can adjust your curtain so that the already ironed top portion hangs off the end of your ironing board.
Continue until the ironed portion almost reaches the floor. It's very common for a curtain to wrinkle after ironing. By allowing your ironed curtain to hang loosely off the edge of your ironing board until it almost reaches the floor, it's unlikely bunching or re-wrinkling will occur., Roughly one half to two-thirds of your curtain should be ironed at this point. By hanging the ironed portion of your curtain now, there'll be less of a chance it will wrinkle and you'll still be able to finish the un-ironed part. To do this you should:


Disassemble your curtain rod. Feed the rod through the tabs, pockets, or hanging loops at the top of the curtain.
Hang the curtain and rod in place. The remaining un-ironed part of your curtain should hang low enough for you to finish the ironing.
If you have a low ironing board, it may be difficult to iron enough curtain to allow the un-ironed remainder to reach your board after hanging so you can finish ironing it. In this case, you may want to bring a stool or something you can drape the ironed part of your curtain over to keep it from wrinkling while finishing the entire curtain. Then you can hang it., As you continue to iron your way toward the bottom of the curtain, you can allow ironed parts to fall into position to hang with the upper ironed portion. Try to avoid sharp angles that causes the fabric to fold or bunch. This could re-wrinkle your curtains.After you've finished, you can spot treat remaining wrinkles. You can do this easily with your spray bottle. Simply spray any remaining wrinkles with water, smooth the fabric with your hands, and let it dry. This technique works well for removing light wrinkles., Delicate, embellished fabrics can be damaged from the heat of your iron. However, for most unembellished curtains, you shouldn't need to do anything special to iron out wrinkles.


To protect delicate fabrics and embellishments, you can overlay a pillowcase or sheet over the embellished area you'll be ironing to protect it from direct heat, and then iron as normal.
If you're concerned that the heat setting for your iron may be too high, a pillowcase/sheet buffer is also a good idea., Many curtains will not require starch, though easily wrinkled delicate fabrics may call for it. Starch will make your fabric crisp and less wrinkle prone. Your curtain instructions should indicate if a starch solution should be used on your curtains.Many modern forms of starch come premixed in a spray can. For this kind of starch product, you should follow the directions as indicated on its label.
Some starch comes in powdered form and is intended to be mixed with clean water in a spray bottle.
You can make your own starch spray with one heaping tablespoon of corn starch and one pint of clean water. Mix the solution well before using., With especially delicate or expensive curtains, your pillowcase/sheet heat buffer might not be enough to fully protect your curtains. You can still iron your curtains safely by using your pad and ironing the back of the curtain rather than the front., These kind of fabrics are especially prone to heat damage. When ironing these, you'll be sure to want buffer fabric, like a pillowcase or sheet, in between the iron and the curtain fabric. For extreme wrinkles, spray the curtain fabric with water first, put your buffer fabric in place, and then iron.

, Gather pleats together and iron them down in a way that follows the design of the fabric. This will make the accent of the pleat look crisper and more sharply defined.


A spritz of water from your spray bottle can help your iron remove stubborn wrinkles in the pleating.

Replace broken slats.",How to Install Wood Blinds," There is a range of woods and wood finishes that you can select, including bamboo, basswood, faux wood and others. Different types of wood blinds may provide better insulation or may block light more effectively. They may also have better quality finishes., Find blinds with complementary colors or finishes. Bring home samples of colors and textures to test with your current décor. Some blinds also have ladder tapes, which are coverings made of cloth (or other material) that can be tailored to your room with different colors and textures.

, Consider the type and size of window when selecting blinds. Some windows are very shallow and therefore need thinner blinds. Slats are typically available in 1”, 2” and 2.5” widths. Prices for blinds can range widely, from $70-$120 for an average window size of 36” wide by 60” tall. Custom blinds will be more expensive but may be the best solution for windows with odd measurements or irregularly shaped windows.

, Many blinds are adjusted using a cord that you pull to swivel the slats open and closed. There are also cordless lift blinds, which do not have cords. These are safer options if you have small children who might pull on cords. You can also choose blinds that resemble shutters from the outside of the window. Some blinds have rounded corners while others have square corners.

, Remove your blinds from the package and lay out all of the mounting bracket parts. Compare with the blinds installation instructions to make sure you have all the pieces.

, Blinds can be mounted on the inside of the window (inside mounting), on the outside of the window on the wall (outside mounting), or on the ceiling above the window (ceiling mounting).Determining the best positioning for the brackets will depend on style preference as well as wall material that may affect the ease of bracket installation. Hold the blinds against the window to ensure they will fit properly for your preferred positioning.


Inside mount: The blind slats are measured to fit inside the frame of the window and the mounting brackets are placed inside the top of the window frame.
Outside mount: The blinds are measured to overlap the window frame and the mounting brackets are installed on the wall above the frame.
Ceiling mount: The blinds are measured to overlap the window frame and the mounting brackets are installed on the ceiling directly above the window.

, Hold the blind head rail up to the window in the position where you plan for it go be mounted (inside, outside or ceiling). Make pencil marks about /14” to 1/8” past the ends of the head rail; you’ll line up the brackets on these marks for attaching them to the wall. Use a level to ensure the marks are even and so that the blinds will hang evenly. Consult the instructions that came with your blinds kit for exact specifications, as they vary by manufacturer.


If you are using inside mount blinds, hold the head rail up either flush with the wall inside the window jamb, or hold it back closer to the window.

, The best choice of anchor to secure the mounting bracket will depend on the type of wall you have. For drywall and plaster, use drywall anchors to hold in the screws. For brick or concrete walls, use masonry anchors. To install anchors, predrill a hole that is a suitable size for the anchor at the spot where you need the mounting bracket screw to go. Push the anchor into this hole until it is flush with the wall.For heavier blinds, you will need more secure brackets and wall anchors that can handle the extra weight.

, These are typically cube-shaped pieces with one open side and one side with a sliding or hinged door. Hold the side mounting brackets up on the pencil marks you made. Place the bracket with the door side facing you and the open side pointing toward inside of the window. Open the bracket cover with a screwdriver. Screw the bracket in place using the screws that came with the product.


If you are using anchors, mark the screw holes with a pencil and predrill the holes. Install the anchors first before screwing the bracket to the wall.

, If your window blinds are wide enough, your kit may have come with a support bracket. This will go in the middle of the window, in line with the side brackets. Measure between the two side brackets and find the middle. Mark this spot with a pencil. Use a level to ensure that the brackets will be even. You can move this support bracket 2-3” to either side of the middle if its center placement interferes with the mechanics of your blinds.Position the middle of the support bracket on this point. If you plan to use anchors to secure the screws into the wall, predrill holes for their installation now. Screw the support bracket in place.

, This should snap into place. Some models may require that you hook the head rail onto the brackets. Make sure the blinds are in the closed position, which will make installation easier. Then fold down the bracket swivel flaps. Follow the instructions that came with your blinds to ensure you are doing it properly, as these could vary slightly depending on brand of blinds.

, This piece goes along the top front of your blinds to hide the brackets. Some models may have a protective covering on the valance that can be removed if you choose. Many valances are magnetic and will stick onto the head rail. Others need to be inserted into the top of the blinds, which should snap into the sides. Follow the blinds’ instructions to ensure you are doing this correctly.

, Your blinds may have come with a wand that will enable you to open and close the blinds when you twist it. To attach the wand, locate the sleeve and hook mechanism that extends below the wall mounting. Slide the sleeve upwards to reveal the hook and hang the wand on this hook. Pull the sleeve back down to fully cover the hook.

, To eliminate the risk of a choking hazard for children, install the cord cleat on which to wrap the blinds’ cord. Mount the cleat next to or above the window on the same side as the cord. Use the screws provided with the cord cleat and screw them into the wall. Wrap the cord around the cord cleat to keep it out of reach of small children., Some blinds come with a hold-down bracket, which will keep the blinds in place when they fully cover the window. Install this bracket into the wall or the window facing at the bottom right side. Snap in the bracket pin end into the bottom slat of the blinds where there is a hole intended for this hold-down bracket pin., Do not yank on the cord to pull the blinds up or down. Make sure children do not pull on the cords or twist the slats. Careful use will ensure that the blinds will work properly and last a long time.

, The slats on the blinds will gather dust over time. Every couple of weeks, wipe each slat carefully with a downward motion. You can also use a soft vacuum upholstery attachment, running it over each slat to remove dust. Alternately, wear a pair of soft gloves or old socks on your hands and rub your hands along each slat. Twist the slats to clean the other side.


If there are stains on the slats, use a wood cleaner to clean them off. Using a damp cloth with a small amount of cleaner, test an inconspicuous spot to make sure the cleaner does not mar or stain the surface of your blinds. Gently scrub the dirt with the cleaner, rubbing along the grain of the wood. Wipe clean with a damp cloth.Be careful not to get the blinds wet. Using a damp cloth is fine, but too much moisture can warp the slats and discolor the wood., If a slat gets broken or cracked, you do not need to replace the entire blind. Remove the plugs on the bottom slat to reveal the lift cord knot. Undo the knot and pull the lift cord out of the slat. Continue pulling the cord out, only pulling out of the slats until you reach the slat you want to remove. Replace the slat (available through your blinds manufacturer). Restring the lift cord through the blinds, weaving it back through the slats in the same pattern as you had removed it. Pull the cord through the bottom slat and tie a knot. Replace the plugs on the bottom to cover the knot. Use a rubber mallet to tap these in."

Use a utility knife to ""score"" the perimeters of the drywall you want to remove. ""Scoring"" is the using a knife to make shallow cuts without cutting it all the way to allow the dry wall to be removed easier.
Use a pry bar or a similar tool to pull off the drywall slowly and carefully, so as not to break drywall that you don't want to remove.;
, There is no exact way to do this, as long as you end up with the window and screen out while not destroying the frame or anything else around the window. Some suggestions:


Use a hammer or a drill to take out any nails or screws that are holding the window in place.
Sometimes there are little pieces of wood between the window and the wooden studs that hold the window tight. Remove this by pounding out with a hammer or using a pry bar like tool to push them out or using a drill to unscrew them if screwed in.

,


This will make it loose and easier to pull out.

, This is a simple step that can be started by using a hammer or drill to remove nails or screws that hold in the window frame.


Use a pry bar or hammer to ""wedge"" out the frame.

, This will be on the perimeter of the open space in the wall and will most likely be the same color and material as the actual siding itself.


Use hammer to remove nails used to keep it in place.
Use pry bar to pull it out carefully without scratching or breaking surrounding vinyl.

, You will be able to easily see the separate vinyl pieces by noticing where one piece overlaps the other on the side., Do not cut the vinyl off.

Use a siding removal tool. Extract nails keeping the vinyl pieces in place in order to prepare vinyl pieces to be removed.
Use this tool by inserting it where a piece of vinyl overlaps a piece below it and then sliding it across until you reach the end of the piece.

, Write down this measurement, as it will be used for the next step., Then, place these pieces of wood in the middle and the two sides of the open space.


If it is difficult to place these in their spots, use a hammer to pound them in as desired.

, This depends on the size of the window, but generally, as mentioned in the previous step, nail one to each side of the hole and one directly in the middle.


Nail in horizontally for side pieces and diagonally for middle pieces. A nail gun may make nailing easier and quicker, especially for nailing diagonally.

, Cut a sheet of wood accordingly to the measurements so that it will fit.

This will be a sheet of wood at least a half inch thick for strength.

, Insert it on the exterior side of the pieces of wood.


Nail or screw in securely to where the pieces of wood are behind the sheet of wood.
Make sure the sheet of wood is ""flush"" against the studs. ""Flush"" means with no space between the pieces of wood and the sheet of wood.

, Then, insert a long, skinny object in the tip and then remove it.

This allows an opening for the caulk to come out of.

,


Caulk the perimeter of the new exterior wall. Caulk is used to seal spaces between two objects. In this case, the objects are the perimeter of the new exterior wall and the perimeter of the old open space.
This prevents any air leakage.

, This guarantees that there are no open spaces for air to get out of.

An easy way to do this is using your finger.

, A moisture barrier can simply be a thin plastic sheet that covers the area of the new exterior wall. It is needed because it prevents moisture from getting inside.


Cut the thin plastic sheet to appropriate dimensions so that it will cover the entirety of the new exterior wall.
Using a staple gun, staple the moisture barrier to the new exterior wall.

, If you look at the area you are working on, you will see spaces of different lengths where the vinyl needs to be replaced.


Measure the lengths of the spaces with no vinyl.
Cut the new vinyl pieces accordingly. A vinyl cutter works best for this task.

, ""Zipping"" is the term used in siding when the top and bottom of two pieces are connected.


This can only be done using the Siding Removal tool mentioned in Step 5.
Once again, use this tool by inserting it where a piece of vinyl overlaps a piece below it and then sliding it across until you reach the end of the piece.
This tool removes two pieces that are already ""zipped"" and also ""zips"" two pieces together.

, All of the vinyl pieces have little holes on the top of them where nails can be inserted.


Use a hammer to insert nail in about every fifth hole, or whatever you may feel necessary.
It is best to use roofing nails for this.

,


If some pieces are not nailed or ""zipped"", they may become too loose and get damaged.

There are a number of styles, each giving your room a different flavor and functioning in a slightly different way. Some of your options include:

Drapes are typically made from heavy material and are pleated, which requires a traverse rod. To hang, you must place drapery pins in the pleat, and then hang them on the rod. A cord allows you to pull the drapes open and closed.
Panel curtains, eyelet curtains and tab top curtains are meant to hang from a plain round rod. They may have a pocket along the top to push the rod through, or the rod may be threaded through eyelets or tabs. Panel curtains may end at the top or bottom of the windowsill, extend to the floor, or be even longer—a style known as puddling.
Cafe curtains cover only the bottom half of a window, to let light into the room while affording some privacy. They are popular on kitchen windows and are typically hung on rods installed inside the window frame on tension rods.
Door panels have pockets on the top and bottom and require 2 curtain rods, which you install on a door or simply attach with magnets. Door panels are often used on french doors and sidelights.;
, When buying curtains, keep in mind that their length should cover the entire window (unless they are cafe curtains). If you buy tab top curtains, make sure the curtain length doesn't include the length of the tabs.
/images/thumb/4/42/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-2-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-2-preview-Version-3.jpg

Floor length curtains end 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) from the floor unless you live in a humid environment, in which case they should end 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the floor, because they will stretch more on humid days. If you plan to puddle your curtains, you only need to ensure you have plenty of material left over for the puddle.
Curtains that hang below the sill should extend 4 inches (10 cm) below the sill, long enough to cover the edge of the casing below the window.
Sill-length curtains should skim the sill.

, If you'd like to pull them completely away from the window, buy a longer rod or a rod that has a return (a 90-degree turn on each end that allows you to push the curtain around the turn or rest against the wall). The length of the return should depend on the type and width of the curtain.
/images/thumb/9/96/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-3-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-3-preview-Version-3.jpg

, Installing in the casing will always leave at least part of the window obscured, while installing outside the casing allows you to pull the curtains back completely. Which you choose will partially be determined by the style and look you want, but you may also have to account for the material of the wall or casing. If you have plastic window casing, the curtain rods will need to be installed on the wall. If you have plaster, cob, or stone walls, then the casing may be easier.
/images/thumb/c/c3/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-4-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-4-preview-Version-3.jpg

Bear in mind that the curtain will only draw back as far as the brackets holding the curtain rod, whether or not you have a return, and the style of the curtain will determine how much they can be compressed. The amount you can compress a curtain is called the stack back.
You may want to keep part of the window covered even when the curtains are open, or you may prefer to completely expose the window to let as much light into the room as possible.

, Use a measuring tape. Determine where the top of the curtain will be from where you want the curtain to end: at the sill, below the sill or on the floor. Bear in mind that some styles of curtains have ruffles or pleats that extend above the top of the rod; subtract this section from the measurement. Mark this point on both sides of casing or wall with a pencil. Use a laser level to make sure your marks are even.
/images/thumb/7/75/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-5-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-5-preview-Version-3.jpg

, When you're sure of all your measurements, use a pencil to mark where the screws will go. Be careful not to get too close to the edge if installing in the casing, as this will make the material too fragile and cause the wood to crack.
/images/thumb/3/36/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-6-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-6-preview-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/3/36/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-6-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-6-preview-Version-3.jpg








, Consider the length of the rod when hanging the brackets. Though most curtain rods are adjustable, you don't want the distance between the brackets to be so wide that the rod sags in the middle. In general, you shouldn't increase the length of the expanded  rod by more than 50 percent.
/images/thumb/4/47/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-7-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-7-preview-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/4/47/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-7-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-7-preview-Version-3.jpg








, This can keep the screws from cracking the casing or wall material. If installing the brackets on the wall, make sure your pilot holes are big enough to place the screw anchors into, if you need to use screw anchors.
/images/thumb/b/ba/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-8-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-8-preview-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/b/ba/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-8-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-8-preview-Version-3.jpg









Screw anchors are only necessary if the rod brackets are spaced in such a way that they cannot be attached to the wall studs. If you want to avoid using screw anchors, make sure that your brackets are spaced to go just 1-2"" beyond the casing.

, If installing them on the wall between studs, you need plastic screw anchors. These will expand inside the dry wall panel to the weight of the rod and curtains and will prevent the screws from pulling out of the wall. Otherwise, you can simply use the manufacturer included or suggested mounting screws.

, Fit the rod onto the brackets and then use a carpenter's level to make sure that the rod is even. It should be, as long as you measured for level when marking the locations for brackets.
/images/thumb/a/a8/Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-10-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Install-Curtain-Rods-Step-10-preview-Version-3.jpg

, Remove the rod again and put the curtain on the rod. Hang the rod on the brackets. Now you're done! Good job!

If hanging tab top curtains, a thin rod is best. A thick rod will draw the curtain up, making it hang too high.

Place one piece on the bottom and top, then one on a side. Leave one side empty., On the side with no tape, carefully take the transfer tape and peel it back. You should stop when you get to the tape in the middle of the bottom and top sides. Use a pair of scissors to cut away the white paper where you peeled the decal.








You should be cutting away about one third of the backing paper.

, With the white paper backing gone, move the part of the decal back over to the window where it originally started. This part of the decal will adhere to the window where you cut away the white paper.








Use a credit card to squeegee the decal to remove all air bubbles.

, Now that part of the decal is stuck to the window, get rid of the three pieces of tape. Lift the free edge and slowly remove the white paper backing.







, All of the decal should be ready to stick to the window. Carefully place the transfer tape and decals onto the window. Stick the decal a small section at a time. Use a credit card to push the decal and transfer tape against the window. Start where the part of the decal is already on the window and use the credit card to stick the decal.








Use the credit card to rub the decal slowly onto the window. Don’t try to stick the rest of the decal onto the window at the same time. Go from the middle outwards.

, After the decal is securely on the window, take the edge. Slowly remove the transfer tape at an angle. Use only light pressure so you don’t rip off the decal.








You may want to wait at least 24 hours to make sure the decal has adhered to the window.

, Before applying the cling, you need to clean the area of the window where you want to place it. Use window cleaner with ammonia on windows before using a static cling.After cleaning it, make sure to dry the area. A static cling won’t stick to a wet or damp surface.

, The dry method can be used for small decals that are smaller than 12 inches (31 cm). Place the decal where you want it on the window. Using a rubber roller, push out the trapped air. Start in the center and work outwards.







, Large decals that are over 12 inches (31 cm) stick better if you use a solution to help them stick. Mix two teaspoons (10 mL) of liquid household detergent with one gallon (4 L) of cold water. Cover the side of the decal that you will stick to the window with the solution.








You can pour the solution on the decal or use a spray bottle.

, Press the decal against the window. When you have the decal where you want it, press the water out from under the decal. Use a squeegee or a rubber roller. Start in the center and press outwards. Push down the edges to make sure it sticks to the window.








Wipe away moisture with paper towels.

Consider painting the window cling.,
Use the window cling.",How to Make Liquid Polymer Clay Window Clings," You want to get your template into the oven as soon as possible. If you have to wait for your oven to pre-heat after you finish your design, the clay may spread too much.You can use a regular oven or even a toaster oven. Do not use a microwave.
Each brand is different, so read the temperature specified on the bottle.;
, You do not absolutely have to create a template, but it will make it easier to create your design. You can print a message or simple outline from the computer, tear a page out of a coloring book, or draw your own design on a sheet of paper.


If you don't want to use a template, you can work on top of a smooth tile instead.

, The clay should hold its shape for several minutes without spreading too much.If the liquid clay spreads too much, it is too thin. You can still work with this, but you will have to color inside your design.


Each brand will have a slightly different consistency.
Polymer clay tends to become thicker as it gets older., Hold the bottle upside down, and tap it against your work surface. Gently squeeze it. This helps get rid of any air bubbles that might mess up your work.If you are applying the liquid clay with a brush, you can skip this step.

, Liquid polymer clay comes in limited colors: clear, gold, and silver. That's not a lot, and it may not work for every design out there. You can always paint it afterwards, or you can tint it first. Keep in mind that most brands will appear opaque at first, and will eventually turn clear after you finish baking them., If you plan on using more than one color, pour more clay into separate dishes. How much liquid clay you pour out depends on the size of your design.

, You will need about 10% pigment to 90% polymer clay.You can use things like: alcohol ink, embossing powder, mica powder, oil paint, or powdered chalk.If you use too much pigment, your piece may turn opaque or too hard.

, Keep stirring until no streaks or swirls remain.If you used chalk or other powders, you may have to break small clumps up by ""stabbing"" them with the toothpick.


Can't find a toothpick? A skewer or another thin stick will also work. Even an unfolded paper clip will do.

, The best types of bottles to work with are the tiny bottles that glitter glue and puff paint come in. Make sure that they are clean first, however. You can apply the liquid clay with a paintbrush, but a squeeze bottle will give your more control.


Use a small funnel to help pour the clay into the bottle.
If you don't have a funnel small enough, roll some wax paper into a cone, and stick it into the neck of the bottle. Use that as a funnel instead.

, The key to making liquid clay work as window clings is to cure it on top of a smooth surface. Your sheet of glass needs to be perfectly smooth, without scratches, texture, bumps, or dents.If you are not using a template, you can work on top of a smooth, glazed tile. Make sure that the tile is perfectly smooth and does not have a warped or bumpy texture., Place the nozzle of the bottle close to the glass, and start drawing. If you are using a paintbrush, use a thin brush to apply the liquid clay. You want a nice, thick layer.


If your liquid clay is thin, you might want to draw just inside the outlines so that it doesn't spread too much.

, If you are applying it straight from the bottle, use the tip of the applicator to blend in the seams.If you are using a paintbrush, use the tip of the brush to blend everything together.

, Carefully lift the glass or tile you are working on and place it onto a baking sheet.

, Again, each brand will have a slightly different baking time. Read the label on your bottle of liquid polymer clay. If you don't bake the polymer clay at the right temperature and for the right amount of time, it may be too soft, too sticky, or too brittle.

, Once the time is up, use a pair of oven mitts to take the baking sheet out of the oven. Set the baking sheet down onto a heat-safe surface, and let everything cool down completely. Do not get impatient and try to run the glass under cold water; it will shatter.

, You can do it with your fingers or with a metal palette knife. Be careful not to rip or tear the window cling. If you are using a palette knife, slide it carefully under the window cling to pry it off., Because the window cling is handmade, it will have some imperfections, such as bumps or strands. If these bother you, cut them off with a small pair of scissors or a craft blade.Cut on top of a cutting mat, not the glass, or you will risk scratching the glass up.

, You can paint it using acrylic paint if you want a solid color. You can also cover it with glue, then shake some extra-fine glitter onto it. Be careful not to get any glitter on the back, however! Lastly, if you want a translucent window cling, you can color it using permanent markers. Let the paint, glue, or marker dry.

, Press the window cling against your window or mirror. It should stick, as long as the entire back surface is touching the glass. You can peel it off and reuse it as often as you'd like.

If you're drilling into concrete, brick or plaster you should use a 5.0 mm diameter masonry drill bit. If you're drilling into wood or steel you should use a 3mm diameter high speed steel drill bit.;
, Mark out your drill holes, using the brackets provided as templates for the holes. Ensure that the brackets are perfectly level so that the blind rolls up and down straight. Do this by using a level when measuring and marking for your holes.

, Drill your holes into the wall, and then screw the brackets into place. Double check that they're in the right spot before you put them in place.

, Slide the end on the opposite side of the chain into the brackets first, and then slip in the chain side. Make sure the blind is firmly attached to the wall so that it won't come crashing down when you pull on the chain to roll or unroll it. Give it a few test rolls to make sure it works as expected.

, By law, the looped chain must be attached to the wall by the chain tensioner provided. Make sure you firmly attach this chain to the wall to keep it in place.


You can also attach chain stoppers to the chain to mark the blind's up and down positions. These are small balls that will prevent you from rolling the blind past these spots.

Drill the holes for the screws.,
Snap the valance clips in place.,
Place the head rail into the brackets.,
Attach the valance.,
Secure the blind wand.",How to Install Blinds," You need to do this to make sure that you buy the correct size of blind. Use a measuring tape to determine the size of the window. You can either mount your blinds on the inside or on the outside of the casing. If you hang your blinds on the outside, your window (and the blinds) will look larger. Hanging the blinds on the inside gives your window a slimmer look. Inside mounts also allow more light to shine around the edges of the blinds.









Measuring for an outside mount: Measure along the outside edges of the casing that surrounds the window. Measure the exact length from the top of the casing to the bottom of the casing (or to the sill if your window has one).














Measuring for an inside mount: Put your measuring tape inside the casing where the glass of the window meets the casing. Measure the width of the window at the top, middle and bottom. If there is any difference in the numbers, use the smallest figure to base your measurements off of.












;
, There are many different kinds of blinds to choose from--vinyl, PV, aluminum, wood--and the choice you make will have to be based on personal preference.









If you plan on putting aluminum blinds in a nursery or your child’s room, make sure that the blinds you choose are painted with certified lead-free paint.

, Unpack your blinds and make sure all of the parts are there. If there are instructions that come with your blinds, follow them along with the steps listed here. You will need to make some pencil marks so that you know where to place your brackets.For an outside mount: Hold the blind up so that the head rail (the top part of the blind) is centered and leveled with your window’s casing (the two vertical slats that form the ‘frame’ of the window). Make a pencil mark right below the head rail on each side of the casing. You should also make a mark ¼ of an inch past the end of each head rail.














For an inside mount: Place the head rail inside the casing. It should be level--keep your handrail level, even if your window is not. Make pencil marks below the head rail on each end.














, Place them inside the pencil marks you have made. There are two open sides to the bracket--one of them should face out towards you, while the other should face in towards the center of the window. The bracket door must face towards the inside of the room.








If your bracket door is tricky to use, consider trying to open it with one of your fingers and a screwdriver.

, Using your pencil, mark the spots where you will need to drill your pilot holes (there should be two of them). You should choose two diagonal holes to drill into so that your brackets are sturdier. Take the brackets away and hold up a level to the two holes are even.For an outside mount: The brackets should be placed on the outside face of the window casing on both sides of the window.














For an inside mount: The brackets should be placed up against the inside top corner of each side of the window.














, Each bracket comes with two screws. If you are drilling into wood, use a 1








If you are drilling into drywall, plaster, concrete, tile, stone, or brick, use appropriate screws, anchors, or plugs and follow the specific instructions that come with them.

, Valance clips are used to attach the head rail to the valance. The valance is what covers the head rail and makes it look a bit more decorative. The valance clips should be snapped over the front lip of the head rail before the head rail is inserted into the bracket.








Your blinds may be made up of ‘ladders’ of blinds. If this is the case, snap each valance clip into place next to the top of each ladder--not directly on top of it. If they are put directly over each ladder, the valance clips might get caught in the cords of the blinds.

, Once you have finished drilling the brackets into place, make sure the bracket doors are wide open and then insert the head rail into the brackets. When you have situated the head rail, snap the bracket doors closed. You should hear an audible snapping noise.







, Place the valance along the head rail in the position you would like it to be in. Rest it on top of the valance clips. When you have positioned it the way you would like it be, press gently down so that the valance clips snap into the valance, holding it in place.







, If your blinds came with a wand for opening and closing them, and it did not come pre-attached, attach it now. Push the plastic sleeve of the hook up, insert the wand’s end into the hook, and then slide the plastic covering back down.

Slide the curtain rod in place.",How to Hang Voile," Many people use voile curtains in conjunction with heavier standard curtains to create a visually appealing layered look. Others use voile curtains on their own. Determine which option works best for your room before you do anything else.


Voile is lightweight and transparent, so it will never provide the full privacy a normal set of curtains would offer. Hang voile by itself in an enclosed patio or similar area where privacy is not an issue.When voile is hung behind a traditional curtain, you would usually pull back the other curtain during the day while keeping the voile curtain closed to soften the light and offer a minimal amount of privacy. The heavier curtain is then drawn closed again in the evening.;
, You can find voile curtains in a range of colors and patterns. Pick out the style that coordinates best with the look of your room.The most traditional voile curtains tend to be white or off-white, but nowadays, these curtains are available in a range of soft pastel colors.
If plain voile is too drab for your tastes, look for voile curtains with a soft print. Floral motifs are common, but you can also find voile with stripes, dots, or other abstract patterns.
Also pay attention to how that particular voile curtain is supposed to hang. Most voile curtains use net pleat tape, which is the most adjustable and versatile option. Other options include tab tops and ring tops (eyelets).

, Measure the width of the window. Voile curtains should measure two to three times wider than your measured window width.You'll also need to consider the curtain length. Measure the height of the window from top to bottom to get a base figure.

A curtain rod is usually placed 6 inches (15.24 cm) above the top of the window, so add this value to the base figure.
The curtain can either fall to the floor or to the windowsill. There should be no more than 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) difference between the end floor/windowsill and the bottom of the voile.Subtract this value from the current calculated height. The solution should tell you how long the voile needs to be.


Note that most curtains come in standard sizes, so you may not find voile curtains in the exact length and width you calculated. Select the next nearest size if you run into this problem.

, Measure the width of the window again. You will need to gather the voile until the width of the curtain roughly matches the width of the window.


The width of the curtains can extend slightly past the width of the window if desired, but the total width of the gathered voile should be no more than 1 foot (30 cm) longer than the width of the window. Using curtains that are slightly larger can make the window appear larger, thereby making the room seem lighter and more open.

, There should be two drawstrings hanging from one side of the netpleat tape at the top of the curtain. Pull these drawstrings outward until the voile shortens to the appropriate width.If you need the voile to be wider, pull more of the material over the attached drawstrings.
Note that one drawstring should be at the top of the net pleat while the other should be at the bottom of the strip.
Also note that the gathering and pleating only applies to voile with netpleat tape. If you are using tab tops or ring tops, skip directly to the ""Hang the Voile with a Curtain Rod"" section.

, As you adjusted the width of the voile, pleats should have formed in the material. Use your hands to rearrange these pleats as needed until they are all even in size and distance.


Make sure that you do not accidentally change the overall width of the voile as you adjust the pleats.
Do not cut off the drawstrings after adjusting the pleats. These drawstrings should remain intact permanently.

, The tension rod will need to be placed in between two facing surfaces. Measure the distance between those two surfaces and select a tension rod that can extend or shrink to that length.


If the window is recessed into the wall, the two facing surfaces will be the vertical sides of the window frame. If the entire window area is recessed into a small room nook, the two facing surfaces might be the two facing walls on either side of the window.
Note that this method will only work if you have voile with a netpleat strip. If your voile only has tab tops or ring tops, you will need to follow the ""Hang the Voile with a Curtain Rod"" section.""

, Adjust the length of the tension rod so that it is approximately the same as the width of your window recess.


The length of the rod should actually be slightly smaller. This will enable you to wedge the rod in place within the recess.
To adjust the length, locate the spot where the two interlocking shafts meet and place one hand on either side of that position. Twist counterclockwise to make the rod longer or clockwise to shorten it., Find the raised transparent loops along the back of the netpleat tape. Slide the tension rod through each of these loops.


Work slowly to ensure that each loop is caught around the tension rod.
The length of the tension rod might be larger than the width of the voile. In this case, simply make sure that the voile is centered along the rod so that it falls in front of the window when placed.

, Put the tension rod in place at the top of your window recess. Twist counterclockwise to lengthen the rod slightly and create pressure on either side.


Once you think the rod is firmly in place, test it by applying pressure to one side. The tension rod should not budge.
This completes the process.

, Insert standard curtain hooks along the top of the voile using the pockets or holes provided.


If using voile with netpleat tape, you should insert the hooks at even intervals into the white pockets along the top of the strip.
If using voile with tap tops, insert a hook into each loop sewn into the top of the curtain. For voile with ring tops, simply insert a hook into each of the open gaps along the top of the voile.

, The curtain rod should be wide enough for the window and suitable for use with voile. Insert the rod through the hooks one at a time until all of them are in place.


If you're hanging the voile by itself, simply slide a standard curtain rod through the hooks.
If you're hanging the voile with a second curtain, try using a double curtain rod. This type of curtain rod will allow you to open and close each curtain separately.
The length of the curtain rod itself should roughly match the width of the gathered voile, but the rod can be a little longer if necessary. Avoid using a curtain rod that is too short. Also note that you should only take the length of the rod itself into consideration here, not the combined length of the rod and its brackets.

, Use a pencil to lightly mark where the curtain rod brackets will need to be on the wall above the window.


Keep in mind that the ideal placement for a curtain rod is about 6 inches (15.24 cm) above the window.
The rod will need to be centered above the window. There should be an even amount of excess overhang on either side of the window. For instance, if the combined length of the rod and its brackets are 1 foot (30.5 cm) longer than the width of the window, the rod should extend 6 inches (15.24 cm) past either side of the window.
Use a tape measure and a level to make sure that your measurements are as accurate as possible. Measure two or three times to reduce the risk of error.

, Use a power drill or screwdriver to twist the screws partially into the wall. Once roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) has been inserted into the wall, remove the screw again.


Do not use the brackets during this step.
Creating a pilot hole is a good way to carefully start the process of screwing something heavy into the wall. This step can help prevent the screws from cracking the wall as you install the curtain rod.

, Position the curtain rod brackets onto the wall so that the screw holes line up with the anchor holes. Use a screwdriver or power drill to carefully insert screws through the bracket holes and into the wall.


If you are installing the brackets in between studs in the wall, you many need to use plastic screw anchors instead of standard screws. Anchor screws can also be a good idea if you are using a heavy double curtain rod.

, Insert either end of the curtain rod into its corresponding bracket. If done correctly, the curtain rod should rest securely inside both brackets and the voile should hang evenly.


If you are hanging double curtains, you will need to make sure that both curtains are on the rod before you install it. The voile curtain should be the one closest to the window.
The conclusion of this step completes the process.

Decide on the location for your mount.,
Check to see if the interior of the window frame is level.,
Mark the location for the shades.,
Install the brackets.,
Install your shades.",How to Hang Roman Shades1," An interior mount involves hanging the shades inside of the window frame, directly adjacent to the windows. This is a good option if you have a deep window frame/windowsill. To do an interior mount, you attach the roman shades to the ‘ceiling’ part of the frame, as opposed to the ‘walls’ on the left or right side of the window.;
, As a result of old age or poor construction, it is common for window frames to have a slightly uneven ‘ceiling’ Use a level to test this; hold the level to the ceiling of the frame, and make sure that the small bubble is clearly in the middle o f the marked section on the tool. If your frame ceiling is not level, you will need to attach a small shim to even it out. A shim is a thin, angled piece of wood that will make the ceiling level when nailed in place., Take your shades out of their packaging, and hold them (still closed/bunched) up to where you would like to hang them inside the frame. Use a carpenters pencil to mark the location of the brackets on the shades. Typically, the brackets will be placed about 3-inches in from each side of the shades. You may have multiple brackets for a large shade, in which case these should be spaced evenly within the space between the two edge brackets (located 3-inches in).


You can choose to measure the shades and use this measurement inside the frame, rather than holding up the shades if it’s easier for you.

, Use the screws that came with your roman shades to install your brackets. Because installation varies depending on the type of shade, you’ll need to follow the instructions that came with yours. Typically, though, you simply line up the brackets with the edge of the window frame, match the screws with the holes in the brackets, and screw them in place.

, Roman shades are outfitted with twin-brackets that match the ones that you installed in the window frame. To install your shades, all you do is click the two brackets into place; slide the top of the shades forward until the brackets snap together, and they are secured in the frame. You should be able to adjust the shades by pulling on the attached drawstring/cord."

This technique works well when brackets have to be placed outside the window frame. Simply hook the scarf over the ends of the outer rod on each side and let the ends majestically flow down.;
, You want the coverage of window blinds or the translucency of sheers, but they leave the window looking too plain. Using a window scarf in such situations adds the decorative touch you need to spice up the windows and the room.

, Use scarf hooks or sconces at the outer top side of your window to hang scarves over sheers or lightweight curtains.

, Use more than 1 scarf at the top of your window to add regal elegance to your windows. Position 3 scarf hooks atop the length of the window. Drape one scarf from 1 end hook across to the other end hook, draping in the center. With your second scarf, drape it from one end to the center hook and then from the center hook to the far end. This scarf will be draped twice.

, Lay your window scarf out flat with the front side facing down. On the long side, begin folding the fabric in 6 inch (15.24 cm) - 8 inch (20.32 cm) folds toward you. When you have folded the entire scarf, loosely tie the folds into place with some scrap strips of material. Place ties in several places so the folds stay in place when you pick the scarf up to hang it. Drape the scarf over the scarf hooks with the short side toward the center. Remove the ties and adjust the drape to your preference.

Make sure that you determine where you would like to install the blind before buying the blind.Hold the blind up to the window to visually see where you would like to secure the brackets.
Use a pencil to mark where you want to blind to be secured.;
, Use a tape measure to measure the distance of the space that you would like to blind to be secured. Measure horizontally from one point to the other point., Once you have determined the measurement of the space, you can purchase your blind. Purchase the blind that best fits the space that you have measured. If it is not exact, opt for a larger blind. The blind can always be cut to fit the space.


Most roller blinds can be purchased at a home improvement store.

, Evaluate the space and determine which side of the blind you would like the chain to hang down. Most roller blinds allow you to change the side that the chain hangs on.For example, if you have a chair to the left of the window, you may decide to hang the chain on the left for easier access.

, The blind can either roll under or over the roller. Typically, the blind is positioned so that it rolls under the roller. However, if you have objects that protrude from the window, you may decide to roll the blind over the roller. This way, the blind will not be obstructed when it is pulled down over the window., Using a hand drill, secure the brackets that came with the roller blind. Make sure that the brackets are screwed in tightly to prevent the blind from falling.Follow the instruction manual that come with your blinds. Every roller blind is slightly different.

, If you blind is too large for the window, you will need to cut it to fit the space. Remove the blind from the roller. Measure the amount of blind that you need to remove. Draw a line all the way up the blind’s fabric with a pencil. Cut vertically up the fabric. Reattach the fabric to the roller.Measure the space one more time to verify the measurements before making any cuts to the blind.
When securing the fabric back on the roller, it is important to make sure that the fabric is secured perfectly horizontally. If not, the fabric will not roll correctly on the roller.

, Wedge the blind into the brackets that you have already secured. Make sure that you are following the instructions that are provided with your roller blind to ensure proper installation., Secure the chain to the wall with the screws provided. Use a hand drill for best results.Some chains hang loosely beside of the blind. If this is the case, do not worry about securing the chain.

, Place your blinds above the window frame in the location you want them to hang. Use a carpenters pencil to mark this location on the wall; the edge of the brackets should be flush to the edge of the window frame. Typically the location of these brackets is located about 3-inches in from each edge of the shades, but there may be more based on the overall size of your shades. If there are multiple loose brackets, space them evenly over the top of the shade.


Always check to make sure that your shades are level prior to marking the location of the brackets.
If you prefer, you can simply measure the overall size of the shades and use this measurement to estimate the location of the brackets.

, Use the brackets and screws that came with your roman shades for installation. Place each bracket on the marked location on the wall, so that the part that sticks out from the wall is at the top. Use the screws to attach the brackets to the wall; you’ll normally need two screws per bracket. Installation of the brackets will differ slightly between brands of roman shades, so follow the specific directions that came with yours.

, The top of the roman shades should have flat brackets that click into place with the brackets you’ve attached to the wall. Carefully slip the roman shades in, so that the brackets at the top click together. Pull on the cord that adjusts the shades, to verify that the shades are secure and functional."

Look at how the blinds work and identify the problem.,

Determine the size of the string you will need.,
Determine the length of string you will need.,
Remove the blinds from the window.,

Get access to the top and bottom.,
Disconnect the string at one end.,

Begin threading the new string through the base of the blinds and up through the row of holes.,

Secure the string to the bottom rail.,
With the blinds closed, leave a bit of excess length on the pull end.,Replace any caps or rails you removed to access the bottom rail.,Hang the blinds in the windows and check that they operate smoothly.,

Replace the tassels and tie a secure knot underneath each one.",How to Restring Blinds,"

Where is the problem? Is the string broken or frayed? Or has it come undone at one end and pulled out?
Follow an intact string. From the tassel (the plastic part you pull), most strings go up, through a gravity catch of some sort, across the hollow channel in the top of the blinds, and down through a row of holes in the slats. From there they're secured by tying them through the channel at the bottom that rides up and down when you open and close the blinds.
There's an additional set of strings, shaped something like a ladder, which rotates the slats in the blinds.
Take digital photos at this stage if you think you will need help remembering what goes where, after you have the string out. If you have a working set of blinds like the ones you are fixing, you can use that for reference, instead.;
, Wrap an intact section 10 times around anything round, such as a pencil or screwdriver. Press the loops together, measure the width, divide by 10, and, if necessary convert inches to millimeters by dividing inches by 25.4 (or use an online converter). Mini blind string is sized in millimeters (mm)., Measure the full height of the blinds. Measure across the top, from the furthest string. Then measure down the hanging part of the string. Add these numbers up, then multiply the total by how many strings there are on the blinds, or how many of the strings you will be replacing. If the blinds are fairly old, you will probably be best placed to replace all the strings in them at the same time. If you're not sure, order extra. String is not that costly, and there is a good chance you will someday wish to replace the string in other blinds in your home., The exact procedure for this step will depend upon the type of blinds you have. In general, they mount at the top.

If you can't figure out how they mount by looking at them, consult the manual or installation instructions. If you don't have a paper copy, try looking up the make and model online.

, This, too, varies with the make and model of the blinds. Most blinds have easy access at the top once they are removed from the window. On the bottom, you may have to remove a cap or bumper, or slide out a rail., It's best to replace one string at a time. Here, we have started at the bottom of the blinds, but you could as easily start with the other end., Some newer blinds lack these holes. In this case, follow the path of the old string around the vanes, instead.







If the old string is worn but unbroken, one way to insert the new string is to tape the end of the new string to the end of the old string. Then, the new string will be threaded through as the old string pulls out. Use masking tape, packing tape, or ordinary cellophane office tape. In any case, make the taped joint as slender as possible. You may have to coax the taped joint through some openings.
If the old string is broken, use the path of an intact string as a model and use a tapestry needle, small crochet hook, or a loop of wire or wire twist-tie to guide the string through its path.
You may have to cut or untie the knots that held the old string into the tassels and onto the bottom rail. Save the old tassels for reuse, or replace them with fresh ones if they are damaged.

, Tie it firmly through the holes, making sure the knot will not slip out. This blind has a pair of holes to tie the string through. Some blinds may come with a small washer or tab that ties onto the string. Replace this if you have it. Otherwise, tie a knot large enough not to slip through the hole., Thread any additional strings and tie them off.,,, With the blinds closed, trim the pull strings to length so that the ends do not show when you pull the tassels down over them.





 Tassels should hang about as far down as the rod.

You can use existing strings as a guide for length, but generally, all the tassels should hang about the same length and they should hang down roughly the length of the rod that you turn to rotate the vanes.

Measure the width of the window to determine the necessary width of the blinds.,
Mark the smallest measurement, and cut to this.,
Subtract 1/4-inch from each side to ensure the blinds have room to move up and down.,
Measure the blinds from the head rail and use a pencil to mark your new desired length.,
Cut the blind headrail using a hacksaw or tin snips.",How to Cut Blinds1," Typically, a set of inside-mount blinds should measure about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) less than the width of the window frame. Make sure you measure the inside of the frame, where the blinds actually fit, and not the entire window frame.


Measure in at least three places -- the top, bottom, and middle of the window.;
, Most windows are going to have regular, even spacing, but older houses may have some variability. If there is a change, use the smallest measurement taken.

, This small gap will keep your blinds from getting cut or stuck on the windowsill.

, Use the measurement found above and mark the headrail (the top of the blinds) at this length. You may either cut an even amount off of both sides or cut only from the pull cord side.


If the chords are on one side, you can cut only from the other side. In many ways, only cutting one side is much easier.

, Simply start sawing to remove the headrail where you noted:


Remove the metal end stiffener bracket from the side(s) you are cutting.
Use the hacksaw or tin snips to cut the headrail per your measured mark.
File any rough edges with a metal file. However, keep in mind that the headrail edges will be covered by the mounting brackets, so a rough cut will not be visible.
Replace the metal end stiffener onto the newly cut headrail."

",How to Cut Bamboo Blinds,"


Inside Mount: Measure the width of the window frame's inside edge at the top, middle and bottom and use the smallest of the three measurements. Typically, a set of inside mount blinds should measure about 1/2-inch less than the width of the window frame.
Outside Mount: Measure the width of the window frame and ensure that the blinds will extend over the window opening at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) on each side. This will allow for adequate light gap coverage.;
, Most edge bindings are sewn into place and may need to be cut for removal.

,


Roll and fasten the bamboo shades tightly around the headrail. You may use a rubber band or masking tape to secure the blinds at the center point.
Cover the ends of the blinds with masking tape to prevent chipping or splintering of the delicate material.
Measure and mark the appropriate width. You will want to cut the excess length equally at each end, so measure and mark carefully.
Cut the blind slats and bottom rail using a hacksaw. For maximum efficiency, you may choose to use a miter box as a guide. Cut one end, tamp the blinds, then cut the remaining end.

, If not, trim individual elements as needed to ensure a consistent width.

Select your teacups.,

Wear safety gloves and eyewear.,
Place the teacup on a flat surface in order to create a hole.,
Mark the area where you’d like to drill, preferably in the center of the cup.,
Prepare to drill.,
Slide the curtain material through the top portion of the cup through the hole you've made at the base of the cup.,
Place the tieback on the hook.,
Finished.",How to Use Teacups As Curtain Tiebacks," You'll need a pair of teacups per set of curtains. While they don't necessarily have to match, you may prefer that they do. If they don't match, it is still a good idea to match up teacups with similar colors and general pattern. In addition to searching around your home for teacups, visit second hand or antique stores, online stores, thrift stores and even yard or garage sales.


Choose by shape and size as well. Base this decision on your curtain’s fabric and amount of material you need tied back.






Test drive different teacups. Hold each teacup next to the drapes to be sure that they're the right choice.






Choose a cup that isn’t chipped or cracked. The cup must be able to withstand being transformed from a teacup to a tieback––cracked cups may split. And chipped cups won't look as pretty.
Test the handle. If it has been glued back on after a break, the cup will be unsuitable because a lot of pressure will be placed on the handle joins when attached to the hook.;
, Essentially you will pulling the drapery through the actual cup and then hanging the handle on a hook. The hook may be key to not only how it holds the cup handle but how it looks. Explore porcelain or other material options for the hook, in addition to the usual metallic ones.

, An errant piece of porcelain in your eye can send you to the emergency room––take precautions to prevent injury.

,


Perform this action on a workbench or somewhere that has good traction. You don’t want to be drilling into the cup and have it slip out from underneath you.

, The size of the hole will be dependent on the girth of the curtain that will be slipped through. It's highly recommended that you place masking tape around the hole to add some strength when drilling and to help prevent cracking.

, The best drill bit for this would be one suitable for drilling tiles (which are often made from similar delicate material). When drilling:

Go slowly in the marked area. Don't blaze through this––porcelain is delicate and may crack if you're too aggressive or speedy.






In some cases, it is easiest to drill smaller holes and to gradually expand these into one larger hole.
Brush aside residual dust after you’ve drilled through the cup. Keep reassessing whether you need to make the hole larger. When you're happy with the size, stop drilling.







, It can be handy to have a friend help here, especially if the curtain fabric is heavy or in an awkward position.


Play with where exactly you’d like the teacup to sit on the curtain. Sometimes having it located higher on the curtain than normal will increase its decorative effect.







, Position the cup so that the handle is firmly linked to the handle. Readjust the teacup to ensure that the design shows clearly.


Test the strength of the handle's hold. If the grip fails, the teacup will most likely shatter if it falls on the floor so having a strong, reliable hold is important.







, Repeat as many times as you need to make matching tiebacks for the room.

, Window coverings are drapery panels, curtains, blinds, shutters, shades, louvers – they literally “cover” the window. They come in any fabric, color and style you can imagine. There are many options to accessorize your window coverings: curtain rods, tiebacks, hold backs, valances, tassels – all available in whatever decorating style you prefer!

, These are the most familiar form for holding curtains and draperies in place. Some styles are purely functional, but many today are designed to be part of your window’s decorating scheme. The materials are varied: they are made from wood, plastics and metals, and available in colors that will fit your room, and are available in single and double rod styles.

, These are used on hanging curtains and draperies, usually to hold them to a side of the window, but can also tie a panel in the middle of an expanse of glass. Some tiebacks are attached to a hook on the wall behind the curtain; others are simply tied around the curtain. Like the hold back, a tieback can be invisible when not in use.


Hold backs are U-shaped pieces of metal that anchor to your wall. The open top of the “U” faces away from the drapery, which can then be nestled into the body of the U. When not in use the hold back is hidden behind the curtain.

, Valances are a great window accessory – they often serve to give your window decoration that finished look and easily reinforce your decorating scheme. A valance can be made of the same fabric as your window covering, or you can choose a coordinating color. How about a contrasting color to liven things up?

, These can fancy up a window in no time! They are often used on valances and tiebacks to add instant elegance. You can also get tassels on pillows and chair ties, and they’re combined with a wide variety of materials: beads, cording, ribbon, fringes, lace and even buttons!

For example, if you want an open, roomy area, keep the walls a bright, neutral color like white, eggshell, or cream. These colors are more reflective and help maximize any natural light in the room.You can even paint the wall trim or moldings a lighter color than your walls, which will make the walls appear further back. Thus making the room appear bigger.;
, If you want to combat the amount of open space and make the room feel a bit cozier, paint the walls a dark color. Darker colors absorb light and will make a room appear smaller than it is.Try a charcoal gray or slate blue. You can even paint the ceiling a darker color, which will make it feel lower., Most accent walls are the first walls you see when entering a room. However, you can choose any wall you want. Try a wall that is visually interesting, for example, one with a fireplace or unique molding. Choose bright or bold color like brick red or evergreen, or a contrasting color to the other wall paint. This wall will draw the eye and break the room up., When choosing lighting for a vaulted ceiling, you want to make sure you are highlighting the ceiling rather than drawing away from it. Try to stay away from any light fixture that shines light directly downward and instead install a fixture like a chandelier that throws light in all directions.

, If you want the ceiling to be the focal point of a room, go for a light fixture that's minimalistic. For example, you can use recessed lighting for a sophisticated look that's unobtrusive. It won't draw from the beauty of the ceiling, but will still provide a significant coverage of light in the room.You can also try spotlighting for a more modern look.

, Most rooms with vaulted ceilings have tall windows that provide a multitude of natural light. However, you can increase this light by adding skylights or putting in mirrors to reflect the light around the room.


Try placing mirrors on opposite walls to bounce light back and forth.

, To keep a room spacious, leave windows open and uncovered. Try utilizing blinds in a bright white that don't draw much attention. However, if you want to bring more intimacy or closeness to a room, install curtains. Not only do these add softness to a space, they can also work to draw the eye where you want it. For example, if you choose curtains that fit the entire length of the wall, it will help draw the eye upwards. On the other hand, if you want to reduce how tall the room feels, choose shorter curtains.You can also make windows appear larger by setting the curtains on the outside of the edges of the windows.
The color and pattern of your curtains are a good way to add a bit of personality, too.

, When working with a lot of wall space, break the area up into pieces. The common rule is to visualize the space split into thirds, which will help you plan out how to place pieces. Decorate the bottom and middle thirds and leave the top one blank. For example, plants, sculptures, and other floor pieces would be part of the bottom third of the wall. Art, tapestries, and mirrors would go in the middle third. Leaving the last third of the space empty to help prevent cluttering., Since the wall area in a room with vaulted ceilings is usually spacious, it's best to stick with larger pieces. After all, putting up small items can make the space seem even bigger than it is and end up looking awkward. You can organize your art however you’d like, but keep each painting or gallery wall at or around eye level for people to enjoy., Large vertical items like grandfather clocks or potted plants can add a lot of character to a room. Try keeping them along the walls for a border effect or place them inward to mimic columns. You can also add large sculptures, bookcases, or floor lamps to utilize the space., If you have the chance, try playing with the look of the ceiling. For example, you can add wooden barrel beams or exposed trusses for an old world style. You can also change the texture by covering the ceiling in distressed wood or copper."

If unlined, silks are particularly susceptible to sun rot.
If you’re buying fabric to have your curtains custom-made, make sure to use decorator fabric specifically. The thread count is typically higher, so they last longer.;
, They’re perfect for small spaces that you want to be sunlit, since sheer materials are thin and take up very little room. Sheers also provide natural ventilation.If privacy is a concern, choose semi-sheers, which offer a subtle amount of privacy without sacrificing the natural lighting.


If you have allergies, consider sheer fabrics. They are excellent at preventing pollen from entering open windows.
Sheers come in a range of materials, including cotton, silk and synthetics. Cotton is the most cost-effective choice.

, When you need very long curtains to cover large spaces, choose a fabric that will hang heavily. Heavy fabrics like velvet, velveteen, suede, corduroy, tapestry and wool-blends will stay put in front of your windows and shield the most light from the room.


If cold winters are an issue, heavy fabrics will help insulate the room and increase the energy efficiency of your heating system.Another option would be using cotton duck curtain lining, which is very heavy and thick.

, They will also decrease the sound of outside noise.Black-out curtains are usually made of very heavy polyester or Thermaweave, which is woven fabric that also provides insulation.


These specialty curtains can usually be found at any home furnishing store. They come in a wide range of prices.
Seek out curtains that are labelled with terms like “blackout,” “room-darkening,” and/or “light-blocking.”

Buy or salvage sufficient screen mesh to cover the entire tear.,
Cut the screen mesh the size of the hole in the torn screen, leaving a one inch (2.5 cm) margin on each side of the cut shape.

,
Thread a curved upholstery needle with strong thread of the same color as the screen.,
Cover the tear with the patch of screen mesh that you have already cut.,
Stitch around the patch.,
Finish with a strong knot.",How to Repair a Tear in a Window Screen," If you have an old, unused screen in storage, you could use this to salvage pieces from. However, if you are concerned about appearance of the screen, it is probably best to try to buy the same kind of screen, either nylon or aluminum, in the same color.;
,, Alternatively, make the thread as close a match as you can get or try fishing thread, which is invisible and very strong. A straight needle can be used if you have access to both sides of the screen, but it will be more difficult and time consuming.

, If the screen is still in its window you can hold this repair piece in place temporarily with tape. If you have taken the screen off the window, perform the repair with the screen laying flat.

, Take the threaded needle and ""sew"" by going through both layers of screen. Take small stitches, making sure to pull in all slack. The aim is to bring the two pieces as closely together as possible.

, Tie off the thread with a strong knot, at least double tied. Ensure that there are no gaps where insects can get in.

Consider the existing color scheme of the room.,
Energize a room with lively pattern.Transform a plain room with patterned or printed curtains, which can add color and texture.,
Create contrast.,
Balance out busy décor with subdued curtains.",How to Choose Curtains2," Curtains should complement the décor of the room, so take a look at your current color palette. Don’t forget to take into account any patterns that appear in your wallpaper or on furniture fabric. In most cases, you will want to choose a hue that will tie your curtains in with the color palette of the room.As an alternative, you can create a unique vibe by choosing curtain colors that don’t tie in with the current color scheme.
You don’t want the curtains to clash with the décor, but as long as the colors are complementary, they don’t have to exactly match.

, Choosing patterns that feature contrasting colors to your furniture and walls can create even more energy and make a basic room far more interesting. You can also create height in a low-ceilinged room by choosing patterns featuring vertical stripes.


Formal home interiors are best dressed with heavy, printed curtains. These create a dramatic effect.
Go with thinner, more delicate printed fabrics for a casual vibe.

, Choose curtains that are at least one shade lighter or darker than the interior walls, as this will stop them from blending into the walls completely. To make the curtains stand out, choose colors that contrast and complement the colors of the walls and furnishings.


Make a statement with a bold pop of contrasting color.
Give a neutral room a focal point with a vibrant curtain hue.
Alternatively, you can soften a room by blending with existing colors.

, If a room already has a lot going on, avoid making it appear busier with patterned curtains. Dress the room down and balance the look with a more subdued fabric. Solid curtain colors will also help balance things out. Don’t be afraid to match patterns in some cases, however.


If, for example, stripes are already a subtle theme in the room, you may want to consider striped curtains to match.Pattern mixing can also be effective if you are going for an offbeat vintage vibe.

Create drama with long lengths.,
Avoid thick curtains in small rooms.,
Choose a length that falls flush with the floor to create a modern look.This creates a crisp, contemporary vibe and suits decor that is modern in nature.,
Extend curtain life by adding a protective lining.If you’ve chosen a fragile curtain fabric or if the curtains will be exposed to a lot of sunlight, you can prolong their life by using a protective lining.",How to Choose Curtains3," Choose long lengths and hang the panels high to create a sense of height and intensity. At minimum, hang them 6 inches above the window frame. Go even higher to create a lavish, powerful effect.For rooms with low ceilings, consider floor-to-ceiling drapes, which will create the illusion of more space.

, Thick drapes will make a small room feel even smaller and create a stuffy, uncomfortable feeling. Go with breezy sheer materials or lightweight fabrics to create a more open feeling in small spaces.Avoid lining altogether, which serves to make the overall appearance of any curtains much heavier.

, For a more traditional look, go with curtains that extend a few inches beyond the floor. This will create a very classic looking puddle effect.


Choose shorter lengths if you have children and/or pets to prevent curtains from getting damaged.
If you battle excessive dust in a particular room, go with curtains that don’t reach the floor. Otherwise they will get dirty very quickly.

, This will slow down the fading effect that the sun has on bright colors.


Unless you plan on changing out your curtains often, use lining to lengthen the shelf life of your drapes.

Coordinate curtain style with the room’s décor.,
Consider the size and function of the room.,
Choose complimentary drapery header.,
Cater to your personal tastes.",How to Choose Curtains4," Curtains affect the overall impact of a room in a big way, so you must think about the room’s current stylistic theme. Airy, modern spaces work best with thin, simple curtains. Formal rooms should be accented with layered panels or thick materials. Think about the current impact of the room and how you want the curtains to tie into that.


For example, if the décor in a room is already busy, think about pulling a single background color out of your statement wallpaper design. Then use that as a monochrome curtain theme.
Curtains should always tie into the design of the room., Avoid thick, heavy curtains in small rooms, which will make them feel cramped. Big, airy spaces look great with elegant floor-to-ceiling designs. Think about the functionality of each room and make sure the curtains make sense in that space. Don’t use the same window treatment in every room – each space is unique and should be customized.For instance, your bedroom and kitchen shouldn’t have the same curtains. Kitchens generally need more light than a bedroom and the fabric should be one you can wash frequently, like cotton.
Bedroom curtains can be chosen for more aesthetic reasons, with less emphasis on light and durability., The top treatment says a lot about the aesthetics of a room, so it should be chosen with the final ambiance of the space in mind. For contemporary rooms, consider a back-tab ripple fold. Grommet tops also accent a modern room well.Pinch pleats look great and they best complement traditional décor. Goblet pleats accent formal rooms with elegance. Smocked headers can add a dramatic and elaborate flair to sophisticated décor.If you’re unsure, consider the rod pocket. It’s is one of the most basic headers, and it compliments a variety of styles.There are many other header options available, so make sure to explore them all. Ultimately, go with something that ties into your room’s style.

, The details of the room, the fabric, the color, the curtain type, the length – all of these elements are incredibly important when choosing window treatments for your home. Making a choice can be daunting. However, don’t forget to also consider your own personal taste!


The décor of your home, including the curtains, is an individual aesthetic choice that reflects your personal style.
Most important of all, your window treatment choices should be visually appealing to you.

Take care not to damage the stop as you remove it from the frame. Place the claw end of the hammer on the side of each nail to support even removal.
Remove any remaining finishing nails left in the molding.;
, Door shims are used to correct and level doors with the frame so that the door is squared, or even, between both sides of the frame. These must be removed in order to adjust the warped door frame.

, Gently hammer the frame in the direction necessary to level out both sides of the frame.


Make sure the door is closed while you straighten the frame. This will help you measure whether the door is even or planed with the frame.
Use a small, thick piece of wood to cover the area you are hammering. This will evenly distribute the blows from the mallet and prevent damage to the frame. The wood can also be used as a wedge if you have trouble hammering in a particular direction. , As you straighten the frame, measure the door gaps to see whether the door is evenly flush on both sides of the frame, from top to bottom.Remember that a warped frame is only an immediate problem if it prevents the door from closing properly, or allows a large gap in between the edge of the door and the frame.
A warped door frame can suggest a moisture problem. Double check for rotting wood on or near the frame.

, Replace the door shims that were removed prior to further tighten the corrections made to the frame. Don’t fully tighten shims until you are satisfied with the correction.


Use new door shims if the older door shims were damaged.
Shims come in a variety of materials, including wood, plastic or metal. Wooden shims are the most commonly used shims and are versatile thanks to their ability to be trimmed. Use plastic shims on any exterior doors as they are resistant to rotting.
Make sure you place a pair of shims at hinge height of the door, on both sides of the frame. This helps the door stay tightly secured, as much of the weight of the door is transferred to the frame at these heights. Use a spirit level to make sure the shims are level. Use as many shims as necessary to ensure the frame is installed level on its entire length.
Open and close the door several times to test the security of the door. If the door still seems to be uneven with the frame, adjust the frame and shims as necessary to level out the door.
Always re-nail places where you added shims.

, If you used new door shims during correction, score the excess with a utility knife and snap it off.

, If the door frame is far too warped for correcting (such as through large scale water damage), you will have to replace it. Once the molding and screws are removed, use a crowbar to slowly pry the frame from the wall. Start at the bottom and work your way up. Once the frame is nearly removed, remove it from the top plate by pulling it away from the door with your hands. Remove any shims you encounter along the way.


You may need to gently move the frame back and forth to nudge the frame loose from the top plate.

, If you are only replacing one side of the door frame, you may leave the top plate and healthy side of the door frame.


The door will have to be removed from the door frame if you are replacing the part of the frame containing the hinges.

, If replacing just one part of the frame, cut a piece of timber of your choosing to size.


Weather-treated pieces of 2x4 timber are the most commonly used type of wood used for door frames. These are available in several standard sizes at DIY stores such as Home Depot and Lowes.
Never use pressure-treated materials as they will twist once they dry out.
The most common heights for doors are 80”, 84”, and 96” in height. The width of common doors range from 18” to 36” wide. Ask an expert at a hardware store if you have any questions specific to your project. They can help you choose and cut any parts you will need for the repair.

, The top plate may need a modified notch for fitting the placement of the new frame. Set the frame where it will be placed and mark the measurement for the notch in the top plate using a pencil. Cut the notch using a multitool and chisel.


A multitool is an electric tool that comes with a variety of heads that fulfill different tasks, ranging from cutting and sanding wood to drilling holes.

, Place the shims 100 mm from the top and bottom of the frame, and where the door hinges will be placed. If the previous shims are still usable and in good condition, you may use those. Otherwise, shims can be purchased from hardware stores or home made from timber.


Use a spirit level to make sure the shims are level. Use as many shims as necessary to ensure the frame is installed levelly on its entire length.

, Slide the frame into place. Make sure it is in the notch and level against the shims. Hammer two nails through the frame at each shim, securing the frame and shims in place against the wall stud.


Don’t immediately hammer the nails all the way. Leave some wiggle room in case you need to make an adjustment.

, Use this opportunity to make sure the frame is flush to the drywall or finished wall material. If flush and level, use a nail punch to set the nails in place. If you have them, use a compressor and a finish nail gun instead.


Reinstall the door to the frame at this point if you removed it earlier.

, Take care to ensure both are flush and level."

The middle of the frame is a common area to become split, particularly if the door is forced open or shut with too much force. This is most often encountered during burglaries or other forced door entries.
A kicked door can cause a split lower on the door frame (including damage to the door itself).

, Use a chisel and hammer to pry the door stop and molding away from the frame. Start at the bottom of the frame and work your way up.


Take care not to damage the stop as you remove it from the frame. Place the claw end of the hammer on the side of each nail to support even removal.
Remove any remaining finishing nails left in the molding.

, Mark the measurements with a pencil. If the damage is at the bottom of the frame, mark just above the damage.

, Use a small hand or power saw to make an accurate cut.


Apply screws just above and below the marked measurements to help hold the frame tight and help guide the cutting process.Be careful not to cut too deep into the frame. You don’t want to damage the structure of the house.

, You want to cut the timber of the same length and width as the damaged portion removed from the frame. Use the same type of timber as the rest of the existing frame.


Weather-treated pieces of 2x4 timber are the most commonly used type of wood used for door frames. These are available at DIY stores such as Home Depot and Lowes.
Never use pressure-treated materials as they will twist once they dry out.
Door frame/jamb replacement kits are available for purchase that feature pre-cut selections of timber in various sizes and thicknesses. These can be further modified to suit your needs.If you believe your door frame is made from a non-standard wood, take the damaged portion to your local hardware store. Experts there can help you identify the type of wood that was used and supply you with the necessary materials.

, Use wood or carpenter’s glue to affix the replacement timber into place. Once fit, allow the glue to dry.


Wood or carpenter's’ glue sets thin, minimizing gaps between wooden parts. This glue also comes in waterproof varieties, making them ideal for wood-based projects. Hammer two nails into the top and bottom of the new timber for a more secure fit.

, Use sandpaper to sand away any glue residue or imperfections between the new and old frame.

, Mix enough body filler, also called bondo, to cover the entirety of the repaired areas. Apply and smooth with a putty knife. Allow to dry. The filler will fill in any gaps in the glue and help maintain the repair.


Most brands of body and wood filler are similar in the tasks they can handle. The eventual hardness, natural color, and malleability of each filler will differ depending on brand and ingredients. If pricing is a concern, body filler tends to be cheaper than wood filler. , Sand the applied filler smooth with sandpaper. Once smooth, finish with one coat of primer and two coats of paint.

Identify the rotted areas.,
Carve out the rotted areas.,
Insert a wire mesh into the carved area.,
Mix enough wood or body filler to fill the carved out gap.,
Allow to dry overnight.",How to Repair a Door Frame3," Wood rot often occurs near the bottom of door frames, where water tends to pool during rain or floods. Measure the section of door frame containing wood rot and mark the area with a pencil.

, Using a chisel, dremel, or straight oscillating tool, grind out all of the rotted areas of wood on the frame. It is important to get every last bit of rotted wood you can see. If even a small amount of rotted wood remains, the fungus causing the rot will continue to spread.


If the rot covers a particularly large area or extends beyond the door frame into the structure of the house, more serious repairs will be necessary to keep the rot from returning.
Inspect your door for wood rot. When the frame becomes rotted, the door can also rot as well. An infected door can pass the rot to the door frame and vice versa. Replace the door if it becomes rotted. , Purchase a folded wire mesh and place it in the gap of the frame. Lock it in place with screws. This wire mesh will serve as a skeleton for the body filler.

, Use a putty knife to fill the mesh cavity with the mixture. Allow to set for a few minutes and add additional filler to fill any gaps. Remove excess filler with a chisel before it hardens.


Use an epoxy-based filler for substantial repairs such as filling rotted portions of door frames. Epoxy fillers, such as auto bondo, are much stronger than wood and body fillers, and are better suited for withstanding the wear and tear that doors endure.
Plan out how much epoxy filler you’ll need. Once mixed, the epoxy filler dries quickly.
Invest in a few higher quality tools if sanding or carving epoxy filler – the filler is often sturdier than the wood itself when dry. , Once dry, sand to smoothness as desired. Finish with one coat of primer and two coats of paint."
"
Identify the damaged areas.,
Cover gouges with filler.,
Dry overnight.",How to Repair a Door Frame4," Survey the frame for areas that need to be filled. Animal bites, door keys, bed frames and other accidents can cause a variety of light dents and gouges in the door frame.


Gently push and pull at any visible nicks, dents or scratches to test the severity of the damage. If pieces of wood pull away, a more complex repair might be necessary., Smaller nicks, dents and gouges can be filled in with a body or wood filler. Use a putty knife to apply the filler into the gouges.


Use wood or body fillers for cosmetic damage such as slight gouges or dents. They lack the structural integrity of harder fillers such as epoxy, but tend to have a more pleasant aesthetic.
If you expect the door frame to continue to take a lot of wear and tear, use the epoxy filler to provide extra strength to the repair. The epoxy filler will have a greater resistance to future nicks and scratches than wood or body filler. You can also have sheet metal bent to cover the susceptible area.
Alternatively, if the damage is very minor, you can sand out the damaged area rather than applying filler.

, Once dry, sand to smoothness as desired. Finish with one coat of primer and two coats of paint. Use a straight edge to help keep the filler level and in place when applying to vertical surfaces."

, Using a hammer and nail set, remove the hinge pin that connects the two sides of the hinges. Be careful, as this will release the door.

, Set the old door aside and remove the hinges and hardware.

, Set the new and old doors on a set of saw horses, with the old door on top. Align their hinge side and top and then clamp them together.

, You'll need to cut a mortise (indent) for the hinge, as well as the hole for the door handle. Trace the door handle hole or holes from the old door onto the new one. Then, measure and mark or trace the hinge shape on the new door, using the new hinge or the old one (if the hinges are the same size) as a guide.

Remove wires from doorbell buttons and touch wires together.",How to Repair a Door Chime," Many times this cover will just hang on some tabs and can be removed by lifting it straight up. Other types may require that screws be loosened or removed.
, Reinstall if possible. Springs and plungers are basically the only moving parts for electro-mechanical chime units., Most units operate at 24 volts or less, and should not pose a shock hazard. You can determine this by looking at the wires. If the wires look to be closer in size to telephone wire - or low voltage thermostat wire, it is most likely the 24 volt (or less) type. Low voltage doorbell circuits usually originate at a small 120 volt to 24 volt (may be any value between 12 and 24 volts) transformer connected to the side of electrical panel. The presence of a transformer is also a good indication, too. In any case, treating the wiring as if it was line voltage (120 volts) will help prevent getting hurt., A faint buzzing sound or slight movement confirms that the chime unit is getting powered., If still unable to hear or see the indications above, just continue following the steps below., Gently push / pull the plunger(s). It may move only in one direction, but may move in both. If unable to move the plunger, or it moves but does not ""spring back"" into position, it is likely hanging up on dirt, dust, etc., Do not use any kind of lubricant. No oil, no WD-40, no graphite powder, and no silicon spray. These may work for a short time, but will quickly attract dust and grime and gum up the plungers., Either way will require safeguarding the area from dirt, solvents, etc. If removing from wall, label the wires and terminals before disconnecting., Do not be surprised to see dirty contact cleaner dripping out of the mechanism. Attempt to move the plunger again. Continue to spray bursts while moving the plunger. The idea is to flush out any dirt, etc that has collected around the metal plunger body.,, These values must match. Replace either the chime or transformer so that the two have matching voltage values. Most doorbell transformers are marked with AC voltage, but also have a 25 VA (watts) rating -- do not confuse VA with AC volts., If chime works, replace doorbell buttons."

, Beginning at the same corner, mark the measured distance to the end of the threshold. Draw a perpendicular line from each mark using a square until both lines intersect.

, Finish cutting with a handsaw.

,, Sand the threshold with 120-grit sandpaper. Spray the threshold with borate solution.

, Use a hammer and a wood block to tap the threshold into place.

, Do not place shims under the horns. Position the pairs of shims so that the thin end of one shim rests against the fat end of the other shim so that the threshold will lift but won't tilt when you tap on the fat end of the shim.

, Snap off the shim ends so they will be flush with the sub-sill.

,, Screw the toe kick to the sub-sill.

",How to Remove a Door Handle," There are lots of different types of doorknobs as well as many different manufacturers. Depending on those factors, as well as the age of the knob, there are many different ways to release the mechanism. Here are the various methods, organized by which you should try first:


Screw Method: Remove any visible screws. The screws around the latch plate between the two sides of the door are standard. The location of other screws can change though, depending on the type of doorknob and the manufacturer. Try looking on the round, doorknob plate on one side of the door or on the neck of the knob itself.
Hole Method: Look for small holes on the doorknob shaft or the base there maybe a small hole with a deep set screw you can use an allen wrench to loosen. If you see that there is a hole but no screw there maybe a release in the holes. Find a wire (clothes hanger) or other implement which can fit and then press down with the doorknob in a variety of different positions. While trying different positions keep tension on the knob (pulling away from the door) One position should release a latch with your tool pressing down in the hole.
Behind the Plate Method: Check the round plate against the door. This is called the rosette. If there is a notch in the rosette use a flat head screwdriver to pry the plate up. There is a heavy plate behind this that may have two notches. Using a flashlight to see if you can spy the small screws that mount this plate to the door. The screws should be in slots that have a larger hole at one end. Try to turn the heavy plate with screw drivers in the outer notches so that the screws line up with the larger hole. Once the screws pop into the holes the knob, rosette and heavy plate should come right off.
Latch Method: With a knife, flat head screwdriver, or other narrow implement, pry the round plate surrounding the knob away from the door. It should snap away easily. With that out of the way, you'll be able to see a thick metal plate that had been covered by the round plate. There should be a hole or gap with a visible latch inside the plate. Switch the latch down and the structure should come apart easily.
Thread Method: Use a wrench or your hands, screw the round plate surrounding the knob counterclockwise until it comes loose. By hand, turn it the rest of the way until it is out of the way. Do this for both sides. On the thread of the handle which should now be exposed, you will see a hole. Turn the handle until you see a spring or latch inside the hole. Press that down with screwdriver and tug the handle off. It should come off easily.;
, With the mechanism released, you should be able to pull the knobs off. Remove both and set them aside.

, This is the metal plate on the edge of the door where the latch bolt sticks out. Unscrew the screws above and below the latch bolt and gently pry the plate off with a slotted screwdriver.

, With the latch assembly unscrewed, you should be able to pull it and the other inner workings away from and out of the door. You're done! Use the manufacturer's instructions to install your new doorknob or follow wikiHow's.

For this project, you’ll need paint and primer (if you’re not using a pre-primed, metal-clad door). Some products nowadays contain both paint and primer in one. Also:


220-grit sandpaper
Screwdrivers
Caulk
Solvent, such as mineral spirits (for metal doors)
Sponges or rags
Painter's Tape
Painting tray
Stir sticks
Small foam roller and frame
Small to medium brush
A cut-bucket;
, Insert a flathead screwdriver between the hinge and the hinge pin. Angle the screwdriver upward at a 45-degree angle, and tap the end of the screwdriver with a hammer. As you tap, the hinge pin will come out of the hinge. Pull the hinge pin out from the hinge. Repeat with the other hinge. Loosen both the hinges and remove the door.Have somebody else holding the door as you remove it from the hinges.
When you have the door off, lay it horizontally on a bench or across two sawhorses.
It’s also OK to paint or stain the door while it’s still hanging. In that case, you’ll need to mask off the hardware or cover it with a painter’s rag.

, Use a screwdriver to remove any hardware from the door that will come off. This includes handles, knockers, the hinges, mailboxes, and the latch and lock mechanism.It will make painting much easier and faster if you don’t have to paint around these things.


You'll most likely need a Phillips or flathead screwdriver to remove the hardware.

, If there are any holes in the door, such as nail marks, fill these in with small amounts of bondo or wood filler. Go over the door and locate holes and cracks. When you find one, inject some filler into the hole to fill it. Smooth down the filler and press it into the hole or crack with a putty knife or scraper.When you’ve filled all the holes, set the door aside to let the filler dry. Read the manufacturer’s directions for exact times.

, To give yourself the cleanest surface possible, clean the surface of a metal door with a mild solvent like mineral spirits to remove dirt, grime, and old paint residue. Soak a rag in mineral spirits or another solvent and rub the surface of the door.This step is not necessary if you're painting a wooden door.

, To give the new paint a good surface to adhere to, it’s important to rough up the surface of the door with sandpaper. This will also help remove any dirt and residue from the surface. Go over the entire surface of the door with 220-grit sandpaper, making sure to get all corners, nooks, and crannies.


If you're painting a metal door, sand before cleaning it., Before you can paint the door, you must clean it to remove dust and dirt. Use a small brush attachment and vacuum the door, including all the recesses and corners.Take a slightly damp cloth and wipe down the entire surface of the door to get rid of any dust that the vacuum missed.
Set the door aside and allow it to air dry for about an hour.
If you cleaned a metal door with solvent, wash it with water mixed with a few drops of dish soap. Rinse the door and allow it to dry before proceeding.

, You need to protect features that cannot be removed, such as windows. Cover the window or element with newspaper, and then tape the paper in place with painter’s tape.


Make sure the tape or paper covers every surface that you don’t want painted.
If you left the door on its hinges, tape adjacent walls, the frame, and the hinges. You can use a drop cloth, too, if you have one handy.

, You need special paints for exterior surfaces, because outside doors will be exposed to many more elements than interior ones. Your best bet for paint is either a water-based acrylic or latex paint, or an alkyd-based oil paint.


Water-based paints tend to dry faster than oil paints, but oil paints will provide better protection for the surface underneath.If you currently have a water-based paint on your door, you'll have to paint over it with the same type of paint. The same goes for oil-based paints – you’ll need to cover it with another oil-based paint.
Make sure the paint you choose is specifically formulated for exterior surfaces.

, Before you paint the door, you'll have to apply a layer of primer that will help the paint get better coverage and adhere to the surface more easily. You can use an oil-based primer with oil- and water-based paints. The best is to apply an oil-based primer followed by a latex paint.For primer color, choose a neutral color or a lighter version of the color you're painting the door.

, The ideal day for painting will be above 50 F (10 C). Also, if you're painting outside, choose a day when there's no direct sunlight hitting the door. However, make sure it’s not raining either, and that it’s not too humid or too windy.If it’s too cold when you paint, the paint won’t dry. Wind and sun can cause the paint to dry too quickly, and humidity can prevent it from drying properly.

, Open your can of primer and stir it with a paint stir stick. Pour some primer into the paint tray. Use a brush to paint the trim around one of the recessed panels. Then use the roller to paint the panel. Repeat until all the recessed panels have been painted. Use the roller to paint the rest of the door, including the top, sides, and bottom.If your door is one flat piece of wood or metal, use the roller to paint the entire door.
When the primer has had enough time to dry (usually a couple hours), flip the door over and paint the other side.

, Fill a clean paint tray with your paint. Use the brush to paint the trim on a recessed panel first, then use the roller to finish the panel. When all the recessed panels have been painted, finish the door with the roller.Give the paint many hours to dry before flipping the door over and painting the other side.

, If you need to paint a second coat, follow the manufacturer’s instructions regarding drying time. In general, you should always wait a full day before applying a second coat.

, As soon as you’ve finished painting the final coat, remove the painter’s tape that was protecting windows and adjacent surfaces. Peel the tape off by pulling it toward yourself at a 45-degree angle.


It’s important to remove the tape when the paint is still wet, otherwise the paint may dry to the tape and peel off with it., Before replacing hardware and rehanging the door, it’s important that the door have time to fully dry. Otherwise, you may dent, smudge, or peel off the paint.


Read the paint can for proper drying times for your specific paint. For most paint, you may have to wait about two days before you can rehang the door.
Generally, when the paint no longer feels tacky to the touch, the door can be reinstalled., Once the paint has dried, reattach all the hardware before you rehang the door. This includes handles, knockers, mailboxes, and anything else that was affixed to the door before painting.

, As soon as the hinges are back on your door, you can put the door back into place. Slide the door back into the frame and align the hinges. Drop the hinge pin into place, and tap it down with a hammer or the handle of a screwdriver to secure it in place.


You may find it easier to have someone else help you with this. One person can hold the door in place and the other can put in the hinge pins.

If possible, try to remove the doors from their hinges before beginning to paint.,
Wash the door thoroughly and let it dry.,
Lay the door you are working on across two sawhorses or another other type of support to keep it horizontal.,
Remove the doorknob.,
Make any repairs needed in the door.,
Apply a stain-blocking primer if it is needed.,
If you will be working with oil-based paint, you can speed the work by applying the paint with a roller, then spreading it with a brush.,
Follow the right sequence when applying the paint: paint the edge first, wiping off the underneath face of the door when finished; paint all the panels, working from top to bottom; paint the cross pieces; finish with the stiles (the vertical sides that hold the panels in place).,
To give your doors the best possible appearance, touch up any drips or runs that appear.,
Let the paint dry completely.,Rehang the door and reinstall the doorknob.",How to Paint Paneled Doors," This may seem like an unnecessary step, but it will make it easier to apply paint to the frames and door-stops. Plus, it will enable you to do a better job painting the doors themselves.

Often, you can simply remove the pin from the hinge without unscrewing anything.
It helps to work with a second person so that one can support the door while the other connects and disconnects the hinges.;
, Use a solution of trisodium phosphate (TSP), available at your local hardware store, in warm water according to the package directions. Allow the door to dry thoroughly after washing and before you apply paint.,

You can, if you're cautious, also lay the door on a drop cloth on the floor.
You can still paint a paneled door while it is hanging, but you run the risk of drips, particularly out of the corners of the panels.

, This usually involves removing two screws. Set it aside and,

If you plan to replace the doorknob with a different knob at this point, now is the best time time to cut or fill in the cutouts for the latch.
Sand off any old drips if anybody less cautious than you applied a previous coat of paint.
Use an appropriate putty to fill any holes.

, It may be needed if the new color is very different from the old color, or if the door has any stains or marks that washing did not remove. Primer may also help paint cover and stick to a surface that was not previously painted. Use the same sequence to prime the door that you will use to paint it., If you are using latex paint, you should use a brush for the entire job. Either way, make sure you use the right brushing techniques for a smooth finish.

Use paints with a bit of gloss on doors and door trim. Semi-gloss will do. The reason is that semi-gloss or glossier paint can be washed, and doors often accumulate fingerprints.

,

It is likely that small brush strokes will remain in the paint, so brush the paint in the direction of any existing grain texture. If there is no such texture, run brush strokes the ""long way,"" which is to say up and down for most of the door, side-to-side for the horizontal

, Since these can sometimes occur a few minutes after you have applied the paint, so keep checking your work until the paint begins to dry., Then turn the door over to paint the other side.,"

Decide on a color and design for painting the knob.,
Sketch out your chosen design on graph paper.",How to Paint Porcelain Knobs2," The effect you wish to achieve will influence which painting method you choose for painting your porcelain knobs.


Consider using craft paint designed for use on porcelain if you want the original color of the knob to show and you want to paint a design on the knob. Craft paint is available in liquid form that requires you to use a brush and in marker form which may make detail work easier to execute.
Look at fabric and wallpaper designs for inspiration. If you want to paint a pattern on your porcelain knob, small scale designs will work best.
Plan to use a combination of primer and paint if you want a uniform finish and color on your porcelain knobs. You can use latex, acrylic or oil paint over the primed knob, and this provides you with a greater option of colors and finishes to choose from than if you use porcelain craft paints. You can also use spray paint over primer in addition to brushing on the paint of your choice.

, If you choose to paint a pattern or design on the knob, sketching out the design to scale before painting can help you produce a more uniform and professional looking result.


Measure the diameter of the porcelain knob you want to paint.
Draw a circle on the graph paper with the same diameter. You can use a compass and pencil if you are not comfortable sketching the circle freehand.
Divide the circle into quadrants by drawing 1 vertical line and 1 horizontal through the center or the circle.
Sketch out the design you plan to paint on the knob.

"
"
Gather together any paints you plan to use on the knob.,
Paint the knob.,
Heat your oven to 300 degrees F (148.9 degrees C).,
Place knobs on an oven safe baking sheet or pan with sides.,
Insert the pan into the oven and allow to fire for 30 minutes.

,
Remove the pan from the oven.",How to Paint Porcelain Knobs3," Make sure you have a paintbrush available for each color if you don't want the paint to dry while you are cleaning your brush when you switch colors.


Choose soft, natural fiber paintbrushes when using porcelain craft paints. Examples include red sable or squirrel hair quill brushes.

, Use your paintbrushes or porcelain craft paint in the marker form to apply the paint to the knob.


Allow your work to dry after you finish with 1 color if you are worried about having different colors bleeding together and mixing while you paint. Resume painting with the next color once the first color has dried.

, Double check your particular brand of porcelain craft paint to make sure this is the correct firing temperature for your paint.

, The sides will keep the knobs from falling off the pan and onto the floor of your oven.

,, Allow the knobs to cool completely before touching them. After firing, the design should be durable and dishwasher safe and will not require a varnish.

"
"
Apply an oil based primer to the knob or knobs you wish to paint.,
Allow the primer to dry.,
Apply an additional coat of primer if needed.,
Paint the knob using your chosen paint.,
Allow the paint to dry completely.

,
Apply a clear varnish to the painted knob.",How to Paint Porcelain Knobs4," Oil based primer will adhere better to the glossy surface of a porcelain knob and will be more resistant to scratches.


Look for a primer designed for use on glossy surfaces.
Avoid using latex primer, as it may scratch off the surface of the knob.
Apply primer using a paintbrush or small foam roller. Apply a light coat to ensure a more even coat and smoother results.

, Follow the directions on the primer container to determine the number of hours required for the primer to dry completely.

, Allow the primer to dry. A second coat will cover any spots you may have missed while applying the first coat of primer.

,


Apply solid colors using either a paintbrush, small foam roller or spray paint.
Use a paintbrush to add detail of your pattern or design if desired.
Sand lightly with fine grit sandpaper after the first coat of paint if you are painting the knob a solid color and want to achieve a smooth texture.
Apply a second coat of paint.

,, Varnish will protect the painted surface from damage.


Choose a varnish compatible with your paint. Use water-based varnishes for latex or acrylic paint and varnishes especially for oil paint if you used oil paint.
Consider what type of finish you want when choosing your varnish. If you want your porcelain knobs to have a glossy sheen, choose semi- or high-gloss. Matte will produce a flat finish and satin will give the knobs a slight sheen.

Select the wood you want to use for your wheelbarrow.,
Build a simple, basic box suitable for your needs.,
Rip two pieces of sound 2 inch (5cm) thick lumber on a taper from about 1 1/4 inches to 2 inches (3cm to 5cm) and around 4 feet (1.2 meters) long.,
Lay these handles on a table, placing them at an angle that will allow the grip ends to be spread apart far enough for you to use them, and with the wide end almost touching.,
Cut these two lines with a circular saw.,
Build your wheel by gluing and screwing layers of 1 inch (2.5cm) thick boards together at opposite angles.,
Scribe a circle on the blank you built for building the wheel.,
Drill the handle frame and the center of the wheel to accommodate an all-thread rod.,
Place a washer on the rod, then pass it through the wheel.,
Install the handle/wheel assembly on the bottom of the box you built earlier.,
Cut two wedges from 2 x 4 inch (5cm x 10cm) material, the same length as the box.,
Lay your wheel and handle assembly on these wedges, and screw them in place.,
Cut and install a cross brace between the wheelbarrow support legs to keep it from wobbling.,
Sand edges smooth if desired, and seal or paint the wheelbarrow with an exterior coating.",How to Build a Planter Box Wheelbarrow," Cedar is a good choice, since it is free of preservatives and naturally resists rot and decay. Plus, it is easier to work with than hardwoods or tightly grained softwoods such as pine that are more likely to warp and split.;
, The one in this illustration is 18 inches (46cm) wide, 22 inches (56cm) long, but the final size depends upon your needs.

, These pieces will be the main supports, serving as both the mounting frame for the wheel and for the handles, so choosing good lumber is important.

, Scribe a pair of parallel lines on the thicker end so you will have a pocket for the wheel/axle assembly to mount in.

, Then scribe a block to fasten the two handles together, staying back about 12 inches (30cm) from the end you are using for the wheel mount.

, Three layers will give you a wheel about 2 inches (5cm) thick, using two 1 X 6 inch (2.5cm x 15cm) planks will allow you to cut a wheel 11 inches (28cm) in diameter, as shown in the illustrations.

, Then cut it out with a jigsaw or band saw.

, A 1/2 inch (1.5cm) galvanized rod will give you a fairly stout axle. Put a nut on the all-thread, running it down about 3 inches (7.5cm), then add a flat washer. Thread your rod through one handle, and start a nut on the end where it passes through the handle. Tighten it so that it pulls into the wood if possible, to make it stationary.

, Add another washer, then another nut, before allowing it to pass through the second handle. Add a final nut on the outside of the second handle, and tighten it securely. Make sure the space between the wheel and its washer spacers is fairly tight, but not too tight, so the wheel cannot wobble.

, You can begin by laying this assembly on the inverted box and marking the edges of the handles so you can fit the next piece in the correct location.

, Lay them on the lines you marked earlier and fasten them with wood screws.

, Add your legs and braces, using 2 X 2 inch (5cm x 5cm) material scribed on the angle of the handles so that they support the wheelbarrow in the position you want. You can let these legs run wild (cut longer than needed) so you can trim them when you have completed the project.

, You can now set the wheelbarrow right side up and check it to make sure it sits correctly. There are a number of simple ways of adjusting the way the wheelbarrow sets, including adding wedges underneath the box, and trimming the support legs.

, You can line the wheelbarrow box with plastic to give it more protection from moisture if you are going to use it for a planter, but if you use a good, exterior grade wood, it should last for a long time with just a sealer on it.

Assess whether you have the type of garage door that can have an opener attached.,
Choose a garage door opener.,
Prepare your garage door for opener installation.,
Make sure there is an electrical plug in the immediate area of the opener motor.,
Lay out all of the parts your opener came with.,
Begin by putting together the main assembly.,
Install blocking on the ceiling, if there is none there already.,
Find the point of connection to the garage door and attach the bracket that came with your opener to the door itself.,
Lean the end of the assembly (opposite the motor compartment) up above the garage door.,
Lift the other end of the assembly up and into place.,
Attach to the bracket on the garage door.,
Attach the safety rope to the emergency release on the carriage.,
Insert a lightbulb into the socket in the garage door opener compartment, if it has one.,
Install the electric eye safety system that came with your garage door opener.,
Install the push button control 5' from the floor so small children cannot reach it.,
Adjust the safety reverse system and the electric eye system properly.,
Test your garage door to make sure the opener is working correctly.",How to Install a Garage Door Opener," Most newer garage doors with multiple horizontal sections should be compatible with an opener. Older types, such as those that are one solid piece, may need to be replaced before you can install an opener., There are two basic types of garage door openers, chain driven and belt driven. Both operate in roughly the same way but just use a slightly different part for operation.


A belt driven garage door opener can be a bit quieter during operation. Consider this when making the choice of what opener to buy.

, Make sure your garage door is well lubricated and operating properly.


The weight of a garage door is supported by the door springs, cables, and pulleys, not the opener. If you can't raise and lower the door normally by hand, do not install the opener until the door is repaired.
Remove all ropes or cords attached to the garage door so you won't get tangled in them during installation.
Deactivate or remove all existing garage door locks, so they won't accidentally engage and either damage the opener or cause personal injury.

, They are usually mounted in the ceiling, facing down. You will need to install one, or have one installed by a licensed electrician, if you do not have one already.


If you need to install permanent electrical wiring, always disconnect the power at the main breaker box before attempting to wire connections. Always connect the power cord of the garage door opener to a properly grounded outlet to avoid electrical shock.

, Make sure that the parts list included with your opener matches the parts included in the package.

, Your opener should have come with a list of detailed installation instructions, so follow those to begin assembly.


First put the rail together. This should come in several pieces that fit easily together.Attach them together as directed in your installation instructions.
Then you will need to slide the carriage (also known as a trolley) over the rail. This is the piece of the opener that will move along the rail, pulling the door open.
Attach the rail to the motor compartment. This is the largest piece of the opener and it will be positioned furthest from the garage door.
Install the pulley at end of rail, opposite the motor compartment. Then feed the belt or chain through the end of the rail, around the pulley, then around the other end (at the motor). Finally you will attach the end of the belt or chain to the carriage. The end of the chain or belt should have a screw attached to it, so that you can easily attach it to the carriage. This screw will also allow you to adjust the tension of the chain or belt., This is how you will attach the garage door opener to the ceiling. The instructions your garage door opener came with should have detailed specifications for the blocking.


No matter what the size and spacing of the blocking is, be sure that you are attaching it to joists (solid wood) in the ceiling, not just to sheetrock.

, The distance from the top of the garage door should be specified in the opener's direction and in most cases you will want it centered on the door.


If your garage door opener did not come with this bracket you will need to consult the instructions to determine what type of bracket you will need., Attach the bracket the opener came with to the wall above the door and then insert the end of the assembly into it. Connect the bracket and the end of the assembly as directed in the installation instructions.

, Install the power unit high enough so that tall people won't run into it, at least 7' from the floor if possible.

, In many cases there will be two pieces used to attach the door to the opener, giving some flexibility in the connection, as the distance between the door and the opener assembly may vary.

, Garage door openers must have a manual disconnect cord. It should be adjusted to approximately 6' from the floor so any adult can reach it.

, The manual or the inside of the compartment should suggest an appropriate wattage for the lightbulb but it's a good idea to buy a lightbulb that is rated for ""rough service"" because of the vibrations it will need to withstand.The light will turn on whenever the door is opened but may be able to be operated manually as well.


Many garage door openers use the light to signal programming changes that are occurring. Be sure to install the lightbulb in your opener so that you can program your garage door successfully.

, This will require you to run two small wires down to the bottom of one side of your garage door. You will also need to mount an electric eye in that location, as well as a reflector on the opposite side of the door.


Be sure to follow the instructions and wiring diagram included with your opener.

, Put it in a location where anyone operating it can easily see the garage door.


Also install and program any other optional equipment, such as a keypad for opening the door on the exterior of your garage or remote openers.

, Refer to your opener manufacturer's instructions for details.

, If the door and the opener are moving smoothly, if all parts are attached solidly, and there are no obstructions blocking the door or the opener's movement, then it should be fine.


Some garage door openers can be quite loud under normal working conditions, so don't assume that just because it's a bit loud that it is not installed properly.

Measure your garage door panels.,
Purchase insulation.,
Cut the insulation to size.,
Fit the insulation into each garage door panel.,
Affix the insulation to the door.,
Consider buying a garage door insulation kit as an alternative.",How to Insulate a Garage Door," The panels are the rectangular parts of the garage door that are recessed from the latticed frame. You will be installing the insulation on the inside face of the garage door, so measure from the inside. Use a tape measure to determine the dimensions of each panel; you don't need to be exact at this point, as you just need the dimensions to know how much insulation to buy.;
, There are 2 different kinds that are well suited for use with garage doors.


The first type that you can use is reflective foil insulation. This insulation is usually about 1/2 inch (12.5 mm) thick, and consists of a sheet of polyethylene foam sandwiched between reflective aluminum foil. This insulation is sold in rolls, and has the benefit of being quite flexible. Make sure you investigate how this material will insulate in hot and cold weather.
Another type suitable for use with garage doors is polystyrene foam. This type of insulation is rigid, and is sold in large sheets. Polystyrene will insulate better than reflective foil insulation, but it can be more difficult to work with due to its rigidity. Shop around for the highest R-value you can fit in the space. Johns Manville and Owens Corning offer very good R-values of 9.8 and 7.5, respectively, for 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) thick material.
Neither fiberglass batt insulation nor spray-in insulation should be used. These are not suited for use with garage doors.

, Using a straightedge, measure out the dimensions of a single garage door panel on a sheet of the insulation, marking the dimensions with a pen. Using the straightedge as a guide, cut the insulation to size with a utility knife. It is best to err on the larger side, because you can always trim off the excess later.

, Place the panel of insulation up against the recessed door panel. If your garage door has a metal frame that extends past the door face, you should be able to tuck the insulation into the frame itself. If not, simply align the piece of insulation directly with each recessed panel. Trim any excess as needed.

, Use aluminum foil tape to tape the piece of insulation to the garage door face. If you were able to tuck the insulation into the frame, you may not need any additional tape. As an alternative, you can use double-sided tape by first affixing the tape to the panel in long strips, and then pressing the insulation into the panel. Repeat this process until all panels have been insulated.

, Insulation kits are readily available at hardware stores, and can speed the process along, as the insulation will already be cut into panels. Make sure, however, that the panels in the kit are not smaller than your garage door's panels. The process for installing the kit will be very similar to the process described above.

",How to Build a Planter Box from Pallets,", If not available, you can purchase them locally for very little money. When searching through the pallet stack, look for the pallets with the most usable wood. The length of the slats is ~ 3 feet (0.9 m). The thickness varies from ½ to ¾ thick. The width of the slats can vary from 2.5 to 6 inches (6.4 to 15.2 cm).

, Breaking the pallets apart takes a decent amount of work. Use a jig or circular saw to cut the ends. Pry the wood from the center support. This should give you 8 to 14 boards per pallet. Remove nails from slats.

, Before you start cutting, determine the best pieces to get the desired width (see drawing). If you have multiple long pieces with cracks and/or damage down one side, you can cut the damage off and still have usable pieces.

Lubricate the top of the rail.",How to Lubricate a Garage Door," Use the remote or close the door manually. This will allow you to access the tracks and the rest of the moving parts on your door.
, Before lubricating your door, you'll want to make sure that it's not on. Disconnect your garage door from the power source, after you close it., The tracks are the what the garage door rollers ride on to open and close. You don't want to lubricate these, but you do want to make sure that they are completely cleaned out for your door to operate correctly. Wipe down the inside of both tracks and remove any dirt and debris.Make sure that there are no debris left in your tracks that the rollers can get stuck on.

, If you are having issues getting debris out of the tracks, you can use a vacuum with a hose extension to suck out the dirt and debris. This is a great solution to reach the higher portion of the tracks that you may be having issues reaching., Popular standard degreasers like WD-40 isn't the best option for a garage door. Instead, purchase a lithium based grease at a hardware store or online. There are also certain greases that are made specifically for garage doors. Do not use oil.Garage door grease will typically come in an aerosol or spray can.
Oil is susceptible to dirt and dust buildup and is more likely to drip than garage door grease or lube. Read the label to make sure that the grease that you are using is appropriate for your doors.

, Slowly lift your garage door up manually and spray down the hinges as it meets the bend of the track. This will lubricate the moving parts on the door and will make opening and closing the garage door much smoother. Use one or two sprays on each hinge. Your hinges should be covered in lubricant., The rollers are the circular moving pieces on your garage door and are attached to each of your hinges. Inside of these rollers are small ball bearings that need to be lubricated for your door to open and close smoothly. Use the thin hose attachment to spray the grease inside of the rollers.Any exposed ball bearings must be thoroughly lubricated.

, The springs can usually be found at the top of the garage door and must be fully lubricated as well. The bearing plates are the moving circular parts on both sides of the springs. Spray down the outside of the springs and near the center of the bearing plates, then open and close your garage door to spread the grease around.You will most likely need a step ladder to reach the springs and bearing plates.
If your springs are making noises, you need to grease your springs.

, Lubricating the lock will make locking your garage door easier, and can prevent rust in the long run. Point the lubricant towards the lock's keyhole and spray it once to lubricate it. Once you're done lubricating the lock, finish lubricating your garage door by spraying the grease on the large armbar at the top of your door., The rail is the portion that your chain rides on and should run along your garage's ceiling. The top portion of the rail is what your chain actually rides along, so it's the part that needs to be lubricated. Spray down the top of the rail and then spread the grease around with a rag.The chain comes with a natural protectant on it that makes it so that you don't have to grease it regularly.
Spraying the bottom of the rail doesn't do anything.

Consider chain-drive openers as a cost-effective option.,
Consider screw-drive openers for a well-rounded option.,
Consider belt-drive openers for quiet operation.,
Consider direct-drive and jackshaft openers for quiet and highly dependable options.,
Consider 1/2-HP models for standard doors.,
Consider 3/4-HP models for insulated or one-piece, wooden doors.,
Consider 1-HP models for oversized or industrial doors.,
Consider AC versus DC motors.",How to Choose a Garage Door Opener," Chain drives are some of the most popular and durable openers on the market. These drives use a metal chain on a sprocket to lift and lower doors.Chain openers also tend to be some of the most affordable options; however, the affordability and strength of a chain drive come at the expense of noise.Chain drives are ideal for the heaviest garage door types, including oversized doors, one-piece wood doors, and wind-rated or heavily insulated doors.
If you have a detached garage or a garage that is at the opposite end of the house from the bedrooms, then the noise will be less of an issue.Many upgraded chain-drive models can come with chain separators to help stop the chain from hitting against the track, which cuts down on the noise of a chain drive.;
, Screw drives use a long metal rod threaded like a screw to lift and close garage doors.Due to having relatively few moving parts, a screw drive tends to be quite reliable as well.If noise is your biggest consideration, screw-drive openers tend to be middle of the pack. They’re not nearly as quiet as belt or direct drives, but they are most typically quieter than chain drives.Screw drives also require a bit more maintenance than most of the other types. Despite having fewer moving parts, the threaded metal rod meshes against a drive section with plastic teeth to catch the threading. Without the proper lubrication on this drive, the rod can wear on the teeth and eventually strip them, so you must grease the works fairly regularly—approximately every few months.The type of garage door you have should also be taken into consideration. For heavy wood one-piece doors, the extra weight and strain can wear the teeth in the inner works of the drive down pretty quickly. This makes screw drives most effective with single-car garage doors or steel doors since the thinner materials cut down on weight.Screw-drive openers also offer some of the faster speeds available. Newer models can open at 10” to 12” per second as opposed to the more standard 6” to 8” per second of most other drive types., Belt-drive openers use a rubber or rubber-like belt on a cog to open and close doors.Since the opener doesn’t have the loud, banging metal parts, it’s one of the quietest options available.Consider your particular garage door. If your door makes a lot of noise on its track, then the lower volume of the belt opener may be moot.Pay special attention to the current of belt-drive openers. Alternating current belt openers start and stop at full power, which can cause the door to jerk into movement and lead to noise despite the relative quiet of the drive.Direct current belt drives offer soft starts and stops that reduce noise even further, as well as reducing wear and tear., Though less common than the other models, these alternatives are gaining in popularity, and both offer additional options for quiet door openers.


Jackshaft openers attach directly to the front wall of the garage, meaning no overhead parts.These models use cables attached directly to the garage door along with pulleys and a rolling torsion bar to lift and lower the door.Many models of this computerized system even include an automatic deadbolt that locks when the door closes for added safety.Due to the compact nature and computerization, jackshaft openers are some of the most expensive models available, and the cable system also means that they only work on sectioned garage doors.Direct-drive openers still have an overhead rail with a chain, but the actual motor moves along the track with the door connected to the motor via a J-arm.Since the motor moves instead of the chain, these models are also extremely quiet, and since the only real moving part is the motor, they tend to come with extremely good—maybe even lifetime—warranties. They are still on the pricey side, however—comparable to a belt drive opener., 1/2-HP is the standard for most garage doors, and it is also the most popular motor speed. Depending on the type of drive you pair it with, the 1/2-HP motor can lift most garage door types. However, while it can lift most door types, well-insulated garage doors and one-piece, wooden doors can put extra strain on 1/2-HP motors that might lead to more wear and tear than with something more powerful.

, 3/4-HP motors are the next step up from 1/2-HP models. The additional power makes these motors a more durable, longer-lasting option, but the increased durability comes with a higher price tag as well. The extra power doesn’t just increase the life of these motors, but it also means they’re capable of lifting heavier doors more easily without as much wear.


Door styles that might benefit from the additional power include one-piece wooden doors on two-car garages or specialty doors with heavy insulation and wind-load ratings.

, 1-HP motors offer the maximum in efficiency and power. These motors are perfect for the heaviest garage doors, including oversized doors and commercial or industrial doors. When it comes to a standard, sectioned garage door, the extra power may prove unnecessary for your needs, especially at the larger price.

, In addition to the horsepower of a motor, you should also consider the current. Direct current motors are most common on belt drives, but more manufacturers are incorporating them into other drive types as well. Direct current motors are typically more expensive, but they offer the added benefit of soft starts and stops, which means that the drive begins a gradual lift and stop on the door, and this equates to much less noise than a motor that jerks to life and shakes the door.Direct current motors are also more likely to provide backup battery options, allowing you to get several uses out of your garage door even during a power outage."

",How to Buy a Garage Door Opener," Garage door openers are found in three different sizes: 1/3 horsepower, 1/2 horsepower and 3/4 horsepower.


You will need to examine if you need an opener to lift one or two doors. You will also need to take into consideration the material and size of the door.
If you plan to purchase an opener to lift double doors, you will need to look for an opener that is at least 1/2 horsepower.
A single door can be lifted with a 1/3 hp opener. However, an opener with more power will last longer.
Oversize, large and heavy doors will need the most horsepower.;
, The three main types are belt drive, chain drive and screw drive.


Belt drive openers raise and lower the door on rubber belts. This is a very quiet opening and closing. In most cases, this type of garage door opener is on the higher end of pricing.
Metal chains raise and lower the garage door on chain driven openers. Naturally, the clanging of the chains causes a more noisy opening and closing. This type of opener is usually lower priced.
Screw driven garage door openers raise and lower the door on a threaded rod. This type of opener has fewer parts and is often lower maintenance.

, The average opener opens at 7 inches (17.8 cm) per second. Some models may double in speed. Others may be slower.

, Do you need a retailer that offers installation? Will you install it? Do you have an outside party that will complete the installation?

, Now that you know what you need, visit stores such as Lowe's, Sears and Home Depot. Private businesses that sell and install garage doors will most likely also sell garage door openers.

Remember that while this article gives a good overview of the process of installing a garage door, there may be important steps that are specific to your manufacturer. Always assume that their instructions supersede those provided here.;
, Your garage door should come with all the necessary parts included. Be sure you have all the parts listed in the instructions and that you understand where each piece provided should go once installed. Its always a good idea to organize your parts into piles, so you can see exactly what you have (and if anything is missing).


While there is some variation depending on the manufacturer, a garage door should come with panel sections, hinges that connect each section together, rollers that allow the sections to move up and down, track for the rollers to move in, brackets to connect the track to the frame of the garage, and a tension spring to help offset the weight of the door.
If any parts are missing do not begin installation. Proceeding without all of the necessary parts could lead to trouble installing your garage door, damage to the door, or even injury due to a poorly installed door.

, This includes a hammer, nails, power drill with a screwdriver tip, and screws. You will also need a ladder to reach the parts of the door that are overhead. In fact, it's not a bad idea to have two ladders handy, so that you and your helper can both be on one at the same time.


Have all your tools and manufacturer-provided garage door pieces at arm's length to make installation easier.

, If hinges aren't already attached to the top of the first panel, attach them. Slide a roller into the left and right hinges on the panel. Also attach the manufacturer-supplied weather stripping to the first panel's bottom edge.


This is also a good time to pre-drill holes for the hinges on the rest of the sections, as it will be easier to get the sections lined up exactly when on the ground. Once you have the hinges attached to the bottom of each section, lay the panel on the ground next to its adjacent panel. Line up the sections exactly, then pre drill the holes where the two sections will be connected. This will save you the time and frustration of trying to attach the hinges while the sections are up in the opening.

, Center the panel with the weather-stripping end on the ground. Make sure you have chosen a garage door that is wide enough to cover the opening but does not extend too far past that opening. Garage doors come in standard sizes, with most basic roll-up single garage doors measuring about 7 feet (2.1 m) tall and 9 feet (2.7 m) wide. If your opening differs from this, you may have to order a specialty door.


If you don't have someone to help you for this part, temporarily pin the panel in place by driving nails at an angle partially into each jamb. This will allow the panel to stay put while you continue the installation process. Remember not to nail through the actual door panel, just use the nail to wedge it in place.

, Each of these distinct parts should be kept separate for now, as they will be attached in separate steps, but the vertical sections should be connected to each other, if necessary.


The vertical section should be approximately as long as the door opening is tall.

, Start with one side and then move to the other. Make sure each track is level and that your panel is still centered in the opening. Screw the track to the door frame with the brackets provided, but don't tighten them all the way. You may need to make several slight adjustments to their position as you add the next panels.

, Unlike the first panel, the second panel should not have the outside hinges attached before the panel is put in place.


Install the outside hinges and rollers on the second panel (and subsequent panels) by angling each unattached roller into the track, then sliding the roller with hinge attached into place on the panel and securing it with screws. These holes can be pre-drilled but cannot be attached beforehand or you would not be able to get the roller in the track. Be sure to do this for both sides of the doorway.
Don't forget to also pre drill the holes for the hinges connecting the second and the third panels before you install the second panel! It's much easier to do this on the ground than when its up in the door opening.

, These screws can be tightened all the way once the panels are lined up exactly.

, Be absolutely certain that the lag screws go into sound framing but do not completely tighten any of them yet because you still might need to adjust the tracks.


Remember to keep checking that the track is level and that the panels are lined up correctly. Any misalignment early on can cause problems for the function of the door.

, Be sure that the brackets below each panel are attached to the wall. Once again, you still want to have the ability to adjust the brackets but they should be secured enough to hold the panels in place.

, Secure the top plates of the vertical track to the wall on each side of the doorway. The lag screws must be driven into sound framing since the garage door will exert a great amount of force every time it goes up or down.

, Follow the manufacturer's instructions when connecting the tracks together. It may prove helpful to rest the horizontal track on top of a ladder at this point. Verify that the horizontal track is level. Cut the rear track hanger to the appropriate length needed to support the track and screw the track hanger into sound framing, such as ceiling joist or blocking. Repeat this process with the other piece of horizontal track, making sure that the distance between track is the same as below.

, Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions. If you intend to use an opener, wait on installing the torque tube. The torque tube and/or spring provides lift assistance for the door and is helpful when you are opening and closing the door manually.


Make sure that if you install a garage door spring, you also install a safety cable to protect from accidents if it breaks. Garage door springs are very strong and could fly across your garage if they come loose, causing damage or possibly injury. If you have a garage door opener to install see: How to Install a Garage Door Opener


, Remember to remove any temporary nails, such as the ones you drove into the jamb at an angle across the first panel. Also make sure all obstacles, particularly ladders, are out of the way so you don't hit them when you try the door for the first time.

, Tighten the screws starting at the bottom of the door and working your way up. As you go, check the operation of the door by making sure it moves freely in the track. The door should move easily up and down the track once the screws are all tightened.

, Make sure the tracks are aligned and make adjustments to the position of the track as necessary. Be sure to check that all of the rollers are sitting well in the tracks and that they are moving freely. Also check that the door will stay in the up position without holding it up. If you have a problem with this, you may need to adjust the slope of your horizontal track or the garage door spring.

Lubricate the springs.",How to Adjust a Garage Door Spring," There are two kinds of springs your garage door might use: side-mounted extension springs or torsion springs. Before you can adjust the spring on your garage door, you must determine what kind of springs your door has. Side-mounted springs are easier to adjust, while torsion springs are more dangerous to meddle with, so you would be better off calling a professional if you have these.


Side-mounted extension springs run above and parallel to the door track, and they’ll have an attached pulley and cable.The cable, which holds the spring, attaches to hooks in the track hanger assembly. There will be two springs: one above each track on either side of the garage door.;
, Torsion springs are mounted above the door and will run along a metal shaft that’s parallel with the top of the door. This type of mechanism is usually used for doors that are over 10 feet wide.Lighter and smaller doors may only have a single torsion spring, while larger and heavier doors may have two springs, with one located on either side of the central plate.

, Improper spring tension can cause many problems with how your garage door opens and closes. The problem you’re having will help you figure out how you need to adjust the spring to fix the door. Doors that need spring adjustments may:Be difficult to open or close
Open or close too quickly
Not close fully or properly
Close unevenly and leave a gap.

, Depending on your problem, you will either need to increase or decrease the spring tension on the door. You will need to:Decrease the tension if your door isn’t closing fully, is difficult to close, or opens too quickly.
Increase the tension if the door is difficult to open or closes too quickly.
Adjust the tension on one side (where the gap is) if your door is closing evenly.

, There are some basic tools and safety equipment you’ll need for this job. Your safety equipment includes gloves, safety glasses, and a hard hat. Your other tools are a sturdy ladder, a C-clamp, an adjustable wrench, and a marker or masking tape. If you are going to be adjusting torsion springs, you will also need two winding bars or solid steel rods.


The rods or bars should be 18 to 24 inches (45.7 to 61 cm) in length.
Solid steel bars can be purchased at hardware stores.
You will need to measure the diameter of the holes in the winding cone (the collar that secures the spring to the metal shaft) to determine what size bar or rod to use. Most cones have a hole diameter of 1/2 inch.
Do not attempt to use any sort of tool as a substitute for the winding bars or steel rods., Before you can work, you need to release the tension on the springs. Open the door until it hits the stop bolt and can’t go any farther. For an automatic door:


Open the door, unplug the opener, and disconnect the door from the openerby pulling the emergency release cord down and back until the spring locks in the open position.You will then be able to open the door fully and release the tension on the springs.

, Place a C-clamp below the bottom roller,or use two locking pliers (one on each track under the bottom rollers).This will ensure the door doesn't fall while you are working.

, The spring will be attached to the track hanger by a large hook that’s kept in place with a nut. Once there’s no more tension on the spring, remove it from the track hanger. Use the adjustable wrench to remove the nut on the back side of the bracket.


You’ll now be able to move the hook to a lower or higher hole to decrease or increase the tension.

, To make sure you achieve the right tension, adjust the spring by one hole at a time.Adjust both springs equally, one at a time, if your door was balanced. Once you’ve moved the hook to its new location, replace the nut on the back and use the wrench to tighten the hook into place.



To decrease tension and fix a door that isn’t closing fully, is difficult to close, or opens too quickly, hook the spring onto a lower hole on the track hanger. This reduces the length of the spring and the tension on it.To increase tension and fix a door that is difficult to open or closes too quickly, hook the spring onto a higher hole on the track hanger. This stretches the spring and increases the tension on it.To adjust tension on one side and correct a door that wasn’t closing evenly, adjust the spring only on the side where the gap was. Decrease the tension on that side by hooking the spring onto a lower hole on the track hanger., After adjusting your spring(s) by one hole, unclamp the door and test the springs by lowering the door to see how it feels. Make another single-hole adjustment if your door is still closing too quickly, slowly, or unevenly (with gaps).


Repeat steps one to five until your door is closing properly and evenly, or until your gap is gone.

, The cable inside the spring will also be attached to a hook or the track, and you can adjust this by tightening or loosening the knot or the clamp attaching it and tweaking the length of the cable.


Shorten the cable to slightly increase the tension, or lengthen it to slightly decrease the tension.Your cable may be attached to the track by an S-hook, and if that's the case, move the hook to a higher hole to increase tension slightly or to a lower hole to decrease tension slightly., Determine if your door is opening and closing the way you would like, and ensure it’s balanced (closes evenly and without gaps). Continue making minor adjustments with the cable and testing the door until it’s correct.


When you have finished with your adjustments, be sure to remove anything that was securing the door in place, pull on the emergency cord to release the spring and reattach the door to the opener, and plug in your automatic door opener.

, Unplug the opener if you have an automatic garage door. Note that because the garage door will be down, this will mean:


The springs will be under tension, which increases the risk of injury. Call a professional if you don’t feel confident dealing with a spring under this much tension.
You should have sufficient lighting in the garage to work comfortably.
You will need an alternate way out if anything should happen.
All your tools need to be inside the garage with you when you begin.

, Place a C-clamp or a pair of locking pliers on the track of the garage door just above the bottom roller. This will prevent the door from popping open when you’re adjusting the tension., From the stationary center plate, use your eye to follow the spring out to where it ends. At the end, there will be a winding cone keeping it in place. The cone will have four holes evenly spaced around it, plus two set screws that are used to lock the spring in place on the center shaft.


To alter the tension on the spring, you will be adjusting the winding cone by inserting the winding bars into the holes and rotating the cone in one direction or the other.

, Insert the winding cone or solid steel rod into the bottom hole on the winding collar.Hold the cone in place with the bar and loosen the screws.


Check the shaft to see if there are any flattened or depressed areas where the screws are meant to be set. If so, make sure you replace the screws in these same flats when you are finished with your adjustment to ensure they hold more securely., Insert the bars into two successive holes in the winding cone. Position yourself to the side of the bars so that your head and body are not in the way if the spring breaks. Always be ready to move quickly., Make sure the bars are fully inserted, and manually rotate the cone in 1/4 increments.To determine a 1/4 turn, rotate the winding bars 90 degrees.



To increase tension for a door that’s difficult to open or closes too quickly, wind the cone up(in the same direction as the garage door cable goes through the pulley).

To decrease tension for a door that isn’t closing fully, is difficult to close, or opens too quickly, wind the cone down(in the opposite direction from how the garage door cable passes through the pulley).Unless you know exactly how much you need to adjust your door, go through all the steps and test the door. Repeat as necessary, working in 1/4 turns, until you achieve the proper tension.

, Keep the bottom-most winding bar in place and remove the second bar. Measure out 1/4 inch from the end of the winding cone (away from the center) and make a mark with a marker or piece of masking tape. With the bar still in the bottom hole, pull slightly up (toward the ceiling) on the bar and toward the center plate. As you do this:Continue holding the bar up and over and tap on it with the second bar. Tap it just below the winding cone. Tap it away from the center plate and toward the mark on the shaft.
Tap the bar until you have stretched the spring to meet the mark on the shaft.

, Once you’ve stretched the spring out 1/4 inch, hold it in place with the one bar and lock it in place on the shaft by tightening the set screws.


Make sure you replace the screws into their flats if there were any on the shaft.

, Some torsion spring mechanisms have two springs (one on either side of the center plate), and if this is the case, repeat steps four to eight on the other spring. Torsion springs must be adjusted equally to ensure balance., Remove any clamps or pliers that are securing the door and test the door to see if you have adjusted the tension enough. If not, repeat steps four to ten until you have found the right tension to correct the problem you were having.


Once your adjustments have been made, plug your opener back in if you have an automatic garage door.

, You should lubricate all springs, hinges, bearings, and metal rollers twice a yearwith a lithium- or silicone-based spray. Don’t use WD-40."

Using a mild detergent and a soft brush, clean your garage door several times a year. This will remove any corrosive chemicals or dirt on the garage door that may prevent it working in top condition. In addition, cleaning it in this way will allow you to see if any springs or hinges need repair.
Proper cleaning of your wooden garage door with a mild detergent and soft brush will remove any chemicals or sediment that may threaten to warp the garage door and inhibit its proper operation. By repainting it, inside and out, every few years, you greatly reduce the chance of moisture seeping into the door and warping it, which would prevent it from opening and closing properly.;
,,


Both wooden and metal electric garage doors have springs and chains that allow the door to move effortlessly up and down. Using a light weight spray oil on all springs, hinges, rollers and pivot points at least once a year will keep your garage door gliding smoothly up and down.
Once a year you should give your electric garage door a thorough examination and tighten any screws, nuts or bolts that may have come loose. This is important to keep your garage door moving properly on the rollers.

,,


Using a cloth and a concentrated but non corrosive cleaner, wipe out the garage door tracks and carefully clean all exposed parts of the rollers. Remove all excess moisture. Then use a specifically designed garage door lubricant or powdered graphite to keep the rollers moving smoothly and efficiently on the tracks.

Find something with a meaningful or fun message. You could also find a sign from an old restaurant in your neighborhood or something that feels nostalgic. If you can’t find what you are looking for, you could make your own sign or ask a local painter to make one for you., Fresh flowers are a staple of the Farmhouse style. By leaving the walls and background furniture in soft, light colors, you can focus the energy in a room around the fresh flowers. You might decide to have house plants or you could use freshly cut flowers, in a vase on your kitchen table. Whatever you decide, be sure to liven up your home with some bright, colorful flowers. You could put the flowers in blue mason jars or Industrial style, metal containers, for an authentic look., Whenever you are shopping for bedding, pillowcases, throws or sofas, you should prioritize natural materials. Linen, cotton and wool are hallmarks of Farmhouse style. In addition, try to find fabrics that have soft, light colors, and avoid excessively energetic colors such as bright pink or neon green., Place wire baskets around your living room, in the mud room or other parts of your house. You can keep books, magazines, pillows or gardening tools in the baskets. The utilitarian look of wire baskets is part of the Farmhouse style, and is also very practical.You could put some wire baskets underneath a bench in your mud room. In the winter, you could store your gloves, hats and mitts in the baskets.
You could use wire baskets to store fruits and vegetables in your cold storage room or in your kitchen.

, Industrial style accessories are a great match with Farmhouse style. Find an industrial style clock, vase, frame or other accessory and place it in your Farmhouse style house.For instance, you could put an industrial pendant light in your Farmhouse style living room. You could also put an industrial style bedside lamp in your Farmhouse style bedroom. The hard lines and metallic look of Industrial style will give some edge to the soft tones of Farmhouse style, while keeping everything rustic."

, You can draw the room onto graph paper based on the measurements you took (1' to every 3 squares, for example). Draw it with no furniture first. Then, draw your furniture on a separate piece of paper, to scale, and cut out the pieces. Now you can make practice arrangements, however you like.

, No longer is planning software limited to interior designers: there are lots of software options for planning out your room. From Chrome extensions like 5d, to games like The Sims (2 and 3 work great for this), there are tons of options to let you experiment with arrangements, color schemes, style, and sizing.

, The focal point of the room will depend on what room you're in. In a living room, it could be a picture window, fireplace or television. In a bedroom, it should be the bed. A dining room, the table. Figure out what the focal point of the room will be, since the majority of the furniture will be around it.

, If you have the option to get an item of different sizes, get one that fits the space that it's in. For example, don't get a bed or dining table that is too big for the room. There should be a minimum of three feet around the large objects in a room, to make them usable.

, Move your focal point, if you can, to the best spot in the room. This should be a place where, when you walk in to the room, you should have the focal point facing you and very prominent. Your eye should be drawn to the object.

, Draw further attention to the focal point later by placing accessories in this area. For a bedroom this will mean side tables with lamps or other items, while with a couch it will mean paintings or a mirror. A TV should generally be made more prominent with shelving or bookshelves, unless it is a part of a large entertainment center.

, Once the focal point is arranged, you'll want to add some seating to the room (unless, perhaps, it is a bedroom). Make sure the seating you choose is the right size for the room. Leaving enough space, as with the focal point, to make it usable. For example, at least three feet should be available behind each dining chair. Try to limit yourself to only one piece of over-sized furniture in a single room. Too many and it will look crowded and cheap.

, When you arrange the seating in the room, it should appear open and inviting when standing at the entrance to the room (or at least the main entrance). Avoid having chairs facing away from the door, for example.

, You can add drama to a room by placing furniture at an angle, but be careful. This takes up valuable space in a small room. Use furniture placed at angles only if your room is very large or you don't quite have enough furniture to fill the space., When place seating in an area that will be used for conversation, such as living room furniture, you should be careful not to put the items too far apart or too close together. Roughly 6–8 feet (1.8–2.4 m) for seating pieces facing each other is a good rule of thumb.Pieces places in an L shape should have 6""-1' between their corners.

, Especially in the living room (but also, to an extent, in the bedroom), you should have a surface within arms reach of every major seating spot. This is so that people have a place to set down drinks while talking. Try to leave these surfaces if you can. If they would be in the way most of the time, consider movable surfaces that can be dragged into position as necessary.

, Surface levels should be appropriate to the area that they are in. Decorative tables at the edge of a room should be taller than tables next to a couch or chair. Keep items next to seating as level as possible with the arm of the seating object.

, Avoid overly large coffee tables or other tables. These can make it difficult to get around a room or get to seating (think of the poor guy taking the middle seat in an otherwise full couch!). Instead, make sure that there is roughly 1-2 of space between the edge of the table and the next piece of furniture.

, You likely will need to use some of the tables in a room as surfaces on which to place reading lights or lamps. Make sure that you place the table strategically so that all areas are lit and also so that outlets will be within reach for the lamps.

, If there is more than one entrance to a room, make sure that there is a clear and fairly straight path between them (it can ""arc"" around a seating area if necessary). This can also help divide a space and make sure each entrance has an open area facing it. , Think about how someone would need to move through a room. The consider where your furniture is. Is something going to get in the way? Make it difficult to get from one area to the next? Make sure these barriers are moved or at least broken up.

, Not only do you want to be able to sit down on your couch easily, you also want to be able to reach things like outlets easily. Have at least one easily reachable with a nearby, low table. This will allow you a space to charge electronics, like phones and portable media devices.

, You can also use furniture to break up large spaces, although this should be considered earlier on in the process. If you have a very large, open room, it will be better to use the furniture to break the space up into sections. For example, use the backs of couches in place of walls to create a living room and make the space on the other side the dining area.

, Paintings and other wall decorations placed high can make a space look bigger, while placing a painting above a couch and placing tables at either end will make that space look larger. Paintings can also help make a large wall look less blank.

, Mirrors placed on a wall can make a small space look larger, by reflecting light and creating the appearance of more room in the room. You can effectively double the amount of space it looks like you have! But be careful...mirrors can easily make a room look cheap.

, Rugs should be sized so that they just fill the area they are placed in. Rugs which are too small or too large can make a room look just that: too small or too large. , High curtains will draw the eye up, creating the appearance of higher ceilings. It can also make a room look more proportional if your windows and ceilings are already high.

, If you want to make a small room look larger, use furniture which is sized down and then avoid items which give it away, such as cups, bowls, or other standard size items. This is the dollhouse effect, where your room will have the appearance of being large and spacious but further away.

, When placing accessories, or any furniture items, try to use symmetry. This is a quick cheat to making a furniture arrangement look better. Place a table on either side of a couch, a bookshelf on either side of a tv, a painting on either side of a table, etc.

It can be the attic, an unused bathroom, the shed out the back, the garage, or the basement. Or anywhere else that's spare, has adequate elbow room, and is left currently unused or pretty much abandoned.



Build a shed or dig out a basement if your options are looking thin.;
, Having a man cave in the house may require delicate household negotiations and compromises. You may have to agree to something in exchange for your man cave been allowed into the house. If your man cave is using up the only relaxation space, no one's going to end up happy. Try offering one of the following in exchange, if your partner or housemate is interested:


Setting up another room as a sewing room, exercise room, sauna and spa, playroom, model collection space, or astronomy observatory.
Promising a certain number of hours each month on household repairs, odd jobs, or chores.
Arranging regular dates or family time.

, Man caves often start in corners of the house without insulation. Make your man cave warmer and more sound-proof by installing fiberglass or other insulation material between the wall studs.


Unless your cave is in a stand-alone shed, or you're living alone, put a priority on sound proofing when choosing insulation material. You don't want your midnight sports or poker game to be interrupted by a tired spouse or neighbor.

, If you've been relegated to the dingiest, smallest room in the house, bright colors will give a sense of more light coming in, and more space. On the other hand, dark colors are good for home theater setups, or a relaxed bar-like atmosphere.


If you couldn't care less and just think a wall is a wall, congratulations. Skipping this step is the first benefit of having a space where you get to make the decisions.

, Install recessed lighting or a light on a dimmer switch if you want to watch movies in your man cave. If your man cave has windows, put up blackout curtains so you can pull them closed and game at three in the afternoon without the outside world butting in.

, Get the comfiest couches, armchairs, recliners, or beanbags you can find. If you're looking forward to a lot of spilled beer and take-out food, find a beat-up leather couch that can handle the damage. If you're building more of a ""gentleman's cave,"" select quality matching furniture instead.

, Most man caves can get away with a couple end tables to put a drink on, and maybe a bookcase to hold trophies, books, and decorations. If you like board games or card games, though, put in a card table and a few compact chairs.


Outdoor wooden furniture is more rustic and durable, and fits in with a rugged man cave style.

, If you watch a lot of sports, save up for a 50 inch+ (127cm) flat screen TV, although keep practicality in mind if you're going to be sitting 5 feet (1.5 meters) away. If television isn't going to be the main entertainment in your man cave, you can put in a small, cheap set, a radio, or nothing at all.


If you want a home theater setup, a projector and canvas screen can create the largest image and takes up barely any space when not in use.

, If you like mixing drinks or keeping a large booze selection, class up the experience with your own bar counter top and shelving, plus a bar stool or two. If the goal here is to keep a few beers cold, or to store some easy snacks, just go with a mini-fridge instead.


If you party in a giant man cavern, buy a kegerator.

, If you have a laptop, just make sure you get internet access. What you look at online is your own business in the man cave.


If your home wireless signal is poor in the man cave, try purchasing a WiFi range extender.

, If you enjoy quality audio, this is another big ticket item to save up for and really spice up your man cave. Keep in mind that most living situations will make sound-proofing a necessity before this goes in.

, From board games to card games, from a pool table to a table tennis table, whatever fits in and makes your world rock is absolutely fine. The man cave is a great place for console gaming, too, especially for less family-friendly games.

, Reserve some space for the physical activity of choice to keep you fit, strong, and manly. Think about dumbbells, a bench press, or whatever you can fit into your space.

, If you're into home projects and have the space, set aside a corner for carpentry, home improvement planning, or other projects. If you are in a garage or basement, you can include a workbench for vehicle maintenance and upgrades.

, There are a thousand ways to customize your man cave. If you have an indoor hobby, make a space for it. Here are even more ideas to customize the space the way you like it:


Arcade games and pinball machines
Indoor bowling, golf, or other miniature sports
Musical instruments you or your buddies can play.
A smoke machine or other completely gratuitous, awesome man toys.

, Neon bar signs make classic man cave décor, as do old-fashioned liquor ads and traffic signs with funny messages or images. You can buy these from specialized stores or online, so there's no need to look for one that ""just fell off the truck.""


You can also search online for ""man cave decorations"" or ""man cave signs.""

, Display posters of your favorite actors, athletes, or anything you like. Frame your favorite movie posters in lighted frames, or negotiate with other people in your house to move a couple pieces of wall décor into your cave. Posters of models are another classic man cave decoration, although they can be a sore point for some spouses and partners.

, Hang up your medals and place your trophies proudly on the top shelf. If you hunt, fish, or play sports, display your equipment, along with photographs of great moments. Your man cave is also the perfect place to display any collection you have, or at least the most prized examples.

, There should be plenty of small things for you and your mates to grab during the lull in TV, audio, or video game activity. Include such items as:


Magazines and books
3D puzzles, handheld games and toys, and other small time wasters or challenges
Strange gadgets, flea market deals, and other odd, interesting stuff you've picked up — especially if your family won't let you keep it anywhere else!

Know how much space you have.,
Create multipurpose workspaces.,
Think vertically.,
Consider collapsible furniture.,
Use storage furniture.,
Use as much wall space as possible.,
Hang a hook from your ceiling.,
Hang a rack in your shower.",How to Maximize Space in Your Apartment1," If you are going to maximize your space, you need to know how much you have. Measure the height of each room as well. High or low ceilings can affect the amount of space you have. Use a tape measure to find the dimensions of every room you have in feet or meters.

Having a floor plan is helpful as well. The layout of a room is often as important as the size.
It helps to have these measurements kept in a handy location, such as a purse or binder when furniture-shopping or thrift store browsing.;
, Think about where you spend time in the apartment, and especially where you store your day-to-day work and entertainment. If you're using the whole place but still feeling cramped, try consolidating some of it.Similar tasks can usually be done in the same setting. Your reading corner, computer station, and work desk can all be in the same corner, for example.
A bookcase can be a good way to divide a room, creating some division while also providing valuable shelf space.Look for other ways to divide a room that emphasizes these spaces, even without using walls.
Consider non-traditional arrangements. For instance, if you do not entertain, and do not need a large table, you likely do not need a traditional dining room. Instead, a small cafe-style table may free up needed room. Or use folding tables if you do have friends over.

, Make use of every square foot, and think of using space right up to the ceiling. Select tall furniture instead of lower, wider pieces.You can install two rods in your closet, hanging shirts from the top one and longer clothing items from the lower.
Try to go ""floor to ceiling"" with bookshelves, taking up as much space as possible.

, A bed can take up a huge amount of room in a small apartment. If you're willing to replace it with a roll-up sleeping pad, you'll have much more space during the day. Similarly, you can buy chairs that fold up under the table, or footrests that slide under the couch., An ottoman with space for storing cushions or books serves two purposes at once. A coffee table or end table with drawers gives you even more space in your living room. A bed with a trundle underneath it lets you use space that would otherwise have nothing but dust and lost socks.Use boxes and urns as decorative storage. They come in all shapes and sizes to match your decor and they are great for concealing a number of necessary items. From baking supplies to TV remotes to loose change, these art pieces can hold all kinds of practical objects.
Try putting some bins and boxes underneath your existing tables and beds. You may not need to buy new furniture, depending on what fits.
If your bed is too low to put things under it, you can buy a bed lift to raise it up. Just a few inches can create extra space for boxes and containers. There are containers that you can buy specifically made to fit under beds., Almost anything can be mounted onto a wall or placed on a newly installed shelf, freeing up floor space. As storage space, bookshelves are a great place to put decorative objects, and more space-efficient than end tables. For example, replace a floor lamp with a smaller lamp on a shelf.


You can use shelf dividers as well to help organize your things, or create smaller, as needed shelves, to maximize the space you are using.
The inside of closet doors can provide additional space to hang or mount items. A spice rack looks good, and can be very convenient, on the inside of a pantry door.
Hanging pots and pans in your kitchen can save cabinet and drawer space, and makes you look like a serious cook.
Hang bulletin boards on walls and doors. Reduce paper clutter in the kitchen with bulletin board or fridge magnets. Make use of the space on a closed door by hanging additional bulletin boards or decorations.
If you have a flat screen TV, hang it on the wall. Don't get rid of the TV stand, instead use it for more shelf space.A cheap wine rack can be a great place for your bathroom towels. You’ll be surprised to discover that rolled-up bathroom towels fit well in a wine rack, creating extra space in your cupboards.

, Use this to hang houseplants or extra storage containers. If you have a high enough ceiling, you can go a step further and replace bulky lamps with a chandelier.

, A rack hanging from the shower head is a space-efficient way to store bathroom supplies.

, You’ll want to put these in another room so they don’t get any paint on them. You’ll need as much room as possible to move around in, so put any wall decorations in another room.


If you have any posters up, gently remove them as well, and scrape off any remaining tape on the wall. You don’t want to paint over anything that will show through the paint or change the texture of the wall.






Remove any nails or screws that were leftover from your decorations. Painting over these nails or screws will look tacky and less professional.







, This will keep you from getting it on the borders. Make sure every part of the outlining walls are covered and that the tape is secured on strongly enough so that it won’t come off when you’re painting.

, You want to find items that are thick so that when any paint hits the floor covering, it won’t go through to the floor. Use anything old or already used so you won’t mind when it gets paint on it. Secure it to the wall as much as you can with masking tape. Although this is hard to do with certain types of sheets, do what you can to at least hold your floor covering down. Once you’ve outlined the whole wall with masking tape, it’s time to start painting.

, Use the wooden stick provided to you by the home improvement store to stir the paint; or, you can use a piece of clean scrap wood.

, Use the roller brush for covering the large surfaces. Don’t be afraid to go over some parts twice if the paint doesn’t go on the wall all of the way. Take your time and don’t rush. Put music on to help the process, and to keep it fun. Use a wet rag to wipe off any paint that accidentally gets on the ceiling, surrounding walls, or floor. Keep this rag wet throughout your painting process and rinse it out if it gets too much paint on it.

, Take a break by making dinner, going to the movies, or getting other errands and chores done. Be sure to keep the windows open and put a ceiling fan on a low setting to help the speed up the drying process. Make sure it’s not a windy day, or that your fan isn’t on a high setting; this is important to prevent the floor covering or any loose items from flying away or sticking to the wall.

, Do all of the previous steps and turn a light on to see that every part of the wall has an even amount of paint. Once the second coat is completely dry, remove all of the tape. Pull it off downward, instead of upward and be slow in this process. Look for any spots that you may need to touch up with the small brush and clean up any spots that you got on the walls.

, Screw the outlet covers back in and put the nails back in the holes they were originally in. If you later find any spots that you missed, it’s OK to make minor touch-ups without reapplying the floor coverings.

Paint your walls.,
Try out new furniture.,
Use decorative storage.,
Refurbish old furniture and accents.",How to Decorate Your Home1," If you live in a rented space, this might not be an option for you. However, if you’re able to, painting the walls in your house can be one of the quickest ways to freshen up the look and add a bit of interest. Choose a color that complements your personality and fits your space. If you’re bubbly and fun, consider a golden yellow or bright green. Calm and collected? A shade of gray or blue might be more your pace. Paint isn’t permanent, so feel free to experiment with colors until you find a look you love!


Don’t be afraid to try several colors spread throughout your home; although you don’t want many different bright colors, painting each room a different color is totally appropriate.






Although it’s not as in style as it used to be, you can apply wallpaper on an accent wall to add a bit of pattern, if you want. There are even wall decals that act like wallpaper but are removable, if you’re afraid of the permanence of it.






If you’re not ready to paint one whole room (let alone your house!), try adding an accent wall. This is when you paint just a single wall in a room, typically one that gets a lot of attention, a bright or cheery color that matches your décor.





;
, Furniture is arguably the most important aspect of decorating; if you’re short on furniture or have been using the same pieces for many years, consider bringing some new furniture into your home. Choose comfortable pieces in colors and styles that match your personality. Don’t be afraid to try something other than what the store model has set up; furniture that truly shows your personality will fit in your space better than boring floor model furniture you pick up because it is on sale.


Don’t be afraid to buy used furniture from thrift stores; it is easy to repaint and reupholster these to match your space.






Mix and match furniture rather than using only matching sets; you’ll end up with a more unique look, and probably save some money in the process.







, Whether you’re incredibly organized or a bit of a hoarder, nearly everyone has stuff that needs to go into storage. Rather than shoving it under a bed or in the back of a closet, try using decorative storage instead. Look for ottomans that store things in their hollow centers, entertainment centers with doors, and large bookshelves and hutches to hold your knickknacks. By using storage that’s attractive, you kill two birds with one stone.


Cover shoeboxes in fabric or spray-paint store-bought storage crates to create sophisticated solutions to your storage problems.






Book cases can be used to store nearly anything, aside from books. Consider placing one in your kitchen to hold dishes or in your living room for assorted decorations.






When you buy new furniture, look for pieces that have hidden storage available., If you don’t have enough money to buy new furniture for your apartment, give your current furniture a makeover. In a kitchen or bathroom, try painting the cabinets a new color or staining them. Use cheap fabric to reupholster your couches or chairs, and try a stain on your floors to change the color. Wood accents (on edges of furniture, the windowsills, trim, doors, etc.) can be painted or stained a bold new color. If nothing else, try moving your furniture into new locations and see the difference it makes on their appearance.

Get rid of extra stuff.,
Put objects in storage.,
Transfer paper records to digital.,
Store odds and ends in empty jars.",How to Maximize Space in Your Apartment2," From clothing to unused kitchen tools to furniture, you can probably find something to throw out. Donate objects in good condition to charity, and throw out the rest. As a rule of thumb, if you haven't used something in a year, you can probably get rid of it.


If you have not used an item in 12 months, it is most likely clutter. The same goes for anything that does not really bring you happiness, or does not function well--such as being broken, or too big or small.
A garage sale is another good way to give your stuff to people who need it more.

, If you have furniture that simply does not work for the space, consider renting a storage facility. This includes things like Grandma's china cabinet that you will use when you get a larger place. A storage locker is also good for rotating seasonal items, like clothing that you will only wear part of the year.Check with your property owner for nearby storage facilities. He or she may have some tips on the good ones nearby, and might even have a deal with one.
If you have a friend or relative with a large house, he or she may let you store these objects in an attic or basement for free.
Consider cost of storage, however. Storage units have a cost every month, which while modest, can really add up over time. Is it really worth hundreds of dollars to hold on to your old furniture?

, Scan your files and photographs to make digital copies. A single hard drive can easily store every paper record you have in the apartment. Just make sure to make at least one back up, so you don't lose the files to a technological error.

, Spare jars or plastic food containers can store the little, miscellaneous objects that build up. From children's toys to nails and screws, these are good to have around.


If you are out of room in your kitchen cupboards, store pasta and other dry food in empty jars. Place these on top of the kitchen cabinets for practicality and ambiance.

Hang up some artwork.,
Add your favorite pictures/memories.,
Add floating shelves.,
Use creative lighting.,
Hang up some new curtains.,
Look for matching rugs.,

You can purchase cuts of carpet and have them finished to create your own rug for your home, for cheap.

",How to Decorate Your Home2," Nothing does more for a space than filling the walls with artwork, prints, and posters. Choose a selection of artwork and prints in complementary colors and themes; think nature photography, paintings, concert posters, favorite quotes, etc. Head to a local thrift store or the clearance rack of a department store and pick up some picture frames that match the sizes of your artwork. Then, hang your prints all over your home. A bare wall is a boring wall, so try to have at least a few large pieces and a few small pieces of art displayed throughout your house.


Keep in mind that you can paint your picture frames to match your artwork or furniture.






You can purchase incredibly cheap prints of famous paintings online, making it easy to add lots of art to your home.







, To make your house truly idiosyncratic and appealing, add framed photos of your favorite memories, trips, people, and locations. You can print large photographs from different experiences throughout your life to hang as centerpieces on your walls, or you can print small versions to place in standing frames around your house. People will love seeing your home filled with your favorite pictures, and you’ll always have good things to be reminded of while you sit and relax.


You can find cheap picture frames for your photos at thrift stores, which can then be painted to match the interior of your house.
Try hanging your photographs with assorted artwork in your home in a gallery display. This will allow you to showcase lots of your favorite pieces at once, and add a more personal touch than just paintings might do.







, Floating shelves are small rows of shelves that are attached directly to your wall, allowing you to hang prints and photos around them. These are great for placing small decorative items and knickknacks on. Add glass bottles/vases of flowers, trinkets, things you’ve collected from your travels, and other pretty things to the shelves that match your interior decorating. These are also a great way to showcase art and photos without filling your walls with holes to hang them up.


Floating shelves are great for decorating a bathroom and allowing you to store towels and the like with a small amount of space.






Try using floating shelves in your kitchen to store cookbooks and pretty glassware/china.







, Generic light covers and shades may come with your home, but they typically lack interest and personality. Mix up your lighting by purchasing new, more decorative options. Look for items to work as your primary light source that match the general style of the room, but that aren’t too bold. Small interesting lamps can be interspersed throughout your home to add light and flare to your style. If you’re interested in DIY, you can purchase old lamps and shades from a thrift store and spray paint or cover them in fabric for a fresh new look.


If you’re using multiple lights in one room, try to vary the sizes, colors, and shapes of the lamps (unless they’re a matching set).You can never have too much light, so don’t be afraid of using several light fixtures in a single room or a small area.







, Curtains are one of the most underused style tools in decorating a home. With just a bit of carpentry work, you can install curtain rods and add lovely curtains that match your furniture perfectly. Look for curtains that have plenty of color or pattern to brighten up your room. If you’re working in a space you’d like to keep dark (like a bedroom), you can add room-darkening curtains or drapes in dark hues to block out light. If you’re trying to make a space look bigger, add light colored and textured curtains.

, The purpose of rugs is dual in nature: cover up unattractive or dirty flooring and add interest and pattern to your floor. Look for rugs to fill up the empty spaces in your home; these will make your house seem full of furniture even when it's a bit bare. Find rugs in colors and patterns that match your décor (or go with it; too much ‘matching’ might look boring). You can also arrange furniture on a rug. There are basically three ways you can arrange furniture on your rug.,"

Measure and mark the surface.,
Clean the surface.",How to Apply Command Strips1," You can apply Command Strips to metal, tile, glass, painted drywall, and painted or varnished wood.Do not apply them to wallpaper, antiques, or valuable/irreplaceable items. Don’t use the strips to hang anything over a bed.Avoid using Command Strips on vinyl, since they may not stay adhered.
If you’re using hooks with clear strips, choose a smooth surface.
To maintain adhesion, apply Command Strips to surfaces that stay between 50°F (10°C) and 105°F (40°C).;
, Check the package of your product to find its exact weight limit. If your items exceed the weight limit, consider other options such as screws and studs or a picture string.


Command Strips come in a variety of sizes with different weight-bearing capacities.
Depending on the product, 3M may advise that you use only one hook per item you’re hanging., Ask someone to hold up the item, if possible, so you can stand back and decide if the placement is satisfactory. Use a level to align a picture; if it’s a group of pictures, use a laser level. Place a sticky note sideways – like a kite shape – at the top center, above where your item will hang.You may want to hang a picture 60 inches (152 cm) above the floor, or with its bottom edge six to eight inches (15 to 20 cm) up from a piece of furniture.
For a group of items, cut paper patterns of their shapes. Use low-adhesive tape to place the papers on the wall and decide where you want the items to hang. Then place the corner of a sticky note at the top center of each paper, so that the bottom corner is your reference point.

, Dampen a cloth with isopropyl rubbing alcohol. Gently wipe the surface where you plan to adhere the strips. Allow the area to dry.Don’t clean the surface with household cleaning sprays or wipes. These leave a residue that can make the strip’s adhesion unsteady.

Use a screwdriver or drill to remove the knob and strike plate.
Remove any other accessories on the door, such as a kick plate or door knocker.

, Use a drill to loosen and pull the screws from the frame.

, Use rubbing alcohol and a rag to clean the entire door. Pay close attention to areas with extra dirt, grease or grime.

, Use painter's tape to mask off windows, trim or anything else you don't wish to paint.

, Use auto body filler to even out dents or cracks. Sand the affected areas until their surfaces are even with the surfaces of the door. Start sanding with 100-grit sandpaper, and transition to using 150-grit sandpaper to finish smoothing.

, Sanding the door prepares the surface so the paint will adhere to the steel door.

, Roll or brush on 1 coat of a universal quick-drying oil-based primer. Allow the primer to dry at least 24 hours.

, Allow the first coat to dry before applying the second coat.


Use a brush to apply the paint. Using a brush to paint the steel door reaches any grooves or inside parts of door panels. Avoid brush strokes as you apply the paint.
Roll the paint onto the door. Be careful to fix any drips or uneven roller strokes before the paint dries. Use different sized rollers to reach crevices in panels on doors.
Utilize a paint sprayer to paint the steel door. A sprayer requires more experience to achieve a smooth finish. If you have experience with a paint sprayer, this process may provide the smoothest finish.

",How to Paint a Wood Stove2," Shake the paint can vigorously for 2 minutes. This ""stirs"" the paint and distributes it evenly. Test the aerosol spray plug by spraying for 1 or 2 seconds onto a newspaper or other disposable surface. When the color comes out and the stream is good, the paint is ready for application.

, Place on eye protection and gloves to avoid stains on your hands.

, Use a sweeping motion to cover an area of the stove in 1 streak. Continue to cover the surface in 1-stroke sweeps until it is covered. Do not keep your hand on the spray nozzle the whole time you are painting, and do not use a circular motion, as this will cause the paint to be unevenly distributed.

Evaluate the lighting.,
Create a neutral base.,
Pair complementary colors.,
Look for different shades of the same color.,
Decide on a palette for each room.",How to Add Bold Color to Your Home1," Whether you are painting a room or just decorating it, the amount of light in the room may affect what color looks best in it. Lighting may be affected by the size of the windows, the amount of artificial light, and the direction that the room is facing.


Lavender, yellow, powder blue, orange, and bright pink are good for rooms with low lighting. Darker shades such as charcoal, dark blue, and brown work nicely in a room with plenty of lighting.North-facing rooms should have bright colors and jewel tones. East-facing rooms should feature oranges, reds, and yellows. West-facing rooms do best with neutrals. South-facing rooms do well with both dark and light colors.Cooler shades, such as blues and greens, may be better in bedrooms and offices whereas warm colors, like reds and yellows, may be better for living rooms and kitchens.;
, Bold colors will appear more vibrant against a neutral backdrop. When adding color to your house, establish neutral base tones to emphasize and brighten your bold palette. Keep about 80% of the room in neutral colors with the other 20% being your bold colors.Some neutral colors include:


White
Gray
Cream
Pale yellow
Tan
Beige
Chocolate brown

, If you want to mix and match different colors, choose complementary colors. These colors will work well together. They can both be bold without overwhelming. Some complementary colors schemes you may choose include:


Turquoise and red
Red and yellow
Green and pink
Orange and pink
Teal and copper
Lavender and yellow, If you only want to go for one color, find different shades of the same color, and layer them around the room. This will create depth without oversaturating the room with one particular hue.For example, if you want to add red to your room, find accents in scarlet, crimson, burgundy, maroon, and sienna.

, When choosing colors, you may want to have different palettes for each room in the house. This will give you some variety when choosing colors, and it will allow you to pick colors for the individual function and design of each room.


For example, you may decide to have a black, white, and red palette for your kitchen but a seafoam green, sandy brown, and yellow palette for your living room and a purple and gold color scheme for your bedroom.
Consider which rooms can be seen from other rooms. Choose similar or complementary color palettes for rooms that open up into each other."

",How to Paint a Room1," It's not always easy to run out to the store in the middle of dealing with wet paint!;
, If you are only painting part of the room, you'll only need to clear or cover items in the danger zone. Paint drips downward, so anything underneath what you are painting needs to be moved or covered. Paint can also splatter sideways as you swing your tools or if you paint too aggressively. Consider the danger zone to be at least 2 meters (6 feet) horizontally from any surfaces that will be painted.

, Remove any unnecessary protrusions, like nails or old paint drips. Fill large holes with self-expanding sealing foam (e.g. Great Stuff). Fill small holes with Spackle, joint compound, or wood putty. Sand the wall flat and remove bumps and ridges. See How to Fix a Hole in a Wall and How to Prepare a Room for Painting.

, you don't wish to paint over. For painting purposes, it's better to remove than to mask, but masking is possible for items that you either cannot remove, don't care that much about, or which would be wobbly if removed and re-installed in the same place. Nothing looks worse than paint on door hardware.

, You don't want dust to blow onto your wet paint; it will make nasty bumps.

, Any colors you want to match exactly will probably need to be painted at the same time. Paint colors can fade over time, especially when exposed to sunlight.

, Some molds can be very hazardous. Use of a filter mask is recommended. Be sure the room is kept dry enough to prevent future mold growth. Some primers and paints are mold and mildew-resistant. Some primers and sealers are specifically marketed to deal with stains.

, They must be completely clean of dust, spider webs, etc., and also completely dry. You should be able to wipe the wall down with a sponge without having anything come off. If there is existing paint that is chipping, it will need to be scraped off with a metal brush or paint scraping tool. Otherwise, your new paint job will also soon start to flake off.

, Use a household detergent or a light acid. Trisodium phosphate (TSP) is one widely available cleaning product that is effective at breaking down dirt, grease, and oil on walls.

, Paint drips may obscure the label later. This will also help you know how long the job will take, so you can schedule appropriately.

,


Make sure the tape is straight. The edge you lay down with the tape is the edge you will get in paint. A small error (especially if the wrong color is on the wrong surface) might be very noticeable later.
Push down hard on the edge of the masking tape nearest the side that will be painted, to prevent bubbles that could allow paint to seep under the tape.
It's almost certainly less annoying to use masking tape than to ""be very careful"" around the edges. It is nearly impossible to avoid accidentally getting paint in the wrong place, and it is difficult to wipe up an accidental smear when it's very close to a large area of wet paint without getting more paint on yourself or other inappropriate surfaces.
To keep paint from bleeding under the tape, you can first ""seal"" it by using either a clear glaze or paint of the same color of the surface behind the tape. You will then need to paint over this sealing coat with the desired color on the surface being painted. This will produce a very crisp line when you remove the tape.
Some surfaces (such as loose plaster or old wallpaper) will be damaged by masking tape. You will need to wipe stray smears, or hold a newspaper or other flat, non-stick object in the right place. Wide plastic blades are sold in paint departments for this purpose. If one surface is heavily textured, you may need to do the border freehand with a good paintbrush. Hopefully this will be in an area where it is difficult to notice small errors (such as high above, out of direct sight, or very low to the floor).

, It's important to take this step seriously; it will be more difficult if not impossible to clean up drips later. You may wish to tape your drop cloth to the floor. Masking tape does work on carpets.

, Wipe your feet thoroughly before leaving the room, or use additional drop cloths in other rooms.

, (See ""How to prime and paint"".) Priming is mandatory if you are painting over any non-paint surface, like drywall, unpainted wood, metal, Spackle, wood putty, ink, crayon, mold stains, or even oil paint. It water-seals the surface and also provides a layer that paint can stick to. Water-based paint will not stick to an un-primed layer of oil-based paint. Putting down white primer is a good idea when painting a light color over a dark one, but consider getting your primer tinted if you are painting a dark color over light. You probably don't need primer when repainting, if the older paint is of the same type and not too old. However, you should use a primer if the existing paint is very shiny, as new paint layers do not adhere as well to a glossy finish. Consider a bonding primer for high-gloss walls. When in doubt, use primer! Some specialty paints are self-priming, which may or may not save time depending on the number of coats needed.

,, (See ""How to prime and paint"".) Add as many coats as it takes to make the surface look nice. Higher quality paint often requires fewer layers for an even color.

, Pull the tape off the wall at a 90 degree angle for a clean edge. You may need to re-mask if you are using more than two coats; otherwise, the paint layers may tear in a jagged fashion instead of being cut cleanly by the tape. You can wait until the paint is dry before removing the masking (this is not necessary if you are careful), but for the best cut, don't wait longer than 24 to 48 hours. If the paint has completely dried, the tape will be difficult to remove and may pull paint from the wall underneath.

, The result will probably not be as good as a good masking job, but it will make errors less noticeable.

,,, You may wish to purchase new hardware that matches your new paint colors. If your electrical outlets, covers, and switches are discolored or no longer match, replacements are relatively cheap and easily installed.

You can match the blanket and the pillow as well. For example, you might have two dark red throw pillows on your coach with a crimson blanket folded on the back of the cushions.

, Invest in a set of curtains for rooms with large windows. These are a great way to add a spot of color in the room without purchasing more furniture. Curtains can be patterned or a solid color.Curtains can be bought or you can make your own.


, The inside shelves of bookcases are easy to paint, and they add a bold color effect to a living room, office, or kitchen. Sand the back of the bookshelf, and add a primer. Once the primer has dried, use a mini-foam roller to paint the back of the shelf. Wait six hours, and add another coat. Once it has dried, you can add gloss on top.You can paint each shelf a different shade of the same color to create a varied effect.Instead of painting, you can also wallpaper the inside shelves. Find a wallpaper in a unique print that suits your color choice. Measure the back of each shelf, and cut the wallpaper to size. Paste it on using wallpaper paste. Wait for it to dry completely before putting anything on the self., A cheap and easy way to dress up kitchen cabinets, old dressers, and drawers is to replace the knobs. New knobs can be found at hardware stores, furniture stores, or online. Unscrew the old knobs, and replace them with the new, brightly colored knobs., If you want something bigger that will draw the eye, invest in one large piece of furniture in your color of choice. Place this object near the center of the room where the eye will be drawn to it. Some examples of a statement piece include:A dresser
Desk
Table
Couch
Ottoman
Large piece of framed art
Chandelier or unique light fixture

, A rug will bring attention to a certain corner or the center of the room. Measure the space you want the rug to go before you buy it. Unroll it, and place your furniture on top to create a layered effect.


You can find rugs in a number of bold patterns, such as chevrons, polka dots, stripes, or ombre tones.
Good places to put rugs include under dining tables, in the middle of a living room, in front of doors, and in hallways.

While you may choose to paint an entire room one color, you may also decide to paint a single accent wall with neutral tones throughout the rest of the room. You might also decide to paint your:


Ceiling
Windowsills
Door frames
Alcove or niche, Visit a local hardware or paint store, and pick up a roll of color sample cards. These are colored cardboard that represent the color as it will appear when painted. Take these home, and hold them up to your wall to see how the color appears in the room’s lighting.

, Purchase a small can of test paint, and apply it to a small area in the room of choice. This will allow you to see how the paint appears on your wall before you commit. Wait several days so that you can decide if you like the color.If you are undecided on the color, you can paint multiple test patches next to one another.

, Before you start priming or painting the wall, you should wipe it down first. Use a rag soaked in warm, soapy water, and gently brush it over the wall. Remove any dirt or stains. Let it dry completely before applying primer.

, Tape the edges, moldings, and hardware (like electrical sockets and light switches), and lay a tarp on the ground. Open the can of primer, and stir it with a brush. Using a paintbrush, add a coat of the primer to the walls. This will give your paint job a smooth, professional appearance.Wait for the primer to dry completely before applying paint. This could be several hours or overnight.

, To begin painting, run a paintbrush along the edges of the wall carefully, so that tape does not bleed over the tape. Fill in the middle with a paint roller. Wait until the wall is dry to the touch before applying a second coat. This could be six to eight hours or overnight.Use a wide, straight-edged brush to paint trim, moldings, window sills, and door frames.

You will need to repeat this sequence once for your priming coat, and then as many times as needed to produce a nice color, with your desired paint color.

,
Mix the paint or primer thoroughly.,
Open the can and begin applying it to the walls.,
To apply with a paint roller:,


Dump paint into the roller tray until it is almost full (less if you have a relatively small area to do).,
To apply with a brush:


Dip the brush into the paint can, roller tray, or paper cup.,
Clean baseboards and other surfaces immediately if paint splatters or runs onto them.,
Before moving on to the next area, inspect for drips and wipe up with the brush or roller.,
When finished with your painting session, do not leave your painting tools just lying around!",How to Paint a Room2,", Shake vigorously for 2-3 minutes before opening the can, or use a paint stirrer after opening.

, Work from the top down (e.g. do the ceiling first, then upper woodwork, then walls, then lower woodwork). This enables you to clean up drips from previous stages. If you have a paint roller, do the bulk of a large area before doing the edges. This way you'll minimize the area you need to do with the slower paint brush.

,
Roll the roller to cover all sides. Use the bottom of the tray to force it to rotate if necessary. Try not to submerge the roller enough to get paint on the insider or on the handle.
Move the roller to the surface to be painted without hesitation, to prevent drips. Slowly spinning the roller by turning the handle will also help prevent drips.
Spread the paint around. Don't go too quickly, or centrifugal force will cause the paint to splatter.
Orient the handle to avoid conflicts with nearby surfaces.
Pressing hard while rolling can release paint trapped in the roller, which is useful when you are coming to the end of the job. Avoid letting the roller get too dry; this produces poor coverage.
Don't necessarily worry about getting all the way into corners; this can be done with a brush. But getting as close as you easily can will save time.
To ensure an even coat, after covering a given area with wet paint (say an 8 foot portion), go back over it in a strictly up-and-down motion, with each stroke covering 50% of the area of the previous stroke. This is known as ""laying off"" the paint.
For more detail, see How to Use a Paint Roller.

, (You can use leftover paint in a tray from a previous rolling step, or you can use a tray or cup as an easier way to carry around a small amount of paint while leaving the paint can safely sealed.) Don't dip more than an inch or so; if you go farther than that, you'll just be wasting paint and making it harder to clean your brush later.
Shake your brush off or gently scrape it off against the inside of the rim, to prevent drips.
Move the paint brush to the surface to be painted without hesitation, to prevent drips. Slowly spinning the brush will also help prevent drips.
Start at the top and drag downward.
It's best if you avoid holding your brush such that the bristles are above the handle. Paint will drip off the bristles and onto the handle, and make a mess. This will be unavoidable if you are painting a ceiling, so avoid putting a large amount of paint on your brush at any one time.

, Use a wet sponge or cloth. Paint thinner is needed to clean up oil-based paints. Water will clean up latex paints. Do not let the drip dry!

, Once dried, drips will produce a bump that is difficult to remove.


Completely finish one wall before going to the next wall. When paint is drying, it will dry darker. If you have to go back and touch up because you did not completely finish, the dry (or wet areas depending on the color) will look different and you will end up doing extra touch-up work.

, They will dry out and become useless. After using up as much retained paint as possible, clean your paint applicator (brush, roller, etc.). If you are using water-based paint, put the item under water, squeeze, and shake around. Repeat with clean water and alternate with running under the faucet until the water runs clear. Let the item dry thoroughly before using again. A thorough cleaning and drying cycle prevents older paint colors or water from mixing with your new paint, which will ruin the color or texture. To keep your tools from drying out for short periods, wrap in plastic or keep submerged in the paint. If you are painting with the same color the next day, you can also put your tools in a plastic bag, freeze overnight, and thaw when ready to use. If you cannot clean up properly right away, at least immerse your tools in water so they can be cleaned up later. (Assuming you are using water-based paint.) If you are using oil-based paint, water will not be helpful, and you must use paint thinner to clean your tools and your hands. Several different chemicals can act as paint thinner, but in general it is more annoying to use, produces noxious odors, and is not as nice for the environment.

Remove the rust on the shed.,
Wash the surface of your shed with detergent and water again.",How to Paint a Rusty Metal Shed1," Use a strong spray attachment to remove leaves, dirt and other debris. It is important to clean it to see which areas of the shed have rust.;
, Dirt will hold in moisture and increase rust, so take time when washing your shed. Use a sponge with a soft and abrasive side and then rinse well.

, This type of rust appears quickly after the metal surface is wet. It will damage the metal if not treated immediately.

, Wash it and apply some paint thinner with a rag to remove any flash rust spots.

, Use a putty knife to apply the auto body filler and swipe it until it is almost even with the shed's metal surface. Allow it to dry completely.

, There are a number of methods that can be used. Choose depending upon available materials and the quantity of rust.


Buy a wire brush attachment for your power drill, if you have rust patches, instead of rust all over the shed.






Employ a belt sander and orbital sander to remove rust on many surfaces and corners. Use fine grit sandpaper so that you do not damage the integrity of weakened surfaces. Most people who are repainting metal sheds will need to do some sanding. Although you can sand by hand, it will save time by using power tools.






Rent a hand held sandblaster for big jobs. This device uses compressed air to blow fine sand over the surface of the shed. It has the same effect of sanding, but is very efficient. Make sure to lay drop cloths over plants and objects. Sandblasting is extremely effective for metal scroll work and smaller, hard to reach surfaces, as well as long flat surfaces.






Use a combination of any of the above methods according to what is the most effective. Remember that areas with auto body filler will also need to be sanded to ensure the paint will stick to the surface.







, This will remove sand and dirt particles that have accumulated. Allow it to dry completely before starting to paint.


If it is a manageable size, dry it with some rags to decrease the likelihood of flash rust.

It is usually best to use semi-gloss paint. Most people use the same paint for chair rails that is used around window and door trim. The paint store can help you with how much paint you should buy.;
, This will serve to catch any dust while you are sanding and drips of paint when you are painting.

, If there seems to be a lot of dust on the chair rail, you may want to clean it well before using the sandpaper.

, The painter's tape will allow you to paint a perfectly straight line. You can seal the edges of the painter's tape by going over the tape with a putty knife. You do this to keep paint from getting up under the tape.

, Most paint stores will give you a paint stirrer for this purpose.

, Check that the type of paint brush you are using works with the type of paint you use.

,, Apply the paint evenly and smoothly. It will not hurt if you get paint on the painter's tape.

, Carefully remove the painter's tape and discard.

For example, look for burnt orange and dark brown pieces of suns and animals. You should also avoid items with a gloss. The more home-crafted it looks, the better.This type of terracotta pairs well with brightly painted walls and colorful tapestries. Try placing these pieces in a room with an azure blue accent wall or in a dining area with a hand woven rug.
;
, Go for terracotta with painted designs or engravings. Look for large vases with brightly colored gloss. Often times, these items will appear rustic with chipping paint and rough patches. You can also find intricate pitchers, bowls, and Tuscan or Greek inspired pottery.If you have any mosaic tile in your home, especially in blues and whites, Mediterranean inspired terracotta is an ideal accent.

, If you can't decide on one style or another, try picking a few pieces from each. For example, the dark, rough-edged terracotta of a Southwestern-inspired candleholder can be a great contrast to the glossy finish of Mediterranean pottery. You can also try matching color palettes to help mesh the style. Pair a light orange vase with a rustic pink statue.

, Terracotta vases come in a multitude of styles and sizes. Go for a large Grecian urn or a small Navajo inspired pot and put them alongside a side table. Or pair a painted, mosaic style pitcher with a burnished clay bowl. Set these items alongside your doorway. You can even fill them full of sprawling vines, small succulents, or umbrellas., A subtle way to work in terracotta is through light fixtures. Not only is it practical, but it's a decor piece that can add a rustic feel without overtaking a room. Try an engraved sconce with simple geometric patterns. Or, make a statement with something figurative and playful, like Kokopelli or a sun face.


If you have a minimalistic room or a space with very little decorating area, try brightly painted terracotta sconces to add a pop of color and design.

, Place traditional Navajo or Mayan clay masks alongside family portraits or paintings. These rough, hand-made items work as a great contrast next to sleek modern picture frames. You can also try hanging brightly painted suns and stars from Mexico next to black and white photos to bring in pops of color.

, Whether you are growing vegetables, flowers, or a myriad of other greenery, terracotta statues can add a point of interest to any garden. For example, add a trio of medium sized terracotta fish to a bed of lavender or geraniums. Not only will the burnt-orange pop against the purple of the flowers, but the fish will appear to be swimming.


Or, instead of a garden gnome, set a small terracotta warrior to stand guard next to your tomatoes or spiraling cucumbers.

, When looking to add flower pots to your deck or patio, trade in the stone or porcelain for terracotta. Not only does terracotta breath easier, but the porosity of the clay allows moisture to penetrate the pot, giving your plants lots of much-needed nutrients. If you have a cement patio or light colored wooden deck, try the traditional orange colored pots. Put them in corners or along stairs. On the other hand, if you have a darker colored deck, try a painted terracotta in a distressed white or cream.Fill these up with flowers of contrasting colors like blues, purples, and yellows.
You don’t have to stick with the traditional smooth terracotta planter either, go for pots that mimic Grecian urns and are carved into intricate patterns.

, An easy design trick is making outdoor collages or murals with miniature planters. Line these pots up in large geometric patterns like squares, circles, or even stars. You can place them on fences around pools or yards, or even on the back wall of your home. Leave them with their common orange color or paint them different shades to stand out against their backdrop. For example, if you have a white picket fence, use the reddish hues of the pots to create a striking pattern that you can see from far away.


Fill these pots with either flowers or herbs!

Paint the trim.",How to Paint a House," It's important to take the time of year into account when painting the exterior of your home, as very cold (below 40 degrees F) or very hot temperatures can ruin your paint job.


Therefore, the best time to paint your house is in late spring or early autumn. Also remember to check the weather forecast to make sure there is no rain promised for the days you choose to paint.;
, If you're lucky, the only real preparation you'll need to do before the paint job is to clean the surface of your house. Use a hose to wash down the walls and go over any stubborn dirt with a wire brush and some warm soapy water.


Alternatively, a power washer can be used to clean particularly stubborn dirt and remove paint flecks. Just be careful not to cause any damage to the home by setting the spray too high.
Remember to wash from top to bottom, and allow the surface adequate time to dry thoroughly before proceeding with the paint job.

, If there is any old, defective paint on the surface of your house, you will need to remove it before you can proceed. This includes any paint that is loose, blistered or chipped.


Failing to remove the old, chipped paint before you begin will prevent the fresh paint from properly adhering to the surface of the house.
Use a wire brush or paint scraper to knock any loose paint free from the surface of the house and use a power sander (or a piece of sandpaper wrapped around a wooden block) to smooth any rough surfaces.
If there are any heavy deposits of old paint that need to be removed, you may need to use an electric paint remover, which essentially melts the paint and then pulls it from the wall.

, Before you begin painting, you will also need to inspect your house for damage and make any necessary repairs. It may seem like an effort, but it will ensure that you're house looks its best once the paint job is complete.


Walk around the periphery of the house and look for split shingles and siding, rust, mildew, popped nails. Don't just look at the exterior walls, also examine under the eaves and around the foundation. Pay attention to areas around windows and doors where old caulk or putty may be missing or needing replacement.
Any rust will need to be removed and mildew will need to be scrubbed away. Cracked siding will need to be filled and sanded, loose caulking or split shingles will have to be replaced and leaky gutters and downspouts will need to be repaired., It's a good idea to figure out how much paint you're going to need before you begin painting. This eliminates the risk of running out of paint halfway through.


To estimate the amount of paint you'll need, measure the perimeter of the house and the height of the house (excluding any gable ends) and multiply them by each other.
Divide this number by the square foot coverage indicated on the can of paint you plan to use. This will give you the quantity of paint (in gallons) you will need for a single coat. However, it is a good idea to add an extra gallon to that number for safety.
To calculate the amount of extra paint needed for any gable ends, measure the width and height of the gable end, multiply these numbers, then divide by 2. This will give you the gable's square-foot dimensions, which you can then include in your paint estimations.
Keep in mind that certain exterior wall surfaces - such as shingles, masonry and stucco - may need 10% to 15% more paint than smooth, flat walls with the same square footage.
The application method may also affect the type of paint you need - airless sprayers may require up to twice as much paint (for the same wall dimensions) as brushes or rollers.

, In some circumstances, you will need to apply a coat of primer to the surface of your house before you can begin painting. Primer provides a good foundation for the paint and will help it to last longer, as it provides extra protection from the elements.


You will need to apply primer to certain distressed areas of the house, especially if your prep work exposed any raw wood or bare metal, or if you scraped away a lot of loose paint.
You will also need to apply primer if you are painting new wood for the first time, or if you are drastically changing the color of your home.
The type of primer you use will depend on the type of paint. If you plan on using latex paint, you will need latex primer. If you plan on using solvent-thinned paint, you will need a solvent-base primer, and if you use metal paint, you will need a metal primer.

, Choose a high quality exterior paint, such as 100 percent acrylic latex. This will produce a better color, dry faster and be more durable in the long run.


Look for paint with a higher percentage of volume solids, and opt for cans labelled ""premium"" or ""super-premium"" rather than choosing budget brands.
Also put some thought into the color you choose for your house. Take the style of your home into account and make sure the paint color complements the roof material and any brick or stone accents.
Consider getting samples of your top colors and painting swathes on an obscured portion of your home. Take a couple of days to see how each of the samples look in different lights and decide which ones you prefer., If you bought several cans of paint, you will need to mix all of the paint from individual cans together in one large container.


This is due to the fact that the color of different batches of paint can vary slightly, even if it's meant to be the same. Mixing them together ensures an even color.
Hold on to the original paint cans though. That way, if you have any paint left over you can pour it back into the original cans and reseal it.
At this point you should also cover the area around your home with drop cloths, to prevent any paint from getting on sidewalks or landscaping.

, Whether you use a brush, roller or paint sprayer to paint your house is ultimately a matter of personal preference. Each method has its benefits - using a brush gives you greater control over the painting, using a roller makes the job more efficient, and using a paint sprayer provide heavier coverage.



Using a brush: Many people who are painting their homes for the first time prefer to use a brush, as it forces you to be very thorough and gives you control over every square inch of the house. To use: dip your brush into the paint until the bristles are halfway covered. Touch the brush against the wall at several points across a horizontal line. Go back and paint back and forth to fill in the empty spots and provide even coverage.

Using a Roller: To use a roller, roll it in the paint until all sides are evenly covered, then apply the paint to the wall using criss-cross strokes. Then, go back and paint over the same section using up and down strokes to fill in the gaps.

Using a paint sprayer: To use a paint sprayer, load your chosen paint into the sprayer. Hold the sprayer upright, about 1 foot (0.3 m) away from the wall. Move the sprayer smoothly back and forth, beginning the motion prior to pulling the trigger to avoid areas of heavy deposits of paint. Make sure each new stroke overlaps the previous one by about 8 inches (20.3 cm).

Using the spray and back-roll technique: The spray and back-rolling technique is a particular method recommended for both its speed and evenness of coverage, but it requires two people. It involves one person using a sprayer to quickly coat the wall in paint, and the other person following behind with a roller to spread and even it.

, Paint all of the sidings on your house before you work on the trim. This gets the bulk of the work out of the way, and also speeds up the process as you won't need to switch between colors. When painting your sidings (or whatever material covers the main exterior of your home) there are several rules you should adhere to:



Work from top to bottom. Always work from top to bottom and from left to right when painting. Working from top to bottom allows you to cover up any drips of paint that fall as you work your way down, while going from left to right helps you to quickly identify any spots you might have missed (this is related to the fact that you read from left to right, so your brain is programmed to process information better this way).

Follow the sun. Try to plan your paint job so you are following the sun throughout the day, waiting until the morning sun has dried any night-time moisture from the walls. You want to work in the shade throughout the day, away from direct sunlight, as this can affect the quality of the final result.

Be careful using a ladder. It is important to be very careful when using ladders, especially extendable ones. You should never reach more than an arm's length away when standing on a ladder. Instead, you should paint in a horizontal strip as far as you can reach, then move the ladder across to continue painting along the same line. Make sure that your ladder doesn't tilt from side to side, and that it's resting on even ground about 1/4 of its total length away from the foundation of the house., Once you have waited the recommended amount of time for the paint to dry, you should consider applying a second coat - if time and budget allows.


A second coat will even out the paint and provide more protective coverage for your home. It will help the finished product to look better and last longer.
If you have chosen a more vibrant color for your home, a second coat will often be necessary to really bring life to the color.

, Once the sidings are complete it's time to go back and paint the trim, whether it's the same color as the rest of the house or not. This is can be quite time-consuming, but will really give your paint job a professional-looking finish.


A brush is normally recommended for painting the sidings, as it allows you to be precise however a small 6-inch roller can help to speed up the process, especially on fascia and window sills.
As with painting the sidings, you should work on painting the trim from top to bottom - start with any gables and dormers, then do eaves and gutters, then do second-story windows, first-story windows, doors and finally the foundations.
When painting the windows, you should protect the glass from paint splatters by covering with masking tape or using a paint shield.
Pay special attention to window sills when painting, as these bear the brunt of bad weather and can look more worn than other areas. If necessary give them 2 or 3 coats of paint and don't forget to paint the undersides.
It is easier to paint doors if you remove any knobs, knockers and numbers first. Ideally, you should also remove the door from its hinges and lay it flat on the ground before painting, working first on one side, then the other. This will also make it easier to paint he frame and door jambs."

Repaint your garage door every 3-5 years.",How to Paint a Garage Door," Climate conditions can have a big impact on the quality of exterior paint, especially when it’s fresh. Try to schedule your project for a stretch that’s not too hot, cold or humid. Be particularly wary of precipitation, as excess moisture can easily undo all of your hard work.The next couple of days after you paint should also be clear in order to give new paint a chance to set properly.
Weekends are an ideal time for painting a garage door, as you’ll have more time on your hands and won’t need to come and go as often.;
, Gently wipe away any caked-on dust, dirt or grime clinging to the outer surface of the door. Scrub from top to bottom, side-to-side, and don’t neglect the corners. A filthy garage door will be harder to paint, and may result in a sloppy, uneven finish.Though some professionals swear by certain specialty cleaning products, the best way to do this is simply to use a sponge or cloth soaked in soapy water.Rinse the door with a hose and blot it dry with a clean towel prior to painting. Never apply fresh paint to a wet surface.

, Before you begin painting, make sure the area beneath the garage door is covered on both sides. A dropcloth or plastic tarp will help prevent stains from dripping or splattering paint. It will also be useful for catching dirt and other debris that’s loosened from the door.If you don’t have a dropcloth or tarp, an old blanket or a few sheets of overlapping newspaper will also do the trick.

, Use painter’s tape to cover any spots where paint might be spread accidentally, like the edges of the door where it meets house or surrounding brick or stucco. This can save you a lot of scouring and scraping later on should your painting project get a little messy.Line up the tape with care and accuracy. Otherwise, you could end up with uneven edges.
Look for wide rolls of tape to provide the maximum margin of error.

, Shop around for paints in different colors that you think might suit your garage door. Be sure to only look at paints that are specially formulated for exterior use. For most garage doors, lighter shades like white, beige or pearl will work best because they won’t fade as much in the sunlight.In general, it’s a good idea to match the color of the garage door to the color of the house itself. A contrasting trim color will create the look of depth around the door.Stick to a color that’s similar to the one you’ve been using, or take the opportunity to explore new tones that change the overall aesthetic of your home., The primer will both provide a flat base for the paint and make for greater durability, allowing it to hold better over time. You’ll only need to use one thin coat of primer. Make sure the primer is dry to the touch before you attempt to paint over it.Those who are planning on touching up their garage doors in the same shade can dispense with a separate coat of primer. It may be helpful, however, to purchase a paint that includes a built-in primer to ensure the color comes out the way it’s supposed to.
Allow the primer to dry for at least 12 hours.

, Begin by painting the hard to reach recessed portions of the panels with a handheld brush. The narrow width and manual control offered by the brush will enable you to penetrate deeper into crevices and molded depressions. Work slowly and carefully, painting each of the inner panels one by one.Look over the door to make sure you haven’t missed any thin or bare spots.
Depending on the color and general condition of your garage door, you may need to use multiple coats to achieve a solid finish.

, After you’ve painted the recessed inner panels, use a wide paint roller to cover the broad outer surface of the door. Painting with a roller is quick and painless compared to manual brushing. A roller also guarantees a consistent finish, and won’t leave behind any visible strokes or seams. Paint with long, steady motions, overlapping the rough edges of each stripe.For most basic paint jobs, a single coat of paint will usually be enough. If you're switching to a bolder shade or painting a lighter color over a darker one, it may be necessary to use multiple coats in order to get the color to show up.
Let each coat dry for roughly 12 hours before applying additional coats.
Set the door’s action to manual and raise or lower it as needed to paint a specific area. This will prevent the discomfort of being forced to crouch, stoop and stand repeatedly., Plan on allotting at least one full day for the paint to dry to the touch. During this time, it’s best to leave the door in a closed (down) position so that it can receive plenty of airflow. Resist the urge to touch the drying paint, and keep cars, bicycles, tools and toys at a safe distance.Though the paint will usually harden to the touch in a matter of hours, it may take as long as a week for it to completely cure.
It may be necessary to park your car outside while the garage door is drying.

, When the garage door starts to show dust or dirt, simply wet a sponge or washcloth with warm water and wipe it down. The flat, smooth paneling of most garage doors make them a breeze to clean, especially if you’ve used a semigloss latex or enamel paint.When left untreated, dirt can eat away at a coat of paint, causing it to crack and fade.
Avoid using cleaning products that contain harsh chemicals, as these can damage the paint.

, Even if you’ve recently painted your garage door, harsh weather and other environmental factors can quickly do a number on it. Get in the habit of eyeing your garage door every so often and looking for areas that may need refreshing. Go over these areas with a little bit of fresh paint to keep the door in good shape from top to bottom.Keep additional paint on hand for occasional touch ups and minor repairs.

, No matter how good a job you do, your garage door will inevitably need a new coat of paint. When you think it’s time, repeat the process to restore the door’s color and luster. Maintaining a protective layer of paint is key to extending the lifespan of your home’s garage door.People who live in dry, temperate climates may be able to get away with going a little longer between paint jobs.
Repainting your garage door should become a part of the routine maintenance and upkeep of your home.

Paint some designs onto the mailbox.",How to Paint a Mailbox," It should be screwed on. Be sure to save the screws some place safe so that you can reattach the mailbox later. If you cannot remove the mailbox, you will need to cover the post or the surrounding wall with some masking paper and painters tape.;
, This includes the numbers, flag, hook, and latch. If you can't remove them, then leave them on for now.

, Spray the mailbox down with an all-purpose cleaner an scrub it well with a scrubbing sponge. This will remove all dirt, oils and dust.If you are planning on repainting the post, you will need to clean that too.

, If you cleaned the post, be sure to rinse it too.

, If you are working on a wooden post, you might use a flat, sanding sponge. You can also use an electrical sander on the post to get the job done faster. This will give you a smooth, clean surface to work on.


If you see any rust on the flag, latch, or hook, be sure to clean it off too.

, If you don't do this, this dust will get caught in the paint, and give you an uneven, grainy finish.

, If you weren't able to remove the hook or latch, cover them with painters tape. If you weren't able to remove the flag, wrap it with a plastic bag; secure the plastic bag with some painters tape., Choose a dry, windless day to prime and paint your mailbox. If it is too damp or humid, the paint may not cure properly. If it is too windy, dust and debris can get caught in the paint.


Paint will dry the fastest on a hot, dry day.

, The best place to work would be outside. If you cannot work outdoors, then be sure to leave a window open so that you do not get a headache.


If you get a headache while painting at any time, step away from your project and take a back. Return to your project once the headache goes away.

, Choose an outdoor quality spray paint primer that is intended for metal. It does not matter what color your use, but a medium grey seems to give you the most neutral base to work on. Hold the can 6 to 8 inches (c to c centimeters) away from the surface, and apply the paint using light, even strokes. Spray using a side-to-side motion. Over lap each stroke by a little bit; this will help prevent any gaps.If you are planning on painting something that is currently covered up (like the flag) wait until you are completely done priming and painting the mailbox.
Paint the entire mailbox first, then open the flap and paint the rim that's normally covered up by the flap. Wait until the paint dries before you close the flap, or it will get glued shut.If you weren't able to remove the flag, you will have to paint around the flag. Do this by painting the mailbox, then moving the flag, and painting the bare patch that was underneath., Not only does this give you a smoother finish, but it prevents any drips and puddles.

, Choose an outdoor quality spray paint that is meant for metal. Hold the can 6 to 8 inches (c to c centimeters) away from the surface, apply a light, even coat using a side-to-side motion. Overlap each stroke by a little to prevent any gaps.As before, paint the mail box once with the flap closed, and once with the flap open. Never close the flap while the paint is wet, or it will get stuck.
If you left the flag on, remember to move the flag up and down as you paint, so that you get the areas under it.

, If you don't wait for the paint to dry, it may not cure properly, and result in a sticky, tacky finish.

, Spray them with your primer first. Once the primer dries, apply your outdoor spray paint. You can match the color to your mailbox, of you can experiment with different colors. For example, if you painted your mailbox white, try painting the latches and hooks black, and the flag a bright red.If the parts are loose, simply set them down onto a plastic tablecloth or masking paper. Be sure to flip them over so that you can get the back too.
If the parts are still on the mailbox, then pull off any painters tape and plastic bags. Make sure that the paint on the mailbox is dry, then wrap the mailbox in masking paper or plastic, but leave the hooks, latches, and flag exposed. Wait until the paint dries before removing the paper/plastic from your mailbox.

, Just because a paint is dry to the touch does not necessarily mean that it is fully cured and dry underneath. Refer to the label on your paint can for specific drying times. Some paints require only 2 to 4 hours to dry and cure, while others may need anywhere from 6 to 72 hours.


Keep in mind that both temperature and humidity levels will affect drying times. Paint will dry faster when the air is dry, and it will dry slower when the air is humid.

, Get out the screws from before, and screw everything back on tightly.

, Make sure that it is facing the right way and hanging straight., This will make it easier to paint it. Most numbers can be just unscrewed. If they were hammered into the post, you might have to pry them off; keep in mind that if you pry the numbers off, you might bend them. If that happens, you will have to get new ones., This will not only remove any mold, moss, and mildew, but it will also give you a smoother surface to work on., You can use wood filler or paste. Smooth the paste down using your fingers. If the paste is too sticky and grainy, dip your finger in water, and try smoothing it down again. You don't have to do this, but it will give you a smoother finish.

, Use a large paintbrush or a foam roller to apply an outdoor quality primer. This will give you a smoother surface to work on. Wait for the first coat to dry before applying a second one.

, You can use a large paintbrush or a foam roller to do this. Apply the paint using long, even strokes.

, Sometimes, one coat will be enough, but you might need a few more in order to get enough coverage. Allow each coat to dry before applying another one.

, You can leave them as they were, or you can update them with a new look. Prime the numbers using an outdoor quality spray paint primer that's intended for metal. Once the primer dries, apply an outdoor quality spray paint. You can use any color you want, but a contrasting color might make them more visible., Just because a paint feels dry does not mean that it is fully dry underneath. Check the label on your paint can for exact drying times. Some paints require only 2 to 4 hours to dry and cure, while others require anywhere from 6 to 72 hours.

, If the letters were screwed in, simply place them back on the post and put the screws back in. If the letters were hammered in, you might remember how difficult it was to remove them. To prevent this from happening again, consider getting some screws, and screwing them in instead.

, You can leave it blank, or you can add some designs onto here. This section will give you a few ideas. You don't have to use all of them; just choose the ones you like the most.


Make sure what you are using an outdoor quality paint.
When you are finished painting your design, consider letting the paint dry, then spraying the mailbox with a clear, outdoor sealer. This will help protect your beautiful work.

, This works great on white mailboxes. Choose some paint in bright colors, then ask your family members to write their names on the mailbox. If you want, they can even leave behind handprints or a little drawing.

, If you are using adhesive stencils, simply place them down onto the mailbox where you want the designs to go. If you are using non-adhesive stencils, then secure them using painters tape. Apply the paint using a foam brush or a stencil brush. You can also use spray paint instead. Whatever paint you choose to use, make sure that it is outdoor quality. Once you are done, pull the stencil off and let the paint dry.


Consider using a color that contrasts with your mailbox; this will make the designs more visible. For example, if your mailbox is black, try using white for the stenciled part.

, For example, the body of the mailbox can be one color, and the flap can be another. This will add some visual interest to your mailbox.

, You can use the same color as the rest of your mailbox, or a contrasting color to make it more interesting.

, You can paint them directly using a paintbrush, or you can sketch the design out first with a pencil, and then paint over that. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Paint something garden related, such as butterflies, ladybugs, tulips, daffodils, or ivy.
Paint some random designs, such as spirals and swirls.
If you like animals, you can paint your favorite animal, or animals commonly found in gardens, such as birds, frogs, and squirrels.
Paint the mailbox to look like something different, such as a cat, cow, or dog (the flap of the mailbox becomes the mouth). You can even paint it to look like a bus, barn, house, or anything else that has a similar shape.

, You should dig down below the frost line, which is usually about 1 foot (or 30 cm) down. If building a retaining wall on a slope, make sure the bottom of your hole is flat.

, These pieces will make a form to stretch around the whole area of your wall.

, These will serve to spread out the concrete to prevent cracking.

, Make sure it lies level. Secure it the ground with stakes or other weights. It should be secure enough to remain solid when stood upon. Concrete is brittle, like toast. ideally wire a mesh to give flexible strength.

, The type and quantity of concrete mix will depend on the size and nature of your wall.

,


Keep a fresh batch of concrete mix ready as you go along. Pour concrete as quickly and evenly as you can so that no part of the wall dries much before any other.

Don’t use any cleaning products. You might damage the wood, but you’ll definitely make the staining process more difficult.;
, Run your hand over the furniture to find any rough spots in the wood. If they need to be sanded down to match the rest of the surface, use this sandpaper to do so. While sanding, check often to make sure the spot is even with the rest of the wood., Before staining, you’ll want to make sure the surface is even and prepared to absorb wood stain. Sand the entirety of the surface until it becomes even and smooth to the touch.

Sand along the grain or you risk scratching the wood.
Wipe any wood dust off with a dry rag before proceeding., Use a foam brush to cover the wood in sealer. This will make the surface smoother and will give the wood stain better grip.

If you want a lighter color, you can dilute the sealer with mineral spirits., Once the sealer has started to dry, use a clean cloth to wipe off any sealer that’s still pooled atop the wood. This will prevent blotches and spots from forming on the wood. It’ll also keep the surface smooth., It should only take a few hours for the sealer to dry completely., You should sand the surface a few times before proceeding. This will smooth out any spots where the sealer might not have dried evenly.

Use a rag to wipe off any residue after sanding., You can use a variety of tools to do this. A foam or bristle brush will do fine, but you can also use a cloth dipped in stain to color your teak furniture. Apply an even coat all over.

If there are any parts of the furniture you don’t want to stain, use masking tape to protect them., Use a clean dry rag to wipe off excess stain. Use a rag you don’t mind dirtying; the wood stain would be incredibly difficult to wash out.

The longer you leave on the stain before wiping, the darker the color., The amount of time it takes for the stain to completely dry will depend on how thick of a layer you used. Avoid touching the stain too much if it’s still wet; you might end up with an uneven, blotchy coat., After the first coat has dried, take a moment to see if you’re satisfied with the color. If you want your furniture to be darker, you can add another coat of wood stain, right on top of the previous layer, following the same process., Use a clean brush to paint on the finish once you’ve gotten the desired color. After applying the finish, make sure to give it plenty of time to dry. There are three main types of finish, each with their own characteristics:

Oil finishes look closest to wood, but aren’t the best for protecting wood. Avoid using this kind of finish on outdoor furniture.
Lacquer strike a good balance between attractive finish and durability, but require multiple coats.
Polyurethane finishes are the most protective of the three, even repelling water."

Lay out the area of concrete to be cut.,
Use a 15-amp circular saw with a diamond or abrasive blade to cut a depth of 2 inches (50.8 mm).,
Employ a gasoline or electric powered cut-off saw to get the job done when working with concrete deeper than 4 inches (101.6 mm).,
Follow the same steps as you did in the use of a circular saw and identify your starting point.",How to Cut Concrete,"


You need to use a chalk line and box to mark a straight line on the concrete. This is the area to be cut.;
, This works particularly well when working with a sidewalk.


Set the blade depth of your circular saw at 2 inches (50.8 mm).
Begin cutting at the edge of the concrete and slowly follow the line you have laid out with your chalk line. I have found keeping the blade wet by pouring water on it as you cut reduces dust and helps keep the blade cooler.
This depth of cut will give you a straight edge scoring the concrete to finish breaking the remaining depth and a straight edge at the top to tie in with fresh concrete.

,


The cut-off saw allows you to penetrate to a depth of 6 inches (152.4 mm).
Most driveways, housing slabs and basement or concrete retainer walls are in this range.

,


Cut concrete to the correct depth.
Proceed slowly, maintaining minimum RPMs of the cut-off saw. Slow speed allows the saw to keep from overheating the blade and causing shrapnel-like pieces to be tossed into the air from a broken blade.
If you have helpers, have them keep the chalk line free of concrete dust made by the saw cut.

Familiarize yourself with how concrete volume is measured.,
Break your concrete project up into different rectangular prisms.,
Calculate the volume of each prism.,
Convert all measurements to the same units.,
Find the volume of the prism using the formula: Volume = Length * Width * Height.,
Convert the volume into cubic yards or cubic meters as needed.,
Find additional prism volumes as above.,
Calculate the volume of any irregularly-shaped forms.,
Buy a little more concrete than you need.,
Convert your volume figure to weight, if necessary.",How to Figure Concrete Yardage1," Concrete's volume (the amount of physical space it takes up) is typically measured in either cubic yards (yds3) or cubic meters (m3). A cubic yard is a 3-dimensional cube that is 3 feet long in each dimension, while a cubic meter is a cube that is 1 meter long in each dimension.


Typically, bags of dry concrete mix will specify the volume of ""wet"" concrete each bag will make when properly mixed with water. Below are rough estimates for how many bags of dry concrete mix it takes to make one cubic meter of wet concrete:40 kg bag: 56 bags to make 1 cubic meter
32 kg bag: 71 "" "" "" 1 cubic meter
26 kg bag: 86 "" "" "" 1 cubic meter

;
, Compared to other 3-D shapes, a rectangular prism's volume is relatively easy to calculate, so, if possible, it is best to break your entire project up into one or more rectangular prisms. For example, if your project calls for you to pour a single rectangular slab-on-grade, that slab would be your only prism. However, if you need to pour a slab along with 4 straight walls, each wall would be its own prism, resulting in a total of 5 prisms.


A rectangular prism is a three-dimensional shape with six faces, all of which are rectangles; opposite faces in a rectangular prism are parallel to each other.In layman's terms, a rectangular prism can be thought of as any ""boxy"" shape with straight edges.

, A rectangular prism's volume can be found by multiplying its length times its width times its height. For example, in the next few steps, let's imagine that we're pouring a slab that is 10 feet (3.05 m) long, 12 feet wide (3.66 m), and 4 inches (10.16 cm) deep.

, Our slab's length and width are given in feet and meters, but its height is given in inches and centimeters. For our volume equation to work, all measurements must be in the same units, so we must convert. Since there are 12 inches per foot, we should divide our inch value by 12 to get a value for feet. The slab is 4 / 12 = 0.33 feet deep.


To convert from centimeters to meters, simply divide a centimeter value by 100. A slab that is 10.16 cm deep is 10.16 / 100 = 0.10 meters deep. To convert back to centimeters, multiply by 100.

, Multiply the 3 dimensions together to arrive at the prism's volume. In our example, the slab's volume is 10 ft × 12 ft × 0.33 ft = 39.6 cubic feet.


To find the metric equivalent, we use our meter measurements instead of our feet measurements. 3.05 m × 3.66 m × 0.10 m = 1.12 cubic meters.

, The slab's volume above is expressed as 39.6 cubic feet, but, unfortunately, concrete is usually measured in cubic yards. There are 27 cubic feet in a cubic yard, so, to convert to cubic yards, we can divide by our cubic feet value by 27. The slab's volume is 39.6 / 27 = 1.47 cubic yards. Alternatively, since there are three feet in a yard, you can divide each individual foot measurement by 3 to get yard values and then multiply these together to get the same answer.


Concrete is also often measured in cubic meters. In our example problem, we already found this value. However, in the case that you need to convert between cubic yards and cubic meters, know that:

1 cubic yard = 0.764554858 cubic meters
1 cubic meter = 1.30795062 cubic yards



, If you have more than one prism in your concrete pour, calculate each one's volume individually using the above method. Finally, add all of the volumes together to arrive at your total volume for your project. Be careful that none of your prisms overlap, or you will end up counting some of the concrete twice, which can lead to you buying more than you need.

, Not every concrete job can be easily split up into rectangular prisms. If you have a spread footing in your concrete design, for example, you can't accurately approximate its shape using rectangular prisms. To find the volume of an irregular form, first find the area of a cross-section of the form. Then, multiply that area times the length of the form. For example, if a spread footing is 3 yards (2.74 m) long and has a cross-sectional area of 0.25 square yards (0.21 square meters), then the volume is 3 × 0.25 = 0.75 cubic yards (or 2.74 × 0.21 = 0.58 cubic meters).


Additionally, some common non-rectangular shapes have convenient equations to find their volume. Below are a few of the most common:

Cylinders: Volume = (Pi)r2 × h, where ""r"" is the radius of the circle at either end of the cylinder and ""h"" is the height of the cylinder.
Triangular Prisms : Volume = 1/2bh1 × l, where ""b"" is the length of the base of one of the triangular faces, ""h1"" is its height, and ""l"" is the length of the prism.
Spheres: Volume = (4/3)(Pi)r3, where ""r"" is the radius of the circle that represents the sphere's circumference. While it's unlikely that you'll ever have to pour a perfect sphere, note that many dome-like shapes are just spheres cut in half.



, A good rule of thumb is to add 5 to 10 percent to your figured volume to account for spillage, waste, or over-excavation. Because you can't reasonably expect to use your concrete with 100 percent efficiency, be sure to order more than you actually need. For instance, if you have figured a total volume of 20 cubic yards (15.3 cubic meters), then you should order 1.05 × 20 = 21 cubic yards (or 1.05 × 15.3 = 16.1 cubic meters).


If you are pouring steel-reinforced concrete, the steel reinforcing will displace some of your concrete's volume. Usually, you don't need to consider this in your calculations. This will keep your figures on the conservative side.

, Truck-mixed concrete is sold by volume, but bags of concrete mix are sold in retail establishments by weight. Often, dry mix will have information on the bag indicating the ""wet"" weight or volume each bag produces. Concrete weighs about 4000 pounds per cubic yard (2400 kg per cubic meter). So, if you need 2 cubic yards (1.53 cubic meters) of concrete, then you need (2 * 4000) or 8000 pounds, or (1.53 * 2400) or 3672 kg of concrete. As noted above, buying more dry concrete mix than is needed is usually much safer than buying less concrete mix than is needed - unused mix can always be used in the future.

Ensure your concrete pour is a rectangular prism.,
Find the square footage of the area you're pouring.,
Divide your square footage by a numerical coefficient.,
Determine odd coefficients manually.",How to Figure Concrete Yardage2," Contractors have devised a quick, easy system of determining how much concrete yardage is needed for a given pour. This method doesn't require you to use any volume equations - however, there are two stipulations for its use. First, it only works for rectangular prisms (basic ""box-shaped"" pours). This method is easiest for relatively shallow pours, but it's possible for all rectangular prisms. Second, it requires that your pour area's length, and width measurements be in feet and that its depth measurement be in inches. To convert any of your measurements to feet, use the conversion factors below:


1 yard = 3 feet
12 inches = 1 foot
1 meter = 3.28 feet
30.48 centimeters = 1 foot

, Square footage (written ""sq. ft"" or ft2) is a measure of 2-dimensional area typically used to describe floor space. To determine your concrete job's square footage, simply multiply the length and width of the area you're pouring into without taking into account its depth.


For example, let's say we're pouring into a rectangular prism that is 10 ft wide, 5 feet long, and 6 inches (0.5 feet) deep. Its square footage would be 10 × 5 = 50 sq. feet. We don't need to worry about its depth yet.
Remember, this method only works for rectangular prisms. In other words, your pour area must have straight vertical edges.

, Now that you've found your square footage, all you need to do to find your project's concrete yardage is to divide the square footage by a certain number - the thicker your project, the smaller the number; the thinner your project, the larger the number. Below are coefficients for a few common thicknesses. If your project's thickness isn't listed below, don't worry - you'll learn how to easily figure out your coefficient in the next step.


If your project is 4 inches thick, divide your square footage by 81 to determine your yardage.
If your project is 6 inches thick, "" "" "" "" "" 54.
If your project is 8 inches thick, "" "" "" "" "" 40.
If your project is 12 inches (1 foot) thick, "" "" "" "" "" 27.

, If the thickness of your concrete pour doesn't match any of the examples above, you can quickly calculate it by dividing 324 by the thickness of your concrete project (in inches). Then, divide your square footage by your answer to find your project's yardage.


For example, let's say our 50 sq. ft concrete pour is 7 inches deep. We would find our concrete yardage as follows:

324/7 = 46.28
50/46.28 = 1.08 cubic yards.

Leave the form work used to create the concrete formation.,
Use ponding, which as illustrated in the photo above, is done by forming a dam wall of sand around the concrete formation and then flooding with water.,
Spray water onto the formation.,
Use some sort of cover that holds and retains sprayed on water, like a sand layer or hessian.,
Use a plastic shield, which basically is a plastic sheet laid on top of the slab to stop the evaporation process.,
Use concrete curing oils or curing compounds.",How to Cure Concrete," The form work itself, if left in place, or on the underneath of a suspended slab, or around a concrete column will stop the concrete drying out too quickly, and so can be said to be a curing agent.;
, This method has the following disadvantages:


It takes a fair bit of work to do, and then quite often a breach occurs and the water runs off the slab.
Usually this can only be done for a few days as it inhibits other work and the pressure is usually on to get the walls up.
A possible drawback of this method, especially if soil or clay is used, is the chance of staining the concrete.

, A simpler way is to just keep water sprayed onto the slab with garden sprinklers or hand held hose pipes. Following are some disadvantages that you need to consider if you intend to use this method:


This method is very wasteful of water
Again, it can only be done for a short period usually. If you hand water, it should be wet all the time, that is you should not let it dry out at all, almost impossible to do.

, The sand cover or hessian has to be kept wet and if they do dry out they actually aid in sucking moisture out of the concrete.

, This is one of the most efficient methods of curing concrete. Usually a spray from a hose pipe is used to wet the surface and the plastic is laid on, with generous laps at the joints. Use timber or cement blocks to keep the plastic in position, rather than taping the joints. To a certain extent the plastic can be used a few times. A major benefit of plastic is that it does not stop other work, like building the walls, and so it can be left in position for weeks if need be.


The photo shows concrete columns that have had the form work stripped (for further use) and then wrapped in a clear plastic film. The evaporation from the concrete condenses on the inside of the plastic and the surface of the column remains moist.

, These compounds and oils now come in a variety of types. Used the water soluble waxy emulsions that can be sprayed onto the fresh concrete with a hand pump type spray. They are milky white when used but dry into a clear waxy film. They have the advantage that that they can be sprayed onto footpaths and the like even before the concrete is set enough to walk upon. Another major use is on concrete walls. They remain on the surface for weeks and finally break down in sunlight. Be hesitant to use concrete curing oils on internal floors, on the off chance that any residue would stop the full adhesion of ceramic tile glues etc.


Other types of concrete curing compounds are PVA based, chlorinated-rubber or resin based. They can also be obtained In coloured versions that fade over time.

Sweep the surface.,
Wet mop the surface.,
Try mild detergent.",How to Clean Stamped Concrete1," The first step in cleaning a stamped concrete surface is removing loose dirt and grime from the surface. Use a broom to remove loose debris from the concrete. If it is an outdoor surface, you can use a leaf blower for extra assistance.;
, For regular cleaning of stamped concrete surfaces, a weekly wet mopping is usually sufficient. After sweeping the floor, dip a rope or foam mop into a bucket of warm water. Thoroughly mop the floor, rinsing the mop regularly. Make sure you change the mopping water when it becomes dirty., If water is not enough to clean your stamped concrete surface, you can add a nonabrasive cleanser to your mopping water. A few drops of dish soap, laundry detergent, or other mild detergent is usually enough to create an effective cleaning solution. Avoid chemical-based cleaners as these can dull the surface."
"
Consider pressure washing outdoor surfaces.,
Try using an alkaline degreaser to remove oil, grease, or soot.,
Use oxalic acid to remove rust.",How to Clean Stamped Concrete2," If water and mild detergent are not effective, you can use a pressure washer to remove tough stains from a stamped concrete surface. Pressure washing can help remove tire marks, leaf stains, and grease spots. Try renting a pressure washer at your local hardware store., An alkaline degreaser can help lift stains like oil and grease to the surface of stamped concrete. Use the degreaser with hot water. Make sure you follow all directions on the degreaser label., If your stamped concrete has a rust stain, you might be able to remove it using a cleaner with oxalic acid. Make sure you consult the company that installed or manufactured your stamped concrete before deciding to use oxalic acid."
"
Sweep or dry dust mop the surface weekly.,
Reseal the surface every 2-3 years.,
Consider polishing high traffic areas.,
Avoid deicing salts and chemicals.",How to Clean Stamped Concrete3," Once you clean a stamped concrete surface, it is important to keep it free from dirt, leaves, and other debris that might scratch the surface. Use a broom, leaf blower, or garden hose to remove debris weekly., A sealer will protect the color and sheen of your stamped concrete surface. Apply sealer to stamped concrete surfaces every 2-3 years to help block penetrating dirt, dust, and stains and protect against wear and abrasion.Talk to the contractor that initially installed the stamped concrete to find out what sealer is best for your surface.

, If you have high traffic indoor areas, you might see signs of wear on your stamped concrete surface. If this is the case, consider using a floor polish or wax on the surface for extra protection. Make sure the polish is formulated for stamped concrete., Your stamped concrete surface will last longer if you avoid using harsh agents to remove snow and ice, such as salts or chemicals. These substances can dull or crack the stamped concrete surface over time."

Choose a size that complements the room.,
Create the illusion of space with a see-through base.,
Show off a unique rug with a glass-topped table.,
Choose a table based on the current decor in the room.",How to Style a Coffee Table1," Select a longer table for a larger room because a small table will be dwarfed in the space. Similarly, use a small table in a small room. And find a table that will accommodate all of the elements you want to use to style your table.For example, if you have several large coffee table books or other decorative items you want to show off, find a table that won’t be overwhelmed by your books or other items.;
, Get a small coffee table with a glass or see-through wire base to create an illusion of space in a small room. Improve traffic flow in your room by using multiple small tables. These are also easier to move to another room if you need the space.Maintain the sense of space when you style a small table. For example, only place a handful of smaller decorative items, like framed photos or decorative boxes, on the table.
To create balance with multiple tables, put a single focal point on each table. For example, arrange books on one table and a vase of flowers on another.

, Get a glass topped coffee table to show off an interesting or lovely rug. Keep minimal items on the table or stack items in the corners so your rug can show through. Match the colors of items on your coffee table to your rug to help it stand out.Try putting a striking pair of candlesticks or a long, skinny vase with just a few flowers on the table. This will create some visual interest without detracting from the rug.
Create a sense of harmony by pairing a round rug with a round coffee table., Match the style of the coffee table to your decor. Find a table that complements other furniture in the room. For example, match a sleek, modern decor, with a glass or chrome coffee table or find a rustic coffee table to match a rustic decor.

Find a length that complements the size of the furniture. For example, if you have a long couch, match it with a longer coffee table that is almost the same length.
Match the wood in a coffee table to other woods in the room. For example, find a teak table to match teak consoles or a birch table to match book shelves made from birch.

Vary heights to add dimension.,
Coordinate colors.,
Display books on every level.,
Go for an asymmetrical look.,
Use just one book to show off a beautiful table.",How to Style a Coffee Table2," Create stacks of books in varying heights. Or make a few stacks of the same height. This immediately adds dimensionality and interest to your table. Top the stacks with small pretty objects.Contrasting a low stack of books with something tall, like a tall pair of candlesticks, to create balance and interest.

, Use books with covers that match in color to create a clean look. To make the books stand out, choose covers with colors that vary and include colors that pop, like reds, yellows, or oranges. Create a sense of cohesion by matching the colors of book covers to other objects on the coffee table or to the colors in your room’s decor., Use the top and bottom levels of your coffee table to display books. Keep shorter stacks on the lower level of your table. And if you’re decorating with more than one coffee table, considering adding books to the surfaces of all tables., Create a classic look by stacking rectangular books on a circular coffee table. For an interesting, minimalist look, angle just one book on a coffee table. This works well if your table is smaller, or even if you need to use it for other purposes, like serving drinks at a party or as a writing surface., If your table itself is worthy of display, don’t detract from its beauty by placing too many objects on it. For example, if your table is made of an interesting piece of wood or has a particularly lovely surface, like rough marble or decorative glass, style it with just a single book or a short pile of like-sized books. Alternatively style it with a single vase or piece of art."
"
Organize decorative items.,
Use a tray to highlight a decorating theme.,
Include candles.,
Focus on a statement piece.",How to Style a Coffee Table3," Keep all of the smaller items you want to display together in a tray. For example, you could use a rustic wooden tray to display vintage collectibles. Keep the tray organized by only displaying a small number of items. You can also put any remotes in the tray to keep them together and help them blend into your decorating scheme.For a very modern look, use a tray with a mirrored bottom with a set of small, sleek vases, gilded anemones, or glass balls.
Consider hiding the remotes in pretty boxes in the tray.

, Display items that will tie into your decorating theme. For example, if you have a nautical theme get a blue or white tray. Include pretty shells, lovely driftwood, pieces of sea glass, and even consider sprinkling some sand on the bottom of the tray.If you have an art deco look, find a tray in rosewood or shagreen and display items that have a 1920s feel, like glass beads, an old metronome, and postcards.
For a country cottage feel, use a wicker tray and display small bowls of potpourri or small animal figurines.

, Add candles to your table as a decorative and practical item. Light them to create ambience or even to scent the air. Display candles that can stand alone or in candle holders. Make sure that the candle holders complement your tray if you place them there., Display items that are important to you, like special antiques or vases. Keep items from any collections or hobbies you pursue in your tray, like elegant knitting needles and interesting yarn. If you have a striking art object, you can place it in the tray by itself or as a focal point in the middle or on top of other items.

For example, arrange a pair of small clocks surrounded by pocket watches in a tray.
Surround a tall piece of art with items that are lower, like a tall sultan canister with some shorter canisters or glass bottles.
Consider making a very special objects d’art the only item on your coffee table -- without the tray.

Pick flowers in one color.,
Make a statement with your vase.,
Find the right size and number of flowers.,
Choose an alternative to flowers.",How to Style a Coffee Table4," Choose a color for your flowers that matches another item on the coffee table to accentuate that color. Alternatively, choose a color that matches or contrasts with a major color in your room’s decorating scheme. For example, if you have yellow wainscotting, display yellow flowers. Flowers also allow you to add color to your room.For example, use dark red flowers to match coffee table books with dark red dust jackets.
Brighten up a dark room with white flowers.

, Choose a vase that reflects the style you are trying to convey. Pick an artistic or elegant vase as the centerpiece for your coffee table. Don’t limit yourself to traditional vases. Antique pitchers and other attractive containers that will hold water and flowers can serve as a vase.For example, put flowers with large, single bloom flowers in old mason jars for a rustic look.
For a nautical theme, fill an old hurricane lamp with flowers.

, Choose flowers that won’t be dwarfed by a large vase. If you have a vase that can only hold a few stems, keep your floral arrangement simple. Keep taller vases to the sides of the coffee table so that people can see each other if they are seated across your coffee table and so they don’t obstruct the view of the television isn’t obstructed. Alternatively, use shorter flowers and vases in the center of the table., Add a green, living element to your coffee table with a houseplant. Put the plants in nice planters that complement your decor. Choose succulents for a very low-maintenance alternative to houseplants. Use a terrarium or glass bowls to best display and show off succulents."

If necessary, take a water flow test.",How to Prevent Water Damage," Corrosion or deterioration of your roof, wind or hail damage or improper installation of vents, flues, chimneys, air conditioners, evaporative coolers or condensers can all result in roof leaks. Fix, patch, replace roofs as necessary.;
, Keep these clean, free from clutter and ensure good working condition.

, An external leak in an irrigation system can quietly waste more than 100 gallons (378.5 L) of water each day.

, A water stain around windows or at the bottom of exterior doors show that water is getting in from the outside. Make sure all windows and doors are tightly sealed. If any signs of water damage are spotted, windows should be replaced and the damaged area restored. Repair or replace caulk, weather stripping, glazing, window seals, door seals or any other exterior area damaged by use, abuse or normal weathering. Examine your exterior siding and replace any missing or damaged fasteners or screws. Repair or replace punctured siding.

, Refrigerators, dishwashers and washing machines are usual culprits of causing water damage. Frequent checks to make sure seals are in good condition, water lines and ice makers are working well can help you spot problems before a flood occurs.

, They have a much longer shelf life., Spongy beams or rafters may be a warning of structural problems as a result of water damage. Spotting these in time may save you thousands of dollars in repairs.

, Invest in a good Relative Humidity Meter as well as a portable dehumidifier with a humidity control. Choose one that shuts off automatically when the collector pan is full., Areas like under your sinks, your attic, behind the water heater, washing machine and your bathroom toilets are good places for one to find leaking pipes. Fix all water leaks, leaky pipes, wall cracks and leaky plumbing.

, Use food coloring to determine whether your toilet has a leak. Remove the tank lid and flush. After it refills, add several drops of dark food coloring. Wait at least 20 minutes and if any trace of color appears in the toilet bowl, you have a leak.

, If you’ve checked for signs of water damage, but still suspect you have a leak, take a water flow test. Shut off all sources of water to your house, inside and out, and locate your water meter. The red triangle or flow indicator at the top will tell you when water is passing through it. If the flow indicator or the sweep hand is moving, you may have a leak. Use the process of elimination to determine where the leak is coming from. Shut of one toilet, go to the meter and see if the red triangle is moving. If it stopped moving, that toilet is the culprit. If not, turn the toilet back on and shut off another. Continue in this manner checking all high risk water sources including toilets, sprinkler system water softener, air conditioner, ice machine, etc. If you shut off the main water valve to your home and the meter is still moving, the leak may be between the shutoff valve and the water meter.

Sweep away and dirt or debris.,
Put on protective gear if necessary.,
Prepare a cleaning solution.,
Pour the solution on the concrete.,
Scrub the concrete.,
Rinse with a hose or pressure washer.",How to Clean Cement1," Any loose dirt, debris, or dust should be swept from cement floors or walls before you begin cleaning. Use a broom to sweep the cement as clean as you can before applying a cleaner.When sweeping down a cement wall, lay down a tarp to catch loose dirt, debris, and dust.;
, When using chemical cleaners, such as degreasers, gloves and goggles are generally necessary. You should also wear older clothing, regardless of what kind of cleaner you're using, as cleaning cement may get messy., Mildly dirty cement can be cleaned with mild laundry detergent diluted with warm water. In a bucket, mix a third cup of your detergent with a gallon of water. When using degreaser, consult the label to figure out the proper degreaser to water ratio., It's best to work in sections, especially when cleaning a large amount of cement. Pour enough of your cleaner over the cement you're working on to get it thoroughly wet. For very dirty concrete, allow the cleaner to sit for a few minutes before proceeding to clean it., Use a deck brush to scrub your cleaner into the cement. Work the cleaner in until you've removed any troublesome layers of dirt and dust, and any obvious stains or set in dirt.For very dirty floors, let the cleaner sit for five to ten minutes after scrubbing it once. Then, repeat the process.

, A pressure washer is the best means to remove a cleaner from cement. These can be rented at most hardware stores. If you do not have a pressure washer, a high pressure hose can be used to rinse the cement. Spray down the cement with clean water to remove any traces of your cleaner.Make sure to keep spraying your cement until water runs clear. Any cleaner reside can damage the cement over time.

Use an alkaline degreaser for oil and grease.,
Look for chemical strippers to remove graffiti.,
Remove rust stains.",How to Clean Cement2," Oil and grease, often found on garage floors, should be cleaned with an alkaline degreaser. You can purchase this online or at a hardware store. Consult the label to see how much water to use to dilute your degreaser. Apply to oil and grease stains and then rinse it out completely using water.Make sure to wear goggles and gloves when applying degreaser.

, In general, chemical strippers should not be used on cement. In the event of graffiti, however, such cleaning solutions are necessary. Go for citrus-based strippers, as these are the mildest. Apply these cleaners to the graffiti and allow them to sit in for several hours before rinsing them out. Use protective gear when working with chemical cleaners.Apply an acid neutralizer, which you can buy at a hardware store, according to package directions after using a chemical stripper.

, Rust stains are difficult to remove and sometimes require professional cleaning. Cleaners with oxalic acid are usually used to remove rust stains. Apply these according to package instructions, making sure to wear goggles and gloves.As removing concrete can be difficult, it's usually best to seek professional help if you have concrete built up on your cement.

Start with less toxic cleaners.,
Do not pour water into acid.,
Use a deck brush over a push broom.",How to Clean Cement3," In general, the least toxic cleaner is best for cement. Start with a mild cleanser, like detergent, and work your way up to chemical cleaners if necessary. Chemicals can wear cement down, so they should be avoided unless absolutely necessary., When using an acid-based cleaner, never pour add the acid to a bucket first and then the water. You should add the water followed by the acid. Doing so the other way around can cause a dangerous reaction., Many people use push brooms to target cement floors. However, push brushes are actually less effective than deck brushes. The bristles are too long to effectively remove dirt and debris from cement.If you don't have a deck brush, buy one at a hardware store.

Precondition the fabric.,
Pick the right steam cleaner.,
Prepare the steam cleaning machine.,
Start with the cushions.,
Steam clean the rest.,
Let your furniture dry.,
Clean the stain with water and soap.,
Use vinegar.,
Use heavy duty cleaner.",How to Clean Upholstery with a Steam Cleaner," The first step you need to take to clean your upholstery is to vacuum any dirt, dust, trash, allergens, pet hair, and dander that may be on the fabric. Some of these things can make your couch even dirtier if they get wet during the cleaning process. Take your time, making sure you get in every crack and inside every crevice. If the furniture has any pillows, remove them and vacuum off each side of them. Also make sure you vacuum the back of the furniture as well. You don't want any left over trash or crumbs to mess up the preparation or cleaning process of the materials.


Make sure you use the attachment on the vacuum cleaner that fits the type of upholstery that you are cleaning. You want to ensure that you don't damage or stain the fabric with the wrong attachment.;
, If there are any apparent stains on the upholstery, spray them with spot upholstery cleaner. Let the cleaner set so it can break up the stain. Depending on what cleaner you use, the amount of time to leave the cleaner will vary, but it should be around 3-5 minutes. Once you've waited enough time, blot the area with a soft cloth, pulling out the stain and drying up the cleaner.A lot of stains, such as food, dirt, pee, and poop, can be cleaned from the steam alone. If you have a stain that is oil based, you might need a commercial cleaner such as Oxy Clean to get out the stain. You can also try mixing vinegar and rubbing alcohol or cornstarch and baking soda with water to treat the area., One of the main reasons to steam clean your furniture is to get out all the ground in dirt, dust, and grit. There are products called soil emulsifiers that will help loosen all of the elements that have been ground into the fabric. Spray it on all of the upholstery on the piece of furniture and the pillows. Let that sit a few minutes. Then, spray a thin layer of upholstery shampoo on the fabric as well. Brush the fabric all over, making sure to rub the shampoo into the fabric.


Don't worry about getting the emulsifier and shampoo off the fabric. It will come out when you steam clean it.Before you steam clean your upholstery, make sure the fabric can handle water based cleaning methods. You can find this information on the tag of your furniture. It should list the kind of cleaning method acceptable for that particular material. If you see an X on the tag, it means that water will permanently damage the fabric, which means you cannot steam clean it., There are many kinds of steam cleaners. They are typically divided by the kinds of materials that they can steam clean. The best steam cleaners for upholstery are upholstery steam cleaners, fabric steam cleaners, and handheld steam cleaners. The upholstery steam cleaner is made specifically for the job, fabric steam cleaners are made to clean fabric, and handheld cleaners are great for small, tight surfaces. The cleaners should either be handheld or have detachable wands or hoses. Pick which one you think will work better on your particular surface.


You want to avoid that large carpet steam cleaners. Those are too bulky and don't typically have fabric cleaning attachments. They will not work at all on your upholstery.If you don't want to buy a steam cleaner of your own, you can rent one from many department, hardware, and grocery stores., To use a steam cleaner, you need to add water and cleaner to the machine. This will vary depending on the machine you have, so follow the directions based on the model that you have. Generally, you will remove a container from the steam cleaner and fill it with warm water and upholstery cleaner. Make sure you don't fill it too full. It can cause too much water and steam to be released on your fabrics, which will over saturate them. You will also need to add the correct attachment for upholstery. This may be a stationary brush, revolving brush, or a cloth, depending on the model you have.


Avoid mixing too much soap into the water. It is much easier to wash an area a few times than it is to have to wash excess soap out of the fabric., If the piece of furniture that you are steam cleaning has removable pillows, such as a couch or chair, start cleaning them. Plug up the machine and turn it on. Take the handheld steam cleaner or the hose and attachment and spray the surface with the steam. There should be a button that releases the steam onto the fabric. This will wet the fabric once the steam hits it. Promptly drag the opening of the machine over the damp areas, sucking up the excess water and cleaner from the surface of the fabric. Repeat over the surface of the pillow.


You may only need to steam clean the sides of the pillow that are exposed. If you do steam clean all side, only do one side of a pillow at a time. You don't want the pillow to lay on a wet side because it will take much longer to dry and could hurt the fabric., The upholstery on the rest of your furniture needs to be cleaned last. Clean the fabric a small section at a time, removing the water the same way as you did on the pillows. You don't want to try to add steam to a huge area at the same time. This will let the water set in the first area, which will absorb too much of the water while you apply steam to the rest of the piece. This will cause the water to soak into the material and cause it to take a much longer time to dry. Repeat until the entire surface is clean.


If there is a particularly dirty spot, you can go back over it once you have cleaned it once. You don't have to wait for it to dry., Once you have steam cleaned all of the fabric, your furniture will need some time to dry. The amount of time will vary based on how humid the steam you used was and the weather on the day you clean the furniture. You can speed up the drying process by using a fan, opening a window, using a blow dryer. It will eventually dry.


If you still see some discoloration on the fabric, you may need to clean it again. This is more likely if the upholstery was extremely soiled when you started.

, Steam cleaning gets out a lot of different stains. If you still have lingering stains once the steam cleaning has been done, there are a few ways you can tackle them. Start first with the easiest option, which is soap and water. Take a sponge and dip it in water. Put some dish detergent on the sponge and massage it into the pad. Wring the excess water from the sponge. Blot the stain with the sponge, coating the stain in the soapy mixture. Next, clean the soap out of the sponge and put fresh water in the sponge. Take the sponge and blot the soapy area to remove the soap and the stain from the surface.


Make sure you don't scrub the stain too hard with the sponge. You don't want to rip apart the fabric of the upholstery with the excessive force of the rubbing., Instead of soap and water, you can try to use vinegar to remove the stains. Take white or apple cider vinegar and soak a cloth. Blot the stain on the upholstery with the fabric, saturating the fabric with the vinegar. Make sure you don't scrub too hard on the fabric so you don't make the stain set in more or harm the fabric. You can gently rub the stain with the cloth in a circular manner to help remove the stain particles with the cloth.


If you don't have vinegar, you can also use vodka. The smell of either will evaporate once the fabric dries., If none of the other methods of stain cleaning work, you may need to try a heavy duty commercial cleaner such as Tuff Stuff, Resolve, or Folex. Take a cloth or sponge and wet it. Spray the cleaner directly on the fabric and use the cloth to blot the stain. You can also gently rub the spot with circular motions to help loosen the stain.


Make sure you test the cleaner on a part of the upholstery that isn't normally visible. You want to make sure the cleaner won't hurt the fabric.
If you have a wine or coffee stain, try Wine Away. It is made to specifically treat dark liquid stains.
If the stain is still being stubborn, you may have to go through another round of cleaning until the stain is completely removed."

, Mix them together in a plastic bucket until they are well-combined. The temperature of the water should be at least 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40.5 degrees Celsius).Alternatively, you can use a specially formulated concrete cleaner instead of the oxygenated bleach and water. You can find these at your local hardware store.

, Fill a tank sprayer with the solution. Working from the top down, use the tank to spray the steps with the solution, focusing on the stained areas. Once you have covered the whole area, let the solution set for 20 to 30 minutes.Make sure the concrete steps are soaking wet to prevent the solution from drying up while it is setting. If the solution starts to dry, then just spray more solution onto the steps.
You can purchase or rent a tank sprayer from your local hardware store.

, You can also use a push broom to do this. Working from the top down, scrub the steps until the dirt and grime are completely removed. Use a smaller scrub brush to clean small crevices and corners.Make sure to clean the steps evenly to avoid a patchy look.

, Fill a gallon bucket with clean, hot water. From the top of the stairs, pour the water down the steps to rinse them clean. Rinse the steps until all of the soap residue, dirt, and grime are removed.If the concrete steps are still dirty, then repeat steps one through five, or use a different method.

Rent a pressure washer.,
Clear debris away from the steps.,
Pre-treat the steps.,
Wash the steps.,
Let the steps air dry.",How to Clean Concrete Steps3," You can rent a pressure washer from your local hardware store. Rent a pressure washer with a flow rate of at least 4 gpm (gallons per minute) and a PSI of at least 3,000., Remove dirt, leaves, twigs, and other debris from your steps using a broom or an electric blower. Also make sure to remove nearby plants, toys, furniture, and decorations.Make sure to cover any nearby plants that cannot be removed with a tarp or trash bags.

, Fill a plastic bucket with one part hot water to two parts liquid dish soap. Mix the ingredients together until they are well-combined. Then scrub the treatment into the concrete using a push broom or a stiff bristle brush. Let the solution set for 15 to 20 minutes.Alternatively, you can pretreat the steps with a specially formulated concrete cleaner.

, Hook the pressure washer up per the directions on the instruction manual. Use the high-pressure nozzle and rinse mode to clean the steps. With the nozzle facing the concrete, press the trigger. Starting from the top of the steps, begin to clean them in a back and forth sweeping motion.Wash the steps until all of the soap, dirt, and grime are removed.
To ensure your safety, wear close-toed shoes, clothing that can get wet, and safety goggles.

, Do this once the steps are completely clean. If you are going to apply a sealant, make sure the concrete is completely dry before doing so.It may take one to two days for the concrete to dry completely.

Do initial research on the Internet to create a list of potential contractors.,
Ask for references.,
Review quotes.,
Visit their work site.,
Check the contract.,
Go with your instinct.

,
Even after hard work on your part, it could happen that you still cannot decide who to hire.",How to Choose the Right Concrete Contractor," Take the time to educate yourself about the business so you can ask the right questions. Here are some of the most important questions to ask potential contractors:


How long have you been in the concrete business?

Usually, a contractor with a minimum of 5 years experience in the business indicates stability and reliability, which is a must in this kind of work. The last thing you want is someone who turns back on their word and either fails to finish the job or does it unsatisfactorily. Also, an experienced contractor will be able to give you helpful insights on your project.


What specific insurance coverage do you have?

It is very important to choose a contractor who has adequate insurance coverage to safeguard you and your property from any potential liabilities resulting from an accident in your work site. Professional decorative concrete contractors should have at least general liability coverage as well as Workman’s Compensation and automobile insurance. Call the insurance company to verify the effective dates of the policies.


When was the last training class or seminar you’ve attended?

It is ideal to choose a contractor who has had recent training, say, in the past two years. This shows they know the latest products, techniques and methods used in the business.

;
,


Make sure to ask for three client references in the past year. Contacting previous clients will give you insight on a contractor’s work ethic.

,


When comparing quotes, never make your choice based on the price alone. Be careful about very low rates because low bidders oftentimes do a lot of shortcuts on their work and use poor quality materials. Do not hesitate to ask the contractor about any items on the quote that you are not familiar with. You have the right to know what you will be paying for. Also, look at the project time frame. It is ideal to find someone who could finish the job quickly without sacrificing quality. As long as the time frame is reasonable, it makes sense for a contractor who could complete the job faster to charge more.

,


Do an ocular visit on one of their previous work sites. The great thing about this industry is contractors can’t really hide the quality of their work because it’s right there for everyone to see Just by looking at a site with a similar work to what you want, you can have a good idea about the contractor’s workmanship.

,


Putting down all agreements in writing will help lessen any possible conflicts during and after the project. A professional concrete contractor should provide you a written contract with details of all the work to be done. Be sure to go over the contract carefully. Sign the contract only when you are absolutely comfortable with all its terms.

,, In this case, it may have to come down to what your gut feeling tells you. You would want a contractor that represent themselves professionally and is pleasant to work with.

Stop the flow of water.,
Turn off the power.,
Assess the damage.,
Rescue your most valuable possessions.,
Get rid of standing water.,
Clean up debris.,
Allow appliances to air dry.",How to Deal with Residential Water Damage1," If the flooding has been caused by a burst pipe or a water heater failure, shut off the main water line for your home.


Get in touch with an expert immediately if you cannot tell where the water is coming from.;
, If your home is flooded, cut off the electricity and gas from the main source. This isn’t as essential for small leaks or puddles, but for large floods turn them off to be safe. Do not handle electrical appliances unless you are properly insulated.
If you have to stand in water to turn off the main electricity, consult with an electrician.

, Before you begin your cleanup effort, first determine if rebuilding is even a worthwhile option. Take ample photos and other documentation to show the insurance company.

, If you are able to, find and remove your most important items from the flooded area, such as heirlooms, money, jewelry, etc. Don’t spend too much time extracting and cleaning individual items, as the water is still doing damage to your home.

, The longer the water sits, the more damage it will cause. As soon as it is safe, pump out any standing water. If you are dealing with a natural flood, wait to pump until the flood waters have receded below your house.Wear proper protective gear. When working in a flooded area, be sure to wear rubber boots, gloves, and a mask or respirator.
Keep children and pets away from any standing flood water, as it is often contaminated.
Place the pump at the lowest spot of the flooded floor. If the water is deep, you may need to lower the pump using a nylon rope.
If dealing with a small amount of flooding, you may be able to use a wet-dry shop vacuum to remove the water. These often only hold 4–5 gallons (15.1–18.9 L), so you may find yourself emptying it often., Be careful, as there could be nails and other materials left behind by the flood water.


Mud left behind by floods often contain a significant amount of toxins. Shovel out as much mud as possible, and spray down your walls with clean water. Make sure to check for mud in air ducts, as it will be hazardous when it dries.
Snakes and rats may seek shelter in your home after a flood

, Do not use any appliances or outlets until they have had enough time to completely dry. Check with each manufacturer for recommended action.

Detect the mold.,
Act quickly after discovering water damage.,
Turn off the power.,
Dry out the area.,
Remove moisture from walls and ceilings.,
Size up the mold growth.,
Clean hard surfaces.,
Clean porous materials.,
Stop cleaning if you start exhibiting symptoms of mold exposure.",How to Deal with Residential Water Damage2," Mold can be visible, but it can also grow in air ducts, crawlspaces, rafters, and between walls. If you can’t see any mold, but you detect a noticeable musty earth smell, you most likely have mold growth that you can’t see.

, Mildew and mold will begin developing within 24-48 hours of exposure to moisture. It will quickly continue to grow until the moisture is completely removed and the mold is exterminated., If any cables or wiring are wet or moldy, shut the power off before cleaning. Have an electrician examine the wiring before turning the power back on again.

, You will want to dry out the moldy or wet area as quickly as possible to prevent the mold from spreading. The longer you leave an area wet, the more likely mold will form.


Open the windows if humidity outside is lower than inside.
Use fans to remove moisture only if mold has not started growing. Fans can spread mold spores to other areas.
Remove all wet items from the area, including furniture, carpets, toys, etc.
Throw away any moldy carpeting. Mold will be almost impossible to remove from the carpet fibers. All other items can be cleaned and disinfected separately.
Discard any contaminated food products. This means anything not sealed in a watertight container.

, If the wall has been water damaged by a flood, you will need to remove all of the wet material, including insulation, wood by-products, and anything else porous.


Drywall is incredibly porous and should be replaced at the soonest sign of water damage.
Remove the wallboard to a foot above the water mark.
You can drain walls by removing the baseboard and drilling holes into the floor.
Make sure to check the interior of the wall for any hidden mold growth.

, If you are faced with a significant amount of mold growth, consider hiring professional cleaners. Mold is very hazardous when being cleaned, because disturbing the mold will cause it to release spores.


Make sure that the area you are cleaning is well-ventilated.
Always wear gloves, a mask or respirator, and eye protection.

, Material such as metal, solid wood, plastic, and glass should be washed first with a non-ammonia soap and hot water. Use a stiff brush on rough surfaces such as concrete.


Use a wet-dry shop vacuum to remove standing water.
Disinfect all surfaces after cleaning with a 10% bleach solution. Allow the solution to stay on the surface for at least 10 minutes before rinsing with clean water or drying.

, Upholstered furniture, clothing, bedding, rugs, carpets, books, and more are all porous items. If you can’t decide whether to keep a contaminated object or not, err on the side of caution and throw it out.


Clean the material and then disinfect with a pine-oil cleaner. Let the material dry completely. Monitor the material for several days after cleaning for any fungal growth or odors. If mold returns, be sure to discard the item.

, As soon as you start feeling adverse effects, stop what you are doing and consult a professional cleaning service. Signs include:


Breathing difficulties, including wheezing
Sinus congestion
Hacking cough
Eye irritation, redness
Bloody nose
Rashes or hives
Headaches, memory loss"

Use water-resistant glues.

, Check around every door and window to ensure that the seals are watertight. Look for discoloration in the paint and caulk. Also look for swelling around the frames.


Replace shingles that are coming loose, and pay extra attention to areas around the chimney and vents.

Seal any cracks in the foundation. Water in the foundation can cause serious damage to your home’s structure.

, Any leaking pipes, clogged drains, and malfunctioning drainage systems should be fixed or replaced.


Check washing machine and dishwasher hoses to make sure that they aren’t cracked.

, Make sure that drainage pipes and gutters drain water away from the house, and that all the joints are all properly sealed.


If your gutters start overflowing after 15 minutes of sustained heavy rain, install additional downspouts to help with flow.
Make sure that the grounds around the house slope away from the home to keep water from the foundations and basement.

, If your basement is prone to flooding, put your appliances on risers to keep them out of small floods.


Raise anything that could get damaged: washer, dryer, furnace, water heater, wiring, and any personal items.

Call your insurance agent.,
Make a list.,
Keep all of your receipts.",How to Deal with Residential Water Damage4," The sooner that you get in contact with an insurance agent, the sooner your claim can be processed. Your protection will depend on your coverage, and your insurance agent will be able to get the process started.

, List all of your damaged property before beginning the cleanup process. Include pictures and video evidence if possible.Let your claims adjuster know when you are disposing of health hazards, such as contaminated food. It can still be claimed, so they need to know about it.
Ask about keeping samples. Sometimes you will meed to keep samples of damaged property, such as a piece of rug, for claim purposes.

, During the cleanup process, keep receipts for all of your supplies and any services that you hire. Even motel bills for nights you can’t stay in the house count.

Gather rope, shuttles, spacers, and a crochet hook, from a local craft store.,
Tie the first half of your rope to one of the horizontal seat poles using a clove hitch.,
Lay the 1"" spacer across the seat, perpendicular to your knot.,
Wrap the rope around the whole width of the chair, then back to your starting point.,
Keeping the strings from overlapping, wrap the rope around everything four more times.,
After wrapping five times, individually wrap the seat pole to create a spacer.,
Run the rope to the other side and wrap the first seat pole once to create a second spacer.,
Slide the strings close together, making sure they don't crisscross.,
Repeat the process of five horizontal wraps and one spacer until you cover the whole chair.,
Tie a new clove hitch instead right after creating a spacer if you run out of rope and need to add more.,
Use a crochet hook to weave any stray strands back into the weave.,
Wrap the remainder of your rope onto your shuttles.,
Work your large spacer into warp, passing it over every other group of five strings.,
Turn the seat upside-down and repeat the step above with your other spacer, lifting the other sets of five strings.,
Starting with the rope on the larger shuttle, tie the rope down to a seat pole with another clove hitch.,
Using the shuttle to slide under the lifted strings, wrap the rope around the width of the chair five times.,
Wrap up the seat poles after five rounds to create spacers.,
Follow the same pattern as above -- five wraps, one spacer -- by sliding the shuttle underneath the lifted strings.,
Use the crochet hook to manually weave the final few strands, as the weave is likely too tight for the shuttles.,
Use scissors to clean up any loose threads, strands, and tails.,
Lay the end of the rope over the top of your pole (the edge of the seat).,
Pull the end under the pole and wrap it back around.,
Cross the end of the rope over the standing line wrapped around the pole.,
Tuck the end back under the pole as if double wrapping it.,
Slide the end underneath the loop you just made.,
Pull tightly on both ends of the rope to tighten it.",How to Weave Rope Seats," The materials needed are light and easy, though you may have some questions about how much you actually need:


About 2lbs of rope chord, cut into two roughly even halves (roughly 200 ft)
2-3 completely flat, 1/8"" thick weaving shuttles, (various lengths)
1"" thick wooden spacer, same length as chair
1/2"" thick wooden spacer, same length as chair
Very thin wooden spacer, same length as chair (a yardstick works well)
Crochet hooks (for detailing);
, You can start on any one of the four sides of the seat. Tie your knot and slide it all the way to one corner -- this is the starting point of your warp. A ""warp"" is simply the first round of rope, pointing in one direction, that gives the weave its shape.You should have the majority of your rope at the other end of this knot. Just keep it attached to the large ball of yarn/rope it came from.
Click here to learn how to tie a clove hitch below.

, This spacer will keep some slack in the weave as you start in the first direction. This will make it much, much easier to weave in the opposite side later. If you make this first weave too tight you will have to remove it and start over.

, Take your rope and lay it over the spacer, over the opposite seat pole, then back underneath everything to your starting point. This is one loop.


You don't want to pull this as tight as possible. It should be tight enough to hold its shape, but not so tight you can't lift it slightly with your fingers.

, Starting with the pole you tied the knot on, lay the rope over the spacer, over the opposite pole, then back under everything to where you started. Use your fingers to push the strings close together, then repeat until you have 5 total wraps.

, Instead of wrapping across the whole width of the chair, wrap it the rope once around the pole opposite your starting side.

, Come back to the beginning and wrap the rope just around this horizontal seat pole.

, If you started on the left side of the seat, slide everything to the left. You should have a total of 6 parallel strings on the seat posts:


The string wrapped for your clove hitch.
The five (5) strings woven across to the other side.
The string wrapped around the pole to create a spacer.

, This process simply continues until you've finished one side of the chair. To repeat:Wrap the string across the width of the chair, going over the spacer, around the far pole, and back to where you started.
Repeat wrap for a total of five times.
Wrap around each pole individually to create a spacer.
Repeat., Don't try and tie a knot between two ends of the rope and keep going. If you're running out of rope/yarn/etc, simply finish the set of 5 you are on and create your two spacers. Tie the second spacer in, then create a clove hitch with a new strand of rope and ""start over"" from this point.

, Once you get to the end of the seat pole, snip the rope so you have a 2-3"" tail. Use your crochet hooks to tuck this strand into your warp, preventing it from unraveling, then snip any excess string., Shuttles are simply thin yarn holders that you can slide into your weave, making it much easier to get a tight weave than forcing your hands through the warp. Wrap up a small and a large shuttle, at minimum., Pick up the first five strings, and slide the spacer under it. Then slide the spacer on top of the next five strings, alternating so that you have a ladder-like pattern.

, This time, your job will be easy as every other set is already being held up by the other spacer.


To get a little extra width, turn the spacers so that their widest side points upwards.

, You'll be starting perpendicular to your first set of weaves, but it doesn't matter which side you start on.

, You're doing the same thing as before, just keeping the string between your first set of weaves. This will help create the checkerboard pattern you're looking for.

, Again, this is identical to the work from before -- you create another spacer on each side of the chair every five times you wrap around the width.

, You should already see how the weave is forming small squares. As you work, you'll likely need to switch to smaller and smaller shuttles in order to fit under the weave, and you may have to switch to using just the thinner, 1/2"" spacer or yardstick instead of both at once.


If you run out or rope, don't worry about tying another knot. Simply

, This takes time, but the precision is necessary for the final bits of the weave. Simply pull the rope through, using the crochet hook to get into the center and pull the rope up and down every five strings., Once you've finished the weave, it should hold strongly on its own. Your woven chair is done!, The weave goes perpendicular to the pole where you tie this knot., You should have a single strand of rope wrapped around your pole.

, Make sure you do this loosely, so you could still get underneath the rope. You'll still have the rope wrapped around the pole, with crisscrossing ropes on top.

, Again, come under and around the pole.

, Basically, you're making another crisscross of the ropes but, this time, you need to go under the line. Note that this is under the second wrap you made, not the first one.

, Hold onto the end of the rope, then pull hard on the rest of the line to tighten your knot."

Place the furniture over a drop cloth.,
Remove old sealant with a chemical stripper (optional).,
Wash the furniture with vinegar and water.,
Sand the furniture.,
Wipe with a clean cloth.This removes the dust sanding creates, and results in a clean surface to work with.

,
Purchase or create the whitewash mixture.,
Apply the whitewash to the furniture.,
Work the whitewash into the wood (optional).,
Wipe the whitewashed area.,
Add additional layers if you desire.,
Seal the whitewashed furniture (Optional) .",How to Whitewash Furniture1," You can use newspapers instead, or any other material to catch the drips.;
, If the wood is covered with a sealant, using a chemical stripper gets rid of it much quicker than sandpaper:Warning: chemical strippers are extremely caustic. Use only in ventilated areas and cover your skin, eyes, and mouth (with a respirator).Brush the stripper onto the wood with as few strokes as possible. Cover the whole surface, but manipulate the stripper as little as possible for maximum results.
Wait 3–5 minutes while the stripper dissolves the sealant.
Scrape the dissolved ""goop"" off the wood. Steel wool is helpful for hard to reach corners.
If you use chemical stripper, do not skip washing the wood with vinegar and water. This will neutralize the stripper and make the wood safe to work with and able to hold whitewash. (Alternatively, you can use turpentine, mineral spirits, or a paint neutralizer.), Dilute white vinegar with equal parts water and use it to wash the wood. The vinegar solution is effective at removing stains and dirt which could cause the whitewash to apply unevenly. Treating the wood this way also enhances its ability to absorb the whitewash.Wait for the furniture to dry completely before continuing.

, Gently use a medium or fine grit sandpaperor sander to rub the surfaces you will whitewash. This gives the wood an even texture and makes the whitewash attach strongly and evenly.If the piece has an existing layer of paint, lacquer, or stain, you'll need to sand it off entirely.,, You can buy this ready made as ""wood stain"" or ""white wash pickling"", or make your own by mixing paint and water.


When mixing your own, a 2:1 ratio of latex paint and water will create a very thick layer of whitewash, while a 1:1 and 1:2 ratio result in successively thinner mixes.
Similarly, you can make your own whitewash by mixing turpentine into an oil-based paint until the desired consistency is reached.
For both homemade and store-bought products, stir the mixture thoroughly before using.
Any ""stain"" or ""pickling"" should work for any type of wood.
Purchase a whitewash stain, not a whitewash paint. The latter is a lime and chalk based paint, which will take much longer to dry and obscure the wood grain.

, Use a paint brush, foam roller, or clean rag to apply long strokes to the surface of the furniture. As the mixture will dry more quickly than standard paint, apply the whitewash product in relatively small sections rather than attempting to coat the entire piece.


For oak or other wood with large grain and pores, apply the whitewash against the grain to ensure it covers the contour of the wood. This technique is called ""pickling"".
For pine and most other woods, apply the whitewash in the direction of the wood grain for best results.
It may be quickest to apply the whitewash in long, even strips the length of the surface, allowing you to wipe off the excess (see below) in one motion before moving to the next strip.Use a sponge to whitewash hard to reach areas such as corners., Before the whitewash dries, use a clean rag to rub the whitewash into the grain and knots of the wood and even the brush strokes into one level coating.This is especially important for oak and other wood with large pores.
You can skip this step if you prefer the intentional ""amateur"" look of individual brush strokes.

, Before the whitewash can completely dry, use a clean cloth to wipe any excess from the furniture surface. This helps to make the wood grain more visible through the product.


You can use a dry sponge instead.
If the excess blobs have already dried, use sandpaper to remove them.

, Applying additional layers (and again wiping off the excess) will create a thicker layer that obscures more of the wood grain. This incremental process makes it easy to create the exact combination of color and wood grain that is right for the project.


One coat is often enough, especially if you mixed your own whitewash to the desired consistency. If you find yourself adding more than three layers, you may want to use a thicker whitewash.

, After the whitewashing is completely dried, apply a clear water-based sealant over the surface. This will protect the whitewash job and allow it to look fresh and new for a long time. Most sealants can be applied using a brush or even a lint free sponge.



Always use a clear water-based sealant. Oil-based sealants may give your furniture a yellow tinge that detracts from the intended color color.
Apply the sealant in long even strokes."
"
Prepare the wood.,
Dip the brush very lightly into paint.,
Quickly and lightly brush the wood.,
Blend uneven spots with a rag or sponge.,
Apply a sealant.",How to Whitewash Furniture2," Just as though you were actually whitewashing, you should sand and clean the surface to be brushed. Remember to place the furniture over something that can catch any spilled paint.


Since you'll be applying paint instead of stain, you do not need to thoroughly remove old finish (sealant) unless it is flaking off. In that scenario, see instructions for chemical stripping under Whitewashing Furniture or thoroughly sand the finish off.

, Use full strength (undiluted) paint. The goal is to barely have enough paint on the brush to spread. Wipe it off on a rag if you get too much paint on it.


If you can't find a balance between being able to spread the paint and keeping the layer of paint very thin, dip your brush in water and shake it (not on the wood) before applying., If you pause during the painting or make the initial contact between brush and wood too heavy, you will get uneven blotches of paint. Try to move as rapidly and lightly as possible.Be especially vigilant while brushing the corners. It's easy to slow down while trying to reach the edge of the surface, but that will cause an uneven paint layer.
If you want to avoid the appearance of brush strokes, make your strokes as long as possible, but maintain an even speed and light touch., Still using a quick, light touch, find any uneven or overly thick spots and gently brush them into their surroundings for an even appearance., One or two coats of a water-based sealant will preserve your furniture without altering its color. Wait for the paint to dry completely before applying.

"
"
Sand and wash the furniture.,
Brush on a coat of primer.,
Rub with fine grit sandpaper.,
Brush on additional coats of primer.,
Apply several thin coats of paint.,
Apply sealant (optional).",How to Whitewash Furniture3," Use this process for metal or wooden furniture. Let it dry completely before continuing.


Sand wooden furniture gently. Unlike using a whitewash stain, you're trying to (largely) obscure the wood grain and make the furniture completely white. Over-sanding pine or oak can cause tannins to leak through the paint and tinge it yellow.Stripping off old finish is not necessary unless the finish is flaking off. If you need to, thoroughly sand the old finish until it is removed or follow the instructions under Whitewashing Old Furniture for safe use of chemical strippers.

, Let this coat dry as well before continuing.


Use a gripping primer on surfaces that are at all glossy or shiny.Use a stain blocking primer for surfaces that have already had a stain applied.Try to use water-based primers if your paint is water-based, and oil-based primers for oil-based paints. Mixing the two types will often work, but not always., Sanding between each coat of primer, or at least before the final layer, removes excess primer that has dried in uneven ridges., Each layer of primer should be very thin, so use at least two before painting. Always let each primer dry before applying the next.


The primer does not need to hide the color underneath.That's what the paint will do.

, Use a clean brush to apply the paint, and allow each coat to dry before applying the next. Using at least two thin coats of paint will create a smooth and durable result.Paint with a roller or use long, even brush strokes to apply an even coat of paint to a large flat surface.
For detailed or curving metal work, use a small craft brush from an art supply store.

, 24 hours after the last coat of paint was applied, you may coat the furniture with any type of sealant to protect the paint job.


If you don't seal your furniture, avoid touching it as much as possible for a few weeks until the paint fully cures."

, You can get books that are 50 pages and those that are 500 pages. A small piece of table or tabletop would need 50 pages, while a large dresser would need a larger book.

, It costs less and has approximately the same effect of a silvery, mirrored surface.

, If there are areas that are hidden, or legs that are difficult to refinish, you can save money by using a silver spray paint, like Rustoleum., This is your adhesive for the silver leaf. You will need regular natural bristle paint brushes to apply it.

, If the silver leaf is disturbed, the paint color can show through the surface. If you are going for an antique look, try a brown paint color or a grey primer, so the cracks are subtler.

,, It must be transparent and can be lacquer or polyacrylic based.

, Apply a chemical stripper in a well-ventilated area. Spread the stripper onto the surface with a brush, and then scrape it off with a putty knife.


Always wear protective clothing, such as rubber gloves, a ventilation mask and long-sleeved clothing when you are working with chemical stripper.

, Start with a medium-grit paper to get rid of dings and scratches. Then, finish with a fine-grit paper to smooth the surface.

, Then, wipe the surface with a tack cloth. Clean up excess dust from your area with a shop vacuum before you start painting or leafing.

, If you are painting the surface with brown paint, you may want to start with a layer of primer before you paint the surface with interior paint., Read the paint or primer instructions indicating how long it takes to cure.

, Read the package directions to learn how long you will need to wait until it is the right consistency to lay the silver leaf. It must dry slightly to a tacky texture.


You should start with the large, flat surface since it will be easier to gild. Once you have the process down, you can move on to the sides and more complicated areas.
Only paint on gilding size to areas that you can leaf within one to one and one half hours. The adhesive won’t work for leafing after it has cured.
Set a timer to ensure you return to your project just as the surface becomes tacky.

, Move slowly when working with silver leaf, since it tears easily and can’t be touched with your bare hands.

, Peel back the tissue paper from the top and turn it under the book, so that you can see the first sheet of leaf underneath.

, Rock your hand back press the leaf onto the dresser very lightly. The leaf will immediately stick to the size, which is why you don’t need to press hard.

, Position your hand to the area next to the leaf you just laid down. Plan to overlap it by at least one-half inch (0.6cm) in the beginning.You will remove the overlapping leaf later.

,, Be extra gentle at the areas where the leaf overlaps. Burnishing will remove the excess leaf, but using too much pressure can break the corners.

, Continue burnishing until the excess leaf is removed. However, you will still be able to see the seams until you seal it.


You can also apply Rub N Buff silver color to these areas before you seal it to get rid of bare spots.

, Take extra care with legs and drawers. It will be harder to apply the leaf to the size around these areas. Burnish the entire piece of furniture before you seal it.


If you have areas that you want to spray paint silver, do this before you silver leaf the areas that are adjacent, so that the spray paint has time to cure.

, You can also paint on a clear coat sealer with a soft-bristled brush.

, Allow it to dry. Then, apply a second coat.

, Then, reinsert knobs or other hardware into the furniture.

Plop your pouffe in front of your favorite chair and enjoy.

",How to Stuff a Leather Pouffe," Don't worry yet about creases and folds in the leather, since the filling will help to stretch these open. Air the leather as long as you wish to reduce any residual odors from the curing or coloring of the leather.;
, You can use ordinary filling, such as you can purchase for pillows. However, it will serve as a sturdier footstool or seat if the filling is firmer than the usual polyester fluff. Thus, try plastic grocery bags, instead. They are inexpensive and plentiful, and packed tightly, they are quite firm. They will also give your finished pouffe a pleasant heft. You will need a lot.

, Look for a built-in opening, such as laces or a zipper.

, As it starts to fill, make sure all parts are filled evenly.

, Push the filling around from inside or outside until it is firm and even, not too lumpy or lopsided. Fill the bag completely.

, Lace, tie, sew, or zip it tightly closed.

Stick a strip of painter’s tape or something similar over each one. Label or number each door so you know which one goes where. For example:Write where each one goes, like “Left Door Under Sink” or “Right Door Over Range Hood.”
Number top and bottom cabinets from left to right, like “Top Cabinet #1,” “TC #2,” and so on.;
, Lay a dropcloth over your counters and/or floors. Make clean-up easier by catching any sawdust or other debris that falls when you remove the hinges. Also protect them against damage in the event that a door slips from your grasp as you remove them., Expect most cabinet hinges to be attached to the inside of the door. This means you will have to unscrew it with the door opened, so ask a partner to help you so they can hold it steady. Use a screwdriver or power drill to remove the hinge’s screws from each door. However:


More modern hinges may have a release latch that separates the hinge into two parts. This means that, once released, you can remove the door from the cabinet and then unscrew its hinge attachment., Use your screwdriver or power drill to remove the hinge from the cabinets. Do the same with the doors if your hinges have release latches and break down into two pieces. As you remove each one:


Take note if all of your hinges are all the same. If not, group each type separately as you remove them and add notes to your doors’ labels about which door had which type.

, Choose a pot or pan large enough to fit your hinges, and that you don’t mind sacrificing if your hinges are particularly old and nasty. Add enough water to cover them. Also add a tablespoon (or more if you think they need it) of dish soap as it fills.Alternatively, you could use a slow cooker if you have other things to do, but again, the inside might get a little foul if your hinges are coated in grime.For especially dirty hinges, also add a tablespoon of white distilled vinegar and a tablespoon of baking soda to the mix.

, Place the pot or pan on the stovetop. Turn the burner to high. Once the water comes to a boil, turn the heat to low. Simmer for at least ten minutes.If using a slow-cooker, set it to “low” and leave for six hours., After the hinges have soaked long enough for the grime to loosen, drain the pot empty. Keep in mind that they’ll be pretty hot to the touch, so either give them a chance to cool or wear safety gloves to take them out. Then brush each one vigorously with a fresh toothbrush to clean off the lingering residue., As you clean each hinge, rinse off the grimy/soapy water with clean warm water. Inspect each in case it needs another soak and scrub. If so, repeat the process. Otherwise, towel each one dry as much as possible, then set them out on a fresh towel or drying rack to air-dry before reinstalling., Apply spray lubricant to the top and bottom of the hinge. Then open and close the cabinet door a few times so the lubricant can work into the hinge while its parts are in motion. Repeat if the squeak doesn’t disappear entirely after the first application., Keep in mind that repeatedly opening and closing cabinet doors will loosen the hinges’ screws over time. Expect this to cause damage to your cabinets due to the door’s weight pulling at the loose screws. Retighten the screws periodically to keep them firmly in place without gouging larger holes in the woodwork., Prevent the need for frequent deep-cleaning by wiping up messes as soon as they occur. Wipe down the inside and outside components whenever they are dirtied by cooking, spills, or other means. Do the same as part of your routine kitchen-cleaning to prevent buildup of gunk.How often you’ll need to deep-clean your hinges will vary depending on how often you spot-clean them and how active your kitchen is.

, Expect hinges to wear out and become less effective if you abuse them. Don’t slam doors shut or whip them open, since this places undue stress on the hinges. Avoid forcing doors to open wider than the hinges allow. Also avoid leaning, pulling, or otherwise placing undue weight on them., With proper care and maintenance, hinges should last a pretty long time. However, if the doors don’t function correctly despite deep-cleaning, consider replacing them. This may be necessary when:Doors do not open or close smoothly.
Two doors interfere with each other when opening and closing.
Hinges appear warped or otherwise damaged.

",How to Make Crate Shelves," You won’t know how many crates you’ll need to buy or scavenge until you plan out your crate shelf. Think about how many rows of crates wide your shelf will be. Crates can be stacked one on top of the other to add height to a shelf. Keep track of the total number of crates.Same sized crates can be stacked side by side, with additional crates stacked on top to form a bookshelf shape. Singly stacked crates will make a simple bookshelf design.;
, Fasten two crates together to form an L-shape. One crate should stand on its end and the other lay flat. Similarly, two other crates can be fastened like a 7. The L and 7 shapes can then be attached at the top and bottom to make a unique shelf with a gap in the middle.It may help you to visualize a design by drawing it out. With a pencil and paper, draw simple boxes to represent crates. Arrange these to your preference.

, When trying to think up a neat design, looking at the designs of others can help. Check Pinterest or do an online keyword search for “crate shelves.”Bookmark websites that have designs you like so you can find them easily again. Combine your favorite features into a single design all your own.

, Some designs may look good on paper but aren’t safe in reality. If you’re a beginner, you may want to start with a simple bookshelf design, as it is relatively stable.

, Most of these supplies can be bought at your local hardware store. Crates are sold at many craft stores, hardware stores, and home centers. Choose sturdy, unfinished, wooden crates. Including the crates, you’ll need:


1-inch (2½ cm) screws
Drop cloth (or a similar cover, like newspaper, plastic tablecloth, or an old sheet)
L-bracket (x1; to attach the shelf to a wall)
Lint-free cloth (x2)
Paintbrushes (optional)
Power drill (and drill bits)
Primer and paint (or wood stain; optional)
Sandpaper (medium grit, between 60 and 100 rating)
Unfinished wooden crates, Choose a flat, sturdy, level surface, like a work bench. You can create an outdoor workbench by lying a sheet of plywood between two sawhorses. Lay out a drop cloth or similar cover over your work area to catch sawdust and stray paint or wood stain.


Paint and wood stain fumes can build up dangerously in enclosed spaces. Because of this, choose a well-ventilated workspace if you plan to paint or stain your crate shelves., Rub sandpaper in the same direction as the grain of the wood with firm, moderate pressure. When the wood is smooth, sand the next portion. Continue this until all of the crates are smooth.Wipe the crates with a lightly dampened, lint-free cloth to remove sawdust and dirt. Follow this with a dry, clean, lint-free cloth.
The grain of the wood is the direction formed by the natural lines in the wood. Follow these natural lines with your sandpaper to achieve the best finish.This process may take an hour or longer depending on the condition of your crates and the total size of the shelf. Speed this process up by using a belt sander or orbital sander.

, Prime wood first before painting for the best results. Wood stain can generally be applied directly to clean, sanded wood. For most wood stains, you should wear gloves when applying it to prevent it from staining your skin.Allow painted shelves to dry fully before assembling your shelf. This time will vary depending on the paint or wood stain used. Check the label of your product to determine the drying time.
Follow the label instructions on your paint or wood stain to achieve the best results. In many cases, you may need to use several coats to produce an even finish.

, Arrange the crates in your planned design. Inspect the crates for stability. When the crates are in place, fasten the crates together with screws. Two screws connecting each crate to its neighbor at its corners should do the trick.Keep the crates steady while fastening them together. Crates screwed in incorrectly will be easily noticeable. Have a friend or family member hold the crates in place as you fasten them.

, Apply gentle pressure with your hand to test the balance of the crate shelf. Press on the inner parts of the shelf with gentle pressure. Increase pressure gradually. Add screws to crates that feel like they need more support., Measure the total height of your crate shelf with a tape measure. Mark this height on the wall where the shelf will be positioned. Screw the bracket into the wall so it can fasten the shelf to the wall. Screw the bracket into the top of the shelf.To prevent the shelf from damaging your wall, anchor the L-bracket into a stud. Find studs with a studfinder or other simple techniques.
Crate shelves can be somewhat light. If you don’t intend to fill your shelf with heavy items, like books, an L-bracket will keep your shelf from falling over.

, Crate shelves that are only a single crate high make excellent shoe storage spaces or as cubbyholes. Make these portable by attaching casters to the bottom four corners of the shelf. This can also be done larger crate shelves, like those shaped like bookshelves.


Casters or similar wheels can be purchased at your local hardware store or home center. These are generally attached by fastening the caster to the wood with screws., Cut a length of fabric 2 in (5 cm) larger than the top of your shelf on all sides. Align the fabric’s edge with a corresponding outer edge of the crate. Attach the fabric along the edge with staples. Repeat this along three of the four sides. Stuff cotton into the cover through the open edge. Staple this edge closed when enough stuffing has been added.


Check your crates for sturdiness before adding a comfortable fabric cover. The crate should easily support the weight of a normal person., Cut a piece of plywood to fit inside your crate and insert it to create dividers. Use wooden planks to make slatted dividers. Fasten dividers in place by screwing them into the crate at the top and bottom.,"

,
Wait 24 hours to several days to cure the finish.

,
Reassemble your cabinets.",How to Stain Cabinets," You will need them to be stored in another place for about a week.;
, If you don’t take all the hinges and knobs off, the stain won’t penetrate the entire area, and you may have inconsistencies and bubbles in your finish. Keep all the knobs and hinges in sealable plastic bags with the screws that attach them.

, Write in marker., Choose a bottom door and sand down the back to remove the original finish. Then, apply stain in several coats to adjoining sections so that you can see what color works best.

, If you can do this project outside or in a garage with a drop cloth, you will reduce your mess and make the inside of your house a lot more tolerable during the project.

, Buy a ventilation mask and wear safety goggles. Some cabinets are treated with formaldehyde, which shouldn’t be breathed in as it is sanded off.

, Start with 100 to 120 grit sandpaper and repeat with 200 grit sandpaper to remove the existing finish. Sand the doors, drawers and bases to remove the glossy sealant.

, Then, follow up by wiping the cabinets with a tack cloth.

, Tape off counters and walls with painter’s tape. Keep cleaning wipes nearby in case of spills or mistakes.

, You can also cut up old t-shirts or use old tube socks. Choose white fabric or fabric with very little dye left in it.

, Start with the bases of the cabinets. Then, move onto the doors and drawers.


It’s better to apply several thin coats than one thick coat, because the wood must slowly absorb the liquid or gel stain., Then, repeat with a second and third coat.

,,,, Screw the doors and doorknobs into the bases. Keep the area well ventilated for several weeks.

Read the oven’s instructions.,
Adjust the settings.,
Keep prepared food warm.,
Look for a humidity controller.,
Avoid cooking food in the warming drawer.",How to Use the Drawer Beneath an Oven1," The easiest way to know if your bottom drawer is simply a storage drawer is to read the instructions that came with the oven. If you don’t have the instructions, you can look up your oven model online and read about the product features. The bottom drawer is most likely a storage drawer if it doesn’t have settings or a heating element., Many warming drawers come with several temperature settings. Typically, there will be a setting for high, medium, and low temperatures. Seafood, poultry, and other types of meat should be kept at a medium or high setting. If you are cooking multiple foods at once, keep the finished food that requires the lowest temperature in the drawer., Warming drawers are typically used to help foods that are already warm, stay warm, instead of heating cold foods up. Use a warming drawer when you are cooking multiple foods at once and want one part of the meal that was prepared earlier to stay warm. For example, keep the dessert warming in the drawer while the main course is cooking., Warming drawers often come with a humidity controller. You can use this option to keep foods from drying out. For instance, keep your bread rolls in the warming drawer to prevent them from drying out, or adjust the humidity to keep your French fries crisp., A warming drawer is slightly different from a broiler. It does keep food warm, but it is not meant to cook the food. Attempting to cook food in the warming drawer can be dangerous because bacteria can develop at a low temperature.Some warming drawers have a slow cooker option. Read your manual to see if your oven has this option.

Know what ingredients teak oil products contain.,
Remove old finishes before applying the Teak oil.,
Don't believe the advertisements.,
Take the proper safety precautions.,
Gather the necessary materials.,
Remove the doors from their hinges.,
Apply masking tape to protect the paint around the cabinets.,
Buff the surface of the cabinets with steel wool.,
Wipe down the surfaces with mineral spirits.,
Pour about a pint of Teak oil into the metal coffee can.,
Use an up and down wiping motion to apply the oil.,
Check for drips then allow the first coat to dry.,
Use the same cleaning and application process for the doors.,
Apply subsequent coats as recommended on the Teak oil can.,
Allow the cabinets to dry completely before replacing the doors.,
Understand the importance of cleaning up properly afterwards.",How to Use Teak Oil on Kitchen Cabinets," First of all, there is very little oil in any of the commercial grade oil finishes. They are made up of a little oil mixed with mineral spirits and varnish.


The lingo in the cabinetmaking trade is “wiping varnish” due to the primary content. You can define it as thinned out varnish with a little teak oil mixed in.
This type of finish should be applied only to bare wood to achieve a nice finish. The wood can be stained as long as the stain is completely dry before you apply the oil.;
, Applying Teak oil finish over old finishes, such as varnish, lacquer, shellac, or polyurethane, is likely to result in a sticky finish that may take months to cure.


If the old finish is completely removed down to bare wood, you’ll have much better results.
Oil finishes are designed to penetrate the unfinished pores of wood. Applying over a finished surface, other than if original finish is Teak oil, is fruitless.

, When you see a television commercial about a polish or oil product to be used to “nourish” or “revitalize” your furniture, it’s baloney! You cannot “nourish” finished wood with these products. They are surface products loaded with silicone to create a shiny slick surface.

, Always use safety glasses for all home improvement projects. When using a solvent-based finish, use only in a very well-ventilated area and wear a painter’s mask when possible.

, To apply a Teak oil finish to your kitchen cabinets, you will needs:


Teak oil finish (Enough for several coats for the entire project. See can for coverage details)
Very fine (#0000) steel wool
Several sheets of 600 grit silicone-carbide sandpaper (the dark gray stuff)
Drop cloth or protective covering for work area
A supply of clean rags (t-shirt material works best)
Large metal can or metal bucket about half full of water
Empty metal coffee can or similar
Can of mineral spirits
Phillips and flat head screwdrivers
Masking or painters tape
Saw horses or other elevated surface for the cabinet doors when finishing
Household window cleaner

, If the cabinets are already installed, remove the cabinet doors by removing the hinges with a screwdriver. Set the doors aside. Since this is a wipe-on finish, it is easier to control its application.


You may leave the doors on if you choose, but it’s much easier to work with them removed.

, Mask off the wall along the edge where the cabinet is attached to the wall to protect the paint on the wall one or two widths should be enough.


If you do get some Teak oil on the painted wall, wipe it off immediately with a “dab” of mineral spirits.

, If the cabinets have been previously finished, take the #0000 steel wool and buff all surfaces to be finished. This will take some time, but be thorough.


After buffing, clean the surface with household window cleaner and wipe dry.

, Take a cloth dampened with mineral spirits and wipe down the surfaces. Wipe dry and allow about 10 minutes for any remaining mineral spirits film on the surfaces to evaporate.

, Make sure it's the one without any water in it. Dip a clean rag into the oil. “Wipe” it out a bit along the inside of the can to avoid heavy drips.

, Starting at the top of the cabinet end and working toward the bottom, use an up and down wiping motion, starting nearest the wall.


Wipe on vertical “rows” of finish, making sure to keep the wiping rag wet with Teak oil until your target surface is completely coated.
Do only one cabinet at a time, starting on each exposed end. Then, do the face frames.

, After applying one coat to one entire cabinet, check for drips. If you spot any, blend them into the finish with the rag. Then, move on to the next cabinet until all cabinets have one coat.


Allow to dry per the instructions on the can of Teak oil. If it calls for wiping off excess before drying, then follow the directions.

, The doors will take longer as there is an interior and exterior surface.


Do not give in to the temptation of “skipping” the interior because “no one will see it.” An unfinished surface will absorb humidity from the air and can warp the doors.
You can, however, get by with one base coat and one top coat on the interior for proper sealing of the wood.

, This tutorial recommends three coats minimum, but no more than four when applying the oil finish.


On the coat before the final coat, rub the entire surface with 600 grit silicone-carbide sandpaper while the finish is still very wet. You can dip the paper into the coffee can of Teak oil and “wet sand” that coat.
Then, on the final coat, apply with a rag as before. You will have a glassy-smooth finish when dry.

, Allow all cabinets and doors to dry completely before handling or you may leave fingerprints in the finish. When dry, carefully replace the doors.

, Properly cleaning up after using Teak oil or any other “oil” finish is extremely important. These finishes have one unique characteristic: the rags used for applying the finish often spontaneously combust!



Never throw old rags in the trash or on your floor when soaked with this product. Always put used rags into a metal can or bucket filled with water. Saturate the rags completely with water and set the bucket of water and rags in a safe place for several hours.
Rinse the rags in clean water a second time and then safely dispose of them. This seems like a lot of work, but it will prevent a fire.

Store baking and cooking supplies.,
Use the drawer for long items.,
Put small items into containers.,
Store special items in the drawer.",How to Use the Drawer Beneath an Oven2," Storage drawers are most often used for cooking supplies. For example, you can put your pots, pans, and skillets in this drawer. To get the most out of your space, invert the lids on pans to avoid the handles getting in the way of the door.Do not overload the drawer, or it will be difficult to easily retrieve whatever item you’re looking for.

, You can also use this drawer to store items that don’t easily fit in other storage containers because of their length. For example, you can put items such as barbecue grilling tools, servings trays, platters, and other serving utensils in this drawer. Though the drawer can store a variety of things, it is better to store things that are used to cook, bake, or serve food., Smaller items, like, utensils can easily get mixed up inside of a storage drawer. Use containers, dividers, or boxes to keep them in place. Store the items according to use., If your drawer is difficult to access, use it store items you only use on special occasions or for entertainment. You can store holiday cookie trays, or cooking utensils that aren’t commonly used. You may not want to keep expensive platters in this drawer just in case crumbs fall through."
"
Check the heating source.,
Read the instructions.,
Cook your food within 5 to 10 minutes.",How to Use the Drawer Beneath an Oven3," A bottom drawer broiler is most common in gas stoves. If you have a gas stove that has a bottom heating source, then your bottom drawer is most likely a broiler. The trays for the broiler will be a maximum of five inches from the heating source., If you are still not sure what your bottom drawer is meant for, the best way to know is to consult the instructions that came with the oven. The instructions will tell you if it is a pull-out broiler drawer and how to use it properly. You can most likely find instructions or product features for your brand of oven online if you no longer have the instructions., You can put the food on a grated broiler pan, or use a cast-iron skillet. Foods cooked in a broiler will typically be finished within 5 to 10 minutes. Foods like fresh vegetables that can be cooked quickly, thin-cut meats, and tender foods are best to broil because usually only the outer surface of the food is cooked.You can also cook foods in the oven first and then put them in the broiler to finish and vice versa.

,
Reattach the hardware and the drawers and doors.",How to Refinish Particle Board Cabinets," Place them on a piece of drop cloth or a sawhorse in a well ventilated area. You should choose to undertake this project when the weather is moderate and not too humid.;
, Label them according to the type and set them aside until the painting is done.

, Open doors, windows and have a shop vacuum nearby. Place drop cloths around the cabinet boxes.

, You should wear long sleeved shirts and long pants, safety goggles, a particulate mask and gloves when sanding.

, To increase your efficiency and improve results, buy a small sander, such as a mouse sander, at a home improvement store.


Your goal is to remove the shiny finish of the particle board. Try to sand evenly to avoid creating an uneven surface. The surface right underneath the finish can start to break away if sanded too hard.







, Wipe the surfaces of your cabinets with tack cloths. Keep the indoor areas covered, and place cardboard or drop cloths under your sawhorse.

, Kilz primer is highly recommended for this type of project, because it seals, primes and blocks stain. It sticks well to particle board.

, If you are doing both sides of a cabinet door, wait until it is dry before applying to the opposite side. Allow it to dry well before moving on to paint.

, Make sure you sand out any drips from the primer itself. Wipe again with a tack cloth.

, Check the reviews at consumer reports before buying, because a quality latex paint is necessary to adhere well to your laminate or particle board cabinets.


Make sure you test your paint colors before you apply them to your entire cabinet set. Test the inside of a door to ensure you like the look.







, Use a small foam roller set for doors and large areas of the cabinet box. Use a paint brush to get into the crevices and smaller areas.

, Apply a second coat.

, You can either choose a finishing wax or a clear lacquer. Apply 2 coats of the material of your choice according to package directions.

,, Remove the drop cloths and clean up the area around your cabinets using a shop vacuum and detergent.

Consider buying previously used cabinets or refinishing your own cabinets.,
Research cabinet companies in your area, or attend home improvement shows if you plan to replace your cabinets.,
Decide if you want stock, semi-custom or custom cabinets.,
Choose your eco-friendly materials in stock, semi-custom or custom options.,
Check on the finishing products that were used on all cabinet materials.,
Research if your cabinet choice is recognized by the Kitchen Cabinet Manufacturers Association Environment Stewardship Program (ESP).,
Choose a local wood supplier/cabinet company, if possible.,
Invest in durable materials.,
Recycle your old cabinetry, instead of dumping it in a landfill.",How to Choose Eco Friendly Cabinets," The best, most eco-friendly option is reuse. Replacing old cabinets adds potentially harmful finishing chemicals to landfills, so consider repainting, replacing just the doors or refinishing your cabinets with low volatile organic compound (VOC) products.;
, It helps to see the materials first hand when choosing cabinetry, instead of simply researching online. Many eco-friendly materials are fairly new to the market, so you may not have come across them before.

, These are the traditional ways that new cabinetry is sold.


Stock cabinets are sold as-is. Although you can order in a number of dimensions, the frame, design and colors are set and not customizable. This is usually considered the least expensive option.
Semi-custom cabinets allow you to make some choices that are customized to your room, such as adding cabinets with tambour doors or covering large appliances with cabinet doors for a unified look.
Custom cabinetry is usually provided by a carpenter. You choose the material and work with the carpenter and/or an interior designer to decide how you will maximize your cabinet space. The time, design and personalization of the cabinets means that this is usually the most expensive option.

, There are a number of environmentally conscious choices out there. However, your budget and your interior design may establish which choice is best for you.


Pick sustainably forested local wood. Wood that grows in your state or nearby supports your local economy and saves on the carbon footprint of the material associated with trucking wood over long distances. Look for wood that is certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). This private non-profit supports responsible sustainable forestry and supports wood that is sustainably forested.
Choose recycled wood. Recycled or refurbished wood can be taken from previous construction projects and used anew in your home. You can often refinish the wood. There are extra costs associated with procuring enough wood for your project, hiring a carpenter and refinishing the wood.
Pick cabinets made with medium density fiberboard (MDF). This common construction material can be made from 100 percent recycled materials. Inquire about the recycled content of the MDF before settling on your choice. This is often a less expensive option, because it is not made from raw wood.
Order wheatboard cabinets. One of the newest eco-friendly cabinet materials on the market, wheatboard is made of recycled wheat chaff. It is a sustainable, renewable resource.
Choose alternative materials to wood, such as recycled metal. Although metal is used more infrequently, sheets of scrap metal are an excellent eco-friendly choice, especially when made locally.

, Make sure no urea-formaldehyde was used, as it is a known carcinogen that can emit gas when heated and lower your indoor air quality. Look for models with low VOC.


Be extra cautious about VOC if you are choosing MDF or wheatboard products. Formaldehyde is naturally found in wood; however, urea-formaldehyde is commonly added to the resins and sealants that hold this material together. Research companies that state they have not added extra formaldehyde during the manufacturing and finishing process. If the company does not specify, it is likely that they use potentially toxic urea-formaldehyde formulas.

, Go to greencabinetsource.org to see a list of cabinet manufacturers that carry the ESP seal. There are over 150 cabinet manufacturers that carry this seal.

, Although this might be a more expensive option than ordering online, buying locally saves on transportation and carbon emissions. Inquire about where your local cabinet companies acquire their wood, to ensure they are using local sources instead of trucking the materials in.

, Buying cabinets that are more expensive, but last longer, will save you money on renovations in the future. It is also a greener option, since fewer used cabinets will make their way into a landfill.

, Inquire at building re-use centers around your area, or ask local cabinet companies if they have a cabinet recycling program.

Hand tools. You probably have scrapers, screw drivers, a hammer, sanding blocks, rags and sponges in your toolbox already, but it's a good idea to check.
Painter's tape (or masking tape). Planning what not to paint is more important than planning what to paint.
Newspapers, a canvas-style drop cloth, or other material to protect adjacent surfaces while working. Packing paper from a moving supply store, like U-Haul is good—it's like newspaper, without messy ink.
Paint stripper if required, TSP (Tri-Sodium Phosphate), and primer.
Quality paint brushes or a sprayer suitable for the finish you plan to use. Get the best brush you can afford—these may seem the same in the store, but the difference in brush strokes and quality of finish is striking.;
, It is much easier to work inside them, prep them, remove them if necessary, and of course, paint them, without loose stuff inside getting in the way.








,









Most shelves simply lift off of pegs or supports; some may need to be unscrewed or pried off their supports. If the screws are caked with old paint, clean out the channel with the tip of a knife or small screwdriver. Remove the screws, being careful not to slip and damage the channel, making it impossible to unscrew.
Lay out the cabinet doors in a grid on the floor so it’s easy to tell their proper places.

, Any grease remaining on the surfaces will interfere with refinishing.









TSP is the preferred product for this job, as it will clean and remove heavy grease deposits with a strong enough concentration to etch the paint so that it is ready to be primed. If you’d prefer an environmentally friendly alternative, try Simple Green.
Lightly sand any rough areas of bubbled or peeling paint or varnish, then sand entire surfaces until they are smooth and even. Take your time with this step—the results will be well worth the extra effort.
When done sanding, wipe the wood with a tack cloth (to remove all dust particles) and let dry. If the finish you are working with is an oil base product, you may dampen a cloth with mineral spirits or paint thinner, rather than water, which will allow it to dry much more rapidly.

, Unless you're replacing the hardware, cleaning it will help give your cabinets a fresher look.









Soak the hardware in a soapy water solution for 30 minutes, scrub lightly with a soft brush, rinse, let dry, and apply polish., Sometimes, in their haste for a nifty new kitchen, people would just slop a coat of paint over everything in sight, including the hardware. You have wisely chosen to restore that hardware to it's old glory.

Put the hardware in a crockpot, and cover with water. Add 2 tablespoons of liquid laundry detergent, set the heat to medium, and set the timer to 8 hours or longer. When the time's up, carefully remove the hardware, and peel off the paint.













If you're in a hurry, a solution of methylene chloride will strip the paint much faster, but it may also strip other finishes. DON'T put this in a crockpot. Apply directly to the hardware in a well-ventilated area while wearing neoprene safety gloves and eye protection. Leave for 10 minutes, then scrape the gel with a plastic putty knife.


Immediately clean off the hardware with a stiff toothbrush—otherwise the paint will start to harden again.













Buff with a beeswax polish to protect the surface, and repeat every 6 months. Do it in spring and summer, when you change your smoke alarm batteries!














, If you want to take the cabinets back to the original wood, apply a clear varnish or polyurethane finish or stain previously painted cabinets, you will have to strip all the paint off the cabinets using strong chemicals, followed by sanding.









This is a much bigger project and will take more than a long weekend.
Liquid strippers work best, but look for gel or semi-paste types because they won't drip as much when used on vertical surfaces. In order to choose the correct stripper, you also need to know what kind of finish you already have on your cabinets. Choose an obscure spot on the cabinets to put a few drops of the following substances:Turpentine or mineral spirits will dissolve a wax finish.
Denatured alcohol dissolves a shellac finish and latex paint.
Lacquer thinner dissolves a lacquer, polyurethane, or shellac finish.
Xylene or 'Xylol' will dissolve a water-based finish.

, Sand the putty smooth after it dries. Wipe the wood with a tack cloth (to remove all dust particles) and let dry.








, If you plan to use paint to refinish your cabinets, they will need to be primed first. Primers are paint products formulated allow new paint to bond with the old paint below it. The primer seals the wood, covering any blemishes, stains, knots, or anything else whose color might leech into the final paint coat. Here is a quick primer on primer:










Do you need to prime? If you are painting an unfinished surface, whether wood, drywall, concrete, or metal, needs to be primed before it is painted.

Pick the right primer. Many primers today will work on anything—ask the pros at the paint store what they recommend. A good rule of thumb is to match the primer with the paint: a shellac primer over latex paint, and an oil primer over oil paint. An exception to this would be applying water-based products over oil-based. This will not work.

Painting oil over latex? The question has been asked 1,000 times, whether it's ok to paint latex over oil, or oil over latex. The answer depends on who you ask, but the bottom line is this: properly prepped, you can paint anything over anything. Prepare your surface properly by cleaning and sanding and cleaning again, then apply a primer.The key is making sure that the surface that is being primed doesn't have a gloss, as paint—especially latex, will not stick to a glossy base, and you’ll have a much harder job to do in fairly short order.
Read the label of the bonding primer carefully. Check to see if it will bond latex to oil.

, This is the big moment, when you transform your kitchen from dull and dingy to hip and modern.









For the best finish, use a sprayer. It will give you a smooth, glossy, even appearance. The biggest drawback is that you have to mask everything in sight that is not going to be painted, as aerosol paint spray will get everywhere.
Use a brush. Using a high-quality brush, apply new paint (or varnish) within the time limit specified in the directions. Always brush in one direction, and don't lay it on too thick. 2 light coats is much better than one heavy layer.
Oil based paints tend to yellow over the years.
Paint additives like Flotrol can create better flow and reduce brush strokes in oil paints.
If you are re-varnishing kitchen or bathroom cabinets, consider a marine varnish which is more water repellent.

Allow the lacquer to dry for at least 30 minutes.

,
Fold a piece of 180-grit sandpaper twice and sand everything; the cabinets, the doors and the drawers.,
Apply another coat of lacquer.,
Re-hang the cabinet doors and install the drawers.

",How to Restore Oak Cabinets,";
,, Use a screwdriver to take off the hinges as well.

, You can purchase it at any hardware store or home improvement store.

, Let it soften the finish for about 15 minutes. The stripper should cause it to gel.

, Begin at the top of the cabinet and scrape downwards, allowing the finish to fall off the sides of the cabinet.


Repeat the chemical stripping and scraping on the exterior of all the cabinets you plan to restore.

, Repeat the process on the exterior of the drawers as well.


Lay the cabinet doors across a sawhorse for the best access.
Remember to wait 15 minutes after applying the chemical stripper to begin scraping. Scrape from the top to the bottom on the doors, the same way you did on the cabinets.

, Your sanding motion should go parallel with the grain of the oak.


Continue sanding until there is a smooth feel to the wood. All of the finish should be gone, and there should be no grooves or differences in texture after the cabinet is sanded.

, Remember to sand parallel with the grain of the wood, and continue sanding until the surface is smooth and consistent.

, Dip a staining sponge into a can of oak stain and wipe it over the cabinets generously. As soon as you get the stain onto the cabinets, wipe it off with a dry cloth.


Stain and wipe the doors and drawers the same way you applied the stain to the cabinets.

,, This can often be found in an aerosol spray can for easy application.


Hold the can 8 inches (20 cm) away from the cabinet and spray evenly in one direction. Continue spraying the entire cabinet going in one direction and then the other (back and forth instead of one end to the other end) until it is covered with lacquer.

, Spray it the same way you did the cabinets.

,, The lacquer should look less shiny and feel smooth when you touch it.

, Spray everything the same way you did with the first coat. Let it dry for a full 24 hours. This will allow the finish to set.

Apply a second coat if possible.,
Install the handles and other hardware when the paint is dry.",How to Paint Kitchen Cupboards," Pull all drawers out of the cabinets and remove any hardware connecting the drawers to the outer cupboard shells.






;
, Take the screws out of hinges and pull the doors off of frames. Once the doors are off, go back and remove any hardware attached to the cabinet frames.









This is also a good opportunity to assess the hardware that holds the cupboards together. Any screws, hinges or braces that look worn should be replaced after you paint the cupboards.

, Use a grease-removing cleaner and a sponge or soft cloth to remove dirt and stains before you paint kitchen cupboards. Rinse the cupboards with water and let them dry completely.









TSP, or trisodium phosphate, is a great industrial-grade cleaner that is sure to remove grease and grime from the surface of your cupboards. Since TSP can be harmful to the environment, you can also look for a TSP substitute instead.

, Whether you've got scratches, scuffs, gouges, or other unsightly marks, a professional looking cupboard painting isn't complete without a smooth surface. Be sure to let the compound dry.









Use a putty knife or other flat surface to skim off excess filler. It's better to over-apply than under-apply, as filler constricts somewhat when it dries. If you apply too little filler the first time, you can always go over the dent with another patch of filler.
At this point, decide if you want new handles on your cabinets. If the new hardware requires different size holes, or holes closer or farther apart, you'll need to fill the existing holes with wood filler and drill new holes before painting.

, Lightly rub all areas you will paint with a 120-grit sandpaper. This will help the primer and paint adhere better when you paint the cabinets.









Sanding is especially important for cupboards that have a shiny polyurethane coating on them. A new paint will peel quickly when applied on top of this shiny surface.

, Primer is an undercoat that's applied before the coat(s) of paint. Paint that is applied directly to wood will dry prematurely, as wood is very porous and soaks up the solvent quickly. For this reason, Primer helps paint adhere to it and dry slower, making the color more brilliant and the texture smoother.









Most experts stick with an oil-based primer. Oil-based primers can be used even if you intend to use latex-based paint to cover the primer. You'll need to let the primer dry completely, however, and roughen up the surface afterward with sandpaper.
If your cupboards are stained and old-looking, you may want to consider a cover stain primer. These primers are specifically designed to cover up unsightly stains, caused by mildew, smoke, and other irritants.

, Once the primer is completely dried, use a 240-grit sandpaper to go over the primer. Again, this will roughen up the surface and help the coat(s) of paint to bond to the primer.








, Tape around the inside edge of drawers or cabinets if you do not paint to bleed into the insides. Be sure to tape around ceiling edges or walls where the cupboards meet.








, Use a trim brush to paint all small cabinet frame areas, and continue painting inside the cupboards with a small roller or brush.








, Roll paint on the doors with a large roller brush to cover bigger areas at one time. Paint the edges of doors, cabinets and drawers with a small brush. Remember to paint the door and drawer backsides, as well.









Apply paint on thin to leave fewer visible brushstrokes. If you used a primer beforehand, thin brushstrokes should adequately cover the cupboard surface. Remember that you can also apply a second coat of paint.
You can take cupboard doors outside or to a garage and use a paint sprayer to coat them. Let one side dry, then flip them over and coat the other side.

, The first coat of paint should be given at least four hours to dry if another coat of paint will be applied over it.








, You don't need more than two coats of paint, especially if you have a primer on, but the difference between one coat of paint and two can be startling: It can be the difference between a decent job and a professional-looking job. Give the paint a whole day to dry.








, Re-attach all cupboard doors and drawers.

Decide what you want your liquor cabinet to look like.,
Consider where you want to store the liquor.,
Consider choosing one of the following popular liquor cabinets:

Choose an easily accessible cabinet in your home, or install a cabinet in your living room.,
Take stock of your favorite alcoholic drinks.,
Make a list of all the alcohol needed to make those 2 to 5 drinks.,
Buy 1 or 2 specialty liquors or liqueurs.,
Liqueurs are spirits with added sugar or flavorings.,
Buy a bottle of bitters, if you plan to mix drinks.,
Gather your mixers.,
Make or buy a bottle of simple syrup.,
Stock your glasses.,
Buy a shaker, shot glass, muddler and/or stirrer.,
Add napkins, toothpicks and any other things you like to serve with your cocktails.",How to Make your Own Liquor Cabinet," Despite the name ""cabinet,"" the place where you store your drink ingredients can be open, closed or in a larger structure, like a bar. A small liquor cabinet can simply be a kitchen cabinet, and a large bar can be purchased or specially made.
, If you have children, you may want to choose a cabinet that is up high or one that locks. If you want it to be on display, you may choose to display it in the living room rather than in the kitchen., You can find small cabinet compartments at Ikea or other box stores. Make sure it is well anchored into a stud in the wall, and not drilled into sheet rock. If so, it will fall with too much weight. With this method, you can choose a cabinet of any style and color and customize the size to the amount of bottles you plan to store.
Instead of a closed liquor cabinet, buy a small island or cart on wheels. Park it in your living room and place a tray on the top for your specialty glasses. Set a shaker to the side and stack your frequently used bottles on the bottom of the cart. This is best if you have a few favorite drinks or if you want a classy or antique looking liquor cabinet.
Set up a tiki bar. You can find bamboo or wicker furniture, including full bar structures for a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. Most bars come with cabinets behind the bar as well as a surface to store glasses, swizzle sticks and shakers. Place stools in front of the bar so that you have somewhere to enjoy your drinks close to your liquor cabinet. You can also choose a bar of almost any theme, such as cafe, sports or travel.

, Make a list of all the drinks you know how to mix. Then, put a star by the 2 to 5 drinks that you have most often., For example, you may choose whiskey, vodka, gin, rum, vermouth, brandy or tequila, or any mixture of these liquors that are commonly found in mixed drinks. Buy this short list of liquors as a base for your cabinet.

Liquors are a grain, vegetable or other food that has been distilled into a spirit. They usually have no added sugar, so they are used as the base for drinks that also feature mixers or liqueurs.

, Common choices are Triple Sec, Grand Marnier, amaretto or Kahlua. Only buy these liqueurs if you use them in a mixed drink, or if you enjoy them as an aperitif or a digestif., As well as being used as an addition to many mixed drinks, some popular liqueurs are served alone or on ice before or after dinner. An aperitif is a liqueur served before dinner and a digestif is a liqueur served after dinner., Bitters are a concentrated liqueur that are often added to mixed drinks, such as Manhattans, Sazerac and some martinis. You can buy flavored bitters, such as orange, lime, mint, lemon and even chocolate to add to specialty drinks., It is a good idea to keep 1 unopened bottle of your commonly used mixers in your liquor cabinet. For example, keep a small bottle of tonic water, seltzer, cranberry juice or lime juice., You can buy sealed bottles of simple syrup in most liquor stores.

Make simple syrup at home by combining water and superfine sugar in a ratio of 1 to 1 in a small saucepan. Heat on medium until it is completely dissolved. Bottle it and store it in the refrigerator. You can also increase the ratio of sugar to water to create a thicker, richer syrup.

, Most cocktails have a specialty glass in which they are served. Order them online, find them in stores, or buy a small collection of any 8 oz. sized glasses instead., Keep anything in your cabinet that helps you make your cocktails. You will need to clean them well after use and before placing them back in our liquor cabinet., Condiments, such as cherries or olives will need to be stored in the refrigerator and accessed before serving."

Move your cabinet back indoors.

",How to Paint a Metal Cabinet," Remove anything that may be in the drawers of the cabinet. Clean the cabinet well with a damp cloth. Allow the cabinet time to dry. Use fine sandpaper and go over the cabinet to remove any loose paint or rust. Sanding will help the new paint to stick better.;
, You may choose to use a special spray paint that is made just for painting on metal. Purchase a primer for metals that prevents rust. Purchase the kind of paint and the new color you would like for your cabinet. Read the label on the paint can to determine how much spray paint you need to buy.

, Paint the drawers separately from the cabinet. You may choose to only paint the front of the drawers. Decide if you want to paint the handles. If not, you will need to either remove them or cover them with painter's tape.

, Put something under the cabinet to protect the ground, such as newspaper or a drop cloth. Be aware of anything that is outside that might get stuck in the paint.

, Shake the paint can several times as you are applying the paint.

, Apply 1 coat of primer. Allow the primer to dry completely before applying the top coat of paint.

, Spray the cabinet holding the can several inches (cm) away from the cabinet. Use a steady back and forth motion with the can. Spray light coats of paint. If you get the paint too thick, it will run down the side of the cabinet.

Make sure your cabinet is a 45 degree corner or straight cabinet.,
Measure for the diameter of the Lazy Susan.,
Measure the depth of your cabinet.,
Measure your cabinet’s opening.,
Measure the cabinet’s inside height.",How to Measure for a Lazy Susan1," The former is found in the kitchen corner, usually sitting at a 45 degree angle between two walls. Straight cabinets are more typical and found throughout the kitchen.;
, If your cabinet is a perfect square, stretch a tape measure from one wall to the opposite wall for this diameter. If your cabinet is rectangular, use the width for this measurement. You’ll want to ensure the Lazy Susan has about 2 inches of clearance all the way around, so that it can spin more effectively.As such, choose a Lazy Susan with a diameter about 2 inches shorter than your cabinet on each side.


For a full-round Lazy Susan, this is the only measurement you’ll need. As long as its diameter is a few inches shorter than the width of your cabinet, it will fit comfortably in your cabinet.

, Since a D-Shaped Lazy Susan has a flat side, its depth will be slightly shorter than the diameter.Check the hardware specifications for the Lazy Susan you plan to order; this will let you know what kind of depth you need for the cabinet. Starting a few inches in from the cabinet opening, use a tape measure to get the cabinet’s depth. This will give you an idea of where the Lazy Susan will sit in the cabinet.

, This measurement needs to fit the length of the D-shaped Lazy Susan’s flat side to ensure it sits comfortably within the cabinet. Start at one end of the cabinet opening and measure to the other: no need to subtract inches here.

, While most Lazy Susans come with a telescoping central shaft, they usually have a minimum and maximum cabinet height requirement.To take this measurement, start with your tape measurer at the very bottom of the cabinet measuring up to the very top.

Assess your needs.,
Establish a budget.,
Measure your space.,
Create a layout plan.,
Compare the different types of bathroom cabinets.,
Consider installation.,
Decide on a style.",How to Select a Bathroom Cabinet," Cabinets in a bathroom may be used for decorative purposes, for storage or to house plumbing or utility features. Decide what, exactly, you want out of your bathroom cabinet design. For example, a typical bathroom cabinet may serve as a place to hang robes, store folded towels and display a perfume collection.;
, Setting a cost limit before you shop can help you narrow down your options and settle on a cabinet that is well-suited for you. The more specific your budget is, the easier it will be to identify which cabinets you have to choose from.

, Also measure door and window openings, as well as existing fixtures.

, Remember that bathroom cabinet units average from 18 inches (45.72 cm) to 48 inches (121.92 cm) wide. You will need ample wall space for the width and height of the cabinet you choose, plus enough space to open any cabinet doors and to allow for easy passage through the bathroom. Follow these instructions to create a to-scale floor plan:


Sketch the bathroom measurements on a piece of graph paper.
Mark the doors, windows and bathroom fixtures on your sketch.
Make to-scale templates for a variety of bathroom cabinet sizes and arrange the templates on the sketch until you are satisfied that you know which cabinet size(s) will fit comfortably into the bathroom.

,

Closet cabinets are floor-to-ceiling units with doors, and have the appearance of built-in furniture. They may be used as linen closets, or to conceal washer/dryer units or water heaters.






Base cabinets are freestanding cabinets that sit on the floor. These cabinets come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, and can be placed anywhere in the bathroom.






Wall cabinets are hung on the wall, usually over a bathroom fixture. For example, medicine cabinets are narrow units that are generally placed within reach from the sink area, while open-shelved cabinets may be installed over the toilet area for toilet tissue storage.







, While base cabinets may be set anywhere on the bathroom floor, closet and wall cabinets will require some labor and expertise when it comes to installation, as they must be firmly attached to the wall's studs for safety.

, A bathroom cabinet should fit into its environment, so you will want to choose cabinetry that complements your home's existing furniture and architectural details. Consider the following design elements:

Doors. You may opt for open-shelved cabinets, which have no doors, or for decorative glass or solid doors.






Material. Bathroom cabinets come in a wide array of materials, including wood, plastic, wicker, glass, bamboo, porcelain and laminate.






Accessories. Pay attention to things like drawer pulls, door handles, cabinet tops and mirrors, as these details contribute to the cabinet's aesthetic and style.

Ensure you have a blind corner kitchen cabinet.,
Use a retractable tape measure to find the cabinet’s inside depth.,
Measure the depth of your cabinet.,
Check the size of your cabinet’s opening.,
Finish by measuring the inside height of the cabinet.",How to Measure for a Lazy Susan2," Half-round (also known as half moon) Lazy Susans are designed specifically for these cabinets, which are quite long. These are the kinds of cabinets that have only one door occupying half of their length. The half-round Lazy Susan is typically attached to the door, sliding out as it is opened.


Keep in mind that if your kitchen cabinets have face frames, you’ll need to allow more leeway in the below measurements for the Lazy Susan to open properly.

, Stretch it along the underside of the cabinet, from the left wall to the right. Set it in place, lock it and record the measurement.


For the best fit, you’ll typically want a Lazy Susan with a total length one or two inches shorter than this measurement., Placing your tape measure at the cabinet’s opening, extend it until it touches the back wall. Record this measurement and compare it to the radius of the Lazy Susan you plan to order. You’ll want the Lazy Susan’s radius to be a bit shorter than the depth of your cabinet, usually between 3 to 4 inches., Stretch a measuring tape over the opening and note the measurement. Make sure it is slightly larger than the radius of the Lazy Susan.This will ensure the Lazy Susan has sufficient space to swivel out as you open the cabinet doors.

, While half-round Lazy Susans come with a metal shaft that adjusts to various cabinet heights, they usually have a minimum and maximum height. Measure the inside of your cabinet, bottom to top, and ensure it falls within this range.

Measure the depth of the cabinet.,
Use the depth of your cabinet to find its center.,
Measure the distance from the center of the cabinet to the inset corner of the cabinet’s opening.,
Measure the distance between the cabinet’s opening and the center.,
Finish by measuring the cabinet’s inside height.",How to Measure for a Lazy Susan3," These cabinets are found in kitchen corners and have folding doors. Kidney shaped Lazy Susans are designed specifically for these cabinets.Ensure you have a cabinet fitting this description before attempting to measure it.

, Place the tape measure at the opening, and stretch it until it touches the back wall. Record this measurement, which will usually be about 10 inches shorter than the Lazy Susan’s diameter., This can be done by placing a tape measure on either side of the cabinet’s opening, where the wall ends. Starting here, stretch out the tape measure until it touches the opposite wall of the cabinet. Record this measurement as the cabinet’s depth.


As the Lazy Susan needs about an inch or 2 of clearance on either side to rotate smoothly, the depth of your cabinet minus 3 to 4 inches will give you the maximum diameter your cabinet can fit for a Lazy Susan.

, Repeat the previous step, as if you were measuring the cabinet’s depth. Dividing this measurement by two will help you find the center. Mark this point with a pencil. Then use a ruler to draw a straight line, perpendicular to the measurement you just took, connecting this point to the far wall of the cabinet.


Next, use your tape measure to measure the cabinet’s depth once more, this time from the opposite side of your cabinet’s opening. This means the tape measure should now run perpendicular to the measurement you previously took.
Divide this measurement by two, finding its center. Mark this point with a pencil.
Now draw a line from this point, away from the cabinet’s opening, perpendicular to the measurement you just took.
The lines you’ve drawn should now intersect at one point. This is the center of the cabinet.

, From the center you’ve drawn, bring your tape measure to the corner of the cabinet’s opening in a straight line. Compare this measurement to the minimum requirement on the Lazy Susan you plan to install., Start with a tape measure at the cabinet’s opening and run it along the inside wall until it lines up with the cabinet’s center. This measurement will also need to be compared to the minimum requirements for the Lazy Susan, so it spins smoothly in the cabinet.


You can erase the pencil lines after taking this measurement.

, Start from the very bottom of the cabinet, stretching a tape measure until it touches the top. Compare this to the height range for the Lazy Susan.

Choose which door to make.,
Pick the correct material to fit your doors.,
Use solid wood for a door when you make a panel door.,
Build a flat (raised panel) door for a quality look.,
Change the bit to a coping or stick bit.,
Determine the dimensions of the panel by measuring from the outside edges to the beginning of the rollover (or bead).,
Place rubber space balls (available at most woodworking supply stores) into the groove you created with the router style bit.,
Apply glue to the tenon of the rails and slide the second stile into place.,
Sand the door, finish as desired, install the hardware and hang the new cabinet door on the cabinet frame.

",How to Make Cabinet Doors," There are two basic types of cabinet doors -- slab and flat panel -- most often chosen. You should consider the need for speed of construction, durability, ease of cleanup and maintenance.

, Most slab doors are made of plywood. Use MDF (medium density fiberboard) on a painted or a covered surface for a wood grain look.

, This is done by either gluing up a panel to the width and length you need or by using a solid piece that has been specially milled for you. However, you need to know that this is usually cost prohibitive.


Lay out the dimensions of the door on your choice of sheet material.






Cut the door from the sheet using either a circular saw or a table saw.






Ease the edges of the face with a router using the bit of your choice.






Put on the desired finish, install the hinges and doorknob and you are ready to hang the cabinet door.







, You need to realize that this type of cabinet door requires more tools, skill and time to create. However, the finished results can be very rewarding if you are willing and ready to step up to the challenge. Panel doors consist of two stiles (side pieces) and two rails (top and bottom) along with a panel that sits between them.


Cut the stiles and the rails from 4/4 (2.54 cm) material - if you can - and mill or plane down the material to a consistent width of .75 inches (2 cm). Accuracy and consistency of width assures a good fit.
The rails need to be approximately .5 inches (1.2 cm) less than the stiles. The width depends on the project and the look you want for your cabinets.
Make the stiles blanks the length you need and then run the inside edge through a stile router bit mounted on a router table.






Cut the rails to the length you need. Determine this length by measuring from the outside edge of the stiles to the beginning of the round-over, or bead, you made with the router bit. Subtract this from the width of the opening, then cut the rail blanks to length. Run the inside edge through the router using the same bit you used earlier.;
, The coping bit creates a secure and tight fit of the rail to the stile. Now, run the ends of the rails through the bit.

, Subtract that distance from the total height and width of the door. A flat door panel will usually be made from .25-inch (.6 mm) plywood - the same wood type as the rest of the cabinet.


Cut the door panel insert slightly less than the size you need to allow for wood expansion and contraction. Ordinarily, this will be the width of a table saw blade.
Begin assembly of the door by applying glue with a brush to the inside of the stile where the rail meets it and insert the rail tenon.

, Insert the panel.

, Clamp the pieces together, and allow the glue to dry.

Empty the closet.,
Measure your closet.,
Locate the studs.,
Scribe the first board or baseboard.,
Attach the first board.,
Finish the field.,
Attach the sidewalls.,
Install the top board.,
Add molding.",How to Line a Closet with Cedar1," Remove everything from the closet, including clothes, stored items, racks, hangers, and molding. If there is any shelving at the top of the closet, you should remove that as well. This will help you get accurate measurements and make it easier to install the cedar lining.If there is any molding around the baseboard or ceiling, you should remove it with a pry bar and reinstall it once the closet is lined. However, if the molding is thicker than the boards, you do not have to take it out.;
, Once the closet is empty, take a tape measure and determine the dimensions of the closet. If you want to line the entire closet, you will need to measure all of the walls, as well as the ceiling and floor. However, you can also choose only to line the walls or specific walls in the closet.Once you have the measurements, go to your local hardware store and purchase enough eastern red cedar tongue-and-groove boards.
The more cedar that you have in your closet, the less likely you are to have moths and insects ruining your clothes.

, Use a stud finder and a pencil to locate and then mark the studs in your walls from floor to ceiling. Then use a level to draw a plumb line at each stud. If you do not have a stud finder, you can start in the corner of the closet and measure the walls in 16-inch (40.64 cm) increments. Then drill a small hole or pound in a small nail to determine if there is a stud every 16 inches. It is important that you locate the studs so that you know where to nail the cedar boards to your walls.Although 16 inches (40.64 cm) is a good rule of thumb, not all studs are placed at this distance. In some old houses the studs may be as much as 24 inches (60.96 cm) apart.If you cannot locate the studs, you can still attach the boards to the walls with construction adhesive.

, Starting with the back wall, you should use a level to check to see if the floor or baseboard is sloped. If it is, you will need to scribe the board to that slope. Hold a board against the wall, above the baseboard or floor with the tongue side up, and level it. Then take a scribe or a compass and mark the largest gap between the board and the baseboard or floor. Finally, use a jigsaw to cut the board and then measure it against the wall to make sure it is plumb.It is important that you check the level of the first board on each wall before you begin attaching boards.

, Beginning with the board at the back of the closet, apply a zigzag of construction glue on the back of the board and press it in place. Press against the board from the middle to the edges to help it seal evenly. Starting at one edge of the board, take your nail gun and place a nail at a 45-degree angle through the tongue of the board and into the stud. This will keep the board in place, hide the nail, and ensure that the nail does not get in the way of the tongue of the next board.Be sure to check your level as you nail in the board.
If you do not have a stud to nail to, shoot two nails next to each other at opposite angles to keep the board upright as the glue dries.

, Follow the first board and begin installing the rest of the wall. Be sure to measure the length of the wall for each subsequent row and, using a miter box and saw, cut the boards to fit. Dry-fit each board before applying adhesive and positioning it on the wall. Make sure the boards are plumb before nailing them to the wall.Because the ends of the boards have rabbits to help them interlock with the board beside them, you should try to use the cut-off of one board to start the next row.

, Once you finish the back wall, continue onto the sidewalls. Use the miter box and saw to make the edge of the boards cover the corners. You should also make sure that the side rows line up with the back wall rows.If there is a little gap in the corners, fill the space with some caulk.

, If the remaining space between the top row and the ceiling is less than ¼-inch (6.35 mm), you can cover it with molding. However, if the space is bigger than that, you will need to install a top board that is plumb with the ceiling. Measure the gap and subtract 1/8 (3.72 mm) of an inch, this will help the board slide into place easily. Then use a jigsaw to cut the top board. Tip the board into place, sliding it over the tongue, and nail it to the wall., Use a miter box and saw to cut a piece of cove molding to go across the back wall. Make sure to cut the ends at a 45-degree angle and tack the molding to the back wall. Miter the sidewall molding at the same angle and attach them to the wall. You can also install molding at the bottom of the wall in the same way."

Add cedar drawer liners.,
Use a cedar clothes hamper.,
Find cedar hangers and racks.",How to Line a Closet with Cedar2," If you have shelves or drawers in your closet, you can add cedar liners to boost the cedar scent. Liners will ensure that your clothes that are in drawers also smell like cedar. They will also add extra protection against insects.You can buy liners online or pick them up at your local hardware store.
If you want to make the liners yourself, measure your drawers and then use a saw to cut cedar boards that fit the bottom of the drawers.

, A clothes hamper with cedar supports will keep your dirty clothes smelling pleasant. In addition, a cedar hamper is a particularly good idea because moths eat the dried sweat and flakes of skin that are in soiled clothes. This will protect your clothes when they are their most attractive to insects., Hanging your clothes from cedar hangers adds an extra level of insect protection. The hangers and racks will match your cedar walls and add to the overall cedar aroma. In addition, cedar hangers and racks not only look and smell nice, they also keep insects out of your delicates.You can find cedar racks at your local hardware store and cedar hangers online.

Inspect the walls.,
Rub the cedar with sandpaper.,
Apply cedar oil.",How to Line a Closet with Cedar3," If you have a cedar closet and notice that it does not smell of cedar, as it should, you should inspect the walls. You may find that the cedar is very old and needs a little treating. You may also find that the lining is not actually cedar. If you find that the lining is actually cedar veneer or a wood laminate, you may want to install real cedar boards., To replenish your cedar’s scent, gently sand it with a fine-grit sandpaper. To avoid damaging the wood, you should consider sanding the walls by hand. Because some people are sensitive to cedar dust, you should wear a mask, eye protection, and cover your skin while sanding.You can find sandpaper and a dust mask at your local hardware store.

, If your cedar walls have lost some of their scent, you might take a rag and rub them with some cedar oil. This will help bring back the wood’s smell and make its color more vibrant. Depending on the age and condition of the wood, you may need to repeat this process regularly.You can find cedar oil at your local hardware store.

,


Measure the cabinet lip.
Measure the cabinet from the hinge. The hinge might lessen the drawer's clearance, so be sure to measure from the widest part of the hinge.
Measure the inside of the cabinet. Measure from all corners of the cabinet because your cabinet might be a little off.
Measure the cabinet height from the lip, if installing a double stacked drawer system.

,


A 14"" drawer: This means that the drawer is 14"", but the sliding mechanism may be wider. Be sure the slide drawer does not exceed the hinge's clearance measurement.
You do not need to get wood large enough to fill the entire cabinet; you need wood large enough for the base of the drawer to be secured to the base of the cabinet. Get these measurements if you want to save money/resources.

, Unless you are one of the lucky few who can find wood exactly the height you need or don't mind spending money, you will need to ""build"" the layers to match the height of the cabinet's lip. This can be done through using scrap wood, solid foam insulation, or other such materials.


If you use foam materials, be aware that the material will have some give, especially once it is screwed down and as more weight is added on top.
If you happen to have old wood flooring or MDF, use it!
Look at the various types of wood at your local hardware store. The prices vary greatly for similar products.

, Most large hardware stores will cut the wood you purchase to size. Otherwise, mark the wood and make the necessary cuts.


If necessary, sand the cut wood edges smooth.

, The easiest way to do this is to place the wood inside the cabinet. If it does not fit, you can re-measure to see where/how it is off and make adjustments accordingly.Image:Install a Slide Drawer in a Lipped Cabinet Step 6 Version 2.jpg
,, This is to protect the original wood finish from the glue/adhesive you should use in the next step. The cabinets may be old enough that you do not care about preserving it; if so, you may skip this step.

, This is done to limit the amount of adhesive that accidentally gets sprayed onto the walls of the cabinet.

",How to Install RTA Cabinets," Proper measuring is key. Many companies offer software that will take the dimensions of your kitchen and calculate measurements and cabinet layout. If you are doing it yourself, you will need to make a diagram with the exact dimensions of your room, of the cabinets and your appliances.
, Pay attention to any uneven spots in the floor or wall as the cabinets may need to be shimmed for even installation., Use an electronic stud finder to find and mark the location of the studs., A cam lock and glue construction make these very easy to assemble. Open each box, examine the contents, lay the pieces out on the floor according to the diagram, run a bead of glue, along the joining pieces, insert in the groove and simply use a screwdriver to lock the cam lock., Measure from the corner to your first stud on the wall and then mark the cabinet as well. Pre drill each. Use a wood T brace to prop up the cabinet and screw the cabinet into the wall, loosely. This corner cabinet may have to be pulled out from the wall a bit, so measure according to the initial design., Clamp the two together, make sure every thing is plumb and tighten the cabinets to the wall. Continue this on all the upper cabinets., Often they will need to be cut to size. They will then be attached by screwing through the inside of the cabinet., Always begin with the blind corner cabinet. Measure the studs, pre-drill and loosely attach to the wall.,,,"

Sand the outside of your cabinets.,
Prime and paint or stain the doors.",How to Hang Cabinet Doors," If you took the hinges off of the door at the start, then you should be able to find the original screw holes. Line the hinges up with those holes and use a hand drive screwdriver to attach them. New doors may or may not have pre-drilled holes for the hinges.


When working with new doors that have never had hinges attached, carefully use a power drill to drill holes for the screws. Make the holes very shallow so you don’t drill through the front of the door.
Look for a mark of some kind, or read the instructions that came with the cabinets, to determine where the hinges need to go.
If you are working with hinges that stay together as one piece, attach them to the door before you attach them to the cabinet. Some hinges will come into two pieces and you’ll attach one to the door and one to the cabinet itself.;
, There are at least a few types of cabinet doors, which include overlay doors and partial inset doors. The type of door and the type of hinges determines the best way to attach the door.If the inside of the door is flat, it is probably an overlay door. If there is a ridge on the inside of the door that would rest inside the cabinet, it is a partial inset door. You can hold the door up against the cabinet to see how it fits.
For a partial inset door, move it around to see it if fits tightly in the cabinet opening or if there is room to move it around. This will affect how you position it when you hang it.
The type of door you have will determine where the hinges go, to an extent. Some hinges will attach to the face of the cabinet, while others will attach inside the cabinet.

, This will help you determine where the hinges attach to the cabinet. If you find holes on the outside or on the inside, that will tell you where the hinges go. If you don’t find holes, it’s good to consult the instructions if you have them. You may need to drill holes.


If you can’t find holes anywhere, and you don’t have instructions, you’ll have to do a little bit of guesswork to determine exactly where the hinges attach.
With doors that inset, there is a pretty small margin of error for where you could place the hinges. With overlay doors, your goal is to center the door on the cabinet opening.

, Have someone help you hang the door. If you attach the hinges to the inside of the cabinet, the door will have to be open, so having someone hold it while you insert the screws will help a lot.


This is the part where you have to move the door and use your own judgment to align the door straight. Using a small level can help you align the door.
It can be helpful to put 1 screw in each hinge and see if the door hangs straight and swings open smoothly. If not, you can remove the screw from one of the hinges, adjust the door slightly, and then replace the screw.
When you feel that the door is aligned, insert the rest of the screws into the hinges. Test the door by opening and closing it a few times to see if it moves smoothly.

, Some cabinets include a latch which keeps the cabinet door shut. This might be a magnetic piece, a roller, or some other type of latch. These are usually attached to the top corner of the door on the opposite side from the hinges. The second part of the latch should be attached to the corresponding spot on the cabinet.


This is an optional step because not all cabinets need a latch to stay closed. Even if your cabinets did not come with latches, you can buy some at a hardware store.
The holes on the latch pieces where the screws go are often slotted so you can move the screws around as needed. You have the ability to adjust the placement so the latch pieces connect.

, Some cabinets do not have knobs. The type of handle may determine how you attach it to the door. For upper cabinets, be sure to attach the handle near the bottom of the door. For lower cabinets, the handle should go near the top.


Cabinets which feature a handle or knob should have pre-drilled holes which show you where the handle goes. You’ll most likely attach the screws on the inside of the door.

, Open the door that you already hung up. Stretch a piece of tape from the hinged corner of the door across the lower front edge of the rest of the cabinets. You want roughly half of the tape to be covered by the door and half of the tape to be visible.


Make this tape line as level as you can. You can use a level to guide as you stretch it out.

, Holding the level against the bottom of the first cabinet door, draw a line under the opening for the second door. This line will give you the proper angle to match the second door up to the first door., Follow all of the steps from the previous section to hang the second door. Align the bottom of the door with the mark you made along the tape guideline. Once the door is up, place the level along the bottom of both doors to ensure they are aligned.

, As you move down the line of cabinets, you can draw a level guideline for each cabinet door. You can also check to make sure that each door you hang stays level with the one before it.

, Use drop cloths to reduce the mess. If the weather is nice and warm, you can work outside, but if you work inside it is best to cover things well. If you are doing a lot of doors, you may want to do a few at a time to reduce the clutter.


If you have doors containing glass, it’s a good idea to tape some paper over the glass to protect it from stains. You’ll also want to be careful as you move these doors around so you don’t break the glass.

, You will be sanding and painting the doors, and this is much easier to do with only the wooden door. Use a screwdriver, electric or hand drive, and take off all the hinges and knobs or handles. Set these aside for when you put them back on.These are most likely interchangeable between doors, but you can mark them in some way if you want to put them back with the same door they were on.

, Whenever you refinish wood, it is a good idea to give it a thorough sanding first. You can use a few coarseness levels to get the job done. Using a sanding block for all of the flat areas will save you time.Sanding serves two main purposes: it removes old paint or stain and roughs the surface up for new paint or stain. Don’t go overboard and take a half inch off the doors, but make sure that all of the old paint or stain is gone.
When you finish, the doors should have a smooth, dull look to them.

, If you want to paint your cabinet doors, it is always good to give them a coat of primer. It helps the paint stick. If you stain them, you don’t need any other product, but you may want to put two or three coats on for a full coverage.


Be sure to cover any surface that you paint over.
Allow the cabinet doors to dry before you hang them up.
If you painted the doors, you may want to use a nail or other thin instrument to gently poke all of the screw holes to clean the paint out so it doesn’t dry and clog the holes.

Lay a straight edge on the bottom shelf of the cabinet.,
Move the straight-edge on to the bottom shelf.,
Measure the actual height of the cabinet opening (from the surface of the bottom shelf).,
Make new reference marks.,
Take measurements from between your reference marks.",How to Hang Sheet Metal in Your Cabinets1," Measure the inside surface of the cabinet, by first laying a straight-edge face flat on the bottom shelf of the cabinet with one end of the straight-edge sticking out of the cabinet a few inches.


Slowly close the cabinet door until it is lightly touching the straight-edge.
Mark a pencil mark on the door where it touches the straight-edge.
Move the straight-edge over at least a couple of inches and make a second mark.;
, Now, place your straight-edge on the bottom shelf with its face against the vertical stile (vertical piece of the face frame) opposite the hinged edge of the door.


As before, it should stick out a few inches.
Hold it as parallel with the side of the cabinet as possible so it’s close to 90 degrees to the face frame of the cabinet.
Again, slowly close the door until it just touches the straight-edge.
Mark a pencil mark on the door where it touches the straight edge.
Raise the straight-edge at least a few inches and make a second mark.

, From the pencil mark near the bottom of the door, use that measurement and make a pencil mark at that point near the top of the door, then make a second one a few inches apart from the first one.


You should now have two marks near the bottom of the door, two near the top, and two along the opened edge of the door.

, Create new reference marks by measuring up ½” from the bottom marks, ½” down from the top marks, and ½” in toward the center of the door from the vertical edge marks.


From the new reference marks you just made, line them up with a straight-edge and connect them with a pencil line. Do this along all three edges.
These lines represent the size of your piece of sheet metal.

, Measure the spaces between your reference marks be sure you stay BETWEEN the hinges and the outer line on the door.


By taking these measurements once, you have established the vertical measurement for all the cabinets of the same height in your kitchen.
For cabinets of different widths, measure from the outer edge of the “model” door to the vertical pencil line.
Measure that same distance on the other doors and make your reference points.
This process will prevent the sheet metal from contacting the face frame of the cabinet.
For frameless cabinets, you can use the straight-edge easily at the top, bottom and side without the encumbrance of a face frame.
Always remember to measure between the hinge location inside the door and the outer reference line so your sheet metal does not touch the hinges!
If the cabinet door has a separate panel within a frame, you can cut the metal to fit the size of the panel (inside surface of the panel) without doing all the measuring and marking.
Do not make the sheet metal larger than the panel, or the metal will not attach flatly to the inside of the door.

Buy your sheet metal.,
Transfer your measurement to your sheet metal.,
Cut the metal with your tin snips.,
File sharp edges down.,
Clean the interior surface of the cabinet door.",How to Hang Sheet Metal in Your Cabinets2," You can purchase sheet metal at any home improvement store.


Sheet metal typically comes in a variety of pre-cut sizes.
Choose the size closest to the size you will need.
You will likely have to cut it to size or have someone at the store do it for you.
It should be about the thickness of a sheet of poster paper. If it’s too thick, it will be very difficult to cut and be more expensive.
Be sure you are not buying sheet aluminum! They look similar, but aluminum is not magnetic.

, Transfer the horizontal and vertical measurements from the reference marks you made on the door onto the sheet metal, and draw lines where you will cut.


Use a Sharpie® ,as it will easily make a solid line on the sheet metal.
You can wipe it off with window cleaner later.

, Cutting your metal requires a pair of tin snips, usually under $10 at your home improvement store.


Put on your leather work gloves, because cutting sheet metal creates very sharp edges. As you cut with the tin snips, chances are your hands will come in contact with a freshly cut edge.
Cut your metal as you would cut a sheet of poster board with scissors.
Go slowly and do not completely close the tips of the tin snips at the end of each “snip,” as this tends to create a sharp “tooth” along the cut line.
Complete the vertical and horizontal cuts and carefully discard the excess.

, Use a file to remove all sharp edges along both surfaces of the metal.


Also, slightly round the sharp corners.
Very carefully, feel the edges to make sure they are smooth.

, Before you attach the sheet metal panel, clean the interior surface of the cabinet door and the mounting surface of the sheet metal.


It is likely that the sheet metal is treated with an oily film when it comes from the factory, and adhesive will not stick properly to oily or greasy surfaces.
Use a household window cleaner to clean metal and the cabinet door.

"
"
Spray or roll a thin coat of contact adhesive on the metal and door.,
Hold the sheet metal about halfway up with your fingers against the sticky surface.,
Bond the whole surface.",How to Hang Sheet Metal in Your Cabinets3," Apply contact adhesive to both surfaces to be joined.


If you made reference lines on the door, keep the adhesive within those lines.
Do not join the two pieces at this time.
Allow the adhesive to set for about 10 minutes or until your finger barely sticks to the coated surface.

, Your fingers will act as “spacers” as you line up the bottom and the right or left edge with the pencil reference lines.


Bond only a small portion of the two surfaces together to make sure the metal is lined up properly.
Your fingers will keep the rest of the metal from contacting the door at this time and will allow for readjustment.
Once you bond more than half the surface, it’s there for good.

, Once you feel the metal is properly lined up, slowly move your fingers up the length of the metal and bond the surfaces together.


Press the pieces together for a solid bond.
Allow them to set for a couple of hours before using.

Use this method only on solid slab-style doors.,
Hold your metal panel in place against the door.,
Make a dimple in the door to guide your screws.,
Drive a pan head screw into each pilot hole.,
Drill new pilot holes about 1/16th of an inch above those marks.,
Punch one pilot hole in the door at the center of each vertical edge.",How to Hang Sheet Metal in Your Cabinets4," This method should not be used on frame and panel doors.


You may use either a hand screwdriver or a power driver.

, Make reference marks along the bottom edge, about an inch or two in from the corners.


Set the metal panel aside for now.

, Using a center punch or a large nail, make a dimple in the door.


A couple of taps with a hammer should do to pierce the surface of the door.
This will be your starter/pilot hole for your pan head screws.

, Drive your screws in, leaving enough space between the head of the screw and the door so the metal panel will fit in that gap.


Set the bottom of the metal panel into the space between the heads of the screws and the door.
Hold the panel in place and make two reference marks along the top edge the same way you did at the bottom.
Then remove the metal panel.

, Insert the screws and leave a gap a bit larger than on the bottom.


Now place the bottom edge of the metal into place, then flex the metal to pop it into place at the top.
Adjust its final positioning then tighten the screws until they hold the panel firmly.

, Punch one pilot hold into the center of each vertical edge, about 1/16th of an inch off the edge.


Insert a screw into each hole and tighten until snug.
Check to make sure the door closes properly and make any needed adjustments.
You are now ready to use your new sheet metal panel for display.

Clean your bonding surfaces.,
Cut and attach vertical strips of carpet tape.,
Cut and attach horizontal strips of carpet tape.,
Cut and attach central strips of carpet tape.,
Place and bond the metal into position.",How to Hang Sheet Metal in Your Cabinets5," Make sure both bonding surfaces are clean by cleaning with a household window cleaner.


Clean thoroughly, to avoid poor adhesion.

, Cut strips of carpet tape about ½” shorter than the vertical height of the metal panel.


On the bonding face of the metal, press the strip of tape in place about ¼” in from the edge with the ends of the strip about ¼” from the top and bottom of the metal panel.

, Cut two strips at a length nearly equal to the space between the two strips you just placed.


Press them into place along the top and bottom edges of the metal.

, Cut and place two strips about 2 or 3 inches (5.1 or 7.6 cm) long somewhere in the center portion of the metal.


Peel the protective film off all the strips you just mounted.
Be careful not to get them dirty or they may not stick properly.

, Carefully place one edge into position along the reference lines you drew when measuring for the metal.


Once the metal is in the proper position, you may bond the entire metal panel to the door.
Once the two surfaces are bonded, it is difficult to peel the metal away without damaging it.
If you need to remove the metal, heat the metal with a hair dryer to soften the adhesive.
Wear gloves when removing sheet metal panels.

Scan the wall with a stud finder.,
Hold the cabinet in place and make sure it’s level.,
Open the cabinet door and mark the installation holes.,
Drill the pilot holes.,
Fasten the screws to secure the cabinet.",How to Install a Medicine Cabinet1," Use a stud finder to locate your wall’s studs, and mark the locations of the studs with a pencil. Bathroom walls can conceal pipes and electrical wires, so you should use caution if your stud finder identifies any other objects behind the drywall. Drilling through pipes or wires can result in expensive damage.If you are concerned about possible pipes or electrical wires, consult with a professional before you drill or cut into the wall.;
, Position the cabinet at a height accessible to your household members. Place a level at the top of the cabinet to make sure it’s straight. Use a pencil to trace the top and bottom outlines of the cabinet.Having a helper to hold the cabinet in place for you will make the job easier.
Try to line up the cabinet with studs for the best support. If you can’t line the cabinet up with the wall studs, you’ll need to use plastic anchors when you drill pilot holes.

, With the cabinet still held in place, open the door and make sure it’s free of any obstructions. Locate the installation holes at the rear of the cabinet. Use your pencil to mark the holes on the supporting wall., Set aside the cabinet in a safe place. Drill pilot holes into the pencil marks you made on the wall that line up with the cabinet’s installation holes.If weren’t able to line the installation holes up with the wall studs, insert plastic anchors into your pilot holes.

, Position the cabinet back on the wall so the installation holes are lined up with the pilot holes. Drive screws into each hole to secure the cabinet to the wall.Some cabinets come with washers or plastic bits to conceal the screws once they’re fastened. Check your cabinet’s installation guide for specific information about these or any other included hardware.

Locate the wall studs.,
Hold the cabinet in place and trace its outline.,
Measure your cabinet width and stud distance.,
Cut an inspection hole.,
Cut out a hole along the outline of the cabinet.,
Notch the studs if necessary.",How to Install a Medicine Cabinet2," Use your stud finder to locate the wall studs. Mark their locations with a pencil. Scan the wall to check for load-bearing framework, pipes, or electrical wires. If you locate an obvious obstruction, consult a professional before cutting or drilling into your wall.If you have the blueprints to your house, check to see if they include any information about what’s behind your wall. If you do identify a large vent, pipe, or load-bearing framework, your best solution will be to install a surface-mounted cabinet., Hold the cabinet in its intended position and use a level to make sure it’s straight. Use a pencil to trace its complete outline. When you’re finished tracing, set the cabinet aside in a safe place., Most wall framing sets studs at a distance of 16 inches (about 41 cm). However, many medicine cabinets are 18 inches (about 46 cm). If your cabinet is larger than the stud distance, you’ll have to notch, or cut away, part of the studs when you create the recess and supporting frame for your cabinet.If you purchase a cabinet with a width less than 16 inches, you’ll most likely be able to install it without notching the studs.

, Drive a drywall screw into the wall in the middle of the outlined area. Don’t drive the screw entirely into the wall, but leave enough of its length to use as a tab to pull out your inspection hole. Use a keyhole or drywall saw to cut a circular hole with a diameter of about 6 inches (15 cm) around the screw, then use the screw to pull out the cut section.Use a flashlight to look into hole and inspect the area where you want to cut your recess. If you see wires or pipes, call a plumber or electrician to have the obstructions rerouted., If there are no obstructing wires or pipes behind your wall, use a drywall saw to cut along the cabinet outline you traced. Take care to only saw through the wall where you’re installing the cabinet, and don’t cut so deep that you come through the wall in the next room.Try to use careful, even strokes to avoid disfiguring the remaining drywall outside of the cabinet outline.

, If your cabinet is wider than your stud distance, take a hacksaw and slide it behind the obstructing stud to cut any screws holding the next room’s wallboard to its back edge. Use a handsaw to cut through the stud flush with the top and bottom of the drywall opening.After removing the section of stud that's in the way, place the cabinet into the recess to check its fit. Make sure its door opens without obstruction. Use a utility knife and coarse file to fix any tight spots, like bits of protruding drywall or wall stud.

Cut two-by-four boards to create a frame for the cabinet.,
Install the frame.,
Patch the screw heads.,
Replace insulation if you’ve cut into an exterior wall.,
Mark the cabinet installation holes and drill pilot holes.,
Place the cabinet in the hole and screw it into place.",How to Install a Medicine Cabinet3," If you’ve notched a stud, cut a pair of two-by-four boards so they will fit flush between the cut stud and the next intact studs on either side. If your studs are intact, cut a board so that it will fit snugly between the studs. Either way, your two-by-fours will need to be flush with the drywall opening to create a secure, well-fitting frame for the cabinet.If you’ve notched a stud, cut a pair of boards for the bottom of the drywall opening and another pair to frame the top. Cut another pair of boards to fit vertically on both sides of the drywall opening.
If your studs are intact and your cabinet outline is square with them, just cut two boards to fit between the studs at the bottom and top.  

, After cutting two-by-fours to the appropriate sizes, grab a bottom board, apply construction adhesive its ends, and place it between the wall studs. Make sure the board is flush with the drywall opening. Hold the board in place and drive screws through the drywall just below the opening to secure the board.Repeat the sequence to attach the other boards.

, You’ll likely find the 4 to 6 drywall screws that outline the opening and hold the frame in place unsightly. You can cover the screw heads with joint compound, let it dry, then sand it smooth with a fine grit sandpaper. Then prime and paint the area to make your work invisible.You'll need to patch the screw heads before installing the medicine cabinet. Once it's mounted, the cabinet might make the area harder to patch, prime, and paint.

, If you cut the recess into an exterior wall, you likely encountered insulation. If you removed any insulation while you were installing the frame, put it back into place. Depending on your cabinet’s depth, you might need to replace thick insulation with a more compact product.Visit your local home improvement store and ask a sale representative for help choosing a product such as vacuum insulated panels., Place the cabinet into the recess, open the door, and locate the installation holes on the sides. Use a pencil to mark the holes’ locations on the frame. Set the cabinet aside, then drill pilot holes into the frame at the spots you marked in pencil., Put the cabinet back into the recess. Drive screws through the installation holes and into the frame to secure the cabinet and finish the job.Your cabinet might have come with plastic washers or covers to fit over the installation holes. Check its installation guide if you have these or any additional hardware.

LED lights come in either fixed lengths or in a strip that can be cut. They reduce energy costs and do not require replacement bulbs. They last up to twenty years.
Fluorescent bulbs are long-lasting and energy-efficient, but they are harder to conceal.
Incandescent bulbs produce a soft, yellowish light and are the most inexpensive option. Their lifespan is short, and they aren't bright enough for utility lighting.
Halogen bulbs are bright and shine completely white. They create much more heat than other bulbs, but they also last twice as long as incandescent bulbs. They are more expensive than fluorescent or incandescent.
Xenon bulbs are similar to halogen bulbs, but they last longer and radiate less heat.;
, The lighting will require a power source. Plan how you will run cable to the lighting/fixture locations. Determine if you are prepared to run wires, cut holes into the wall, and create new electrical boxes. Alternatively, consider plugging the light fixture into existing outlets or finding battery powered lighting. Plugging in the lighting into an existing outlet means you have to decide how to camouflage the lighting’s power cable.Consider hiring an electrician if you’re uncomfortable tying the lighting to any electrical wiring.Make sure you are using a code-compliant source of electricity.
Make sure the source of power you selected isn’t dedicated to the refrigerator or any other kitchen appliances. You don’t want to overload the circuit.

, Lay your light on the countertop, underneath where you plan to do the installation. If you plan to run multiple lights, find lights that have a quick-connect cord. This cord will connect lights using only one power source.


Most installations are usually above the sink, work areas, and small appliances.For the best lighting, place the lights as close as possible to the front of the cabinet.
Some manufacturers suggest that multiple lights be at least 12 inches apart.

, Make sure the cabinets and counters are free from anything that might obstruct your work. If you need to go through your cabinets for wiring, make sure all the items are removed., If you plan to add new wires or a light switches that to an existing kitchen outlet, make sure the electrical box that houses the outlet has enough room. You will have to replace the box with a larger one if it doesn’t.


Use the National Electrical Code to determine the size of the electrical box. Calculate the amount of wires, devices, and clamps you will put in the box. Add 1 cubic inch for each hot and neutral wire, 2 cubic inches for each device (such as a switch), 1 cubic inch for all ground wires, and 1 cubic inch for all clamps. Take this sum and multiply it by either 2 for 14-gauge wire or 2.25 for 12-gauge wire. This calculation will give you the minimum box requirement in cubic inches. You do not have to do calculations for plastic boxes as the volume is stamped inside of them. , Do this at the circuit breaker. Find the switch labeled kitchen and make sure it’s off. Test to see if the power is turned off, plug in a device such as a lamp or radio into the outlet and see if it turns on.


You can also use a receptacle tester on the outlet. The lights on the test will come on if any power still running into the outlet.
While the circuit breaker may be labeled, make sure you test the outlet anyway. There may have been changes in the wiring since the box was installed, or the wiring may be defective., First, unscrew the wall plate that holds the outlet. Then, unscrew the outlet from the electrical box. Take the outlet out and disconnect any wires that are connected to it.The electrical box is nailed to a wall stud. Look around the electrical box to determine which side the stud is on. Use a flashlight if it’s too dark to see. You don’t want to saw through the stud when you are expanding the hole to hold new electrical box.

, Hold the new electrical box over the existing box in the wall so the expansion of the hole is on the side that isn’t nailed to a stud. Use a pencil to make an outline of where you will cut with the drywall saw.

, Use a drywall saw to cut along the tracing you made. Make sure you’re not hitting any studs.

, Make sure that any wiring connected to the old electrical box is loose before removing it. Pulling out the box when the wires are tight will damage the wiring. Once you are sure that wires are loose, remove the old box by using a flat pry bar., A knockout is a pre-scored hole made to run wire easily without drilling extra holes., There might be a plug or plate in the fixture’s knockout hole. Use a screwdriver to either pry the plug loose or unscrew the plate., Before drilling a hole in the wall so that you can run cables, you need to plot the spot. Place the light fixture in the exact location you plan to install it. Find the spot on the wall directly across from the light fixture’s knockout hole. Draw an “X” on this spot using a pencil.


Make sure that there isn’t a stud located between where you plan to drill the hole behind the light fixture and the electrical box. A stud will prevent you from running the cable. If you do find a stud, draw another “X” on the other side. Be sure to erase the previous “X” so that you don’t get confused.

,, Measure the distance between the electrical box and the hole you drilled. Take the distance you measured and add 24 to the length. This is how much of the 12/2 nonmetallic cable you need to cut. Adding the length to measure gives the cable some slack when you run it through the wall.

, Go to the hole where the electrical box was and reach into the wall. Grab the cable hanging from the small hole you drilled. Once you have the cable, pull it through the electrical box hole.

, Take off everything until you have just the casing of the light fixture. Clearing the fixture will give you space to screw the fixture into the cabinets.

, Put the fixture where you plan to install it. Make sure it is lined with the edge of the cabinet or behind it.

, Screw the fixture to the cabinet using the screws the manufacturer provided in the kit.

, Insert a ½-inch nonmetallic cable clamp in the fixture’s knockout hole to hold the cable in place and protect it from damage. Unscrew the plate that locks the clamp and place the clamp in the knockout hole. Once the clamp is in place, screw the plate back into it from the outside of the fixture., Grab the cable hanging from the small hole in the wall and run it into the knockout hole of the fixture.

, Use a wire stripper to remove the coating around the end of the cable that's in the fixture. Once stripped, connect the exposed wires to the corresponding wires in the light fixture: black-to-black, white-to-white, and bare copper to green. Do this by twisting orange wire connectors to the ends of the wires.

, Make sure all the connections are secure and that there is no exposed wired. Once you reattach everything back to the light fixture, staple the cable to the cabinet using cable staples.,, There will be two sets of cables: the cable that ran into the old electrical box and the cable you ran from the light fixture. Pull both cables through the new electrical box.

, The fins on the outside of the box should rest firmly against the wall so that you can screw it in securely.

, The box has fins that flip inside the wall when you screw it. Make sure you feel the fins flip as these secure the box to the wall.

, A ground fault circuit interrupter outlet will help prevent dangerous shocks that could seriously injure or kill someone.Once installed, this outlet ground-fault circuit interrupter will shut off instantly if the circuit shorts or is overloaded.

, Use wire strippers to remove the insulation on the cables. Once the wires are exposed, strip on the insulation on them as well. Connect the corresponding wires using an orange wire connector. Use a green pigtail connector to combine the copper wires from both cables and the outlet. , Make sure you combine the black and white wires from both cables and the outlet. Once they are combined, screw the free end of each of these wires into the corresponding terminal on the outlet. These terminals will be labeled “hot-wire line” and “white-wire line.”

, If you are installing a light switch into the outlet, connect the yellow wire from the switch to a black wire coming from the light fixture cable. Attach the copper wire from the switch to the copper wire on the GFCI outlet. Connect the white wires together. Make sure you use cable connectors to combine all wires.

, Once everything is connected, carefully pack the wires into the electrical box. Screw the outlet and switch to the electrical box.

, Once the outlet is secured, screw the wall plate into the electrical box., Once everything is secured and connected, turn the power on by flipping the kitchen switch at the circuit breaker."

;
, If you have cabinets high above your head then you will need a ladder to access them easily.








, Remove all the drawers and door faces off the cabinets by unscrewing the hinges. You should also remove all the hardware such as door handles. This will prevent them from getting paint on them and keep them looking clean.









You will usually only glaze the doors and drawer faces of the cabinet and not any pieces on the inside. This keeps the cabinets looking clean and finished even though they have an antique look. , After applying wood putty into the holes and cracks, allow it to dry and sand smooth. This will make your cabinets look finished and smooth.









If you are going to be using new hardware that will not fit in place of the old, you must also fill the screw holes with wood putty. After applying the putty, allow it to dry and sand smooth., This will protect the rest of your house from any paint or glaze splatters.








, Over time cabinets, especially kitchen cabinets, can become coated with smoke, oil and other deposits. You must thoroughly remove all this using a degreasing cleanser before glazing your cabinets.









After cleansing apply a deglosser to remove any remaining residue.
There is no need to sand before glazing painted cabinets but if you are repainting your cabinets then you will need to sand them first., If you want to repaint your cabinets, now is the time. Make sure they are smoothly sanded, then apply primer and allow it to dry. Apply the paint color of your choice and allow it to dry thoroughly.









Oil-based paints work better for kitchen cabinets because it dries to a harder finish than water-based paint, making it more durable and easier to clean.
If you want your cabinets to be a cream color, then choose a shade that has more of a white tint than a yellow. This will provide a nicer, cleaner look once the glaze is applied.
If you are repainting make sure you cover all surfaces including the edges of the cabinets and the inside of the doors to provide a more polished look. Allow the doors to dry for 24 hours before applying paint to the other side.
Make sure you cover all surfaces including the edges and crevices. You can use a small paintbrush to do these small areas., Allow the paint to dry for at least 24 hours to ensure that is completely dry before proceeding.







, Spray the lacquer in a clean, even coating over the cabinet surfaces. This step can be helpful if you are using white or cream paint as the base for your cabinets because it prevents them from darkening.









Although brush-on lacquer can also work, it is more difficult to use.
Darkening is a common problem experienced by those attempting to glaze their cabinets because the glaze can penetrate the paint and turn it darker.
With gray or other darker colors this step is not necessary unless you really don’t want them to darken., After the lacquer has completely dried, tape the backs of the cabinet doors and drawers so that you won’t accidentally glaze those areas. The tape will ensure that the edges are cleanly painted and finished.







, You can buy premixed glaze, which is the easiest option, or you can make your own custom colors. Choose your glaze color based on your personal preferences and so that it complements the rest of the kitchen’s décor.









If the store does not contain the particular shade of glaze that you are looking for you can make your own using plain glazing medium and paint.
You can use either oil-based or water-based glazing medium. Oil-based glaze dries slower so can be easier to use for glazing projects. The type of paint you combine will depend on the glazing medium you select. Be sure to read the glazing medium manufacturer’s instructions with regard to paint types.
Most manufacturers will recommend four parts glaze to one part paint but you can vary this to achieve your desired color. To make a very dark glaze combine three parts paint to one part glaze. For a medium glaze combine one part paint with one part glaze. To make a light glaze use one part paint to three or four parts glaze.Test your glaze on a poster board or scrap board with the same base color to ensure that it is the correct color for your needs., Whether you have bought a premixed glaze or prepared your own, you must make sure that the glaze is thoroughly mixed. Use a paint stirrer or wooden stick to mix. This will ensure an even color and texture when applying.








, Apply a thin coat of glaze to the cabinet, using either circular or straight motions. You can use a rag, a brush or sponge applicator to apply the glaze to the cabinet.









Some of the glaze will settle into any seams or grain lines in the wood. This is natural and adds to the beauty of the finished job.

, Wipe the area using a cloth rag or paper towel to achieve the look you want. You can use materials with different absorbencies for wiping down the glaze to achieve different looks along the seams.









For example, if you want a thicker glaze along the edges then you can use a cheap brown paper towel with minimal absorbency to wipe down the glaze.
If you want a thinner glaze, then you can use a soft paper towel or rag to lightly wipe down the glazed area., The glaze will dry very quickly once it is applied so complete only small sections at a time. The longer you leave the glaze before wiping, the darker the finish will be. Always remember to “wipe on, wipe off” so that you end up with a beautiful finish.









Glaze that is left for too long and becomes too dark will look streaky rather than resulting in a nice antiquated look.
Do not glaze an entire door at once. Rather complete the door in smaller sections to ensure an even look., After finishing a section check the glazed area to make sure it looks like you want it to. If you don't like the effect, you can remove oil based glaze with paint thinner and latex/acrylic based glaze with hot water and start over.








, Allow the cabinets and drawers to dry for at least 24 hours to ensure they will not be damaged. Check the manufacturer’s label on the glaze for the recommended time. 







, You can use a urethane, varnish or lacquer to finish the cabinets. This is optional as most glazes are very durable, but it may be necessary in busy or large family kitchens.









The finish can help prevent scratches and other damage on the cabinets.
Test the finish on a small section to make sure it looks good and will not change the color., Hang up all the doors and drawers into their appropriate positions. Reattach all the hardware including pulls and knobs and admire the new look of your kitchen cabinets.








, Glazing creates an antiquated look for your cabinets. If your hardware is shiny and new then it might look a bit out of place next to the new glaze. Consider replacing hardware with more rustic or aged-looking knobs, pulls and other hardware.

Finished.

",How to Choose and Install New Cabinet Knobs or Pulls," Remember to count every cabinet, closet, drawer and door. Then do it again. You'll be really annoyed with yourself if you miscount and have to wait to get more knobs!;
,, The trend right now is for large scale knobs, but you need to be careful. Huge knobs on small scale furniture can look a bit cartoonish, which may be just the look you're after! If you have frame and panel doors and drawers, you'll want to consider the width of the rails. As a general rule, knobs or pulls no wider than half the rail width look best.

, Knobs generally ship with a 1 ½ – 2"" screw, and you should check to be sure this will work for your installation. Doors and drawers will sometimes need two different screw lengths and different pieces of furniture may need different sizes. Drawers with faces applied as a separate piece will require screws to pass through 1 ¼"" - 1 ½"" of wood or substrate. Doors are usually made of ¾"" lumber so 1"" screws usually work. You can measure the depth of the face where the screw will go in. In addition to length, you must have screws that are the correct diameter. This won't be an issue if you can use the screws that came with your knobs. But if the screws that came with your knob aren't the right length, the best thing to do is figure out the length you need and take the knob to the hardware store with you so that you're sure to get a screw that is the correct diameter.

, (For stubborn screws, squirt a little W-D40 onto the screw head, or use a drop or two of Goo Gone directly on the screw head. Allow the substance to set for a few minutes and the screw should come out with little effort.)

, Drill holes if needed. The holes you drill should be the correct diameter, and should be drilled perpendicular to the surface. If you drill at an angle it can be hard to get the knobs to screw in tightly.

, (Just enough to get it started.)

, Tighten the screws after all screws for that handle have been installed and you are satisfied with the fit, the look, and the alignment of the new handle.

Separate screw and knob.,
Place sliver inside of the knob.,
Thread the knob back onto cabinet, closet or drawer.,
Test the handle.",How to Fix a Stripped Cabinet Knob or Drawer Pull," Whether you choose to accomplish this step by using a screwdriver or pulling the knob off, it does not matter. As long as the head of the screw is not stripped and you have the knob in your hand, you are ready to move on to the next step.;
, Fit the sliver as far down as it will go into the knob/pull and break the end off.


Make sure the break is flush so that no extra wood or plastic is sticking out.
You do not need to fill the hole completely (there can be room on either side). You just want to be able to give the screw traction.
For drawer handles with two attachments, place it in the hole(s) that need more traction.

, You will need to apply firm pressure while being careful not to overtighten because you will now have the resistance needed to keep the handle firmly on the door/drawer. Tighten the screw (or twist the knob) until the knob is flush with the door/drawer.

, You should now have a solid knob that does not wobble or come off in your hand.

You can usually apply this polish directly to the cabinets without diluting it, however, be sure to check on the packaging. This can be a more expensive option as a bottle can cost around $12.You can also make your own citrus-based cleaner by mixing ¼ cup (60 mL) of white vinegar in with 10 drops of orange essential oil.Murphy’s Oil Soap is one popular citrus cleaner that many people trust. It is considered a mild cleaner with a relatively light scent.;
, If you have numerous areas with difficult stains, you may want to make your own scrub. Get out a bowl and mix together 2 parts baking soda for every 1 part vegetable or olive oil. You can use a finger or a spoon to get this into a chunky, thick paste. Then, apply it directly to the cabinets.You can also follow this method with one of the lighter cleaning options. This should leave your cabinets with no extra residue., In a large bowl or bucket, add 8 cups (1.92 liters) of water and 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of liquid soap. You can also put in a few drops of citrus essential oil, if you like. Mix it all together and apply it to the cabinets with a sponge. This is a gentle cleaner that will do a good job removing general dust.If you are looking for something a bit more powerful, try substituting the liquid soap with laundry detergent., In a large spray bottle, mix together 4 tablespoons of white distilled vinegar and 2 tablespoons of vegetable or olive oil. Fill the bottle to the brim with warm water and shake to mix everything together. Spray the solution lightly directly onto the cabinets.Using vinegar also has the added benefit of sanitizing your cabinets and removing germs during the cleaning process., If you notice a liquid spill that is running down from the counter and onto the cabinets, get a paper towel or washcloth and wipe it up right away. Get in the habit of doing this while you are cooking or just working in your kitchen. This will help to prevent your cabinets from getting discolored due to continued contact with food, such as spaghetti sauce., If you plan to work with many cabinets at once, it is a good idea to buy a large, plastic leaning bucket. You can stir your warm water and cleaning agent together in the bucket. Then, you can move the bucket from area to area as you work.After you finish each cleaning session, make sure to rinse your bucket out with warm tap water and set it upside down on a towel to dry.

, Find a place on your cabinet that is not easily noticeable. Apply a standard amount of your cleaning solution to this area. Watch to see if any discoloration or waxing takes place. This will let you know if this particular cleaner is safe to use on the rest of your cabinets. You may need to wait up until 30 minutes to check the results., If you notice any areas of your cabinet that appear particularly dirty or discolored, you may want to place a bit of your cleaner on a toothbrush. Then, use this brush to lightly go over the surface of the problem spot. Keep applying consistent pressure until you start to see results. You may need to rinse off the area and reapply solution numerous times.Set this toothbrush aside and use it only for cabinet cleaning purposes.

, For the remainder of your cabinets, you can dip a sponge into the bucket, let it soak up the solution, and then wring it out until it is just damp. Wipe the sponge over the surface of your cabinets until they are damp as well. Try to apply pressure to the crevices of the cabinets without creating dripping.You can also use a microfiber towel for both applying the liquid and for drying.
After the cabinets are damp, let them sit and absorb the solution for a couple of minutes. You can also use this time to go over any problem areas once more., Whenever you wipe with a sponge or cloth, make sure to go with the grain, not against it. This will keep the wood looking smooth and not overly grainy. It is also a good idea to wipe in gentle circular motions. Trying to create some overlap at the edges of each stroke., After the solution has absorbed for a moment, refill your bucket with just warm tap water. Get a fresh cloth or sponge and wipe down the cabinets once more. This will remove any lingering cleaning agent and should leave your cabinets looking clean and fresh. Keep wiping until the cabinets feel dry to the touch., In addition to spot cleaning, designated a day each month where you do a full cleaning of your cabinets. This will help to reduce the build-up of dirt and grime. You will also get faster at this routine and should be able to complete it in minutes after a few sessions., If you have multiple layers of cabinets, or even with a single cabinet, it is a good idea to start from the top and work your way down. Apply the liquid cleaner at the top edges and make wiping circles across. This will let you wipe up any excess that accumulates that bottom of the cabinet., Traditional cabinet cleaners will often smear when placed on glass surfaces. To clean these areas, get an ammonia-free glass cleaner and apply with a fresh paper towel or another microfiber cloth. Place the cleaner on the cloth and then rub the surface. This will keep moisture from pooling behind the glass., These are the areas that are touched the most. They will likely be covered with fingerprints and smears. Use a microfiber cloth to gently polish these candles by applying a bit of cleaning solution. Keep going until they are restored to their original appearance., Don’t forget the inside of your cabinets. These spaces are likely to accumulate dust bunnies and food crumbs. Take a moment and use a paper towel or cloth moistened with warm water to wipe out the interiors. Start at the back of the cabinet drawers and shelves and move forward.Installing shelf paper to your cabinet interiors can also help to protect the wood and improve overall cleanliness."

Dry your cabinets completely.",How to Clean Soot from Kitchen Cabinets," The soot can get into your eyes and lungs, causing irritation. Depending on the cause of the fire, chemicals from the soot may even burn your skin. Harsher chemical solutions can pose a safety hazard, as well.


Wear eye goggles.
Wear gloves. Rubber dish gloves that extend up to your elbow offer the best protection, but disposable latex gloves will also work.
Wear a dust mask over your mouth and nose.
Throw on a long sleeves and long pants, but choose clothing that you do not mind getting dirty. There is a good chance that soot may get on you clothing at some point during the cleaning process.;
, Leave doors and windows open. If possible, you should even run a small electric fan. Good ventilation will rid the air irritants from soot and cleaners, and it will also help to remove the burnt odor that accompanies the soot.

, As you clean your cabinets, soot may fall off and dirty unprotected areas. Remove any clean appliances or furniture, especially those that are near the cabinets you need to wash, and place plastic sheeting or aluminum foil over clean counters and other unaffected, non-removable surfaces.

, Use a plain nozzle or smooth hose, rather than a brush attachment. Hold the nozzle about the soot, getting as close as possible without actually touching the surface of the soot or the cabinets. If you rub the nozzle over the soot, you may work it further into the wood of the cabinets and create a stain.

, Due to the oil-based properties of soot—especially soot from kitchen fires—plain water typically smears the soot and worsens the problem. Dry soot sponges are specially designed to remove greasy soot without the use of water. Drag the sponge over the soot stain in straight, unstopping lines.

, As you use the dry sponge, it should blacken as it picks up more and more soot. When it does blacken, however, it becomes less effective.


Turn the dry sponge over to another side once the first becomes too dirty to use. Keep turning the sponge until all sides are dirtied.
Cut away 1/4-inch sections of the dry sponge using a sharp knife once all sides are blackened. Cutting away the dirtied areas should reveal additional clean, usable portions of sponge.

, Dish detergents with a degreasing formula work notably well due to the greasy nature of soot produced by kitchen fires. Many other household cleaning detergents will also work well on treated wood cabinets, however. Mix 1/4 cup detergent into half a bucket of hot water and stir vigorously to combine.

, Dip the clean rag into the soapy solution, wring out excess water, and wipe it over the soot in a smooth, straight line. Repeat as necessary until you have wiped the solution over the entire soot-covered area of the cabinet.


Note that you may need to wash the cabinets down with this solution several times before it removes the majority of the soot.

, If washing your cabinets with a rag did not remove enough of the soot, the stain may be severe enough to warrant the use of steel wool. Only apply a light pressure, however, and swipe the wool over the cabinet working with the grain, rather than going against it. Going against the grain or applying a forceful pressure could cause scratches and may dull the wood.

, Dip a clean, stiff toothbrush into the detergent and water solution. With the door still closed, carefully scrub the hinges with the soapy toothbrush, going from highest to lowest.

, Re-soak the toothbrush in the soapy solution. Scrub the interior of the hinges, from highest to lowest, the same way you scrubbed the exterior of them.

, For severe stains, a degreasing detergent may not be a powerful enough cleanser to remove soot. TSP is a very strong, harsh cleaner that often proves highly effective against soot and other smoke damage. One tablespoon of TSP dissolved into one gallon of warm water should be potent enough to do the job.

, Dip a clean rag into the TSP solution, wring out the excess, and wipe it across the soot-covered portions of the cabinet. Keep wiping your cabinets down using straight lines, back and forth, until you have passed over the entire stain.

, Dip a clean rag into a bucket of clean, warm water, and wipe down the cabinets once more.


This step is important regardless of whether you only used the detergent solution or if you also had to resort to the TSP solution. Soap grime and TSP residue can both have harmful effects on the wood of your kitchen cabinets if allowed to soak in for prolonged periods of time. Residual amounts of these solutions could also irritate your skin and eyes if they should come into contact with them after the cleaning process is over; moreover, the residue poses an especially grave risk if it comes into contact with any food you store or prepare in your kitchen.

, Use a soft, dry cloth and wipe off excess moisture by dragging it across the cabinets in straight, back and forth lines. Run the cloth over the cabinets again using small circular motions to buff and polish the wood.

",How to Build Inexpensive Kitchen Cabinets," Never wing it, even for your own cabinets, without a plan of some kind.


Measurements from the original cabinets (if possible) or even from a set of drawings from an Internet site are a good place to start.
Don't try to build the kitchen cabinets with just an idea of how to do it. You will have a multitude of failure and frustration if you do.;
, The ultimate secret to success begins with watching your material costs.


The case, doors, drawers and shelves of the cabinets can easily be made of plywood or MDF (medium density fiberboard) to save money. You can opt for higher quality wood options if your budget allows.
Hardware can also be a budget buster if you are not careful. An example of this would be your using traditional cabinet door hinges and making drawer slides yourself by using them for guides.

,


Cut a rabbit on the back side of the case to the depth of the plywood backing before assembly.
Build two cases to fit on either side of the sink and bridge across them if the section of cabinet has a kitchen sink. You need it to have a case open at the back. This way you have access to water and drainage.

, Counter-sink the nails with a nail punch then fill with wood putty. Be sure that the case remains square by measuring from one corner to the opposite (front and back).

,


Hang the doors following the manufacturer's instructions for the hinges you have chosen.
Install and adjust the drawers so they slide easily. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for metal drawer slides.

, Be sure your finish is water resistant if you are painting with interior enamel.

, Slide it up against the back wall and check to see how straight it fits. Use scrap wood wedges to fill gaps between the back of the case and wall if needed. Fasten deck screws into the wall to secure the bottom case. Make sure the bottom cabinet is level. Adjust the bottom as needed.

, This is a board that has been split down the middle at a 45-degree angle.


One piece attaches across the cabinet open back with the angled part turned inward.
Square the top of the cleat to the side of the cabinet. Attach the second piece to the wall with deck screws fastened to wall studs. Turn the leveled and the angled section toward the wall. Set the cleat attached to the cabinet on top of the cleat attached to the wall.
The top cabinet should be level and ready to attach to the wall studs with deck screws.

, They will probably have the length you need in stock. It will be quicker and easier if you just buy it - unless you are familiar with Formicas, tile or some other inexpensive top covering. A cabinet top takes a lot of abuse during its lifetime. This is particularly true if a sink is to be installed.

Cabinets are also usually 34.5"" tall, allowing for a 36"" overall height once the countertop material is added. To calculate the size of wall (or upper) cabinets, add 18-20"" to the counter height. Subtract this from the overall height of your ceiling and you will have the range you can work in for cabinet size. Standard wall cabinet depth is 12-14"". The lower cabinet width will be somewhere between 12-60"" in 3"" increments. 15"", 18"", 21"", and 24"" are the most common sizes. Don't forget to plan your cabinet size around the cabinet doors that are available to you (unless you plan to make your own)!;
, Using 3/4"" MDF (or similar material, like plywood), cut out the side pieces for the cabinet. It doesn't matter how this material looks, since the sides will not be seen. Just get something sturdy and affordable! The side panels will be 34.5"" high and 24"" wide. Add a toe-kick by clamping the two side panels together and then, using a jigsaw, cut a 3x5.5"" notch into one corner of the panels. This is the bottom front corner. Unclamp the side pieces after they are cut.


Adjust the measurements for a wall cabinet and skip the toe-tick. No toes up there, we hope!

, The bottom panel will be 24"" deep. The width will change depending on the dimensions of your kitchen. The width should equal the total width you want for the cabinet, minus the added with of the two side panels.


A change in dimensions will again be needed for wall cabinets.

, Cut two pieces of 1x6 lumber to the same width as your bottom panel. Skip this step if you are making wall cabinets.

, Cut two pieces of the 1x6 to the same width. These will be used to brace the upper portion of the side panels. Skip this step if you are making wall cabinets.

, Assembled like a picture frame, these panels will make up the part of the cabinet that you actually see, so use dimensional lumber of a wood type that appeals to you (and your wallet!). You can use a few different sizes depending on the look you want, including 1x2s, 1x3s, and 1x4s.

, Line up the flat face of one base panel with the back edge of the bottom panel. Line up the second base piece 3"" from the other end of the bottom panel, in order to form the toe kick. Glue both pieces in place and then drill pilot holes and secure the pieces firmly together using screws and butt joints.

, Attach the side panels to the base you just made, using a similar glue-butt-joint-pilot-hole-screw process. Align the base so that the toe kick notches match up and all edges are flush. Use clamps, angle measures, and levels as necessary to ensure proper 90 degree angles.

, Fit and glue into place one of the upper braces, such that the flat plane is flush with the back edge of the cabinet and should rest against the wall. Fit and glue the second brace at the front, so that the flat plane would rest against the countertop, once the countertop is installed.

, Trace the entire outside frame of the back of the cabinet and then cut a back panel from a 1/2"" plywood. Screw it into place. You will need a thicker material for wall cabinets, such as a 3/4"" plywood.

, It is a good idea to reinforce all of the connections within the cabinet. Use corner brackets and screws.

, Measure the height for the shelf or shelves and mark it on both sides. Use a laser level to make sure that the marks are level. Then, install four corner brackets per shelf (two to a side) for the shelves to rest on. Slide the shelves in. Wait to add the shelves to wall cabinets.

, Using flat or mitered joints, assemble the face pieces the same way you would a picture frame. You can use pocket holes, dowels, or mortise and tenon joints to secure the pieces together (just choose a method that you know how to do). Once that's done, glue and nail the single unit in place. With the nails countersunk, you can use wood putty and paint or stain to finish the cabinets.

, Fit the cabinets into their final location. Secure them in place by screwing through the back panel and into the wall studs. Wall cabinets will require more serious support. You can use L brackets and cover the bottom portion with appliances or a backsplash (or just get decorative brackets).

, Just buy door panels. Unless you're remodeling an industrial size kitchen, buying them will be cheaper than getting all the special equipment necessary to make anything more than the plainest of doors. Install them according to their manufacturer's instructions.

Decide where to locate your closet.,
Lay out the walls and doors.,
Remove any base or ceiling trim and carpet from the area you have laid out for construction.,
Install the framing, beginning with the base and top plate.,
Hang .5-inch (1.27 cm) sheetrock or sheathing on the walls.,
Position the doors in the closet.",How to Build a Closet," This can be the most difficult part of the process. The most logical place would be an alcove, the end of a hallway or on a wall without windows or doors to work around.;
, Whether it is a wall or walk-in closet will depend on the amount of room available to you.

, Be careful not to break the trim, since you will want to reuse it.

, Attach the base with deck screws to the floor and the top plate to the ceiling. Use 4-inch (10.2 cm) toggle bolts and construction adhesive.


Nail or screw the end studs to side walls and to the top and base plates and rough in the door opening by nailing the studs to the top and bottom plates. Studs traditionally are on 16 inches (40.8 cm) spacing. Just use the spacing you have if width of your wall is greater than 16 inches (40.8 cm) but less than 24 inches (61.2 cm). Split the difference for better support of the sheathing if the width is greater than 24 inches (61.2 cm).
Rough in the door framing. This will include trimmer studs on each side of the door. Dimensions are normally 6 feet (1.8 m), 10.5 inches (1.83 m x 26.7 cm) tall attached to the wall studs and a doubled 2 x 4-foot (5.1 X 10.2 cm) door header nailed to the door trimmer with the end nailed to the wall stud.
Place short studs (called cripples) between the door header and ceiling plate. This will normally be centered on 16 inches (40.8 cm). The framing is complete.

, Both sides of the framing use sheetrock screws. Cut sheetrock to size using a utility knife and a straight edge as a guide. Run the edge of sheathing to the roughed-in door openings.


Score the sheetrock with a utility knife. Begin breaking the sheetrock off with hand pressure and then with a straight edge (along the back side of the sheetrock). The sheetrock should snap off in one piece if it is scored deep enough.

, How to do this will depend on the type of doors chosen.


Insert the door into your rough opening if you are using a traditional prehung door (as for a walk-in-closet). Then, with a level, plumb the door using shims to keep it aligned. Install the trim supplied by the manufacturer around the door.
The use of a bi-fold door requires that you first trim out the door opening. Use trim similar to the floor trim you salvaged or that matches the trim in the room. Hang the door in place and adjust to fit, following manufacturer's instructions.
Install the accessories, however elaborate or simple, that fit your needs.

Consider carefully the design of new cabinets.,
Find ideas wherever you look.,
Choose the right top for your cabinets, as it can make or break how it all comes together.,
Look at your budget.,
Buy the cabinets you have chosen.",How to Buy Cabinets," For example, you may need proper storage in a kitchen.


Measure the size of the kitchen using a tape measure. Sketch the floor plan to scale, locating the sink, stove and refrigerator appropriately.
Some elements, like the stove and sink, may be locked in place due to cost considerations. The same does not apply to the refrigerator. Move it to where it works best for your design.
Think of adding a kitchen island with cabinets in the middle of the room. Before you order the island, cut out large cardboard replicas. Place these in your kitchen and see if they get in your way.;
,


Magazines that deal with kitchen remodeling, for example, show features that you give the storage capacity you want.
Sliding shelves give you access to pots and pans at the back of the cabinet. Pantries with sliding shelves give you access from both sides, making it easier to find cans of food that never seem to be at the front of the shelf.

,


Pick a top that is durable. Granite, Formica, wood and even concrete tops are all available. Some of these last better than others, and with less upkeep.
Use consumer reviews and ask what other people like about their choices.
Because of food preparation, you need cabinet tops that clean and sanitize easily to prevent contamination and possible food poisoning.

,


Before you buy, sit down and come up with a dollar amount you can afford.
Price can easily get away from you when ordering the cabinets. Otherwise, sticker shock will leave you with regret when you are looking at the final bill.

,


Home improvement stores provide examples of cabinets along with the tops to choose from. They also have trained sales associates that can take your sketch and measurements, turning your wish list into reality. They also offer installation by one of their subcontractors.
On-line resources provide an attractive method for people who live in areas that do not have a home improvement store close by. Choose wisely when buying online. Check references and don't forget the shipping costs. Keep in mind the cost of having a local handyman install the new cabinets, if that is your plan.
Traditional cabinet shops are great. Using a cabinet shop is more personal, since you deal with the woodworker as opposed to a salesman. They will install the cabinets as well. This is really important if your house has an odd shape to the kitchen or is older and the corners are no longer square.

Distinguish between knobs and pulls.,
Decide on color and style.,
Test the knobs to make sure they feel comfortable in your hand.,
Match the size of the knobs to the size of your cabinets.,
Ask for samples.,
Shop for cabinet knobs at hardware stores or department stores.,
Shop for cabinet knobs online.,
Ask about return policies.,
Look for used cabinet knobs to save money.",How to Buy Cabinet Knobs," Knobs are smaller, and can be installed at only one point where the knob meets the cabinet. Pulls are handles, and are often attached at 2 different points where the pull meets the cabinet.;
, You will want the cabinet knobs to complement the style of the room you are updating. Browse the different colors, finishes and styles that are available in cabinet knobs.


Choose modern knobs if you prefer a contemporary look. Look for metallics in glossy finishes, bold shapes, interesting sizes or retro satin metals.
Select traditional knobs if you prefer an antique or classic style. You can find knobs that are mushroom shaped, wooden, wrought iron or pewter to achieve a colonial or country look.
Buy novelty or specialty knobs to make your cabinets fun. They can come in many themes and styles, including nautical shapes, jeweled knobs, fruits, birds and other animals.

, You will be pulling these knobs every time you need to get into a cabinet, so make sure they are easy to grab and pull.


Ask to try a knob if you are shopping in a store, and if you are considering ordering knobs online, request a sample.
Check to see if the knobs will catch on clothing or jewelry. Round knobs are less likely to grab your clothing, but knobs with sharp ends or points might snag on fibers.

, Hold one knob up to your cabinet before you purchase a whole set of knobs for all your cabinets. Make sure it is not disproportionate to the cabinet.

, Getting a sample knob will help you decide if you like it before you buy. You may have to pay for the sample knob, but most retailers will allow you to return it or put cost of the knob towards the full price of your purchase.

, Retailers such as Lowe's, Home Depot, Target and Walmart will have selections of cabinet knobs. Shopping in stores will allow you to touch and feel the knob, and match it to any fabric or color swatches you may bring with you.

, Access thousands of online retailers by doing an Internet search for cabinet knobs. You should also check major sites such as Amazon, eBay and Overstock. You will probably find a larger selection than you will in stores, and better prices. Be prepared to pay for shipping, however.

, Find out if you are able to return or exchange the knobs if you change your mind.

, You can find previously owned knobs at antique stores, flea markets, yard sales, or online at sites such as eBay, Amazon and Craigslist. If you have a Habitat for Humanity ReStore outlet near you, you can buy donated items from there at a fraction of retail price.

The dimensions of the two side pieces should be: 84 inches (213.36 cm) high by 22 inches (55.88 cm) wide and 84 inches (213.36 cm) high by 21.25 inches (53.98 cm) wide. The dimensions of the triangular top and bottom pieces are (side by side by hypotenuse) 22 inches (55.88 cm) by 22 inches (55.88 cm) by 31.11 inches (79.02 cm). The dimensions of the triangular shelves are 21 inches (53.34 cm) by 21 inches (53.34 cm) by 29.70 inches (75.44 cm).;
, Cut out the pieces, then trace them onto your sheets of wood.

,, Lay the smaller side piece that is 21.25 inches (53.98 cm) wide on the floor. Stand the wider side on its edge right next to the smaller side piece. Make sure that the edges match up for a tight fit.


Nail through the face of the wider side piece into the edge of the smaller piece. Make sure that the nail goes in perfectly straight so there is no damage to either piece of wood. Your side pieces should now make a ""V"" shape.

, Stand the side pieces up on end. Take the triangular top piece and lay it on the top of the side pieces. Make sure that the edges are perfectly aligned for a clean finish.


Nail the pieces together making sure that the nail goes in perfectly straight so there is no damage to either piece of wood. Repeat this process for attaching the bottom piece.

, The spacing between the shelves should be 16.5 inches (41.91 cm). From the bottom, measure up 16.5 inches (41.91 cm), and mark the spot on the back of the cabinet. From that first mark, measure up another 16.5 inches (41.91 cm) and mark that spot. Follow that process 3 more times, for a total of 5 times.

, Using a level, make sure that the shelves are level. Nail through the pre-drilled holes in order to attach each shelf to the cabinet. Again, make sure that you nail with precision.

, Repeat with a finer grit of sandpaper to get a smooth surface.

, Make sure that the stain is applied evenly and that there are no drip marks. Apply as many coats of stain as needed, letting each coat dry completely each time.

, This will prevent the cabinet from moving and shifting. Try to attach the cabinet to the studs in the wall.

Prepare your cabinets.,
Choose a process for antiquing white cabinets.,
Glaze your cabinets.,
Distress your cabinets.,
Apply a crackle finish.",How to Antique White Cabinets,"


Remove the cabinet doors, as well as the hinges, knobs and other fixtures. The process of antiquing cabinets is much easier, and you will get more streamlined results if you take your cabinets apart before attempting an antiquing treatment. Remember to set the screws, hinges and other attachments in a safe place where they won't get lost.
Use sandpaper to rough up all of the cabinet surfaces that you plan on antiquing. Be sure just to remove the top finish. High-gloss cabinets will require extra sanding.
Clean the cabinets with a wet rag so that paint will adhere to them, and make sure they are free of sanding dust.;
, You may use 1, or a combination, of the following methods:


Glazing involves applying a thinned paint mixture, called a glaze, over the cabinet surfaces in order to create antique white cabinets.
Distressing is a method of visually aging wood by causing intentional damage to the surface with a variety of instruments.
Crackle finish is a faux painting technique for antiquing cabinets that results in a crackled paint effect.

, Glazing makes white and light-colored cabinets appear older and slightly dingy. Glaze only 1 cabinet at a time.


Choose a glaze. You may opt to mix a brown, umber or amber water-based paint with water or a store-bought glaze mixture, 3 parts paint to 1 part water/glaze medium, or you may use stain. Adjust the opaqueness of the glaze by adding more water or glaze medium, as per your personal preference.
Brush the glaze onto the cabinet. You may use a paint brush or a foam brush.
Wipe off excess glaze using a cloth or paper towel.
Repeat glazing until you get the desired effect. Antiquing white cabinets with the glaze method is a process, and you may need to build layer upon layer before you are satisfied with the level of antiquing.
For greater detail and dimension, use a small paint brush to layer extra glaze into cracks, crevices and joint lines, where dust would naturally settle.

, The purpose of distressing is to achieve an effect of years of wear and tear. When antiquing cabinets, you may distress them as much or as little as you prefer.


Scrape a key over the surface of the cabinet to create random lines, or indentations, similar to what an old cabinet might have. Experiment with several different sized keys for different effects.
Use an ice pick or a fork to poke holes in the cabinet surfaces. These holes should appear to be worm holes that would be natural to aged cabinets.
Flog the cabinets with a chain to create a series of random, irregular dents and gashes in the wood.
Sand edges with sandpaper to give them a well-worn appearance.

, Paint the cabinet surface with a store-bought crackling medium and let it dry. As it dries, the crackling medium shrinks, or ""cracks,"" taking the glaze underneath with it and creating the look of old, sun-cracked paint.

Finish off your project.",How to Antique Kitchen Cabinets," Antiquing is a process by which you put a dark ‘antique’ stain over the top of cabinets that are painted or stained a few shades lighter. That means that the base color for the cabinets can be anything you like, be it painted white or stained oak. You can antique over your current cabinet color if you so desire, but many people like to go for a totally transformed cabinet look by adding a new base color as well. Examine your space and consider your overall décor to determine what the base color of your cabinets should be.


Generally, it is best to stay away from very dark base colors, as the antiquing effect won’t show up as well on them.
Cabinets painted white or stained with a light, natural wood stain are very popular for their ‘shabby chic’ appearance when antiqued.;
, The antique stain is the dark stain that will be painted over the top (and then wiped off of) the base color on the cabinets. While any matte stain will work, it is recommended that you select a stain advertised for its antiquing qualities. This is because antique stains are made to be the right opacity, luster, and color to convey an authentic antique appearance. For white and cream cabinets, choose a mid-tone antique stain. For honey/caramel tone cabinets, chose a medium to dark stain (depending on the desired contrast). For dark cabinets in a chocolate or coffee hue, you’ll want to choose the darkest antique stain available.


Antique stains cost about the same as regular wood stain, so you’re not losing out financially by going with this option.The higher the contrast between the antique stain and the base color, the more worn and vintage the cabinets will appear when finished.

, There are pros and cons to both leaving your cabinets in place for painting, and to removing the doors and reinstalling them post-painting. If you choose to leave them in place, you save yourself a bit of prep work. However, you may end up spending more time taping off hinges and trim as well as painting. By removing the doors, you are granted full access to every aspect of the cabinet that needs painting. However, removing the doors and replacing them when you’re finished antiquing takes a lot of time and effort.


If you choose to remove your doors, label them on a piece of painters tape so that you know where they are supposed to go back in place.
Know that you’ll have to tape off the walls, floor and/or ceiling regardless of which option you choose.

, There aren’t a ton of supplies necessary for antiquing cabinets, but you best make sure you have all of them at the ready before starting your project. You will need:Base color paint/stain (optional)
Antiquing stain
1-2 Paintbrushes (size dependent on project - 3-inches wide is typically good)
100-grit sandpaper
Sanding block or electric sander (optional)
Painters tape
Dry, clean cloth (choose a smooth fabric)
Rubber gloves
Finishing glaze/sealant (optional), Paint and stain won’t adhere to a glossy or dirty base, so it is important to sand down the cabinets prior to painting them. If you have a block sander or an electric sander, now would be the time to use it. Use 100-grit sandpaper to smooth down the entire surface of each cabinet; sand until the wood looks dull/matte.

, As you’ll surely find out, sanding can be messy business. Before moving onto the fun part of the project, it is necessary to clean off the newly-sanded cabinets. Use a damp, lint-free cloth to wipe down the surface of each of the cabinets until there is no sawdust in sight.

, If you decided to go for a base color or stain other than the original color, now is the time to apply it. Paint on a layer of paint or stain to each of the cabinets, and wait the package-directed curing time for it to dry. Follow this up with a second coat of paint or stain to finish the job. Wait for the paint to dry completely until moving on to the antiquing process.

, The moment you’ve been waiting for: antiquing your cabinets. Dip your paintbrush into the antiquing glaze and wipe off the excess stain, to prevent dripping. Brush over the parts of the cabinet you want the antique effect applied to, using a very light coat. Then, use a clean, dry, lint-free rag to wipe off the stain. The result should be some areas of the wood appearing worn and old, without looking fake or dark.


When you brush on the glaze, go in the direction of the grain of the wood.

, Repeat this process of brushing on antiquing glaze and wiping it off, over all of your cabinets. Try to add equal amounts of the antiquing glaze to each cabinets, so that you maintain uniformity across all the wood. Follow the package directions for drying time.

, Although you don’t have to, some people like to add a distressed effect to their cabinets to make them appear even more worn and ‘vintage’. There are a number of ways of doing so, including sanding down the wood over the top of the fresh antiquing glaze, using a hammer to hit the wood and create dents, and lightly tapping the surface with a chisel to create indents. Use your distressing method of choice on all the cabinets so that they look consistent.If you sand down your cabinets, use a dry cloth to wipe off the dust again.

, If you’re happy with the appearance of your cabinets at this point, then you’re ready to seal! If not repeat the glazing and distressing steps until the cabinets look just the way you hoped. To seal your cabinets, brush on a clear wood sealant over each of the doors, and allow time to dry. Add a second coat if instructed by the package directions.

, Depending on whether or not you removed your cabinet doors, the way you finish will differ slightly. If you took off the doors, put them back in place with their hinges and and knobs reattached. Remove any painters tape, and clean up the surrounding area. Voila! With the cleanup finished, your project is completed; go an enjoy your new antiqued cabinets!"

Re install your whitewash cabinets.",How to Whitewash Cabinets," Whitewashing is best suited to a soft wood like pine.A wood like oak will require pickling, a technique of whitening wood. Pickling is considered a method, not a finish, and though you can pickle pine and other soft woods, woods like oak and ash are the most common type of wood you can pickle. You can create your own pickling stain for oak and ash wood, or you can purchase pre made pickling stains.;
, Taking off the doors will make them easier to whitewash and give you easier access to the cabinet frames. It's also a good idea to work on the cabinetry and the doors separately.


Use a drill to remove the doors. When you store the screws, label them so you can tell which door they came from. As the hardware is already set to a particular door, labelling the screws will prevent any confusion later when putting the doors back on., Before you start treating the wood, use rags and a heavy duty degreaser to clean the doors. Apply the degreaser to the front and the back of each cabinet as well as to the frames. Wipe down and repeat these steps as necessary until the cabinet and frame are very clean., Whitewashing requires a blank canvas for the wood stain to take. Paint strippers will do the job, but these harsh chemicals require excellent ventilation (or a respirator), safety goggles, neoprene/latex gloves, and a drop cloth to protect your floor.Apply one coat of paint stripper with steel wool, then wipe with a rag once the finish has dissolved. Most paint strippers are flammable, so dispose of the steel wool and rag in a sealed metal bucket.


Alternatives:Furniture re-finisher: This more mild product may work if there are only one or two previous coats on the cabinet.Other paint strippers: if yours is ineffective, try a more powerful option. From weakest to harshest, these are varnish, lacquer, paint, and polyurethane removers., You can sand the surface by hand or by using a power sander. The goal is to uncover the natural color of the wood cabinets. When sanding, always move in the direction of the wood grain, rather than against it.


Sanding by hand: fold a quarter of a sheet of 120 grit sandpaper into thirds to make a pad that fits your palm. Wrap it around a block of wood to get a sharper edge to work into bevels and corners.Sheet sander: cheap power tool, sand in stages to 180 grit to avoid marks.Random orbital sander: fast and powerful, but requires purchasing more expensive sanding disks. Sand to 120 grit, and be careful not to nick cabinet edges., If your cabinets are made of a soft wood like pine, it's important to condition them as these woods can sometimes appear blotchy when stained. Conditioning also raises the grain of the wood. You can use a pre-stain conditioner for this step.


Apply the conditioner to the cabinets with a clean brush designed for latex paints and then let them sit for 30 minutes. Follow up with a light sanding of the cabinets using the 120 grit paper again. This final sanding will ensure the cabinets have a smooth surface to absorb the stain.Dewaxed shellac is an alternative option, if heavily diluted and wiped off fairly quickly. This is a risky method, so experiment on scrap lumber first. Alternatively, apply dewaxed shellac to the end grain to prevent over-staining that area. Wipe off unabsorbed excess, then sand lightly., Different stains will create warmer or darker tones to the cabinets, so consider your preferred tone and choose a wood stain that will work well in your home. Brands such as Minwax have a variety of different wood stains to choose from.Water-based wood stains produce fewer fumes, dry fast and clean-up easier than oil-based wood stains, but the color may fade quicker. Only use oil-based stains in a well-ventilated area.

, Whenever you are applying stains of any type, it's a good idea to test the stain on a sample of scrap wood of the same wood-type as the piece you'll be working on.


Shake the can of stain thoroughly before you open the can and test the stain. This will mix in any pigments that have settled at the bottom of the can.
Apply the stain to the scrap wood with a paintbrush and let it set for 2 to 3 minutes. Ensure you are happy with the results before moving on to the next step.

, Using a clean rag, apply the stain with long, smooth strokes in the same direction and work the stain into the wood. Follow the line of the grain while accentuating any knots in the wood. Wipe away excess stain with another clean rag or a soft cotton cloth that you've folded into a pad. The more pressure you apply to the rag or the pad, the more the wood grain will show through the stain on the final product.If you are pickling oak cabinets, apply the pickling stain with a brush and wipe the stain against the grain. Due to the large pores and the natural grain pattern of oak, wiping against the grain is essential to working the stain down into the pores of the wood. Once you've worked the pickling stain into the pores of the wood, use a clean rag to wipe away any excess.If your rag becomes tacky as you are staining the cabinets, replace it with a clean rag., This should take about 1 to 2 days. If the surface is tacky to the touch, the wood stain is not completely set and will need more drying time.

, While whitewashing enhances the wood grain, it does not offer any wood protection. To finish the cabinets, use non-yellowing protective top coat that will penetrate the wood's pours and protect the wood from within, such as a water-based lacquer, clear acrylic or natural Tung oil.


Apply the top coat with a high quality brush that is designed for latex or water-based products, so that stray bristles don't end up on your top coat. Use overlapping continuous strokes to finish the surface, a process called ""striking off."" Allow the first coat to dry for about 4 hours, and then lightly sand the cabinets one last time with 220 grit sandpaper. Use a tack cloth to wipe away any excess reside left behind by the sandpaper, and then apply a second and final coat to the cabinets.When you finish the bottom of the cabinet, place the cabinet on a small block or shims so that the polyacrylic doesn't stick to the surface of your work area.
Avoid using oil-based protective finishes over whitewashing or pickling as these finishes have a yellowish look that will detract from the white coloring of the whitewash look., Hang the cabinets back in their exact positions, using the labelled screws and hardware."

, Wipe off any dirt or grime and generally do your best to clean the cushion as well as possible before getting it wet.

, Turn on the water to warm/very warm and let the tub fill about 1/3 or 1/2 of the way up, depending on how big/thick your cushion is.

, If your cushion is really dirty, you may begin to see the water in the tub turn brown or gray with grime and dirt from your cushion. This may be gross, but it means that the cleaning is working, so embrace it.

, Try stepping on it with your bare feet so water comes into the cushion and then gets forced out. Moving the water in and out of the cushion is what's going to get this sucker clean! Flip the cushion every minute or so so both sides have a chance to breathe.

,, If there's a spot that is particularly dirty, make sure to focus the detergent on that spot. Then rub the detergent into the cushion with your hands or a towel.

, Squish the cushion again so that the soapy water goes in and out of the cushion. Do this for another five minutes or so, flipping every so often to adequately clean the whole cushion.

, Squish the cushion and push the water in and out for as long as you feel like it's making a difference. Drain the water and refill the tub with clean water periodically for even better effects. Keep working at it until you feel you can't get the cushion any cleaner.

, Step on the cushion and squish water out of it until you've drained away as much water as possible.

, Keep flipping the cushion every so often so as to clean both sides. Your goal here is to get all the soap out of the cushion, leaving it nice and clean.

, Again, step on the cushion to squish all the water. Then have a friend help you transfer the cushion to a suitable area for drying.

, Make sure the fans face as much of the cushion's surface area as possible - set them up facing the open face rather than the sides of the cushion. The key here is to dry the cushion as fast as possible so no mold will grow inside it. If you are using two box fans then set one of the fans in front of the cushion and one in the back. If you are drying the cushion on a flat surface be sure to turn the cushion every few hours so both sides get drying time. Leave the fans set up and running until the cushion is dry.


To test to see if the cushion still has moisture left in it, you can put a paper towel in the suspected area and then sit/step on it. If the paper towel gets wet then the cushion still needs to be dried more.

, After the cushion is fully dried you can spray something on the cushion to further remove any unpleasant smells. Use your favorite air freshener and follow the directions on the label.

Plan the locations of your closet shelves.,
Cut the wire shelves to length.,
Mark the locations of the mounting clips.,
Drill pilot holes for the mounting clips.,
Screw the mounting clips into the wall.,
Hang the wire shelves using the mounting clips.,
Install the support poles.",How to Add Shelves to a Closet," The first step in planning your layout is determining the length of each shelf. Measure the length across the back wall, and subtract about an inch (2.5 cm) from either side where the shelf touches a wall. Next, plan the vertical distance between each shelf. This will depend on what type of objects you want to store.;
, Simple powder-coated wire shelving is available at hardware stores and retailers that sell home organization products. To cut the shelves to length, you can use either a hacksaw or a pair of bolt cutters. Measure each shelf's length carefully with a tape measure before making your cuts.

, Wire shelves are sold with U-shaped mounting clips that can be screwed into your wall. Use a stud finder and a pencil to mark the locations of the studs along the back wall of your closet. Then, use a spirit level and a long piece of scrap wood (or other straight material) to draw long horizontal lines indicating the position of each shelf. You will screw the mounting clips into the points where the long lines pass over the studs.

, At the locations that you marked for the mounting clips, drill pilot holes using a drill bit that is just smaller in diameter than your screws. The pilot holes should be a bit deeper than the overall length of the screws. These holes will prevent the mounting screws from binding up and breaking.

, Position each mounting clip over the pilot holes you drilled. Drive drywall or wood screws into these holes using your drill. For the best stability, use screws with lengths between 1.5 and 2 inches (2 - 2.5 cm).


If your mounting clips have an integrated drywall anchor (a long plastic sheath projecting from the back), you should cut it off using scissors. Mounting these clips into wood studs will provide much sturdier and more stable closet shelves.

, Once the mounting clips are all installed against the back wall of your closet, you can clip each length of shelving into them. You may have to angle the shelves sharply to get them through your closet door.

, Most wire shelving systems are supported using angled braces that connect the front edges of the shelves to the wall. Clip the front end of each support pole onto the front railing of the shelf, and rest the other end against the wall. Drill a pilot hole through the screw hole of the support pole, and then secure it with a screw. Support poles should be secured into the studs as well.

",How to Refurbish an Old Cabinet," The one used in this article is an old baker's cabinet taken from an abandoned house, probably from the 1930s or 40s. As more and more of the old paint was removed, the construction technique indicated a hand made piece or perhaps a high school shop project. It's still very old as indicated by the 16” wide clear pine lumber used in the flour bins.;
, The handles removed from this piece, under two layers of paint, were made of brass or copper plated steel. Much of the plating is worn away, but they can still be reused.

, Strip the old paint, or in this case, the old linoleum finish. If the top is in usable condition, it can be refinished, or as an alternative, apply ceramic tile, or even laminate flooring for a beautiful new look. If you decide to enlarge the top (for example, to make an eating area), more of the same type of lumber must be acquired to extend it (preferably wood that matches the old), or a new top must be built. This piece received a new top made from old barn wood so that a breakfast bar could be added to one side.

, Keep the gun moving in a circular or back and forth motion so that you do not scorch the wood. Work in small areas and as the paint begins to bubble, use the putty knife to scrape up the paint. Be careful not to scratch or gouge the wood. As one section of paint begins to bubble, hold the gun in front of the knife, and gently push the putty knife forward. Slowly continue to move the gun forward while scraping. The hot air gun will only remove paints and varnishes, it will not remove stain.

, This is also a good time to clean up any old hardware that you are going to keep, and repair damaged areas of the piece. A small brass brush and a nail work well for cleaning detailed areas.

, To maintain the “old” look, the nicks, gouges, and dents may be left in place. If the piece will be painted, and a “new” look is desired, putty all the defects and allow the putty to dry before sanding. Due to shrinking, if the defect is large, more than one layer of putty may be required.

, On woods like pine, it is best to use boiled linseed oil thinned with mineral spirits, or a commercially made wood conditioner prior to applying the stain to achieve a more uniform color.

,, A glossy polyurethane finish is a durable choice for cabinets. An HVLP spray gun is the best thing to use to apply your finish if you have access to one. Next would be spray cans, but this can become expensive. Last is the good old brush. If you use a brush, purchase a good one that is made for finish work. Apply the finish using gentle strokes so bubbles are kept to a minimum. After the surface is covered completely, and before the finish begins to set, brush entire area one last time, brushing only in the direction of the grain. One light stroke is all that is needed. If the area is large, work in smaller sections, overlapping the edges before the finish becomes tacky.

, The purpose of sanding is not to remove the finish, but to “roughen-up” the finish so the next layer will adhere to the old, and to smooth any defects. Wipe the sanded areas to remove dust with a tack cloth or soft cloth dipped in thinner and apply another coat of finish. Repeat this step until the desired thickness and sheen is achieved.

Remove the contents of the drawers.,
Open and close the drawer slowly.,
Close the drawer completely.,
Remove the drawer from the cabinet.",How to Adjust Your Cabinet Drawers1," Begin by removing the contents of the drawers that need adjusting AND the cabinet below.


You will need access to the inside of the cabinet to assess the adjustments that need to be made.;
, While doing so, check to see if it binds at the top against the face frame as you close it.


If not, open and close the drawer very slowly to see if the guide wheel drops or “pops” off the track at any point.
If neither issue occurs, then your width adjustment is probably OK.
Open and close the drawer again, doing so very slowly. If the drawer glide on one side of the drawer or the other begins to lift off the guide wheel, near the face frame of the cabinet (when the drawer is nearly closed), then an adjustment needs to be made.
This will be covered by the following steps.

, All four edges of the drawer face should touch against the face frame (or all protective bumper pads, if applied).


If the drawer is out of alignment, there will be a growing gap starting from the point where the edge of the drawer face touches the face frame.

, Pull the drawer open all the way until it stops.


Then, while pulling slightly, lift from the drawer face end and the drawer should clear the track and come right out.

;
, If you are replacing existing cabinets, you may want to use them as a pattern. You may also prefer to create a new layout to better suit your purposes.









Get brochures from the cabinet company. It will tell you what standard sizes are available (this usually means 12"" wide at a minimum, with larger cabinets at 3"" increments). You want to have them tune up all your sizes, give you a printout so you can make copies, and include them with your bid request.
Also get an idea of your options for finish, styles, materials, and hardware options. In many cases, it is possible to get a custom size to match your needs, but it is always much less costly to use their standard sizes.
Draw a layout of your cabinet plans. It doesn't need to look like something an architect would draw, but it should be enough to give you an idea of how everything will line up and fit together.
Check the cabinet heights, especially for upper cabinets. If you are especially tall or short, check how far up you can comfortably reach. Many upper cabinets are designed to have a space between the tops and a standard height ceiling, while others will extend all the way to the ceiling.
If one of your cabinets will go over your sink or stove, make sure to allow space underneath it for working and to attach lighting or a stove hood.
Check how your range hood will fit with any upper cabinets above the stove.
Most systems have special cabinets to go under the sink, in corners and in other special locations. Learn how these work and incorporate them into your layout.
Check that upper cabinets line up appropriately with lower cabinets, and allow for windows and other features in the wall.
Consider how you use your kitchen (or other workspace). Does your layout make sense for you?

, Make a list. Don't forget screws to screw the cabinets to the walls and shims with which to level the cabinets.









Remove the old cabinets, if there were any. At the back of the cabinets, you will generally find screws or nails holding them to the walls.
Empty the cabinets completely first. It is much easier to work inside them and remove them without loose items rattling around inside.
Remove the doors and shelves before unscrewing the cabinets from the walls. Most shelves simply lift off of pegs. Some may need to be unscrewed or pried off their supports. In either case, it will help to have them out of your way.
Make certain that you support the upper cabinets somehow as you remove the screws that support them. If the upper cabinets are a one-piece unit, you may have to separate them to avoid damaging adjacent walls since there will be no room to turn them as you bring them down.

, It is not necessary to run the flooring under cabinets, but for some flooring materials, it is easiest to do the floor while the cabinets are out. Do not replace baseboards until after the cabinets are installed. If you are installing wood or tile floors, consider the thickness of the floor material when you decide whether it should go under the cabinets.

Slide the pins together.,
Repeat as needed.,
Replace the cushions.",How to Separate a Sectional Sofa," Take all of the cushions off the sectional sofa before you begin separating it.


You can technically separate the sofa sections while the cushions are still on the piece of furniture, but doing so can be more difficult since the cushions usually cover the area you will need to grab and work with.
Keep the cushions nearby and keep track of which cushions belong to which section of the sofa.;
, Locate the corner section of the sectional sofa. Find the lip running around the top perimeter of the corner piece and slide your fingers beneath it.


Placing your fingers here will give you the greatest amount of leverage when you lift up the corner section. For best results, position your fingers beneath the corner section lip along the edge it shares with the detachable section.

, Lift the lip of the corner piece straight up. The entire corner piece should lift up and out of the sectional jaw clamps.Note that most sectional sofas use jaw clamps, but some may use other clamp-and-pin style attachments. Regardless of the exact hardware used, the procedure for detaching the pieces should be the same.
The pin mechanism is usually attached to the corner section, so when you lift the corner up, that pin should slide up and out of the clamp attached to the detachable section. If this does not work, it is possible that the pin is attached to the detachable section. Try lifting up the detachable section instead of the corner.

, Move to the sofa section previously attached to the corner piece and grab the outer edge. Pull this edge straight out to pull the section away from the rest of the sofa.


It will be easiest to pull the section away if you are pulling from the edge opposite the jaw clamp side.
Note that the clamp portion of the jaw clamp may fall out as you slide the section away. This is fine, but you will need to remember that the clamp is loose while moving the section to avoid damaging any walls or other surfaces.

, If your sofa has more than one detachable section, you will need to pull each section away separately.


If each detachable section was originally connected to the corner piece, they will usually separate from the corner simultaneously once you lift the corner up. If the detachable sections are all connected at different places, however, you will need to lift each connection away separately.
Once the clamps and pins are separated, you should be able to move the sofa sections around as desired.
After separating the sofa sections, rearrange the sofa as desired and join the sections back together as needed. Place the cushions back on the sofa when finished.

, If there are any cushions on your sections before you join them, temporarily take those cushions off before connecting the sections together.


Taking the cushions off will make it easier to see what you are doing while joining the sections. You can technically join the sections together with the cushions on, but doing so is not recommended.
It is best to keep the cushions nearby as you work. Make sure that you remember which cushion belongs to which sofa section.

, Find the sectional jaw clamps on both connecting sections. Arrange the separated sections so that these clamps line up with one another.


Make sure that you know which section has the “pin” side of the clamp and which has the actual “clamp” side.
If the clamps lie flat against the sofa sections, you do not need to make any changes to them before joining the sections together.
If the sectional sofa has clamps that extend outward, make sure that these clamps are parallel to the base of the section before joining the sections together. These types of jaw clamps tend to fall down when you separate the sofas, so you will likely need to straighten them up each time you want to reconnect the sections.

, Lift the pin-side section up and push it directly next to the clamp-side section. Press the pin-side section down until the pin snaps into the clamp of the adjacent section.The pin-side section is usually the corner piece, so the corner is usually the section you will need to lift and move.
Note that for some outward facing clamps, you do not need to lift the section to join it to its adjacent piece. You might be able to simply push the clamp into the pin while both sections are flat on the ground.
Regardless of how the clamp works, you should wait until you hear an audible “click” or until both sections appear perfectly level before you stop pushing the clamp together.

, If your sofa has multiple detached sections, you will need to join each section together one at a time.


It is best to connect the heaviest or largest sections together first. Join the smallest section to the sofa last.
Some pieces may have both pin-side and clamp-side hardware on them, so you will need to make sure that you line up the correct side with the adjacent section based on which type of hardware is on that adjacent section.

, Now that the sections have been joined, you should place the cushions back on the sofa sections.


Once the cushions are back in place, the sectional sofa should be ready to use.

Replace overly bent guides.,
Remove the drawer and set it aside.,
Loosen the screw that holds the glide.,
Slide the glide downward.,
Adjust the mounting brackets if necessary.",How to Adjust Your Cabinet Drawers2," Some glides are secured to the inside edge of the face frame with a screw and mounted into a plastic bracket that is attached to the inside rear of the cabinet.


Sometimes with this type of mounting, the glides can become slightly bent or twisted.
Check to see if this is the case. If so, remove the glide screws and the glide, then use a little pressure or twisting to return the glide to shape, if possible.
This should be very simple. If too bent, then both the right and left glides will need to be replaced, as they are sold only in a set.

, Be sure to replace the damaged, useless glides.


Take one to your home center to get a proper replacement.
They cost about $6 to $8 for a set.
The good news, however, is that this type of damage is usually very “fixable” and replacement is not needed.

, More often, your glides will be mounted on wood rails that run from the backside of the face frame to the inside rear of the cabinet. The glide can be adjusted at several points along the railing and are usually mounted with 3 or four screws per rail.


If your drawer binds at the top, against the face frame, this is a fairly simple adjustment.

, Use the Phillips screwdriver to loosen the screw that holds the drawer glide to the inside of the face frame.


Loosen it only. Do not remove it.
This screw is located in a vertical oblong hole in the glide to allow for up and down adjustment.

, With the mounting screw loosened, slide the drawer glide downward and retighten the screw.


Repeat the same process with the drawer glide at the opposite side of the drawer space.
Do any necessary fine-tuning to the glides and tighten the screws to secure the glides.

, If the glides are mounted in a bracket at the inside rear of the cabinet, the mounting bracket typically has elongated slots for adjustment.


Loosen the mounting screws enough to adjust the bracket.
Tighten ONE screw enough to secure the bracket so you can test the adjustment.
When satisfied with the adjustment, you may tighten all screws.
NOTE: Because of the way the glides are designed and mounted, it is very unlikely that a drawer would bind at the bottom.

Identify a drawer with wheels that drop off the track as the drawer is closed.,
Check the position of your rails and wheels.,
Adjust a minor derailment.,
Fix a drawer rail that jumps off as the drawer is closed.,
Align the washers with the hole where the screw will be replaced.",How to Adjust Your Cabinet Drawers3," Typical drawer glide designs consist of a pair of rails that are mounted to the drawer and a pair of rails that are mounted to the cabinet.


The drawer rails have a small wheel located at the end near the back of the drawer and the cabinet rails have a small wheel located near the face frame of the cabinet.
The drawer wheel travels along the track of the cabinet rail, while the wheel on the cabinet rail supports the track of the drawer rail.
Either the right or left cabinet rail has a “hooked” channel along the top edge to keep the drawer wheel securely in the track.
The corresponding drawer rail has a slightly “hooked” edge along the bottom to keep the drawer from slipping off the cabinet rail.
The rails along the opposite side of the drawer and cabinet do not have these “hooked” edges.
If the right and left rails are not parallel, then this is when the drawer is likely to drop off the track along that edge. You can usually feel this occur as you close the drawer.
You are also likely to feel a temporary bind and a “pop” of the wheel back onto the track as you open the drawer.

, With the drawer fully closed, use a flashlight to look at the drawer rails and cabinet rails from inside the cabinet and below the drawers.


If the drawer has jumped the track, the drawer glide wheel along the “non-hooked” edge will be off or nearly off the track.

, You can make the adjustment by loosening the mounting screws along on the cabinet rail mounting bracket at the inside rear of the cabinet.


Nudge the bracket inward until the glide wheel on the drawer is properly traveling along cabinet rail.
Then, secure it in place by tightening the bracket screws.

, If the drawer rail jumps off the guide wheel at the face frame as the drawer is closed, then you have to use the following trick to realign the rail.


Remove the mounting screw that holds the rail to the face frame of the cabinet.
Take one or more of the ¾” washers and use as spacers between the face frame and the rail.
You can gage the number of washers you will need by comparing the thickness of a number of washers with how much the rail needs to be moved.

, Since you have now increased the space between the rail and the face frame, you will need to use one of the longer screws described at the beginning of the tutorial.


Your drawer should now open and close without jumping the track!
Use this same trick if the cabinet glides are mounted to wood rails that run from front to back. You may use washers to adjust the back end of the glide as you did the face frame end of the glide.

"
"
Fix a wheel that lifts off.,
Loosen the mounting screw.,
Make any necessary small adjustments to align support wheel.,
Raise the right cabinet glide rail if the left drawer glide is lifted off the support wheel.",How to Adjust Your Cabinet Drawers4," Fixing a glide wheel that lifts of the rail when the drawer is closed requires a different solution than fixing a wheel that “jumps” the track.


This scenario is when the wheel lifts straight up off the track surface at either the front or back of the drawer.
This, too, is an easy adjustment.

, If the wheel lifts off the track at the back of the drawer, simply loosen the mounting screw on the rail or the mounting bracket.


Then, slightly raise the rail until the wheel rides properly on the track.
Be sure not to raise it too much, or the opposite wheel will lift off its track.

, If the drawer glide lifts from the support wheel on the rail at the face frame, this will require a small adjustment.


However, the adjustment will be made at the rear end of the rail and not at the face frame.

,


Raising the cabinet glide at the opposite corner will lower the drawer glide back onto the support wheel at the face frame.
Here is the “formula” to keep in mind: Raising right rear lowers left front; raising left rear lowers right front! Think in opposites!
When using washers or any other material for spacers, either run the mounting screws through the spacers or have two equal-size spacers “straddle” the mounting screws to avoid distorting the shape of the glide rail.
Distortion and twisting can cause binding—and that’s what we’re trying to adjust!

The first aspect of installation should be the upper cabinets.,
Assemble the cabinets, but do not put the doors on yet.,
Use a stud finder to locate and mark the locations of the studs in your walls.,
Start on one end or in a corner and install the upper cabinets.",How to Install Kitchen Cabinets2," This is so you will not need to work over the lower cabinets to do so.








, Most modular cabinets come with instructions and go together just like kit bookcases. Take the time to make sure that the cabinets are assembled as securely, squarely and evenly as you can.








, Plumb down from the ceiling and use a measuring tape to mark the height of the cabinet brace or rail you will fasten through. Since the new cabinets will conceal the wall after they are installed, you can simply tap a small nail through it to locate the studs. When you have found one, measure either 16 or 24 inches (40.6 or 61.0 cm) to find other studs in your wall, since these are typical stud spacings.








, There are two methods you can use. Either way, get help lifting and supporting them until they are screwed in.









The first method, called the French Cleatmethod, consists of screwing a support, or cleat, to the wall at an appropriate height that allows you to hang the cabinets on the cleat. See the Sources and Citations section below for a link giving the details of this method.
The second method will require a partner. Create a support jack by screwing a short length of a 2x4, or other sturdy scrap wood across the end of another 2x4. If you like, cover the end with a rag or old towel to use as a cushion. Have your helper use this T of wood with the bottom end against the floor, and the top against the bottom of the cabinets to support the cabinets while you level them and screw them to the wall.
Calculate the distance from the edge of a wall cabinet to the stud(s) behind it. Mark these spots on the back of the cabinet, and drill pilot holes from the back of the cabinet. Be sure to allow for the ""ears"" on the front of the cabinet. When you place the cabinet to the wall, you'll know where the stud is.
Always secure the cabinets firmly to studs before loading them with their contents. Secure cabinets to each other as well as the wall. Drill pilot holes in the cabinet frame and screw together with good wood screws.

"
"
Begin work on the lower cabinets once the upper cabinets have been completed.








,
Mark the locations of your studs for the lower cabinets, then bring in the cabinets and set them into place.,
Do a test fit and, if the cabinets are backed, make any cutouts necessary for electrical outlets, plumbing hookups, and the like.








,
Level the top of the cabinets by shimming under and behind them.,
Screw the lower cabinets to the wall.",How to Install Kitchen Cabinets3,", Check which cabinet sits highest, perhaps due to a high spot in the floor. It is easier to shim the others up to this height than to shorten the tall one.








,, Remember that you will install a counter top on the cabinets, so you want this reasonably level and all the joints to be flush. Look at the appearance of the cabinet fronts and make sure those are even.








, You can often screw right through the shims.








"
"
The counter top should be the next task once the cabinets have been completed.








,
Test fit the counter top.,
Place the counter top on top of the lower cabinets.",How to Install Kitchen Cabinets4,", Cut it to length if required, and cut out the sink opening and the opening for the stove (hob) if it will be built in. You may need to cut the counter top short so that it will set in if it is between two walls. If you allow a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) on the overall length, you can caulk the ends after it is installed.
<br.









For post formed (laminate on particle board) counter tops, you will get better results cutting it to length with a ""finish"", or ""plywood"" blade rather than a ripping or combination circular saw blade.
Cutting with the counter top upside down will reduce chipping, but make sure you support the piece until the cut is complete.
For cutting a sink opening, invert your sink at the location it will go, mark the outline of the outside rim lightly with a pencil, then make another mark about 5⁄16 inch (0.8 cm) inside this line for your cut. Place masking tape on the outside of the cut mark, and use a jigsaw to make your cut. If you cannot ""plunge"" your jigsaw (starting inside the cut line), you may drill a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) hole to drop your blade into to start your cut.
Seal all cut surfaces of post formed counter tops before installing to prevent moisture from swelling the material later if your caulking fails to seal.
More durable counter tops can be made from synthetic marble (Corian, etc.), natural granite or other stone, cementuous backerboard or plywood covered with ceramic tile.

, Screw it in from underneath, making sure that the screws you use are not so long that they will break through the material to the top.








"
"
Begin work on caulking once the counter top has been finished.








,
Apply caulk around the sink cutout and lower the sink into place.,
Apply caulk around the edges of the counter top and between the backsplash and the wall.








",How to Install Kitchen Cabinets5,", Check the fit and location, then secure it into place with the brackets underneath. Apply caulk around the rim of the sink.








,"
"
Complete these final steps to finish installing your kitchen cabinet.








,
Install the stove in a similar fashion, if it is a range top model.








,
Install the cabinet doors and hardware, and adjust the hinges so that the doors hang properly.

, If you are getting sofa, you probably would want one that match your other furniture. If you had two yellow chairs and a plaid sofa, your house probably wouldn't look too inviting.

, Color also helps a couch look better. Don't make a couch with a color that looks like it is going to blind you, but don't make it look as if it would suck all the fun out of you.

, If something as hard as a rock, then you might break your back jumping on it, but if it is too soft, then you might drown in cushion.

Measure the length of crown molding you will need.,
Construct a guide fence for use with your miter saw.,
Prepare and install framing along the top of the cabinets.,
Cut the butt joint for the first length of molding.,
Cut any outside corners in the molding.,
Cut any inside corners in the molding.,
Begin affixing the molding.",How to Add Molding to Cabinets," Begin by using a tape measure to determine the total length of your cabinet tops. This will determine the total length of crown molding you need to purchase. If this is your first time working with molding, consider buying about 20 percent more length than you need to allow for mistakes and wasted material.;
, Each joint in your cabinet molding will form a compound angle, meaning the pieces must be mitered to create the right angle as well as beveled to fit tightly against each other. This compound angle can be easily achieved if you have a miter saw capable of compound cuts. Otherwise, you must create a guide fence.


Begin by placing a piece of molding into the miter saw at the same angle that it will sit against the cabinets. The top of the molding should rest against the saw table, while the bottom should rest against the saw fence.
With the molding in this position, position a scrap of dimension lumber against the molding and glue it to the saw table. Once the glue is set, make a 45 degree cut in either direction to clear away the middle portion of the dimension lumber. The lumber will act as a guide fence, ensuring that the molding sits in the correct position and allowing you to cut compound angles in one cut.

, If desired, you can nail or glue the crown molding directly onto your cabinet boxes. However, for a sturdier approach, you should install framing along the cabinet tops. This can be as simple as a length of 1 x 2 in (2.5 x 5 cm) furring strip, cut to length and glued along the tops of the cabinets, flush with the edges. You will affix the molding directly to this framing.

, The first length of molding will butt directly against a wall on one end, with the other end either meeting the next piece at an inside or outside corner along the cabinets. To cut the butt joint, simply place the molding into the miter saw and make a straight cut.

, Outside corners are cut by placing the molding into the miter saw and cutting at a 45 degree angle. Because even inexpensive cabinet boxes are nearly always squared well, you will not likely have to make any adjustments to these cuts to get the joint to fit cleanly.

, You may need to cut an inside corner if your cabinets wrap around an inside corner of your walls. This corner is cut in the same manner as it would be for crown molding on your ceilings. One piece should be cut into a butt joint. The other piece should be cut at a 45 degree angle, and then the excess wood should be cut away using a coping saw. Follow the profile of the molding carefully with the coping saw to ensure a clean fit with the adjacent piece.

, You should nail the molding in place using finish nails. If you chose to install a strip of framing along your cabinets, drive the nails directly into the framing. If the cabinet molding will rest against the ceiling, you can use finish nails to affix the molding to the ceiling. Apply a small amount of glue at each joint, wiping away the excess with a cloth.

Put the cushions back on the couch.,
Place the fitted sheet over all of the cushions.,
Cover the arms.,
Place some pillows.",How to Cover a Sofa1," You'll need a full set of sheets, both fitted and flat, in at least full size. Queen and even King size sheets may be needed for larger couches.;
, Remove all of the movable cushions off of the couch.

, Lay the flat sheet over the sofa so that it creates a skirt in the front and drapes all the way around to the back.


You may need to orient the short sides at the arms of the couch, or they might need to be at the back and front. It depends on the size and shape of your couch.

, Replace the cushions on the couch, keeping the sheet looking nice and straight where it shows through at the front.

, Now place the fitted sheet over both the seat cushions and the back cushions (if there are back cushions). Tuck the sheet as you go until it looks nice and uniform over the cushions.

, Now you'll want to cover the arms of the couch. Take the pillow cases and drape them over the arms of the couch, lengthwise so that the front of the arms are covered. Tuck and pin the fabric until it looks nice.


This method leaves the sides of the couch exposed. If you have tables or other items on the sides of the couch, this won't matter. However, if the sides of your couch will be visible, use folded blankets draped over the side, to keep the sides disguised.

, Now all you have to do is cover and place some pillows to make the couch look more normal. You can use pillow cases on normal pillows or you can cover or reuse loose pillows that came with the couch.

Put the upholstery and fabric back on the couch.",How to Fix a Sagging Couch," A sagging couch could be the result of worn out cushions, old springs, or a bad frame.If the problem is the cushions, you're in for an easy fix. If the cushions seem fine upon inspection, you may have to replace the springs or the frame. Depending on the level of damage you may need to replace the entire couch.;
, Before you start taking your couch apart, take some pictures so you have something to refer to. If you can, take the pictures to a local furniture repair shop and see if they can help you determine the problem.

, Remove all the sofa cushions and turn the couch over so that you can see the bottom. Look for torn fabric and broken or rotted wood.


If you see any cracked wood, or wood that is ""bowed"" out, you'll need to replace it. This will involve taking off most of the upholstery fabric and can be time consuming.You may have to remove some of the fabric on the bottom, known as a dust cover, to inspect the springs. Be gentle and take care not to rip the fabric., Some couches have zig-zag springs which are also known as ""sagless"" springs. Other couches use coiled springs.Determine whether your springs are bent or broken. If the springs are bent you may be able to fix them yourself. If they're broken you may need to bring your couch to an upholsterer.
Older couches tend to have coiled springs, while newer couches have zig-zag springs. Your couch may not have springs at all, depending on the quality of the frame.Check the space beneath the cushions. You may find that the slats or straps of the couch have snapped.

, If the cushions feel too soft, then you may need to add more filling. Open up the individual cushion cover and remove the insides.This is a good opportunity to wash the cushion covers., Batting is fabric used in upholstery to give the cushions a smooth appearance. It is usually made of cotton or wool, but can also be a blend of materials, including polyester.If the foam has noticeable dents in it, you may need to replace the entire cushion. If the batting is worn, but the foam is fine, you can get by with just replacing the batting., Determine what needs to be replaced in your cushions. You can buy both foam and batting online or at an upholstery supply store.


You can also stuff your couch cushions with a different material if you prefer. You don't have to use foam. Instead you can find cotton, down, even old clothing if you wanted to. The material you use will affect the softness of the couch. Make sure you like the firmness before you stuff every cushion.Consider the durability of your materials. Some materials may not hold up well, but foam padding could last you for years to come.

, Make sure to use ""sheets"" of batting. Cut to the seat size, and wrap the cushions a few layers thick. Remember to smooth it over, otherwise you may create a lumpy seat., Once you've repaired your cushions you can place them back in their covers. Sit on the couch to make sure the cushions were the only issue with the sagging couch. If the couch still sags, inspect the frame again.

, If the wooden boards that support the couch frame have broken, you will need to replace the wood and screws. Measure the slats and take note of how many you need. You should be able to buy your material at a hardware store.


If you need to, take a slat for reference to make sure you get exactly what you need.
You could also place a piece of plywood between the frame and the cushions for added support. This isn't a permanent solution, and it could make the couch a little firmer than you'd like.Use wood glue to seal the ends. Use a staple gun with long, thick staples, or a hammer and very thin nails, to secure the beam in place.

, If they are twisted or bent, you can fix them by using pliers to bend the springs back into the shape of the other coils.If you need to replace the springs, your best bet is to take your couch to a professional furniture repair shop. Replacing springs requires a specialized tool, such as a spring stretcher., If the wooden frame is cracked or rotted, you'll need to dismantle the couch and replace the wood. You might find that the wood used to build your couch is plywood. If this is the case, consider replacing it with hardwood.Remove any fabric attached to the wood you'll be replacing. Take care not to damage the fabric.You'll need to remove the springs that are attached to the frame, which will require the use of a special tool. This process can be dangerous, so be careful.Once the springs and fabric have been safely removed, take the wood off the couch., Using a staple gun or a hammer and nails, replace the broken boards with your new wood.Secure the board with wood glue and let it dry completely.Reattach the spring clips to the new wood. This may require the use of a spring stretcher. Secure the clips with new screws., With the frame replaced, you can go about reattaching the upholstery to the wood. Using a staple gun, pull the fabric tight and staple it to the bottom of the frame."

Clean leather sofas safely.,
Condition leather furniture.",How to Maintain Your Sofa1," If you have a vacuum with an upholstery attachment, this is ideal for vacuuming a sofa. You should vacuum your sofa at least once a week when you're doing your regular chores. This will keep the sofa free of dirt and debris that can cause damage over time. This will also help control air quality in the room where you keep your sofa. If dirt and debris settle onto a sofa, they can affect the integrity of the surrounding air.


Vacuum the surface of the sofa. You should also vacuum in any nooks and crannies. If you can remove the cushions, remove them and vacuum underneath.
You should also vacuum the floor surrounding the sofa and under the sofa. Push the sofa forward or backward at least once a week and vacuum underneath.;
, If something spills on your sofa, or if you notice a stain, you should start addressing the situation by looking at the manufacturer's label. This will tell you how to properly clean your sofa based on its material.Some sofa's may not come with a manufacturer's label. In these cases, do a spot test with a furniture cleaning solution, a homemade solution of your choosing. If the solution does not damage the furniture, you can treat the stain using the solution.

, If something spills on your leather sofa, clean it up right away before the stain has a chance to set. In addition to this, once a day, check the sofa for any stains. It's possible the sofa got dirty during the day without you noticing.As soon as something spills on the sofa, wipe away whatever spilled with a paper towel or a dry soft cloth. Use blotting motions to remove the liquid. If you catch a spill quick enough, you can remove it before it leaves a mark on your sofa.
If you don't get everything out with a dry cloth, use a water-based cleaner to rub out the remaining stain. However, do not attempt to treat a grease or oil stain yourself. These can be tricky to remove, and typically require professional cleaning services.

, This is especially important if you have pets. A couple times a week, roll a lint roller over your sofa. This will remove any loose hairs or debris stuck to the sofa, giving it a cleaner feel and appearance.This can be especially helpful if you have a white sofa, as stray hairs tend to show up easier on white or light colored furniture.

, If you have a leather sofa, it will need to be cleaned regularly. In addition to regularly vacuuming and lint rolling, you need to wipe down a leather sofa with a cleaning solution.Many people make their own cleaning solution for leather furniture by mixing equal parts water and white vinegar. However, you can also buy a commercial leather cleaner at a hardware or department store. Whichever cleaner you use, test it on a small portion of your leather sofa before applying to the whole surface.
Coat a soft cloth in the solution until it's damp, but not dripping wet. Wipe down the full surface of the sofa. When you are done, gently dry the surface with a dry rag.

, Conditioning leather furniture gives it a sleek shine after cleaning. Mix one part white vinegar with two parts linseed or flaxseed oil. Then, use a dry cloth to apply this mixture across your sofa. Use circular motions when applying to give your sofa a nice shine.Let the solution sit on your sofa overnight.
The next morning, buff the solution with a dry rag to restore shine to your sofa.

Lift the locking levers to release the seat backs.",How to Dismantle a Recliner Sofa1," Lift the sofa forward so the back faces straight up into the air. Many upholstered sofas have a detachable back panel that you can lift to expose the inner frame. Locate and unfasten the velcro strips or snaps that secure the fabric to the frame’s base, then lift up the upholstered panel., Check the frames on each side of the sofa’s seats for the locking levers. At each side of the sofa’s main body, around where the top of the arm and back join, you should see a metal lever pointing in a downward position. If your sofa has a center console, you should see levers on the frames between it and the seats., If your sofa doesn’t have detachable strips of fabric that expose the frame, stick your hands into the rear seams on the sofa’s left and right sides. Check the seams between the center console and seats, if any are present. Feel within the seams for the locking lever pointed in a down position., Use a flat head screwdriver or, in a pinch, your fingertips to loosen and raise each lever and release the seat backs. After unlocking the levers, return the sofa to its normal position and carefully lift the back out of its frame.If your sofa has a pair of seats divided by a center console, lift each individual seat and console back out of its housing.

Sew the pieces together.",How to Cover a Sofa2," Keep in mind the décor in the rest of the room and the desired level of comfort on the sofa. Do not choose fabric that is especially expensive, as your cover will hang on the ground and will also likely need to be cleaned because of frequent use.


A home supply or sewing store will have many options for your sofa. Choose a lightweight fabric that is easy to clean. Buy a piece of fabric approximately twice the length and twice the width of the sofa to give yourself extra room to work with.
Jersey fabric is recommended, as it will stretch to form to your couch. However, it will not look as ""fancy"" as some other fabrics might.
Purchasing the fabric for your cover on sale from a fabric store is recommended, since this will save you a lot of money. In the US, many craft stores will have weekly coupons that can be used to save money on fabric as well.

, The length is the distance from where the sofa touches the ground in the back, over the sofa, to where it touches the ground in front. In other words, measure the height of the back of the sofa, add the depth of the sofa, and then add the height of the front. Use a flexible tape measure to get this measurement. The sofa's width is the distance across the seat of the sofa from one arm to the other.


Write both of these measurements down.

, The arm width is the distance from where the arm meets the seat of the sofa, over the arm, to where the arm touches the ground. The arm length is the distance from where the arm meets the back of the sofa to the edge of the arm.


These measurements should also be written down.

, The under layer is the main piece of fabric that will go directly on top of the sofa. It serves as the main protection for the sofa and lies beneath the top piece.


To find the under layer's width, add the sofa width to both arm widths and add an additional 12 inches (or 30 cm.) to allow for tucking. For example, a sofa with a body width of 4 feet (or 122 cm.) and arm widths of 1 foot (or 30 cm.) should have a width of 7 feet (or 212 cm.). To find the under layer's length, add the sofa length to both arm lengths and add an additional 12 inches (or 30 cm.).

, A hem is a small ribbon of folded-over fabric that runs along the edge. It will serve to keep the under layer in place. To sew the hem, fold over 5/8 of an inch (or 1.6 cm.) of fabric along all sides and sew this to the under layer.

, The body of the top piece will drape over the back of the sofa onto the floor. To find the body's length, use the sofa length and add approximately 12 inches (or 30 cm.) to allow for tucking. To find the width, use the sofa width and add approximately 2 inches (or 5 cm.) to allow for hemming.

, The arms of the top piece will be secured to the body and flow over the arms. To find the arm piece's lengths, use the arm lengths and add approximately 2 inches (or 5 cm.) to allow for hemming. To find the arm piece's widths, use the arm widths and add approximately 12 inches (or 30 cm.) to allow for tucking.

, Drape and tuck the under layer behind the sofa's cushions. The under layer should fall evenly to the ground and should have any excess fabric tucked between the back of the sofa and the cushions.

, Drape the body of the top piece over the body of the sofa. Now, drape the arms of the top piece over the sofa's arms.

, Sew together the body and arms of the top piece. After adjusting the arms so that they fall to the floor evenly, pull each one about 5/8 of an inch (or 1.6 cm.) under the body piece. Sew each arm piece to the body piece. You can do this by hand or with a machine. When you're done, tuck any excess fabric into the cushions.

Measure and observe your sofa.,
Purchase a cover with an appropriate size for your sofa.,
Put the cover on your sofa.",How to Cover a Sofa3," Take the measurements for your sofa's length and width, as well as the length and width of the arms. You'll need to know these in order to know what size cover to buy. You'll also want to take note of what style of couch you have and who the manufacturer is. There might be an official slipcover made especially for your couch, such as if it is from Ikea. If not, the general shape of your couch should inform what style of cover you buy.


For example, if your couch has scroll-style arms, you'll want to find a slipcover with ties at the front so that you can gather the material and maintain the round shape of the arm.

, Sofa covers are readily available at home supply, furniture, and upholstery stores. Consult the cover's packaging or a sales associate to make sure the cover is the right size. You'll want to err on the side of caution: if you're unsure on the sizing, try to get something that's slightly too large, instead of something that might be slightly too small.

, Drape the cover over your sofa so that its edges fall evenly to the ground. Tuck any excess fabric into the cushions. There may be special instructions included with your sofa cover, in which case you should be sure to read and follow them.

Change where you sit.,
Fluff cushions regularly.,
Flip cushions on occasion.",How to Maintain Your Sofa2," Sitting in the same spot too often can cause the cushions to become uncomfortably soft. This will also cause one area of the sofa to collect more dirt. Instead of sitting in one spot continuously, shift where you're sitting each time you use your sofa.


If you live with family or roommates, encourage household members to do the same.
You should also limit the amount of time you spend sitting on the sofa overall. In addition to keeping your sofa more firm, moving around more often will be good for your health.

, To fluff the cushions of your couch, simply prod and poke them. This will move the stuffing around, preventing it from clumping and becoming hard. This is the same thing you would do to a bed pillow that has flattened out., If your cushions are removable, periodically flip them. You should do this every two weeks. This will help maintain the shape of your cushions and also assure both sides wear down evenly. If you don't flip your cushions regularly, one side of the cushion may become very worn down."

Keep sofas away from direct sunlight.,
Move or cover your sofa during social events.,
Cover leather furniture when it's not in use.,
Do not sit on a sofa's armrest.",How to Maintain Your Sofa3," Sunlight can actually be harmful to sofas. You should keep sofas away from open windows. Draw your blinds during peak sunlight hours in your area.If you dislike keeping your blinds closed, see if you can purchase stain protection when buying a sofa. This is an added feature that will protect a sofa from harmful UV rays.

, If you're having people over, this greatly increases the chances of your sofa becoming stained. You can move your sofa into another room of the house and put out fold-out chairs instead. However, if you don't want your guests to feel uncomfortable, you can also put a cover over your sofa when you have people over.


You can buy a suitable slip cover for your sofa at a local furniture store.

, Leather furniture requires greater protection than other sofas. You can drape lightweight sheets over leather furniture when it's not in use. This will protect your leather furniture from sunlight, dirt, and debris.Cleaning will go much quicker if you cover leather furniture, as it will not gather as much dust and dirt.

, Only sit on the portions of a sofa designed for sitting. Sitting on a sofa's armrest can cause damage.If you live with others, especially young children, make sure everyone in your household knows not to sit on a sofa's armrest.

Turn the sofa over to locate the base bars.,
Unfasten the base bars’ bolts.,
Have a helper hold the sofa as you remove the last bar.",How to Dismantle a Recliner Sofa2," Lift the sofa onto its front side so its back faces straight up toward the ceiling. Look under the sofa to see if it has base bars. If they’re present, you should see two or three bars screwed or bolted from one end of the sofa’s base to the other., Check the heads of the screws or bolts that secure the base bars. Use a drill with the appropriate bit to unfasten each screw or bolt from the base bars.You’ll probably need Robertson drive bits, as base bars are often secured with square Robertson screws.

, It’s best to get someone to help you remove a sofa’s base bars, especially when removing the final bar. When you detach the last bar, the individual seats and console will come apart freely. Having someone stabilize the sofa will help keep its components from rolling away, getting damaged, or damaging nearby objects."

Take pictures as you disassemble the sofa.,
Keep bolts, screws, and other hardware in separate plastic bags.,
Reinstall the top bar first during reassembly.,
Reassemble seats by replacing the backs and locking the levers.",How to Dismantle a Recliner Sofa3," When you first lift the sofa’s rear upholstery panel, take pictures of the frame, base, and other relevant features. That way, when you have to put it back together, you’ll know what the sofa is supposed to look like when it’s fully assembled.If you’re unsure about your mechanical abilities, you could take pictures at each step of disassembly to guide you during reassembly.

, Have plastic bags or other small containers on hand when you unfasten any screws or bolts. Place your hardware into a bag as soon as you remove it. Keep separate bags for each base bar’s hardware so it’s easier to sort through the screws, bolts, nuts, and washers.Label your disassembled parts so you’ll know where to reinstall “left seat back” and “top base bar.”

, Line up each of the base’s parts up so their backs face the ceiling. Locate the predrilled holes on the top base bar where the screws or bolts fit, and line the bar up with the corresponding holes on the sofa’s base. Start by fastening the top bar’s center screws that attach it to the center part of the sofa, then work outward to reattach the bar to the base of each sofa part.After securing the top bar, drive the screws into the remaining bars to reassemble the sofa base.

, Place the sofa in a normal position. Carefully slide the detached seat back into its housing, and jiggle it a little until you’ve slid it all the way into place.Turn the sofa forward so the back faces toward the ceiling, locate the locking levers, and push each lever down to lock the seat into position."

Note that fabric is sold by the yard, which is the measurement lengthwise. Bolts of fabric at the craft store have predetermined width, which you'll need to verify before purchasing. Typical widths range from 32 to 60 inches (81 to 152 cm), with 45 and 60 inches (114 and 152 cm) being the most common. The following measurements are based on fabric that is 54 inches (137 cm) wide.


For a two-cushion sofa, use 16 yards (16 m)
For a three-cushion sofa, use 18 yards (18 m)
For a six-cushion sofa, use 22 yards (22 m)
For a two-cushion love seat, use 13 yards (13 m)
For a four-cushion love seat, use 17 yards (17 m);
, You can purchase it at a fabric store or online.


Consider a fabric in a solid color. Matching patterns or stripes across large panels can be tricky, so unless you're ready to put in this extra effort, look for a cover material that's a single tone.
Opt for a fabric with a lot of drape – this will be much easier to work with., This softens the material and also accounts for any shrinkage that may occur. Don't skip this important step: the beauty of a slipcover is that it can be easily removed and washed, but you need to make sure it won't shrink after you've made it.Be sure to follow care instructions for the particular fabric you're working with.

, Wrinkles could cause puckering in the finished product, so this ensures a smooth and accurate fit.

, This mock cover should conform to the sofa's general shape. Since you're creating the pattern at this point, you can decide whether you want a close-fitting slipcover, or one that drapes more loosely.


Note that it's okay if you need to use two or three large, separate pieces. In that case, you may need to secure sections to the sofa with safety pins.The arm fronts don't need to be covered at this stage; see Step 3 for more details.
If you're feeling confident, you can skip the mock-up and drape the sofa with the material you're going to use, wrong-side up (that is, the color or pattern should be facing down). In this case, you can trace the pattern onto the fabric itself with chalk.

, Use chalk to identify where to cut out the pattern (with the exception of the arm fronts, which you'll do in Step 3). You should have a few different sections:


the outside back of the sofa
the seating area (including the backrest and front section that drops to the floor)
the sides of the slipcover, which start on the outside and come up and over the inside of the armrests

, These are the two vertical sections on either side of the front of the sofa. It's easiest to create the pattern for them separately. Note that you need only make one pattern, which you can use to create both pieces.Cut out one rectangular piece of paper or muslin, roughly the size of the arm front.
Use pins to hold it to one of the arm fronts.
Trace with chalk along the outline of the arm front.
You'll use this piece for both armrests

, Use the scissors to cut carefully along the chalk outlines you've made.

, Place large sections of the slipcover fabric on a flat surface, then cover with each of the pattern sections. Mark the dimensions on the fabric with the chalk and cut out each section, allowing about 1 inch (2.5 cm) seam allowance for hemming.


Seam allowance is a bit of extra fabric you leave so that you can sew the pieces of fabric together.
If your arm fronts are asymmetrical, be sure to flip the pattern over before tracing the second one.

, Lay the pieces of the fabric on the sofa, wrong-side out (i.e., pattern or colored side facing in to sofa). Use straight pins to assemble the sections of the cover, taking care to affix the pins just on the inside of the chalk lines. This will create the general shape for the slipcover.

, Remove these sections from the sofa (you'll need to unpin them from the other sections, but don't touch the pins connecting the arm fronts). Use a sewing machine to stitch the sections together, using the chalk line as the ""road"" for the stitching.


Remember to place the fabric into the sewing machine wrong-side up, so that your seams end up smooth on the right side.
Remove the pins once you've sewn the pieces together.

, Remove the other two pieces (the back and seating area) from the sofa, taking care not to lose the pins. Use a sewing machine to join these two pieces together.


Remove the pins once you're done.

, Make sure the cover fits snugly and falls evenly. Add pins to join the sides and body once again.

, Use the pins and chalk lines to guide you.


Remove the pins from the seams as you go.

, Place the cover back on the sofa, wrong-side out. Make sure the seams are straight and the cover fits smoothly across the surfaces.


If there are any spots that need fixing, now is the time. Remove problem seams with a seam ripper and rework them so that they are straight.

, Remove the slipcover from the sofa and spread it out on a large work surface. Use chalk to trace a hemline along the bottom, about 1/2-1 inch (1.25-2.5 cm) from the edge. Use a tape measure to make sure your line is straight.

, Fold along the hemline (wrong side to wrong side) and secure the fabric with pins.

, This step helps ensure a clean, straight hemline, and makes sewing easier.

, Use the sewing machine to make the hem. Pause from time to time to make sure the stitches are even and holding properly.

, Turn the slipcover so the right side is facing out and place it on the sofa, carefully tucking the cover into place.

Clean oil-based stains with neutral soap.",How to Clean Natuzzi Leather1," Attach the brush accessory to the hose of a vacuum cleaner. Use a medium setting and vacuum up dirt. Alternatively, you could use a brush with soft bristles. Gently sweep up the dirt into a dustpan.


Regardless of which method you use, avoid rubbing the leather too harshly. This could set in the stain.;
, Water-soluble substances include coffee, tea, milk, soda, or sugary preserves. Use a clean, dry cloth to blot the spill and absorb the liquid. Work quickly, but be gentle. Then, dampen another cloth with plain water. Start rubbing at the outside of the stain and gradually work your way inward. Use another dry cloth to blot excess water until it's completely absorbed.


Never dry your furniture with a hair dryer. Dry hot air will damage the leather., Use a paper towel to wipe away the substance. Avoid rubbing too hard to prevent the mess from getting ground in to the upholstery. Then, soak one of the cloths in diluted soap with a neutral pH (6.5-7.5). Begin gently rubbing the stain at the outer edge and work your way inward. Finally, dry the wet area with the other cloth. Continue blotting until all the moisture is absorbed. Don't use a hair dryer.Oil-based substances include oils, mayonnaise, chocolate, and ketchup.

A W-label indicates that it’s safe to use water when cleaning your couch. An S-label couch will react well to solvents like rubbing alcohol, but you should avoid using water. A S-W label means you can use either water or a special solvent, but a X-label means you can’t use any liquid at all. For X-label couches, you should only use your vacuum for cleaning the couch cushions.If you can’t find a care tag on your couch, a safe way to proceed is to treat it as if it has an S-tag.;
, If you can, remove the cushions from your suede couch. This will allow you to clean both sides and make it easier to get the entire cushion clean. If your cushions are not removable, be extra careful to clean the whole cushion.

, Working against the grain of the suede in your cushion, gently brush the cushion with a suede brush. This lifts up the nap, which helps you saturate the cushion with cleaner.If you don’t have a suede brush, a clean bath towel will work just as well.

, For couches with W-labels, fill a spray bottle with warm water and then add a few squirts of mild dish soap. If your couch has an S-label care tag, fill a water bottle with undiluted rubbing alcohol., To clean your whole cushions to refresh your couch, work on one small area at a time. Spray a small area so that’s it damp, but not soaked, with the cleaning solution you’re using., Use a white towel to rub the section you sprayed in a circular motion. Work from the inside of the damp area out, rubbing the cleaning solution gently in to the fabric. Using a white towel will prevent any color transfer from your towel to the couch., Repeat the circular motions you used to clean the cushions to work clear water into the suede. This will rinse your cushions. Use the towel to buff at the edges of your clean area to prevent water marks., If you’re cleaning both sides of a cushion, let the first side dry before you flip it over and work on the other side. If you’re cleaning cushions that are permanently attached to the sofa, let them completely dry before sitting on the sofa again., Once the cushions are dry, brush them with a soft brush or bath towel.

Seal the wood furniture first.,
Clean the furniture of any dust.,
Apply some wax to a clean microfiber cloth.,
Apply the wax to the wood furniture.,
Allow the paste wax to dry.,
Buff the waxed furniture with a clean cloth.",How to Wax Furniture," Wax is not well suited for use as a finish coat itself, but rather as a further protective layer over an existing finish. Make sure your wood furniture has an existing finish coat such as polyurethane, varnish, lacquer, or shellac.;
, Before applying the wax to the wood furniture, rub it down with a clean cloth to remove any dust and debris. If not removed, this dust can mix into the wax and mar the appearance of the finished piece.

, The type of wax used for finishing wood furniture is called ""paste wax"" or ""finishing wax,"" and can be purchased at most hardware stores. It is best applied using a clean microfiber cloth, onto which it can be dabbed straight from the container.


The only significant mistake you can make when applying the wax is laying it on too thickly. A thick coat of wax will dry unevenly and create a splotchy or hazy appearance. For this reason, apply only a little wax at a time to the cloth.
For better control over the amount of wax you apply, you can place a small chunk of paste wax into a piece of cheesecloth and then wrap the cheesecloth into a ball around the wax. The slow seeping of the wax through the cheesecloth will prevent you from applying too much.

, To apply the paste wax, simply rub it into the wood surface with the cloth using smooth, circular motions. Work from one end of the furniture to the other, and aim to apply a thin, even coat. You do not need to apply the wax in any particular relation to the wood's grain.

, After application, the paste wax should take about 20 minutes to dry, or a bit longer in chilly or poorly ventilated spaces. You can test for dryness by touching the wax with your finger in an inconspicuous location; it should no longer have any tacky feeling.

, After the wax has dried, it will need to be buffed into the furniture. This process imparts a lustrous, beautiful sheen to the wood. To buff the wax, use a soft, clean cloth to rub the wax in a gentle, circular motion all across the furniture's surface.


The softer the cloth you use for buffing, the more luster you can achieve in the finished appearance. Scraps of old tee shirts work well for buffing wax.
You will know when you are finished buffing when the furniture no longer improves in sheen as you buff.

, You do not have to sand the final coat.

, Clip the paper tightly in place, making sure that the work surface is taut so that your sandpaper doesn’t bunch up or loosen.

,, Turn the device on and rest it on your work surface.

, Never sand across the grain; you will leave scratches that will show up when the stain is applied.

,,,,,,


If you’re working with hardwood, then wipe the surface with a damp cloth before you sand it with the 220-grit paper. This will raise the grain of the wood and allow you to create a very smooth surface.

Decide if you want to stain over the current color or start from scratch.,
Remove or cover up any non-wood hardware on the furniture.,
Breakdown larger furniture into smaller pieces if possible.,
Sand the whole piece with medium-grit (100-120) sandpaper.,
Use a clean cloth to wipe off the dust between sandings.,
Use a finer-grit sandpaper, around 220 grit, to smooth and polish the surface.,
Clean the wood with mineral spirits.,
Apply a wood conditioner for softer or difficult-to-stain woods.,
Wipe the entire piece clean to remove any last dust or wood conditioner.,
Consider a chemical stripper of you want to drastically change the furniture's color.",How to Stain Furniture1," If the wood is unfinished, which means it is its original color, then you'll simply prepare the wood and add stain. If it is already stained you have a decision to make -- either stain over the old color or remove the stain and start over.


If there is a finish on the furniture (a clear coat that protects the wood), you must remove this before starting.

If you're adding a darker stain to a lighter piece, you can generally add this new stain over the old one without having to remove the original color.;
, Stain can change the color of metal handles, knobs, and hinges permanently. They are best removed before beginning. If the metal cannot be removed then use painter's tape to carefully cover it all up.Plastic, glass, or rubber should be similarly removed to prevent accidental discoloration.

, To get the most even and total coverage you should stain each part of the furniture individually. This prevents missing areas around joints or corners as well as stain pooling up along edges or in cracks. While not strictly necessary, this step will ensure the most professional finish., Work in the direction of the grains to avoid making scratches. This means that you sand parallel to the lines in the wood, not against them. If the piece is large you can use an orbital sander with 120 grit paper to work more quickly.


If the furniture is very worn, go at it with a coarser sandpaper (80 grit or so) until you have it nice and smooth. You can then move to the medium-grit paper.
The lower the number on the sandpaper, the coarser (rougher) the grit.

, Simply wipe off the wood dust as you work, making your sanding easier and more effective. A tack cloth is the best material, as it attracts the wood dust., Sanding opens up microscopic pores in the wood. The stain can then soak into these holes, changing its color permanently.


For very delicate pieces, work up to 220 grit slowly. Go from 150 to 180, then 200, then 220 or higher for a perfect surface.
If the furniture is already stained and the color is still there after sanding, you will either need to continue sanding with a coarse-grit paper or use a chemical stripping agent to remove the old color


, This will bring out the wood's natural color, which will give you a better and richer color once the stain is applied. Simply use a clean rag or sponge to wipe the whole thing with the spirits, then wipe them off with another clean rag.

, Even the easiest to stain wood -- oak -- could use a little wood conditioner for a better coat. Wood conditioner, which is easily applied with a paintbrush or clean sponge, should be left to dry for 10-15 minutes. It is essential for furniture made from:


Alder
Aspen
Birch
Maple
Pine
Fraser
Ceder, Right before you start staining, give everything a quick wipe to prevent any dust or dirt from being accidentally stained over.

, If the piece is already stained dark black, for example, and you want a honey color, you'll likely be sanding all day just to get started. The alternative is a chemical stripper which, though messy, will remove the majority of coloring. To use one, purchase a stripper labeled ""wash away"" or ""no cleanup,"" then move your furniture to a well-ventilated area:


Put on gloves and eye protection.
Apply a thick coat of chemical stripper on the entirety of the wood.
Let the stripper sit according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Use a putty knife to scrape away the stripper, working in the direction of the wood grain.
Scrub away any last stripper with steel wool.
Sand the furniture with a fine-grit paper (200 or higher) once it is dry."

Search for inspiration.,
Use complementary colors.,
Make a statement.,
Coordinate with a few staple pieces.,
Match the color to outdoor scenery.,
Take into account who will be using the sofa.,
Look at the overall motif of the room.,
Think about your personality.,
Think about the fabric.",How to Choose a Sofa Color," Pick up a few interior design magazines like Home Decor and Country Living to help get you started. These magazines will not only give you some helpful hints on choosing colors but will also be full of pictures of professionally designed rooms that can give you a clear idea of what you want. You can also search online on sites like HGTV or Pinterest for some insight and inspiration.;
, An easy way to choose a color for a sofa is to base it off other colors already in the room. Using complementary colors on the color wheel will guarantee a match and take out some of the guesswork in trying to find the perfect sofa shade. For example, if you have a lot of orange in the room via lamps, rugs, or paintings, then a couch which has a blue-ish hue would be a great addition. Or, if you have a large violet colored tapestry, try a chartreuse or other green colored sofa., As a sofa is usually the centerpiece of a room, try making it stand out. Pick bold jewel-tones like jade, ruby, and sapphire or a contrasting color to make the sofa pop. For example, if you have bright white carpet, pick a dark gray sofa or something black. You can also pick large patterns like floral prints or chevron stripes to bring the sofa into the forefront.Be mindful if choosing a particular pattern, though. Different fabrics can cause a sofa to cost more in the long run.

, To bring symmetry or balance to a room, match a sofa’s color with prominent pieces already in the room. This can be anything from lamps, tables, and pictures to the floor. For example, if you have light-colored, wood floors, try a tan or beige leather couch. Not only will the color match the flooring, but the leather will also mimic the smooth finish of the wood.You can also match the sofa upholstery to the color of the wall for a more unified look., If you have a lot of windows, try pairing the sofa color with any outside greenery. For example, if you live in a heavily forested area, earthy tones like greens, browns, and tans would be complementary. Or if you have a large outdoor garden, you can match the sofa color to the shades of the flowers or plants.


For those that live in a city, bring in some color from surrounding buildings. For example, look at the shades of surrounding brick or the dark gray of sleek metal structures nearby.

, Before you choose a color for your sofa, consider the other members of your family. If you have a roommate, children, or even a pet, you may want to go with a neutral dark or medium color like gray to hide potential stains. For example, small children are prone to making messes, and the last thing you want is to come home to a light colored couch covered in dirt and food residue. Similarly, pets like dogs and cats are likely to shed so you may want to match the color to their fur. This will spare you both constant worry and cleaning.

, Is the room you’re placing the sofa in for relaxation, entertaining, or simply for show? If there is a set purpose or theme to the room, you will want the color of the couch to reflect this. For example, if the room is a quiet place for relaxation, going for a light, minimalist color like a pale green or beige is a good choice. However, if the room is for show, you may want to make more of a statement with a bright red or deep purple., If you’re the type of person whose style is constantly changing, then you may want to go for a solid, neutral color. Though this may seem surprising, choosing a non-descript color and dressing it up with accessories like throw pillows is a great idea for someone with a shifting style. A gray, black, or navy couch works similarly to a blank canvas. It also works with pretty much any color you want to add to it.For those with a more traditional, consistent style, you can choose any color you like. Though a solid is recommended over patterns for versatility.

, Depending on the members of your family or the kinds of friends you have, you may want to go for a specific type of fabric. For example, if you aren't worried about dirt or debris you can try for a linen couch. However, if you expect a lot of wear and tear, you may want to go with a more durable fabric like leather or wool. Leather can be both vacuumed and damp-wiped to clean, while wool resists wrinkling, fading, and pilling. Keep in mind that each fabric will cost differently, though.If you aren't sure what would look best in your room, try bringing a couple of fabric samples home. You can get free swatches from craft stores like Jo Anns, or even whole fabric books from eBay.

Measure the size of the sofa set: Settle on a set after analyzing the space available in the living room.,
Consider which style will fit best.,
Decide on the best sofa material.,
Choose a sofa frame.,
Pick the best sofa color.,
Pay for quality.,
Consider a conventional three piece suite (sofa plus two arm chairs) if you favour traditional furniture styles.",How to Choose a Sofa Set," The number of sofas or chairs will be decided according to the space vacant in the room. Settle for a 5 seater set or more depending on the space available. If the room is huge, go for love seat and couches too.;
, There are so many options that are available in the market. One can choose from a loveseat, lounge, tuxedo, camelback and knole, and sectional sofas. If the house has a traditional appeal to it, go for loveseat, camelback or lounge style sofas, while if your home has a modern outlook, choose tuxedo, knole, or sectional style sofas.

,  Sofas can be crafted out of many fabrics. Some of them are silk, microfibers, textures fabric, leatherette, leather, canvas and more. Silk gives the sofa a delicate and rich look but requires heavy maintenance. Fiber sofa make the sofa look attractive and are easy to clean. Leather or leatherette sofas give a modern look to the room and are available in a wide variety of colors.

, The quality of a sofa depends on the quality of its frame. The wooden frame is considered the best, since it is sturdy and strong to last for a long period of time. Check the joints and corner of the frame. A sofa can also be crafted with a metal frame, which is sturdy and strong enough. Avoid buying frames that are crafted with particle board or plywood, since they are prone to cracking and wear and tear quickly.

, Always buy sofas that compliment the colors of the wall. Buying sofa will be an investment for a long time, so buy sofa in a neutral color. If you fancy prints, choose them wisely. It is always a good idea to settle for sofas that will not look boring and let you play with various colors and prints in the long run.

, The quality of the sofa depends on its frame, cushioning and padding of the sofa. The cushion should retain its shape, when somebody sits on and doesn’t curve. The springs have the capacity to bounce back when someone stands up from the sofas. The frame of the sofa should not be felt through the padding.

, A two seater, three seater or even four seater sofa with two matching or coordinating armchairs is a common choice in many homes. Look at this option if it appeals.

The first thing to determine is how you're going to use it.,
Have an idea of what you're willing to pay before you go shopping.,
There are numerous systems for converting a sofa to a bed on the market, but the three most popular are the traditional pull-out sofa bed, futon furniture, and davenports.,
Traditional pull-out sofa beds are sold in most department and full-line furniture stores.,
Futon furniture first broke into the mainstream back in the early eighties as an alternative to the traditional pull-out sofa bed.,
Davenports have been around since the 1940s, maybe longer.,
There are several other kinds of convertible products available (flip flop, daybed, trundle bed, etc.,
And consider the importance of a fitted sheet and mattress pad.",How to Buy a Sofa Bed," Most manufacturers emphasize either sitting comfort OR sleeping comfort, but very few consider both. So it's important to think about whether you want it primarily for use as a sofa or a bed. A sofa bed is always a compromise; it is never the best sofa or the best bed available.;
, You can expect a good quality sofa bed to sell for between $600-$1000. Anything under $500 and you're asking for trouble.

, Before shopping at a ""bricks and mortar"" store, do some research online so that you know what to expect and which questions to ask.

, They feature full and queen size models which seem to be designed as stand alone pieces of furniture whose primary use is for sitting. Unless you're willing to pay more than $1,000, the comfort level of the mattress in the bed position is highly questionable. With an undersized and thin mattress, heavy beyond belief, and famous for that ""bar-in-the-back"" feeling, these are the sofa beds that people love to hate.

, Made-to-order and offering sizes from chairs to queens, futon speciality boutiques soon appeared in all the major North American markets. Futons are practical and functional, but comfort depends totally on what's inside the mattress, as the wood or metal convertible frame serves only to lift the mattress off the ground. Most futon mattresses are made of layers of cotton batting and low-density foam, which should be no less than 1.5 lb. if you want it to last. Unless you buy a good one, these mattresses are prone to compact and harden.

, Featuring an 8"" standard size mattress, elastic webbing for spring-like support, a click-clack mechanism, storage in the base, and ""knocked down"" for easy transport.

,), but they are generally not as practical for everyday use as those above. Consider this before you order: If you're buying a sofa bed for loved ones, buy a good one so your guests will enjoy their stay. Nothing ruins a visit more than a poor night's sleep.

, Some sofa bed mattresses are fully upholstered, and the last thing you want to do is stain the material by eating and/or drinking in bed.

Use your vacuum’s upholstery attachment.,
Vacuum against the grain.,
Use the crevice attachment for in between the cushions.",How to Clean Suede Couch Cushions2," For suede couches that can’t handle any type of liquid, clean them with your vacuum. It’s best to use your vacuum's upholstery attachment – the brush attached to it will help you work up the nap and get more dirt and debris out of the suede., Beginning at one edge of the cushion, run the vacuum slowly down the cushion, moving against the grain. Overlap your vacuuming paths to ensure you get all of the debris and dirt possible off of your cushions., If your suede cushions are not removable, use your vacuum’s crevice attachment to clean in between the cushions. A lot of dirt and debris can fall into these cracks, so it’s important to clean them."

Scrub the couch cushions gently.,
Rinse with water.",How to Clean Suede Couch Cushions3," If the stain is fresh, use paper towels to soak up any excess liquid. Press lightly on top of the stain, but don't press too hard. This will force the stain further into the suede.

, If your cushions only need a spot clean, you can use white vinegar. Pour a few tablespoons into a small bowl. Don't dilute the vinegar. This is safe for any type of couch, and works especially well on stains created by oil or ink.

, You can use a cotton washcloth or cotton balls to spot clean your cushions. Dip your cleaning material into pure white vinegar, making sure the cloth or cotton balls are damp, but not dripping wet., Scrub the stain gently in a circular motion. This helps keep the nap of your cushions up and ensures you get to the base of the stain., Dip a clean cloth into clear water, again making sure that you dampen, but don't soak, the cloth. If the cloth is too wet, the cushions will take too long to dry and you risk leaving water stains on your cushions.

Clean microfiber with care.",How to Clean Couch Pillows2," Not all materials can be spot-cleaned. The following materials must be professionally dry-cleaned: wool, velvet, silk, and upholstery., If the stain is in an obvious area, consider doing a spot test in an inconspicuous area first. You can do this simply by soaking a cotton ball with water, and lightly dabbing it on the pillow. If the color bleeds, take the pillow to a dry-cleaner. If the color does not bleed, you can spot clean it., Pour some warm water into a bowl, and add a few drops of mild dish soap. Agitate the water until it becomes sudsy, then dip a cloth into the water. Use the dampened cloth to blot up any stains. Blot up any soap residue using a clean cloth dampened with fresh, non-soapy, water. Let the damp area air dry before you put the pillow cover back on.If your pillow is made out of leather, consider using a leather conditioner afterwards. Make sure that you are using a leather conditioner intended for upholstery leather and not saddle leather.

, Brush the entire piece using a soft-bristled brush to loosen dirt. Always go with the grain stead of against. A suede brush would be ideal, but a clean toothbrush or manicure brush might also work. If the stain remains, follow up with any of the following options:Try white vinegar on stains. Dampen the brush with vinegar first, then go over the stain. Don't worry, the smell will go away.
Use suede cleaner on tough stains. Consider doing a spot test first, in case of discoloration.
Sprinkle cornstarch/cornflour over oily stains, wait overnight, then vacuum the next morning. Use a soft-bristled brush to comb out any residue cornflour/cornstarch.
Use water with care. Some stains must be cleaned out with water. Dampen the brush first, then go over the stain--and the rest of the pillow. This will help conceal any potential discoloration.

, Read the care tag on your pillow and try to notice if there is a letter code on it. Choose one of the cleaning methods from the list below, based on the letter code. If the microfiber turns hard after you clean it, simply brush the fabric with a soft-bristled brush, such as a clean suede brush, toothbrush, or manicure brush.If the tag has a W on it, you can use a water-based cleaner, such as soapy water.
If the tag has a S on it, you can use an alcohol-based cleaner, such as rubbing alcohol or vodka.
If the tag has a S-W on it, you can use either water or alcohol based-cleaners.
If the tag has a X on it, you must vacuum the fabric.
If there is no tag, use an alcohol-based cleaner.

Before you stick your pillow into the washer, examine it carefully. Focus on the body of the pillow as well as the seams. If you see any rips or tears, stitch them up using a needle and thread., Placing the pillows vertically will ensure that they won't wrap around the agitator while they are spinning and get tangled.Washing two pillows at once will help balance out the drum inside the washing machine.
Washing the pillows separate from the rest of your laundry will ensure that there is enough water to rinse the soap out properly.
If the pillow is not washable, toss it into dryer with a few tennis balls or dryer balls. The head will kill any odor-causing bacteria., When choosing soap, make sure that it is liquid and low sudsing; powdered detergent will be too difficult to wash out.

If the care label on your pillow has different requirements for water temperature, detergent, and cycle setting, follow what the label says instead., Because pillows are so bulky, a single rinse cycle may not be enough. Many people find that they have to do an additional rinse cycle or two in order to get all of the suds out., The longer they sit, the more likely they will end up smelling musty., Do not twist or wring the pillow. Instead, place it at the end of a large, clean towel. Place another towel right on top, so that the pillow is sandwiched in between. Start rolling the pillow along with the two towels, from one end to the other. Press down on the roll, then unravel it.

Repeat this step for any other pillows you have just washed

, If the pillows are filled with feathers, use the no-heat setting. If the pillows are filled with a synthetic material, such as fiberfill, use a low-heat setting.Consider adding a few dryer balls or tennis balls into the dryer along with the pillows. This will help them dry faster as well as fluff them up.You can also lay pillows flat to dry. They will dry the fastest if they are laid out in the sun.

2 parts 3% hydrogen peroxide and 1 part dishwashing soap.2 parts water, 1 part hydrogen peroxide, and 1 part washing soda.2 cups (475 milliliters) warm water, 2/3 cups(160 milliliters) dishwashing soap, 2/3 cups (160 milliliters) ammonia, and 6 tablespoons baking soda., Make sure that there is enough water to completely submerge the pillow. Also, try to use a detergent intended for hand washing; they tend to be gentler. When adding the detergent, follow instructions on the bottle in regards to amount.If you cannot find a mild ""hand washing"" detergent, use a regular washing machine detergent. Decrease the amount you are using, and put on a pair of rubber gloves. You can also try using dish soap or baby shampoo.

, Depending on how large your pillows are, you may be able to fit more than one in your tub. If your pillows are very dirty to begin with, you might want to wash them one at a time.

, Not only will this force the pillow underwater, but the repeated pressing motion will force the water into it. The soapy water will help flush out any dirt and dust.If your pillow is very dirty, you may need to replace the water. Just remember to add more detergent to any water changes.

, Drain the water first. Once the water is all gone, press down on the pillow to squeeze out any excess water. Don't worry if the water coming out of the pillow is dirty—just make sure that you get it all out.

, If necessary, press down on the pillow so that it fills with water and sinks. You want it to be completely submerged—and stayed submerged. If the pillow won't stay down, place a couple of heavy jars on top of it.

, Keep doing this until the water runs clear. Alternatively, you can empty the tub of all water, and rinse the pillow under running water. A shower with a removable head would be ideal, but the water spout would work for smaller pillows.

, Once the water draining from the pillow is clear, it is time to start drying the pillow. Press down on the pillow in various spots to expel any excess water. Keep doing this until no more water comes out of the pillow.

, Do not try to dry the pillow in the dryer; the heat may cause the pillow to melt. Instead, set the pillow down on a clean towel in the sun, and wait for it to become completely dry.


If you were unable to remove the cover and are concerned about the fabric fading, set the pillow down in a shaded, but well-ventilated, area.

, Once you think the pillow is dry, take a paper towel and press down hard on the pillow. Make sure that you are pressing down hard enough to compress the pillow. Lift the paper towel away, and inspect it. If it feels wet, the pillow needs to dry more. If it feels dry, the pillow is ready to be covered and put back on the couch.

, If your pillow is only dusty, and not heavily stained, you might just have to vacuum it using the upholstery attachment. Try to use a lower suction setting so that you do not damage the foam., If you've washed your pillow and it still smells, sprinkle baking soda liberally over it, and leave it outside in the sun. After a few hours, bring the pillow back inside and vacuum the baking soda up. The baking soda will have absorbed any foul odors.

Be sure to use the upholstery attachment and a lower suction setting on your vacuum cleaner so as not to damage the foam.

Choose a water or oil based stain, depending on your desired finish.,
Get a clean paint brush, sponge, or foam brush.,
Open and stir the stain thoroughly.,
Test your stain in an inconspicuous area to ensure it looks good.,
Wipe the furniture with a damp cloth, then sand with 220 grit paper if using a water-based stain.,
Apply the stain in a thin, even coat.,
Make a final pass over the stain in the direction of the wood grain.,
Wipe the stain off with a clean cloth after it has soaked for your desired time.,
Let the wood dry for 6-8 hours.",How to Stain Furniture2," While there are some hybrid stains, most people buy either water-based or oil-based stains. Water-based stains are non-toxic and easy to clean, but can cause some streaking if you're not careful. Oil-based stains are easier to apply evenly but produce stronger fumes and can be tough to clean.


If the piece of furniture can easily be moved outside, to the garage, or to another easy-to-clean area, go with oil-based stains., You want something absorbent but soft. Foam brushes, especially those with a pointed edge to get in the corners, are your best bet. Clean, soft rags and towels will work as well, though they will be permanently colored by the stain.

, Make sure that is well mixed, following the instructions on the can. Be sure to keep the top as well, as you can close up the stain and save it for another project if there is any left.

, Find a hard-to-see area and apply a little stain in an square. Make sure it doesn't drip, then wipe it off after 4-5 minutes and check the color. Keep an exact measurement of the time you let it sit for. How does this stain work with the wood's natural color?


If you want the finished piece to be darker than this test area, you'll need to leave the stain on longer before wiping it off.
If you want the finished piece to be lighter you'll have to wipe the stain off faster than you did for the test area., As wood absorbs moisture, it slightly expands. By getting the surface damp and then sanding down the small burrs or bumps that rise up, you better prepare the wood for your water-based stain.


While optional, this step can even help with oil-based stains. It will result in a smoother finished surface., Use your rag, sponge, or brush to apply a thin, even layer of stain over the entire piece. Work slowly, only keeping a little stain on the brush at any one time to prevent dripping or pooling. It should be thin enough that the stain isn't running, just sitting on the furniture.

, You can apply the stain any way you want, but your last pass of the brush or rag should be along the direction of the grains. This ensures a beautiful, non-streaky final finish.

, Remember -- the longer you leave it on, the darker the color will be. While you can choose your timing based on your own desires, make sure that it doesn't dry on the wood. If it is starting to dry, wipe it off immediately -- you can also apply a second coat later on if you desire a darker color., Check the stain's instructions to see if you need to wait even longer, though most stains will be dry within half a day or less. Try to place the wood in a well-ventilated area to speed up the process and prevent fumes from collecting.

Apply a second coat of stain after the first has dried for a darker color.,
Finish the furniture after you're done sanding to protect it.,
Use a water-based polyurethane for a safe and easy finish.,
Use a traditional polyurethane for a strong, protective coating.,
Try out a wood lacquer for a gorgeous, soft finish on high-end furniture.,
Apply a penetrating oil, like tung, Danish, or antique oil, for a light and beautiful finish.",How to Stain Furniture3," This second coat generally doesn't need to be left on for long. Simply apply it just like the first coat, wiping off after 2-3 minutes. Let it all dry for another 6-8 hours before moving on.


Do not add this second coat until the first has finished drying.

, Stain is for looks, but it will not protect the wood from moisture, oils, or warping. For that you will need to finish the final piece, protecting both the wood and your stain. You can choose from the following options:


Water-based polyurethane
Polyurethane
Wood lacquer
Finishing oils, Using a clean cloth or foam brush, simply apply a thin, even coat of polyurethane to the wood, then let it dry. Don't worry if it looks milky or white as you apply it -- it will dry clear.


Water-based polyurethane is, by far, the easiest finish to apply, though it is less protective of water or oil than other finishes., Apply 2-3 thin coats, making sure there are no bubbles on each one. Let each coat dry, then sand it with 220 grit paper before applying the next one.


This is the thicker, almost plastic-like clear coating on many tables and desks. If your furniture is going to be prone to nicks, scratches, and scuffs, this is your best bet for protection.

, To apply it, use a paint sprayer and aim for an even coat throughout. A natural-bristle brush can also be used, but you must work quickly, as lacquer dries quickly. Let it dry, using a brush to remove any bubbles or unevenness, then sand with fine-grit (220 or higher) paper. Apply 2-3 more coats, sanding between each one.


Lacquer is harder to apply but worth the effort for expensive pieces.

, Apply a little bit of oil to a clean rag and rub it into the dry, stained wood. Let it soak according to the oil's instructions, then rub it off with a clean rag and apply 1-2 more coats.


If the piece is subject to lots of wear and tear, this is not a very protective coating. You should use something more durable."

You can even save ads/pictures for sofas you like, or start a Pinterest board for the styles you're considering.;
, You're going to get a very different kind of sofa to frame the communal space of a family room with five kids from the one you'd get if you were setting up an intimate reading nook in a personal library. Most people don't want to squish up or sit on the crack between cushions; unless the sofa has a bench cushion, a good rule of thumb is one person per couch cushion. If you have many people to seat, consider a big sectional sofa with lots of options for spreading out or snuggling up.

, If you've got kids, you probably don't want a pristine white couch in a fabric that's difficult to clean. Consider investing in a long-lasting, dark-colored leather option that'll be easy to wipe clean. If, however, you're picking a couch for an office or a formal living room and don't predict anyone spilling on it, you can go with something more delicate without wearing about so much wear and tear.

, A couch is a big investment, and ordering it sight unseen is a big risk. Unless you're particularly sure what you want, try to go to a store in person and ""test"" drive the couch you're interested in. Deciding whether it'll stand the test of time is much easier in person than by just looking at pictures online.


That being said, do also check out some reviews online. If the couch looks great now but is likely to start falling apart in 6 months, the reviews from other customers an clue you in, before you buy.

, This is an obvious one, but give it a whirl to see whether you actually like sitting in it, before you even get into testing the build and potential longevity. Different couches have different softness (see the steps below, on filling and springs), and factors like seat depth and armrest height make a difference, too. The best way to test is just to sit, and see how you feel.

, When you see a couch you like, check the framework. You can ask an associate for help if you need it. If the frame is made of soft wood like pine, it will cost less but it could also warp and wobble. If it is made of plastic or metal, the frame could crack or chip. A kiln-dried hard wood like beech, ash, or oak cost more but are less likely to get damaged. The legs of the couch should be attached to the frame by screws and pegs, not just glue alone. Sometimes the legs are part of the frame, but either way your frame is going to be sturdy.


The frame should be attached by strong materials and not just quick-fix solutions (such as glue, staples, or nails). Wooden dowels, wooden blocks, metal screws, and metal brackets should be the main joints on your sofa. Glue, staples, and nails are okay for extra reinforcement but should not be the main joinery on a good sofa. You should also ask the salesperson for manufacturer information on the joints.

, Polyurethane foam is the most common filler because it is easy maintenance and costs less. Other high-density foams are budget friendly, but down/feather combos are the ultimate choice. Polyester flattens quickly, but costs less than the other fillings. Poly fiber blends cost even less but clump and get lumpy. A great blend is down mixed with HR foam. It is reasonably priced and very comfy.

, Most sofas or couches have springs, but some are just made of webbing or mesh slings. Springs make for a sturdy and comfortable couch. There are two types of springs: sinuous or hand-tied. Sinuous (also called serpentine) springs are cheaper but can easily damage the framework if they are too heavy or sag if they are too light. Hand-tied springs are more expensive but don't sag or damage the framework. Some experts feel that there isn't much of a difference between the two. To test the springs, feel them through the upholstery. They should be tight and close together, but not feel like they are poking through the fabric.

, How a couch looks is one thing, but the strength of the fabric is a whole different story. Cotton and linen upholstery is reasonably priced and easy to clean. Microfiber blends can act like cotton and are stain resistant. Leather looks nice and lasts a long time, but is extremely expensive. Natural blends with polyester can snag and wear out overtime. Silk gives the couch a sleek look but is very hard to care for. Pick out the style and looks you like that will also be durable and worth the price.

, You're not buying a couch for use in isolation, after all. You need to make sure it fits in its intended room, when it comes both to size and to layout. Measure the couch and make sure it'll fit, of course, but also consider the style and vibe of the room. If it's a large, dark unit in an otherwise light room, will it be overwhelming or feel out place? If it's much smaller than what you have now, will it make the room feel empty or leave you lacking seating options?


Try sketching out a floor plan or even moving furniture around to get an idea of how it'll fit; you can mark the size of the couch on the floor with masking tape if you really want to know exactly where it'll go.

, Most couches sell for about $200-$2500, but designer couches can cost $10,000. Budgets are good, but give yourself a 10% cushion in case you see a couch you really like that's over your budget. A good couch is comfy, but not too squishy that you need help getting out of it. The couch should also compliment the space you are going to put it in. You don't want a couch that is the wrong color, shape, or size.

Wash the scratched area.,
Investigate the scratched area.,
Contact a professional, if necessary.",How to Remove a Scratch from a Granite Countertop1," Depending on the state of your counter top, you may only need to clean your counter top with warm water and a mild soap to remove any dirt, grime, or buildup from it. This will allow you the clearest view of the scratch so you can decide whether or not this is a DIY fix or something requiring a professional.


You'll want to remove any buildup has occurred inside the scratch. To do so, you may have to allow your counter top to soak in a mild cleaner before wiping the cleaner away.
Stubborn grime that is firmly lodged in your scratch can be scraped out with a small tool or cleaning implement, like a toothpick or a cotton swab. Use cleaner and your tool to completely cleanse the scratch of buildup.
For especially greasy counter tops, you may have to resort to more extreme measures. You can use acetone on your granite to ensure a good degreasing. Make sure there is good ventilation in the room before applying your acetone to prevent the harmful fumes from building up.;
, The color of your granite can have an impact on the visibility of scratches; scratches in light colors will likely be more apparent than those in darker colors. You may want a ruler or a tape measure on hand so you can more precisely evaluate the size and depth of your scratch.


If the scratch you are dealing with appears to be quite small, apply some water to it. If the water makes your scratch disappear, it's highly likely you can remedy this scratch on your own.
Scratches that are larger than ½ inch (1.25 cm) long and 0.08 inch (2 mm) deep are considered to be serious blemishes in your stone. It's unlikely you will be able to remove these yourself., The dealer or contractor who sold and/or installed your granite counter tops may also do restoration and repair work. You might see if he can assist your in your granite repair or recommend someone who is qualified to do the same.


Deep scratches will need to be ground down with diamond pads until the top layer of the granite with the scratch in it is removed. Then the surface must be repolished evenly. Both of these processes, if done incorrectly, can further damage or even ruin your counter top."

",How to Put Laminate on a Counter Top," For areas where a backsplash is required, a post-formed factory built countertop may be more suitable, but for many applications, a do-it-yourself top will work well, offering you more flexibility and the satisfaction of doing the job yourself. Here are some things you will need to know before beginning:


Decide how large the counter top or work top will be. For example, a work-counter in a craft room may need to be 24–36 inches (61.0–91.4 cm) wide, depending on the size of the materials you will use on it.
Look at the colors and the effect they will have on the surface. Dark wood or stone designs are pretty to look at, but if the lighting in the area you will use them in is not sufficient, a lighter or brighter color may be more suitable.
Look at the exposure the surface can expect. For areas near sinks or where water or other liquids may be spilled, post-formed counter tops will help manage spills since they have an integrated back-splash and slightly raised front edge to decrease run-off from the surface.;
, Plastic laminates come in an almost limitless selection, from solid colors to realistic wood or stone designs, either very smooth and glossy, or embossed and textured to more closely replicate the material they resemble.

, Plywood or MDF (medium density fiberboard) are common materials for a laminate substrate, and each has advantages and disadvantages. Here is a limited comparison:


Plywood has a somewhat higher structural strength, and weighs less than its fiberboard counterpart. It can be purchased in thicknesses ranging from 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) to 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm), and comes in sheets normally sized at 4 foot (1.2 m) by 8 foot (2.4 m), although special order sheets can be longer. Plywood with exterior glue will be somewhat more resistant to moisture, as well.
MDF board is less inclined to warping, since it has no directional grain. Its surface is more dense, so it takes the glue a bit better than plywood, and the glue will not dry quite as quickly. Typically, MDF board is about 25-30% less expensive than a sanded hardwood plywood.

, There are a number of grades and brands available at building supply stores and home improvement retailers, so you can plan to spend some time researching and shopping for the product you will use. Plastic laminate comes in sheets, normally measuring 49 or 60 inches (124.5 or 152.4 cm) by 12 feet (3.7 m), but can be purchased cut to size for your project to minimize waste.

, Many retailers sell laminate with a thermoset glue already applied to the back of the sheet, but if you buy one that does not have this feature, you will have to glue up the laminate yourself. This is the process we will be looking at in this article. You should find two basic choices in adhesives, either a solvent based (very flammable, very fast setting) or water based (non flammable, slower setting) contact cements. Generally, you will need about 1 quart of adhesive for each 4 X 8 sheet or 32 square feet of countertop.

,, You will also want to make sure you have the tools you will need to perform the work.

, If this is going to be a close fit project, you may want to make it slightly larger than you will need so it can be scribed and trimmed to fit. This is especially critical if you are fitting against an abutting wall or between two walls, as they may not be square (at a true 90 degree angle).

, Screw (and glue, if preferred) this strip along the front edge of your top. Make sure the edge is square and perfectly flush, sanding if necessary to perfect the fit.

, Usually, you will allow about 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 inch (0.6 to 1.3 cm) overlap so the material can be trimmed to fit after it is glued, since placing it with contact cement on it does not allow for error.

, You will want to be very careful to keep the plywood and laminate clean after you begin to apply the glue.

,, The glue will cease to be tacky, or wet, to the touch. Carefully lift the laminate and place it on top of the plywood, aligning it as it is placed along the front edge and ends. Once the glued surfaces make contact, repositioning them is almost impossible.

, This will prevent buckles or bubbles from forming. Ideally, when the laminate is pressed down, you will have at least an eighth of an inch of overhang all the way around the top.

, If you are using 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) thick plywood, you will want the edge band to be about 1 5⁄8 inch (4.1 cm) wide, and at least 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) longer than the edge it will fit on. Ideally, you will also want a factory edge to tuck underneath the top laminate at the corner, but if not, you will need to pre-fit the band and trim it so it fits tightly.

,, Be careful, if using a tapered trimmer, not to set the bit so deeply that it scuffs the laminate below the thickness of the surface material.

Remove etching with polishing paste.,
Use fine grade steel wool to buff out your scratch.,
Test the seal of your granite after buffing.,
Reseal your granite counter top, if necessary.",How to Remove a Scratch from a Granite Countertop2," This measure should only be taken if your counter top is already polished. Etching occurs when a substance corrodes your counter, leaving behind a very slight mark on it that often looks like a stain, cup ring, or small blemish.If you can barely feel the scratches in the surface of your counter, a polishing paste may be your best alternative.


Make sure your counter top is completely free of soap or any other cleaning agent you used to clean the scratch. These substances may interact with your polishing paste unfavorably.
Follow the directions on your polishing paste. Different brands will require different procedures for you to achieve best results.
Generally, you should use a small amount of polishing paste to begin with and apply moderate pressure when polishing. In most cases, you'll only need a little of your granite polishing agent to remove etching., Using a coarse grade sandpaper, steel wool, or buffing paper could result in damage to your granite counter top. As a general rule, to protect your granite, you should start with the most moderate grade available. In this case, you should use a dry piece of #0000 steel wool to buff out your scratch(es).Use moderate pressure when buffing and small, circular motions that centralize around your scratch. After several minutes of buffing, if you still notice no change in the appearance of your scratch, you'll have to make use of other measures.
NOTE: more aggressive buffing procedures, using specialty granite sanding tools, can be used to remove your scratch. However, if improperly or inexpertly performed, these methods can result in permanent deformation of your granite.

, Buffing can remove the top coating of your granite, which is also called the seal.You can gauge whether or not your counter top needs to be resealed with a simple drip test. Simply...


Sprinkle a few droplets of water on your counter. These should form water beads along the top of its surface.
Allow the water to sit for 10 to 15 minutes. If the water has spread or left a dark spot on your counter, it's time to reseal your granite., Your local hardware store should have a counter top sealer suitable for your granite. You should always follow the instructions that come with your sealer, but in most cases, to reseal your countertop you should:


Re-clean the area with a mild soap and water. Your hands may have transferred dirt, oil, or grime back to the counter top. Cleaning again will prevent these from being trapped beneath the seal. Allow the counter to fully dry before sealing.
Apply your sealer. In most cases, this will be done with a brush, though your sealer might recommend using a cloth for application.
Most sealers only require about 15 minutes before adhering to the surface of your counter. Then you can wipe any excess sealer away with a dry cloth, and buff the area with small circular motions using a microfiber cloth."

Fill in the scratch with an acrylic repair kit.,
Conceal small scratches with a stone color enhancer.,
Hide your scratch with a permanent marker.",How to Remove a Scratch from a Granite Countertop3," These kits are specifically intended to repair small scratches or pits in your granite by filling the afflicted area with a hard drying clear acrylic patch. For this kind of treatment to be effective, you'll need the scratch to be deep enough for the acrylic to take root.


Scratches that you can feel obviously with your fingers are good candidates for acrylic repair. Very light scratches and etching can best be remedied with a polishing agent or light buffing.
There are many different kinds of acrylic granite repair kit, including gels specifically formulated for counter tops. You'll have to follow the instructions labeled on yours carefully when applying it to the scratch.
In some cases, the application of your acrylic may be as simple as administering it to your scratch, chip, or pit, waiting a designated period of time, and wiping away excess., A color enhancer can brighten the color of your granite to its original hue, but a color enhancer can also hide small scratches that appear over time. This treatment can work especially well for scratches that are invisible when wet.You should follow the directions that came with your color enhancer, but generally you should:


Make sure the area you are about to color enhance is clean and free of any residue. The surface should also be dry unless otherwise indicated by your enhancer.
You may want to test your color enhancer before applying it to a highly visible part of your counter. Use a small amount of enhancer on an out of view spot to make sure the enhanced color is to your liking.
Use a clean rag to administer your color enhancer. Allow the enhancer to sit on your counter top for the time indicated in the instructions - usually about 15 minutes. Then wipe away any remaining enhancer with a clean rag., This works especially well for black granite. Scratches often leave behind a color that is lighter than the surface of your stone, but these can be rendered invisible with a permanent or paint marker matching the color of your counter. All you need to do is...


Color in the scratch with your permanent or paint marker until the scratch is no longer clearly visible. Then wipe the area with a cloth dampened with denatured alcohol to erase any unnecessary color."

Clean stains and spills from your marble countertop immediately.",How to Protect a Marble Countertop1," Using any cleaning substance that contains acid, such as vinegar, will break down the internal compounds of the marble.


Mix together 1 qt. (946.35 milliliters) of warm water and 3 tbsp. (44.36 milliliters) of baking soda in a large bowl.
Place a clean, soft cloth into the mixture and saturate it completely.
Wring the cloth over a sink and use it to wipe down the surfaces of your marble countertop.
Apply slight pressure to the cloth when you are cleaning spots that are difficult to remove. Using a scrubbing pad or an abrasive cleanser may scratch your marble surface permanently.
Let your countertop dry completely for at least 2 hours after cleaning.
Rinse the countertop by spraying it with clean water.
Use a dry, soft cloth to remove the water and any excess residue.;
, If you do not clean up stains and spills right away, the substances may soak completely into your marble.


Use a soft, household sponge and warm water to remove spills and stains.
If the stain is sugar-based, add a few drops of liquid dishwashing detergent to your sponge and scrub it lightly to loosen the sugar elements.
For all other food stains that remain after using the sponge, cover the stain with hydrogen peroxide to loosen the grime. This process will eliminate any remaining elements that can soak into the marble and cause damage.

Make sure your cabinets can handle the weight of the granite.,
Clean counters after each meal.,
Avoid leaving containers directly on the granite countertop.,
Do not stand or sit on your counters.

,
Use a cutting board when preparing food.,
Hot pans, no problem.,
Apply a granite sealant to your countertop if needed.",How to Protect a Granite Countertop," The first step in protecting your granite countertop is making sure the installation is safe and secure. Because of the granite's weight, your lower cabinets need to be of sturdy construction and affixed properly to the wall. Otherwise, the cabinets may partially collapse, leaving the granite to crack as it falls. A licensed contractor can make the assessment of your cabinets' strength if you are unsure.;
, The next important step in preventing discoloration is to clean up spills. This is especially true for liquids with a deep color like red wine on a lighter granite. Lighter granites are more likely to absorb stains.

, Containers such as olive oil bottles are often hard to keep completely dry, acetone from fingernail polish remover can remove your sealant, cosmetics and beauty aids may contain chemical residues on the outside that will react with your counter over time. Leave these types of containers on a shelf or in a cabinet.

,, Cutting directly on the granite will damage your knives. (citation 3)

, One of the benefits of granite countertops is that you can place hot pans directly onto them without causing a burn mark or ""thermal shock."" The worry would come from a sealant that is not rated for high heat.

, Most granite does not need to be sealed. (Citation 1)


To test if your granite requires a sealant you will need water, lemon, and baby oil and a sample of your stone.
Lemon juice can permanently damage stone that contains calcite.
Only use this test on a sample of stone you do not care about.

Shut off the supply lines to the countertop fixtures, if applicable.,
Disconnect the drain line under the sink.,
Pull out the countertop fixtures.,
Separate the countertop from the base cabinets.",How to Remove a Countertop," To safely remove your old countertop, you'll first have to disconnect the water lines to the sink and gas lines to the stovetop. Turn the emergency shut-off valves for each fixture clockwise to the off position. Disconnect the supply lines from the valves using an adjustable wrench.;
, Use your adjustable wrench to loosen the large nuts that hold the J- or U-shaped trap to the sink's main drain line. Hold the trap in place with channel locks. If you have a PVC connection, you should be able to loosen the connection by hand. If you have a garbage disposal, disconnect it from the sink, as well.

, Be careful not to damage a sink or cooktop that you plan to re-install in your new countertop.


Undermount-style sink: If the sink is an undermount type, unfasten the screws holding it to the countertop. The sink should come out easily once it is freed from the counter. Have another person help you pull out the sink, particularly if it's an unwieldy double-bowl configuration.
Drop-in fixture: Use a chisel or putty knife to pry the sink away from the countertop. Chop away at the layer of dried adhesive under the rim of the sink to free it. If the sink is fastened to a tile countertop, chisel away the quarter tiles along the sink's perimeter. Also remove any remaining mortar or adhesive. Get help to lift out the fixture, especially if it's large or heavy ceramic.

, Determine how the countertop is fastened to the base cabinet. Typically, a clamp configuration using threaded fasteners is involved. Small countertops, like bathroom units, may be fastened to the base cabinet using adhesive. Use a pry bar to take off this type of construction.


Formica or laminate countertop: Most countertops are bracketed to the base cabinets. Remove the retaining screws inside the brackets and set them aside. If the counter is attached to the base cabinet with nails or an adhesive, use a pry bar to remove it. Start at a corner and pry the surface, lifting the countertop as you go.
Tile countertop: Remove the tile from the surface. This frees the countertop and also reduces its weight, making it much easier to lift out. First, carefully pry the tile running up the backsplash away from the wall. Remove the rounded, bullnose tile along the front of the countertop. Repeat the process on the tile glued to the countertop, slicing between the mortar and wood underlayment. When the tile is removed, go under the counter and take off the brackets holding the countertop to the base cabinets. Lift the countertop off.
Granite countertop: Most natural-stone countertops are heavy, and therefore, difficult to remove. They are either attached to particle-board underlayment or epoxied directly onto the base cabinets. The base cabinet can easily be damaged during the procedure. It's usually best to have a contractor do this type of removal.

Avoid abrasive cleaning products.",How to Paint Formica Countertops," There are several things you'll need to clean a Formica countertop before painting, because you have to remove grease and sand the surface before you can paint. To clean and prepare the counter, you'll need:


Bucket
Grease-cutting cleanser
Sponge or scrub pad
150-grit sandpaper
Vacuum
Damp rag or cloth
Dry rag or cloth;
, In order to paint your counter properly, you need to completely clear the surface.Remove any appliances, dinnerware, food, storage containers, plants, and decorations that are on the counter and store them elsewhere.


You can store items in cupboards, pantries, on the kitchen table, or in the basement or garage.
Do not store items on the floor around where you'll be working.

, To protect the sink from paint and cleaning products, it’s best to remove the sink from the counter. Start by shutting off the water supply to the sink. Before you remove the sink, you'll also have to remove the faucet.Use a wrench to unscrew the nuts attaching the faucet to the water supply. Remove the pipe, unscrew the nuts holding the faucet in place, and remove the faucet.
Use a screwdriver to remove the long screws attaching the sink to the counter.
Disconnect the sink from the water supply and drain pipes.
Loosen the sink from the counter with a screwdriver if necessary, and remove the sink.
If removing the sink isn't an option, cover the basin and sides of the sink with plastic, and tape the plastic in place.

, With a sponge or scrubbing pad, clean the entire surface of your counter with a grease-fighting cleanser.When you're done, wipe the counter down with a clean, damp rag to remove leftover dirt, grease, and cleanser. Then wipe the counter with a dry rag and let it air dry for 30 minutes. Good grease-fighting cleansers for this job include:


Trisodium phosphate: In a bucket, mix ½ cup (4 ounces) of TSP with ½ gallon (1.9 L) of water
Denatured alcohol
Ammonia-based cleaners, such as oven, all-purpose, and glass and window cleaners

, One problem with painting Formica is that it’s smooth and slippery, so the best way to get paint to adhere is to make the surface rougher. You can do this easily with sandpaper. Use a piece of 150-grit sandpaper or a sanding sponge.Rub the entire surface with the sandpaper or sponge. Apply even pressure with the sandpaper. Don’t forget corners, edges, and crevices.

, Once you’ve gone over the entire counter with sandpaper, vacuum the area to pick up dust and dirt that was left behind by the sanding. Then, wipe the whole surface down with a damp cloth.


Dry the surface with a dry cloth, and then allow the counter to sit for at least 30 minutes to air dry completely.

, To paint the countertop, you will need primer, paint, and a few tools to help you apply the paint and protect surrounding surfaces. The tools you'll need include:


Paint tray
Paint roller
Medium paint brush
Two foam roller brushes
Painter’s tape

, Painting a Formica countertop isn't like painting other surfaces. The main problem is that countertops get a lot of use and endure tons of abuse. Because of this, you need an incredibly durable paint. You can choose any color or style that you like, but look for a durable paint that’s suitable for Formica, such as:


Two-part epoxy paints that are water-basedLaminate paint kits
Interior acrylic paint
Interior oil-based alkyd paints

, To protect nearby surfaces from paint and splatter, tape off anything touching the surface you'll be painting. This could include walls, cabinets, and the backsplash.


Good painting tapes include green tape, blue tape, and masking tape., Before you start priming or painting, open a window and set up a fan to blow air around the room. The fumes from the primer and paint can be dangerous, so keep the room well-ventilated throughout the entire painting project., If you're not using a two-part paint with a built-in primer, it’s important to prime the surface of the counter top before painting. The best kind of primer for your counter is an oil-paint. Try to match the color of the primer with the color you’ve chosen for the countertop.Pour your primer into the paint tray. Fit a roller with a clean roller brush and roll it in the primer. Wipe off excess primer on the tray.
Cover the entire surface of the counter with a thin layer of primer. Use the brush to get into cracks and to manoeuvre  around edges.
Wait about three hours for the paint to dry, then repeat. Check the manufacturer’s instructions on the paint can for precise drying times.

, When the primer has fully dried, you can apply the paint. Pour the paint into a clean paint tray. Fit a roller with a clean, dry roller brush. Dip the brush into the paint and saturate it completely. Roll off excess paint onto the tray.


Go over the entire surface of the counter with a thin layer of paint. Use the brush to paint around edges, in cracks, and in hard-to-reach areas.
Allow the paint to dry, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This is usually about three hours.
Once the first layer is dry, apply a second and third coat if necessary.

, As soon as you’ve painted the final coat, remove the painter’s tape. By removing the tape when the paint is still wet, you'll prevent paint from drying onto the tape and peeling off with the tape.To remove the tape, gently pull it toward yourself at a 45-degree angle.

, Once the paint has dried, after 24 to 72 hours (check the manufacturer's instructions), replace the sink. Fit the sink back into it's basin, reconnect the plumbing, screw the clamp screws back in place, and reconnect the faucet.

, Depending on the type of paint you used for your countertop, curing time could take anywhere from a couple hours to several days or even longer than a week. During this time, it’s important that you don’t put anything heavy on the counter, don’t get it wet, don’t have food near or on it, and avoid disturbing it as much as possible.


If you don’t give the paint time to cure, it could smudge, get dented or marked, or not adhere properly to the surface.
Check the paint can for the manufacturer’s instructions regarding curing time for the paint you used.

, Whenever your cutting or chopping, always use a cutting board to protect the paint and the counter surface. This will prevent scratches, chipping paint, and other dings and marks.


To protect your knives and keep them sharper for longer, use wood cutting boards instead of plastic, bamboo, or glass., Heat mats will protect both the paint and the laminate from damage. Never put a hot pot or item directly on the counter, and always place a trivet or heat mat on the counter first. The same applies in the bathroom, and you should never put hot styling tools directly on the painted counter.


Hot items can burn or melt the paint, leave scorch marks on the laminate, warp the counter, and separate components within the Formica., Use sponges and cloths, and clean the counter with liquid cleaners and soaps when necessary. Avoid scrubbing pads and harsh powder cleansers that could strip the paint from the surface."

Season the wood similar to how a cast iron pan needs to be seasoned.,
Fill in cracks with wax.,
Seal the countertop to protect it from water and other liquids.,
Protect wood countertops from burns by placing a trivet or potholder between the countertop and hot dishes or cooking vessels.

,
Clean off any harmful bacteria.,
Respond appropriately to cracks in wood countertops.,
Protect the wood from warping by controlling the humidity in the air around the countertop.",How to Protect a Wood Countertop," Keep countertops clean to protect them from stains. Stains, buildup and dullness will result on the surface of your wood countertop if it is not cleaned regularly.


Remove any spills and debris before a stain has opportunity to set in by cleaning the area quickly.
Wash the wood with soap and warm water.
Rub lemon juice onto stains. Add abrasion to the surface to increase the cleaning power by sprinkling a little salt on with the lemon juice.
Mix 1 tablespoon hydrogen peroxide into 1 cup warm water. Pour some of the solution onto a stain. Wait a few minutes. Rub the area with a cloth.
Use wood bleach or oxalic acid on the stain. Rinse the area with water to remove any residual chemicals.
Sand wood countertops to restore a fresh surface. First use 120 grit sandpaper to remove the stain. Then switch to 180 grit sandpaper to smooth the surface.
Do not use vinegar to clean a wood countertop unless the wood has been sealed. Vinegar can dissolve the glue that binds the wood together and can leave the wood pithy or splintered because it eats away at the wood's density.;
,


Pour a generous amount of warm mineral oil onto the countertop. Oils help prevent warping and cracking. The wood will only accept the amount of oil it needs, so do not fret about applying too much.
Make sure any oil you use is food-grade. Cooking oils should not be used. They will turn rancid with time and exposure to air, giving off a foul odor.
Use a rag to rub the oil into the wood.
Apply oils with the grain of the wood.
Allow the oil to soak into the wood 20 to 30 minutes.
Wipe the surface with a cloth or paper towel to remove any excess oil.

, The wax fills in any open pores and small cracks or abrasions.


Melt paraffin wax or beeswax in the microwave, and add it to mineral oil at a 1:4 ratio.
Apply this mixture to the wood while the wax is still warm. Spread it over the surface with a cloth.
Allow the surface to cool and dry, and rub the cloth over it again to polish the surface.
Reapply wax once a month to maintain the surface.

, If left standing on the countertop, water can damage the wood. Other liquids and foods can stain the wood.


Apply coats of polyurethane to the countertop surface. A sealed surface makes the countertop easy to clean but is not recommended for cutting surfaces.
Select a urethane that is FDA approved to ensure the substance is safe to be in contact with your food.
Apply at least 3 coats to get a good, solid coating.

,, Wood kills a lot of bacteria so it is naturally a good choice for countertop material. Countertops are made from hard woods that do not allow for bacteria penetration. You should, however, clean your countertop with an all purpose cleaner to remove any surface bacteria.

, On occasion, hairline and a little larger cracks can occur in a wood countertop. These are quite normal and do not mean that you have a defective countertop. You should clean any cracked countertops often and apply a finish over the countertop as soon as possible to seal cracks.

, Some warping is normal for a wood countertop since wood is a material that is responsive to changes in humidity. Under normal and suggested conditions, your wood countertop will not warp to the extent that it will render the countertop unusable.


Keep humidity at a fairly consistent level, avoiding drastic fluctuations, by regulating your heater, air conditioner, humidifier or dehumidifier.

",How to Protect a Marble Countertop2,"


Buy an impregnating sealer product from a retail store that specializes in countertops or home repair, or contact your counter tops manufacturer directly for specific sealant recommendations.

,


If your countertop has a large surface area, you may want to treat small sections once at a time to make the sealing process easier or more efficient.

,,


Refer to the instructions on your sealer's packaging to verify that 3 to 4 minutes is long enough for the sealer to fully penetrate the marble.

, This procedure will allow you to easily collect and gather excess sealer residue during cleanup.

,


Use a dry, clean cloth to remove any sealer that has not soaked into the marble surface.

Apply a wood stain in the color of your choice.,
Apply a polyurethane topcoat.",How to Make a DIY Countertop," Work slowly and carefully to ensure that you do not wreck the cabinetry. The following are essential steps in effectively removing an old countertop:


Disconnect your plumbing. If your countertop is located in a kitchen, bathroom or utility area, you must ensure that you cannot have water leakage. Stop the water from its source.
Loosen the sink and other plumbing. You can use a putty knife and the help of a few friends. Remove these items when they are loosened.
Cut the caulk around the backsplash, if you have it. Use a utility knife to cleanly cut and strip away the caulk holding the backsplash in place. Place a putty knife next to the wall and use a crowbar to pry away the backsplash until it is removed.
Unscrew your countertop from the top, sides or underneath. Again, use a putty knife and crowbar (if necessary) to pry the countertop from the cabinetry. It is a good idea to have a number of people helping you so that you can do it gently and pull it away without dropping the counter or digging into the cabinets.;
, It will be far easier to take the dimensions once it is no longer connected to the cabinets. Take measurements of the width, length and depth before going to the hardware store.

, There are quite a few inexpensive options, but what makes sense for your home may be determined by the availability in your area.


Find reclaimed wood from a construction site or a construction recycling business. An old door will work as well. Find a piece of wood that is larger than your measurements, so that you can cut it down to size. You can also use several pieces and glue them together, as long as they are the same depth. Remember, if there are some imperfections, these can add to the charm of the wood, or it can be re-sanded in the refinishing process.
Find tongue and groove flooring from your local home improvement store. Many of these stores have sales every few months on wood that is overstocked. Buying enough tongue and groove flooring for a counter will be fairly inexpensive. If you choose to do this option, have the clerk calculate how much you will need based on your measurements. Also, you may want to leave your existing countertop in place and glue over the top, or install MDF or a thick plywood countertop in exact measurements before you use the flooring.
Order a piece of wood board from a hardware store. You can have a piece of wood in any type cut to the size you need at most home improvement stores. You will have the most control over what type of wood you want with this option, but it is likely to be more expensive if you choose a rare wood.
Choose a hard wood for this project. Soft wood will mark easily and be less durable over time. Ash, hard maple, cherry, mahogany, oak, walnut and teak are all hardwoods. Oak is the most common material for making furniture. Pine is a soft wood that is commonly used with furniture, but you may want to choose yellow pine over white pine if you are opting to use a softer wood.

, Cut it to size with a circular saw, if this has not already been done at the home improvement store. If you are using tongue and groove flooring, you will need to cut the boards to desired lengths, taking into account how they fit together.


With flooring, 1 of your boards may need to be cut lengthwise in order to achieve your desired counter width. You may choose to use this board at the back of the counter to hide the unfinished cut.

, Finish it with fine-grit sandpaper. This is also not necessary with the tongue and groove option.

, Liquid nails will work well for tongue and groove flooring and gluing together separate pieces of panel. It is important to glue the separate pieces of wood together, rather than gluing the board directly to the cabinets.

, Wipe away excess glue throughout the process with a clean cloth.

, Place heavy objects on top of the wood so that they do not bow while drying. Allow them to dry according to glue bottle directions.


Try to space your clamps out evenly. This will create an even hold in all areas.

, These small nails are usually applied with a hammer, but a nail gun can be used for larger projects. Make sure to space them at regular intervals, approximately 1/8 to 1/4 inch (0.3 to 0.6cm) from the edge of the counter.

, This will also help to affix the stain. Wipe the surface with a tack cloth before staining.

, This is a water-based product sometimes called ""conditioner."" You will want to take extra time when finishing the countertop to ensure it is ready for use.

, You can apply it with a foam brush or a cloth. Repeat another coat once dry to achieve a darker color.

, Use between 2 and 5 coats, allowing it to dry according to the package directions.

, You will want to create a smooth, porous surface on your countertops so you will need to sand off any finish.

, You don’t want to create an uneven surface by getting too rough during the sanding process. Instead lightly smooth the sandpaper over the countertop until you see light scratches and a dull surface.

, Sanding will generate a plethora of dust and debris. You’ll want your countertops clean and debris-free before you apply the new gloss.

, Before you paint you’ll want to keep other areas of the kitchen free from paint splatters. Use heavy plastic sheeting and painter’s tape to cover surrounding areas before you paint. Don’t forget to cover the sink drain to protect it from any chemicals falling into the drain.

, This coat of paint provides a sticky surface for you to add your paint chips and decorative touches.


Apply the paint in a thick coat to ensure you have enough paint to accept the paint chips.
Work quickly as this paint dries very fast--typically within 20 minutes. For best results work with a buddy so one person can roll on the paint over the backsplash while the other person rolls it over the countertops.

, Use the enclosed dispenser to add chips while you cover the surface evenly. This kit comes with a lot of chips so apply them liberally, making sure you cover any stains or areas that contain scratches.


Allow area to dry for 12 to 24 hours before sealing the area.

, Use the enclosed chip scraper to knock down rough chipped edges.

, Apply pressure, but avoid sanding to heavily so you don’t remove all the paint chips. You want the chips to look as though they are part of the countertop.


Although the sanding process will lighten the area, the top coat will darken it back up again.

,, Apply paint liberally to entire surface and re-apply after you make one pass to the area.


Allow area to dry for up to 48 hours (you can remove plastic sheeting after surface is dry to the touch--usually around four to six hours).

Squirt approximately 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of a gentle, non-abrasive dishwashing soap and shake well to mix the two.You should never use an abrasive or acidic cleanser on marble countertops because it may etch the surface. Avoid soaps or cleansers that contain citrus juices, such as lemon, or vinegar.;
, After you’ve mixed the warm water and soap together, apply the cleanser to the countertop. Use a generous amount to ensure that the entire marble surface is treated.If there are areas with more residue than others, you may want to focus more of the cleanser in those spots.

, Once you’ve applied the cleanser to the countertop, wet a clean cloth with warm water. Smooth it over the entire counter to remove the dirt and soapy residue. Continue wiping the countertop with the wet cloth until no residue remains.While it’s okay to scrub at stubborn spots on the marble with the cloth, you should never use an abrasive sponge or pad on the countertop. They can easily scratch the surface.

, When the counter is clean, wipe down the marble with a clean, absorbent towel to dry it. Use a buffing motion to get the most flattering finish for the marble.Be sure that you’re using a soft towel to dry the marble. Rough, scratchy towels may damage the surface.

, The key to keeping your marble countertop stain free is wiping up spills as soon as they happen. The longer wine, oil, or other substances sit on the marble, they greater the chance that they penetrate and cause a permanent stain.It’s particularly important to wipe up acidic stains, such as citrus juices, tomato sauce, or vinegar as quickly as possible. They can etch the surface of the marble and damage its appearance.

, To remove a stain from a marble countertop, it’s best to use a cleanser that can sit on the spot and penetrate it over time. That’s why a poultice with the cleaning ingredients is usually the best option. Choose the poultice ingredients based on the type of stain that you’re dealing with.For organic food stains, mix flour with hydrogen peroxide.
For oil-based stains, mix flour with dishwashing liquid.
For mold, mildew, fungus and other biological stains, mix flour with household bleach.
No matter what type of poultice you’re making, mix the flour and liquid until you form a paste that’s the consistency of peanut butter.
Always test the poultice on an inconspicuous spot on the countertop first to ensure that you won’t wind up making the stain worse.

, After you’ve mixed up the poultice, use a plastic putty knife to carefully spread it over the stained area of the countertop. Next, cut a piece of plastic wrap to cover the poultice and secure it in place with painter’s tape. Once it’s in place, poke a few holes in the plastic for ventilation.If you don’t have a putty knife, you can use any type of knife to spread the poultice on the counter.
Don’t use regular masking tape to secure the plastic over the poultice. It’s too sticky and may dull the marble.

, To lift the stain, the poultice must sit on the stain for a while. For a fresh, light stain, 10 hours may be sufficient. However, it’s best to wait a full 24 hours to be safe.If the stain is old, very dark, or extremely stubborn, you may want to leave the poultice in place for two to three days.

, When you’ve allowed the poultice to sit on the stain for a sufficient amount of time, remove the plastic covering. Use a clean putty knife to carefully scrape away the poultice mixture and discard. Wipe the surface with a clean towel to make sure that the stain has disappeared.If the stain hasn’t disappeared, you can repeat the process with another application of the poultice.

, After you’ve removed the poultice, wet a clean cloth with warm water. Wipe down the marble to remove any remaining residue.Be sure to use a soft cloth to avoid scratching the marble. A microfiber cloth is a good option.

, When the countertop is completely clean, use a clean, soft towel to wipe it dry. Buff the marble gently to ensure an attractive finish., Before sealing your marble countertop, it should be clean. Use the dishwashing soap and water mixture to wash the entire surface, rinse it, and dry it well.Make sure to take all of the items off your countertop so the entire surface is clear.

, If there are any areas of the counter that are coated with residue from cooking grease, cleansers, or other substances, scrape it off before sealing the countertop. Use a plastic scraper or knife to carefully remove it.You can also use a single-edged razor to remove the residue, but be very careful because you can easily cut yourself. Hold it at angle as you move it over the marble.

, With a countertop that’s already been sealed, you should strip off the old sealer before applying a new coat. Wet a clean cloth with acetone and smooth it over the marble. Next, dampen another clean cloth with warm water to remove any residue. Dry the counter with a microfiber towel.Don’t allow the countertop to air dry; wipe it down to dry it.

, When the countertop is clean and dry, read the sealer’s instructions and apply it as directed. Most sealers require pouring the product onto the counter and using a white cloth to spread it evenly across the surface. You usually must also allow the sealer to soak in for a specified amount of time, which is just 3 to 4 minutes.Always apply the sealer exactly as directed to on its packaging. Some sealers may require alternative application methods.

, After you’ve allowed the sealer to soak in for the proper amount of time, you must remove any excess product that hasn’t absorbed. Use a clean dry cloth to wipe it away., Some sealers may require a second coat. Read the instructions to determine if it’s necessary, as well as the proper procedure for applying it.To keep your countertop stain-free, you should reseal the marble every three to six months.

Select the correct Formica or other laminate for your project.,
Lightly sand the surface on which you will install the Formica.,
Measure the length and width of the areas where you will install Formica.,
Place the Formica on a flat, stable surface.,
Mark the measurements on the back of the Formica sheet, adding 1 inch (2.5 cm) to each measurement.,
Apply masking tape along the lines.,
Cut the Formica along straight lines.,
Use a different tool to make curved adjustments (if applicable).",How to Install Formica1," Most places that sell laminate will provide sample chips for you to take home and compare to the house's color scheme. Take several of these home and test for additional properties to help you decide.Also keep in mind that you can purchase formed laminate to fit your counter if you do not wish to do the sawing yourself.


A matte finish will hide wear and tear better than a glossy laminate, which is easily scratched, but may require more cleaning. Laminates come in a whole spectrum from the most glossy to the most matte, so consider each chip by its appearance, and not its marketing.
Test how well the laminate stands up to wear and tear by scratching it with a steak knife.
If you're applying a thin laminate sheet, use 1/16"" (0.16 cm) thick laminate for flat work surfaces and 1/32"" (0.3 cm) sheets for vertical surfaces.;
, Sand the surface to create a rough surface for solid adherence, and wipe away sawdust with a tack cloth or damp rag.If the surface is covered by paint or varnish, you should sand thoroughly to remove it using coarse or medium coarse sandpaper., Use a tape measure to get an accurate measurement of each dimension of the area.


If you are installing a full countertop and your walls are not at perfect right angles, you should scribe the Formica first. See Troubleshooting for more information.

, This should be large enough to keep the Formica steady while cutting. Use scrap plywood or similar material that you don't mind damaging with the saw. Don't use concrete or another surface that will damage the saw blade.

, Draw your cut lines onto the laminate at the increased measurement, which ensures you don't waste a large piece of laminate due to cutting too small a piece.

, This makes it easier to see where to cut, while also reducing the risk of chips. You can also apply additional tape to the surface beneath the formica to protect it, but you shouldn't cut over a surface you want to keep presentable.

, Ideally, you should use a circular saw, saber saw, back saw, table saw, or laminate shears. A handsaw with at least 10 teeth per inch (4 per cm) will also work, but may be tedious for larger jobs.Use a metal straightedge to ensure a straight cut.


If you don't have a saw, use a craft utility knife with a laminate cutting blade to score the laminate sheet, and then snap it on the scoring by lifting the smaller piece until it snaps. Use a straightedge to keep your score straight. Lift carefully and keep an eye on the score to make sure the laminate bends at the desired break point.
Do not use these tools to make circular cuts. Cut out the laminate piece in straight lines, taking care not to cut into the marked area.

, If your installation place is curved, you'll need to use a jigsaw or laminate router to make these finer adjustments. The cutting tool you used earlier will have trouble turning along a curve, resulting in laminate that won't fit.

Mark off the existing countertop's dimensions with strips of wood so the ends overlap and fix the ends in place with hot melt glue to form a template.,
Place the template onto a sheet of melamine, which is plywood with a stick resistant plastic coating, and cut out the outer dimensions of the shape formed by the template.,
Carry the dry form to where your countertop will be and set it in place, removing any doors, drawers and hardware from the cabinet on which it will sit.

,
Mix the concrete according to the manufacturer's specifications, using a mason's hoe to blend the dry ingredients first, then carefully measuring and slowly pouring in the water, mixing as you pour.

,
Pour the concrete mixture into the template form until it is about two-thirds full.

,
Hold a running orbital sander on edge up against the bottom of the template form to shake and level the concrete mixture and eliminate air bubbles.

,
Cut and place steel reinforcing mesh on top of the concrete mixture and repeat the process with the orbital sander to sink the mesh into the mixture.

,
Pour a second layer of concrete mixture into the form until it reaches the rim.

,
Scrape off any excess and smooth the concrete by running the flat edge of a board across the surface while holding the ends of the board firmly to the form's edges.

,
Repeat this process several times until the concrete mixture is smooth and packed firmly into the form.

,
Leave the concrete to dry and cure for one week.,
Sand down any sharp edges with an orbital sander.

,
Etch the surface of the concrete by applying a wash of muriatic acid and water and then thoroughly rinsing the surface with water to remove the acid residue, and allowing the surface to air dry.

,
Mix up a batch of cement, latex additive and any color liquid pigment you desire until it is the consistency of peanut butter.

,
Apply it to the surface with a rubber-faced piece of flat wood.

,
Allow the surface to dry for an hour, then sand it with 180-grit paper and an orbital sander to the smoothness you desire.

,
Apply a small bead of silicone caulk to the top of the cabinet on which the counter sits and replace the doors or drawers and hardware you removed earlier in the process.

,
Finish by sealing your new concrete countertop with any commercial concrete sealing product according to the manufacturer's specifications.

,
Once it's dry, buff the surface with a soft scouring pad such as Scotchbrite.

If you cut them from the laminate yourself, apply the contact cement with a brush or roller to both surfaces. Allow it to set until it feels tacky, according to the manufacturer's directions.


If you are using pre-glued end caps, all you need to do is heat a clothes iron, place the laminate against the edge, and iron back and forth. Let sit for one minute and gently tap it along its length with a rubber mallet or shoe heel. You can now skip to Trim the edge strip.

, When you are sure you have it placed properly, press it to the surface. Once the two surfaces come into contact, the contact cement is already bonded to 50% or more of its final strength.

, Push a dry roller back and forth across the laminate to adhere it completely and to remove air from between the laminate and the surface.

, Use a fine file to remove the excess material, applying pressure only on the up strokes. You may use a laminate trimmer or router instead, but if you do you should lubricate the edge with petroleum jelly (Vaseline) first.This minimizes the chance of breakage.


Use a carbide drill bit when trimming laminate.

, Before continuing, protect your finished edges while you install the remainder of the laminate sheet.

, Allow it to set according to manufacturer's instructions. As a general rule, the contact cement should be left until it becomes tacky and dry to the touch, but no longer.


'Note: If your Formica came with an adhesive already attached, follow the manufacturer's instructions to activate it before installing. Often, these adhesives activate when moistened with water.

, Place lengths of 1/4-inch thick (.64 cm) or larger dowels every 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 cm) apart across the surface to prevent accidental misalignment. These should lay flat across the full width of the surface to hold the laminate up until it is aligned.


When applying laminate to vertical surfaces, you will need to position them by hand.

, Align the laminate as accurately as you can, then continue to adjust it as you move from one end of the surface to the other. Shift the dowels out of the way once you've aligned each section, then press it down to adhere it to the surface.

, Push a roller across the sheet to eliminate air pockets and strengthen the contact bond.

, Use a flush trim carbide drill bit. Stop frequently to allow the router to cool, as the laminate will melt if exposed to high heat., Use a fine wood file to methodically file down the sharp edge of the laminate. File downward at an angle along the entire edge."

Before installing, scribe your countertop to adjust it if it won't fit.,
Install angled edges of Formica using miter bolts and sealant.,
Consider whether to install a laminate backsplash.,
Apply a laminate backsplash the same way you applied your counter.,
Cut holes for appliances.,
Learn how to treat your Formica.,
Remove Formica carefully by prying it off the base.",How to Install Formica3," If your walls are not at right angles, place your countertop against the wall as closely as you can, then use a compass and sander to adjust the shape:Check that the countertop is level using a plumb bob or level. Slide shims or wedges beneath the countertop to make it level if necessary.
Hold the non-pencil end of the compass against the wall at the widest gap, and touch the pencil end against the countertop. Move the compass along the length of the wall to draw a line on your counter.
Clamp the countertop onto a sawhorse or other secure position, then use a sander or block plane to level the countertop up to the pencil line. Your countertop should now fit snugly against the wall.

, For L-shaped countertops, Formica typically comes precut with angles of either 45º or 22.5º. Attach these diagonal pieces together with miter bolts after aligning their front edge. Apply a bead of sealant or laminate caulk to ensure a waterproof corner.


Do not over tighten the miter bolts. Only tighten enough to keep the pieces in place.
Tap down one piece of laminate with a rubber mallet or shoe heel if the surface is not level across the diagonal.

, A backsplash is a vertical section of material above the countertop, which protects the wall from stains and other kitchen accidents.


If your wall is drywall, you'll need to attach a particle board base before adhering the laminate.
You could also consider installing a tile backsplash over your laminate counter.

, Once it's aligned against the wall with contact cement, roll it flat and trim excess or uneven edges with a router., Always follow the appliance manufacturer's instructions to determine safe placement on your countertop. Use a jigsaw to cut out the hole, and file down the sharp edges afterward.


Cover the edges of a rangetop cutout with two layers of heat-conductive aluminum tape to prevent the Formica from melting.

, Avoid placing hot objects onto the Formica or other laminate, as the material can melt. Use a cutting board rather than cutting directly onto it. Clean with a damp cloth and a mild household cleaner.

, Always wear eye protection and ear plugs, as removing Formica is a loud, time consuming process that creates dust and sharp particles. Use the sharp end of a hammer or other prying tool to pull the Formica off the countertop in pieces.Use gloves when handling the sharp, broken Formica.
Be careful not to dent the plywood or particle board base beneath the Formica if you wish to install a new countertop on top of it.

Use butcher block wood.,
Use a stainless steel worktable as an island.,
Use solid surface veneer (SSV).",How to Find Cheap Countertops3," Made with pieces of wood joined together, butcher block offers a variety of economical, kitchen countertop options. Get a custom piece from a cabinet maker or browse standard sizes at home retailers, like Ikea, Menards or Lumber Liquidators. Because butcher block is wood, you can cut it to size yourself or ask the store to do it for you.Do not use butcher block immediately around a sink. Use it on islands and around appliances.
Make sure you oil the wood at least every six months.

, Cheap probably doesn’t come to mind when you think about stainless steel, but a stainless steel worktable is cheaper than a custom built island. Look for one at restaurant supply stores or online.

, You may be able to find solid acrylic countertops cheaper at a discount wholesaler, but it will still be a pricier option. Opt for an eighth of an inch veneer to put on top of unfinished countertops instead. You’ll find many kinds of SSV at your local home store and you can get the look and feel of solid pieces at a fraction of the price."

Be sure to choose a paint that is specifically meant for laminate countertops, since these are often cheaper than other paints and won’t require you to prime.;
, Make sure you buy enough paint for the job. Measure the dimensions of all surface area to be covered. Be sure to buy enough for two coats to ensure the countertop’s original surface doesn’t bleed through once the paint dries.


Search online for “paint calculators,” such as http://www.glidden.com/Tools/PaintCalculator, to get a ballpark figure on how much to buy.

, Refer to your brand of paint's instructions regarding drying times. Expect some brands to take as many as three days for all coats to fully air-dry. Also be aware that the paint’s consistency made be adversely affected by extreme weather. Plan accordingly, with a guaranteed stretch of consistently ideal weather for as long as the paint needs to dry., Line all other surfaces that connect with the countertop (such as walls and cabinets) with painter’s tape where they meet. Remove or cover appliances like sinks and stoves. Use painter’s tape to secure a tarp, dropcloth, sheet, or other protective covering over the floor., Expect paints to be toxic. Minimize the amount of contact that you will have with the paint itself or its fumes. Open windows and/or set up fans to promote better air circulation. Wear protective gear, such as air masks, gloves, foam collars, long sleeves and pants., Use fine sandpaper to smooth the surface. Scrape away any substances that may have dried, congealed, or otherwise stuck to them. Create as smooth a surface as possible for an even finish.

, Expect the paint’s ingredients to separate from each other after sitting on the shelf for so long. Once you open it, stir the contents until the color is even. Then pour some into your paint tray., Use your roller to cover large surface areas. Use brushes to coat smaller and/or harder-to-reach areas, like corners and edges, to avoid making a mess. Have paper towels and water handy so you can quickly clean up any drips on unwanted surfaces before the paint has a chance to dry., Refer to your paint’s direction to find out how long it needs on average to fully air dry. Be aware that environmental factors, like low temperatures or high humidity, may make it take longer. Periodically test it by gently touching it to feel how tacky it is.

This can be done in a matter of hours, but you’ll enjoy the rebirth of your favorite book shelf or end table for years. Best of all, you can strip and repaint a piece as often as you like, which means the possibilities are nearly endless.Sand wooden surfaces to remove the old paint and help the new paint hold better.
Prep your surface with a primer, use two coats for a smooth, even finish and seal the paint with a lacquer when you’re finished to preserve it.Use painter’s tape to layer paint with multiple colors and create dazzling designs.;
, IKEA specializes in sleek, contemporary designs, but what if you want to impart a more quaint, time-worn look to your home or apartment? Put aging furniture through the ringer by distressing it yourself at home. Sand down an unremarkable wood surface, then stain it for a rich antique finish. Adorn ordinary fixtures with rustic materials like burlap, leather and wicker. Suddenly, your home will go from sterile to tastefully rugged.Try wet-sanding painted surfaces to make them look faded.Distressing IKEA furniture the right way can give it that aesthetic of age and coziness that it’s sometimes lacking.

, Inject a little of your own personality into less-than-exhilarating decor. Come up with a list of fun ideas about how to represent yourself through your furnishings. Be on the lookout for unconventional materials you could use to create custom pieces that really make a statement. For instance, those with an interest in nautical imagery could embellish wall hangings with ropes tied into sailor’s knots, or you could resurface your MALM desk with a mosaic of paint spatters if you’re an artist. Have fun and let your creativity take over!Personalizing your IKEA purchases doesn’t have to be an elaborate process. It could be as straightforward as adding a border, sewing on fabric accents or changing out small details like buttons, cushions or trim.

Protect neighboring surfaces.,
Sand and clean your existing countertop.,
Mix your cement.,
Apply your first coat.,
Sand, clean, and repeat.,
Sand, sand, sand.,
Clean up.,
Seal the cement.",How to Update Your Countertops2," Line the edges of any other surfaces (such as walls, cabinets, and backsplashes) with painter’s tape wherever they meet the countertop. Safeguard them against damage when you sand the countertop. Keep them covered so you don’t have to clean any cement off in case you graze them by accident during application.Additionally, consider removing any sinks in order to protect them and to resurface where the sink’s lip covers the countertop.

, Use coarse sandpaper for sanding. Don’t worry about making your countertop smooth, since the cement actually does a better job of sticking to irregular surfaces. Once you’re done, wet a washcloth and wipe the countertop down until it is clean, using additional washcloths as needed. Allow the countertop to air-dry once you are finished., First, read the cement’s directions. Pour the recommended ratio of cement and water into a disposable container. Stir them with a paint stirrer until the mixture is even.Only mix a small amount at a time. Mixing the total amount of cement that you need to complete the project all at once will result in the cement drying before you reach the end of your project. Instead, make small batches of a couple cups’ worth at a time as you go.

, Lather the cement in a thin layer over your countertop. For wide, open areas, use a large drywall trowel to cover the most amount of surface area with less effort. For corners, edges, and any other tight spaces, use putty knives. Once you’re done, give the cement a minimum of 24 hours to dry, and more if needed.Wide putty knives work best for right angles in corners and where the countertop meets the wall. Wipe the needed amount of cement off onto the painter’s tape covering your wall. From there, draw the cement toward you with your putty knife. “Pulling” the cement toward you will create a smoother finish than “pushing” it toward the wall will.
Use smaller putty knives to cover any rounded edges. This may be the most labor-intensive part of the application. Make sure the existing countertop is covered and smooth the cement out as much as possible. If necessary, use more cement than desired and sand off the excess later, once it dries.

, Use medium sandpaper to get rid of any noticeably uneven cement. Vacuum the surface area to remove all dust. Then apply another coat of cement. Wait another 24 hours for the cement to dry, and repeat the process for a third coat.When sanding the first and second coats, don’t worry about making the surface perfectly smooth. Simply concentrate on getting rid of any cement that is obviously higher than the surrounding area.
When applying new coats of cement, keep an eye out for any areas where the previous coat appears to be thinner than the surrounding area. Apply extra cement here.

, Once your final coat has dried, sand your countertop’s new surface down to your desired level of smoothness. This will take some time, so if you are sanding by hand instead of a machine, protect your fingers with a pair of thin work gloves. Start with coarse sandpaper to get the bulk of the word done quicker. Then switch to fine sandpaper for a smoother finish.Be careful if you use a power sander. Depending on how powerful it is, it may do too good of a job and end up stripping more cement than desired off of your countertop.

, Peel your painter’s tape off of all surrounding surfaces. If needed, use your putty knife to chip off any cement that may have sealed it the edge to the countertop. Then vacuum the area to remove all of the dust created by sanding., Pour some water-based sealer into your paint tray. Use a paint roller to apply the sealer over large surface areas. Use a brush to reach tighter areas like corners and edges.Give it a couple of hours to dry.Then apply two more coats, and you’re done!


The liquid sealer is very thin and can easily drip or splash over other surfaces. If you’re worried about making a mess, add a new layer of painter’s tape over connecting surfaces and cover the floor with a tarp, sheet, or newspapers.
When purchasing sealer for kitchen countertops, double-check if the sealer is food-safe. If local stores don’t carry any, consider searching for one that is safe for food online. If not, be sure to keep food from coming into direct contact with the countertop.

Remove any appliances.,
Square any rounded edges.,
Sand the surfaces.,
Trace the tiles’ layout.,
Cut your tiles to fit.,
Apply adhesive.,
Lay your tiles out.,
Grout between the tiles.",How to Update Your Countertops3," Measure the dimensions of your countertop. Be sure to include the dimensions of all surface areas to be tiled, including the edges as well as the countertop’s backsplash if you want to keep it. Bring the dimensions as well as photos of your countertop’s layout to the retailer where you plan to purchase your tile. Ask for their recommendations in choosing which type of tile will work best for your situation.Once you have purchased your tile, arrange it on your existing countertop to see what it will look like in the end. Confirm that this is the design you wish to go with before you begin. If you are having any of your tiles precut at the store to line the edges, make sure their sizes are correct.
If you are looking to create a tiled backsplash on the wall behind the countertop, consider removing the countertop’s backsplash with a reciprocating saw. This will create a continuous effect and simplify the project by creating only one right angle to deal with between the wall and countertop.

, Depending on where your countertop is located, remove any sinks, disposal units, stoves, or other appliances. Give yourself as much access as possible to all sides of the countertop.


When removing appliances like sinks and stoves, be sure to turn off the water and gas before doing anything else. With water lines, allow any water that may still be in the pipes to empty before starting.
Also unscrew the covers of any nearby power outlets if you are doing the walls as well.

, If the edges to your existing countertop are rounded, trim them so they become squared. First, use a ruler and level to trace a cutting line along each rounded edge. Although designs may vary, tracing your line 3.25 inches (8.26 cm) in from the edge should accommodate most countertops. Then cut rounded edge off with a circular saw.To keep yourself from going off the mark, create a makeshift cutting guide by using clamps to lock your level into place along the cutting line.

, Be aware that the adhesive you will be using for your tiles works best with porous surfaces. At the same time, expect your laminate countertop to be made of nonporous materials. So, instead of sanding for smoothness, use 50-grit paper to roughen the texture and create an irregular surface with gaps for the adhesive to settle into for a more secure bond., Arrange whole tiles on the countertop. Start from the edge farthest from the wall and then lay them out toward the wall, column by column. Trace the edges of each tile onto the countertop as you go. Then, at the end of each column, trace a line on the countertop along the edge of the last whole tile that will fit before you reach the wall or backsplash.Since areas around the sink can be the trickiest, start here to get the tough part over and done with. Along each side of the sink, trace a line on the countertop along the edge of the last whole tile that will fit here.
If the layout of your countertop includes any angles other than right angles, do the same thing as you reach each angle.

, For each area where a whole tile won’t fit in the space left at the end of a row or column, place a whole tile over that area. Keep its edge flush along the edge of the counter, sink, or angle, so that it overlaps the last whole tile in that row or column. Place a straightedge over where they meet and trace a cutting line along the tile on top. Then use a wet saw or a tile cutter to cut that tile to size.Once each one is cut, set each tile in its place to make sure it fits.
To avoid wasting materials, it’s better to err on the side of not cutting enough on your first try and then trimming off the excess.

, For tiling, be sure to purchase a latex modified thin-set adhesive. Once your outlines have all been made, remove all loose tiles from the countertop. Then use a trowel to spread a thin layer over the surface area.Keep the layer thin enough for the outlines on your countertop to show through the adhesive, since you will be following these as you lay out your tiles.
One edge of your trowel should be combed. Once you have spread adhesive over the surface area, run the comb over it in one direction to form grooves in the adhesive.
If your countertop was rounded, place ⅛” by 2” shims underneath the tiles that will line the sawed-off edges. Then apply mortar the edge of the countertop to ensure that any uneven gaps are filled. This will keep those tiles firmly in place.

, Follow your outlines to set your tiles back into place. Move slowly and purposefully to better ensure that you set them exactly into place. As you place each one down, gently push it into the adhesive perpendicular to the combed grooves. For instance, if you combed the adhesive from left to right, push the tile in toward the back of the countertop.After you set each tile down, a tile spacer along each side and corner to create an even line for grout between each pair of tiles.
When you reach an area requiring a cut piece of tile, double-check to see if it needs any additional trimming before setting it into place, since the whole tiles may not exactly match your original outline by this time.
In areas where appliances have been removed, be careful that no edge pieces project over the original countertop, which may interfere with reinstallation.
Once you are done, refer to the adhesive’s directions to find out how long it needs to dry before proceeding.

, First, pry the spacers out from between each. Then follow the directions to your grout in order to mix it. Once it’s mixed and ready to go, plug all gaps between tiles by packing the grout in with a hard rubber float. Skim any extra off the top and then use your trowel to smooth the surface. Finally, clean the tiles with a wet sponge by:Wiping each tile in a circular manner, starting from the center of each tile and working your way, to loosen the grout if it has begun to stick.
Soaking the sponge again and then wiping the tiles diagonally, being careful to not disturb the grout drying along their sides.
Repeating as needed until the surface of each tile is perfectly clean.

Get your other belongings in on the act of creating visually-interesting decor.This is an easy and versatile way to liven up your decor that will save you the expense of going out and buying new furniture.

, Experiment with attractive and unusual pairings. Just because a piece was designed as part of a set doesn’t mean it won’t work when placed with mismatched pieces. Look for places where a given item would be consistent with different but complementary items. Taking a hodgepodge approach with simpler pieces can really break up the monotony of uniform designs.Try using the bar stools from the kitchen counter as the new seats for your BJURSTA dining table, or trading out the pillows on the couch for those on the love seat.
Establish a harmony between offbeat colors and materials, like natural wood grains or brightly colored plastics with shiny metallic details.

, Divide your IKEA selections up by style, color and material to put together fresh combinations that tie the room together with a unique theme. The living room could be all warm, vibrant colors, for example, while the bedroom is done in cool, subtle hues. You could also showcase diversity throughout the household by choosing a different material and design style for each set of furniture (i.e. sleek, futuristic kitchen accessories, patterned bathroom fixtures, etc.).By laying out the furniture in your home “showroom style,” each room will have its own distinct character.

Choose from traditional designs or pick one that resembles more expensive materials, like granite and marble.Opt for a textured surface, rather than a flat one, to better conceal any scratches or other wear and tear that may occur over time.Advantages: takes little effort to wash; stands up to abuse (heavy heat, impact, and stains) very well.
Disadvantages: seams allow water to penetrate under the surface and damage the composite wood underneath; surface scratches easily, which is irreparable.

, Give your counters a touch of warmth with this earth-toned surface. Price-compare the different types of wood available to find one that matches your budget. Choose between cherry, maple, teak, walnut, and more.Advantages: enhances rustic-style homes; easily repairable; can be utilized for food prep; resists stains when varnished.
Disadvantages: requires upkeep with regular applications of mineral oil, beeswax, and varnish; easily damaged by heat and moisture; should not be used over a dishwasher or around sinks.

, If budget is no concern, consider this higher-end countertop. Ensure a sense of style with this classic surface that won’t grow out-of-date. Invest in a surface that will match the rest of your kitchen, regardless of its aesthetic.Advantages: takes little effort to wash when sealed; scratches are repairable with polishing.Disadvantages: easy to chip and scratch; requires sealing on a regular basis; susceptible to etching and staining from acidic foods.

, If you want to be more or less done with your countertop once you install it, go with this long-lasting material. Enjoy a countertop that will requires little to no upkeep and stand up to almost any abuse, with one exception. Its Achilles heels are the corners and edges, which are prone to chipping. To minimize this, opt for rounded edges.Advantages: non-porous; waterproof; antibacterial; stain- and scratch-resistant; requires no sealant; easy to clean.
Disadvantages: can be damaged by heat; corners and edges may chip; difficult to repair.

, If quartz is beyond your budget, or if you are frustrated by the its lack of variety in appearance, consider granite instead.

Confirm that you are not removing the patina from an expensive antique.,
Before you begin always read and understand instructions on all labels of the chemicals and solvents you are using and always work in a well-ventilated area.,
Wash vs.,
Strip/Paint Remover: Always use rubber gloves and a mask when using stripper.,
Don’t remove any stripper until you can rub with one finger (without scraping) down to bare wood.,
Removing the Stripper: Periodically peek under the plastic to determine how quickly the stripper is working.,
Wash: When the stripper has softened the finish, scrape off as much as possible, so you can wash down the piece with the appropriate solvent or water.,
Sand/Sandpaper: To remove light scratches, which is all you should do, use fine grit sandpaper.,
Stain: Your best bet is to purchase the leading brand of pigmented wiping stain, which are color fast, direct-to-wood stains formulated to develop and highlight the grain of all wood species.,
Remember to place all used rags in an approved airtight container.,
Finish: Now your piece is ready for the finish.",How to Refinish Antique Furniture," What you don’t want is to take a $1,000 table and refinish into a $100 table.;
, The fumes can cause dizziness or death if not used in a properly ventilated space. Also, your local hardware specialist can serve as a great source of information with this project, its steps, and material needed.

, Strip: Decide whether the old finish should come off or if a thorough cleaning will do. Perhaps a rejuvenating coat of varnish will bring it back to its original luster. If cleaning an unpainted piece, hand cleaner containing pumice used with a toothbrush to get into crevices works well. After cleaning you will know better what you are working with. In many instances you can save a lot of work by just refinishing parts of the piece i.e. the drawer front and top of a table or bureau or maybe just the arms and seat of a chair and then rejuvenating the rest of the piece.

, Use lots of remover and do not brush back and forth. Put on a thick layer of stripper with one stroke. The stripper will form a skin, like pudding. Place plastic trash bags or newspaper on top of the stripper to help keep the stripper from drying out. Always position the piece so you are working on a horizontal surface, this also keeps you from doing too much at one time. Place a piece of masking tape over the backside of any key and knob holes so the stripper doesn’t spatter the back of the drawer.

, If the piece has a carving, plan to leave the stripper on those areas longer.

, You may need to flow on additional stripper if it the finish is thick. When the finish is soft, scrape it off with an expired credit card or a putty knife, but a credit card is less likely to damage the wood.

, It is very important to read the container to determine appropriate washing liquid. Scrub with a stiff brush with course wood chips, hamster bedding from the pet store will work just fine! This will clean and dry the piece around spindles and carvings. If the piece you are stripping is veneered, be careful when using water as to not lift the veneer. When refinishing, it is more desirable to make every effort to bring forth the original surface and not produce a new one.

, As a novice, the finer the sandpaper you use, the longer it will take to make a mistake. 120 C open coat aluminum oxide will do nicely. To remove any stripper residue and set the wood up to accept a finish, 220 open coat aluminum oxide is good. To sand various shapes and moldings on your piece you can use old felt. Shape it and cover it with sandpaper. (Important information on sandpaper: The 120 refers to the grit size. The lower the number, the coarser the paper.)

, They can be cross-mixed to achieve different tones i.e. adding mahogany to walnut for a reddish brown color or ebony to walnut for a deep dark brown. Brush the stain on, leave it for a moment and wipe it dry. Make sure to use rubber gloves and a mask during the staining process as well.

, Do not leave them on the bench all bunched up, as spontaneous combustion may cause them to burst into flames! If you do not have a container, lay the rags out flat to dry, preferably outside. Any rags containing solvents are extremely dangerous.

, To keep it simple the best method is a wipe on finish. There are even wipe on polyurethane finishes for optimal protection. Just put the finish on with a soft cloth keeping it wet until it doesn’t seem to want to absorb any more finish, then wipe it dry. Wait 24 hours and then give the piece a light sanding with 320 sandpaper and apply the finish again. You can do this as many times as you wish, but three or four coats should suffice. Start out with a gloss finish and the last coat should be a semi gloss. Your piece is now ready for that special spot in your home.

Inspect secondhand cribs carefully.,
Check the latest safety guidelines.,
Fix any problems if possible.,
Paint or stain the crib.,
Replace the mattress.,
Avoid crib decorations.",How to Repurpose a Crib1," Your baby’s safety is paramount. Whether you’re using a hand-me-down or used crib, it’s important to make sure the crib is usable. Even seemingly minor things on a crib, such as a faulty latch, may harm your baby. Doing a preliminary search for any obvious problems can help you identify potential issues, recognize if you should keep the crib, and protect your baby from harm.Toss a crib that has visibly broken or defective parts. For example, broken slats, missing parts, or a defective bed spring can cause serious injury to your baby. In addition, toss a crib that that has bars more than 2 3/8 inches apart because they pose a strangulation risk.;
, In order to protect babies, governments issue guidelines for safe cribs. Recognize that hand-me-down and used cribs may not meet the latest safety standards. For example, traditional drop-sides increase the risk of suffocation or strangulation.You can find the latest safety guidelines and updates at https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/Multimedia/?vid=61784 and http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/products-cribs.html.


Check if there are any recalls for the crib. The US Consumer Protection Safety Commission has an online list of recalled cribs at https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls?field_rc_date_value%5Bmin%5D%5Bdate%5D=&field_rc_date_value%5Bmax%5D%5Bdate%5D=&combine=cribs.

, If you do not see any considerable safety hazards, fix any issues with the crib. Make sure to:Replace missing hardware
Tighten loose parts
See if you can get an immobilizer or stabilizer for a drop-side crib from the manufacturerPosition a drop-side crib so you don’t use it

, You may not be sure of the paint source for the crib. Lead paint is common in older cribs. In addition, a hand-me-down may not have non-toxic and/or baby safe paint. Remove any paint and then repaint or stain the crib with non-toxic, Zero VOC, no odor and baby safe paint.Clean any dirt or grime on the crib with a moistened towel. Allow it to dry completely. Sand the entire crib with medium (180#) or fine (220#) grit sandpaper. You can also use a sanding sponge. Remove any sanding dust.
Apply at least two coats of your paint. Wait 4 hours between coats. Add a clear finish topcoat if you like. Allow the paint to dry thoroughly in a well-ventilated area before your baby occupies it.

, Your baby will spend a lot of time in their crib. Old mattresses can harbor allergens, have defects, and/or may not meet current safety guidelines. Replacing any mattress with a brand new one can ensure that your baby gets enough rest and stays safe.Buy the best quality mattress you can afford. Choose from a foam or innerspring mattress that is firm. A firm mattress will have little to no indentation when you press into it. A soft mattress can increase the risk for suffocation or SIDS if it conforms to your baby’s head.
Make sure the mattress fits snugly into each corner of the crib. There shouldn’t be any gaps between the sides of the crib and the mattress. You can check this by seeing how many fingers fit in the gap. If it is more than 2, the gap is too large., Your baby only needs a sheet on the mattress to sleep. Items such as blankets, bumpers, and pillows can strangle or suffocate a baby. You should also keep toys, including stuffed animals, out of the crib. Hang any mobiles high enough above the crib that your baby can’t reach it. Remove any mobiles if your baby can push up on their hands and knees."

If the piece of veneered furniture has been stored in a damp place for a few years, chances are you can skip the loosening step and move straight on to scraping the veneer off.;
,, Squeeze it out so that it is damp and not dripping.

, Take extra care to ensure that the towel is not sitting directly on any pieces of finished wood that you want to leave intact. The water can damage the finish.


Any water damage to the wood just under the veneer can be removed during the sanding process.

, Re-moisten the towel if it won’t stay damp for that long. If the veneer doesn’t have any cracks, you may need to keep the towel on the surface for three hours., Look for curling and gaps in the surface. The glue under the veneer should start to dissolve with prolonged water exposure.

, Put on your safety gloves and glasses.

, Keep the putty knife as flat as possible to avoid damaging the wood underneath. Try to scrape with the grain of the wood underneath.

,, Damaged veneer can come up in sheets.

, Flip your chisel over if you are using one. Work at the glued portion from the side, approximately 45 degrees off of the wood grain.


Use short, flat strokes and gentle pressure to lift the glued portion.

, Purchase an old iron that you can use for only home improvement projects. Wet an old towel and place it on the stubborn veneer.


The towel should be fairly damp, but not dripping.
Place the heated iron on top of the damp towel. Let it sit for one to two minutes. The steam should help loosen the glue on the veneer.
Be very careful that you don’t touch the iron or place your hands near the steam during this process. It is extremely hot.
Keep the iron and towel away from finished pieces of wood.,,, Plug it in and put on your safety glasses and ventilation mask.

, Brush off the dust.

",How to Refinish a Coffee Table," Because you will be sanding the coffee table and creating a lot of dust, it is best to work outdoors or in a garage. If this is not an option, choose a room that is well-ventilated and will not be needed for use during the refinishing project. Lay down a plastic drop cloth to cover the floor of the room and collect the sanding dust. Make sure the room is not really in use by anyone else during this time period.;
, Your coffee table may be covered in paint, a clear sealer, or a stain and a clear sealer. Any type of finish can be sanded away to expose the raw wood underneath. If you hope to re-stain the wood or use a clear finish, you'll need to sand the finish away completely. If you want to paint the coffee table instead, you can leave some splotches of the previous stain.


For the fastest results on the coffee table's surface, use an electric sander. Fitting the sander with coarse-grit sandpaper will help you cut through existing layers of paint or varnish quickly.
For sanding along legs, molding, or other intricate or tough-to-reach places, use a sanding sponge. For very hard-to-reach areas, you can wrap a piece of sandpaper around your finger.

, When you are finished sanding, use a vacuum with a hose attachment to remove as much sanding dust as possible from the coffee table. To ensure the removal of all sanding dust, moisten a rag with some mineral spirits and rub it across the coffee table.

, If there are scratches in the wood that were too deep to be removed through the sanding, you should fill them in before refinishing the coffee table. Small scratches can be filled in by rubbing them with the meat of a walnut or pecan. Larger scratches can be filled in with wood putty.

, Wood stains are available in a wide range of shades for darkening your furniture. Apply the stain according to the manufacturer's directions; an inexpensive foam brush is usually adequate for the task. Make sure that you wipe away all excess stain after allowing it to penetrate the wood. Allowing stain to dry into the wood will create an uneven appearance.

, Whether or not you stained the coffee table, you'll need to apply a coat of clear sealer to improve its appearance and protect the wood. The best option for achieving the durability needed in a coffee table is polyurethane, which can be applied using inexpensive foam brushes.

Reapply your finish.",How to Refinish a Desk," Before taking any action to refinish a desk, you need know the original finish of the desk. This is important, as there are some finishes and types of wood that you may not be able to refinish.


Veneer cannot be refinished. To fix a veneered desk, you’ll have to remove the veneer and apply new veneer. However, depending on the wood below the veneer, you may be able to remove the veneer and rehabilitate the wood.
Laminate desks cannot be refinished.
Particle board desks cannot be refinished. They are best painted.;
, Once you’ve verified that your desk can be refinished, you need to remove all the hardware from it. Unscrew knobs, handles, hinges, and any other hardware. If you leave any hardware on, you won’t be able to properly refinish the desk.


Put your hardware (screws and all) in plastic baggies so they don't get lost. If you have a lot of hardware, put them in separate baggies and label them so you know exactly where to put them when you reassemble the desk.

, Chemical strippers will help remove varnish, stain, or paint and make the sanding process a whole lot easier. When applying the stripper, do one section at a time (avoid stripping the whole desk). Use a liberal amount of stripper and don’t mess with it after application.


Allow the stripper to sit for as long as the directions on the product indicate.
Use a stripper that you can wash away with water.
Open windows, doors, and turn on the air conditioning if you're doing this inside., After you’ve let the stripper do its job, take a putty knife and gently remove the stripper, varnish, stain, or paint. To do this, gently scrape the surface of the desk in a systematic fashion. Remove as much as you can.


Don’t apply too much pressure – you could gouge the wood., Scrub the entire surface of the desk. Pay attention to hard-to-reach areas. Don’t apply too much pressure – you could damage the wood.


If you find that varnish, stain, or paint remains, you may need to apply stripper to the wood again., Depending on the specific stripper you used, its directions may suggest you use another chemical agent to remove any residual stripper. Follow the directions and apply the chemical agent over the entire surface of the desk.


Some products simply require that the wood be wiped down with a damp cloth., After you‘ve completed the process of removing stain, varnish, or paint, allow the desk to sit overnight and dry. Without allowing it to dry, you won’t be able to move on to the next step in refinishing your desk.

, Purchase a 120-grit piece of sand paper and rub down the entire surface of the desk. Sand until the entire surface is smooth and you can see the grain. After it is smooth, use a 220-grit piece of paper and sand the desk again.Always sand with the grain of the wood.
Pay attention to corners and hard-to-reach areas of the desk.
Sand any rotten or broken spots off until you reach smooth, healthy, wood.

, Use wood filler or epoxy to replace any pieces of the desk that have broken or rotted off. Use a putty knife to apply filler to the area in question. Shape it with the knife, toothpicks, or any other tool that might come in handy. Allow the area to dry before moving on., If your desk is made of a wood that has an open grain structure – like oak and mahogany – you may have to fill the grain to make the piece completely smooth. To apply the filler, take a rag, dab some filler on it, and rub it into the open grain of the wood. After application, remove any extra filler with a putty knife or another flat object.


Let the grain filler dry completely before moving on.
If you want to emphasize the grain of the wood, choose a filler that contrasts with its main color. If you want to obscure the grain, pick a color that is similar to the color of the wood., With a paint brush, apply a liberal amount of sanding sealer to the entire surface of the desk. Let it soak in, and then remove any remaining sealer with a cloth. Let the sealer dry before you continue., After applying the sanding sealer, take a 220-grit piece of sandpaper and sand the wood again. This will sand off any wood fibers that protrude from the surface of the desk and any sealer that remains.

, Use enough so the stain can soak in and penetrate the surface. Remember, the more stain you use, the darker your wood will appear. After application, wipe off remaining stain with another cloth. Then, allow it to sit.


If you want your desk to appear darker, apply more stain.
Depending on the wood, you may need to sand the desk again. This is because the staining process may force wood fibers upward and create a rougher surface., You can choose between different types of polyurethane, lacquer, or oil finishing products. To apply most finishing products, like polyurethane, stir or shake the product well, then apply it with a brush or clean cloth.


When using polyurethane, stir the product very well and to allow time for bubbles to dissipate before applying it.
If you choose to use polyurethane, don't use too much. Only apply a little at a time, otherwise you could cause a running or wrinkling effect.
While you can apply lacquer with a clean cloth, you may want to consider spraying it on., Some finishes, like polyurethane, need to be reapplied several times. To apply polyurethane correctly, sand between every coat. Use a 200-grit paper to sand between your polyurethane coats. Reapply polyurethane between two and three times."

Select the right piece.,
Make a refinishing plan.,
Buy refinishing supplies.,
Remove the furniture's hardware.",How to Refinish Furniture1," Not all furniture is a good candidate for refinishing. Valuable antiques, for instance, should be refinished by a professional, since the refinishing process could devalue the piece if you aren't careful. To choose a piece to refinish, look for these qualities:


Furniture made from sturdy wood. Furniture made with fine wood that could be easily damaged, particle board, or other non-sturdy wood won't do well during the refinishing process.
Furniture without too many coats of paint. Taking off layer after layer of paint may not be worth the time it takes.
Furniture with smooth, flat faces. If this is your first time, avoid furniture with intricate carvings or turned legs.;
, Take a look at the furniture you have chosen to refinish and craft a plan for turning it into the perfect piece for your dining room, front porch or kitchen. You'll need to consider the following questions:


What will it take to refinish the piece? If it's painted, you need paint stripper; if it has an old varnish or finish, you need a thinner finish stripper.
How do you want your new piece to look? Will it be painted a new color, or do you want the natural wood to be exposed? You may not know the answer to this question until you see what the wood looks like underneath the old paint or finish.
Consider going to furniture stores, browsing online, and talking to experts for ideas on how to create the look you want.

, Now that you have a plan, you'll need the following supplies to get the job done:


Protective equipment. You'll need a ventilator (especially if you're working indoors), goggles, chemical-resistant gloves and an apron. To protect your floor or yard, get a chemical-resistant drop cloth as well.
Paint stripper and/or finish stripper. If the furniture has paint, you need thick paint stripper to remove it. Otherwise, you just need a thinner finish stripper.
Brushes for applying the stripper and scraping tools for removing it.
100 grit sandpaper and/or a power sanding machine, plus a finishing sander.
Wood stain in the color of your choice.
A protective polyurethane topcoat to seal the stain.

, Take off the knobs, pulls, hinges, and other metal hardware to prepare the furniture to be refinished. These items could be ruined by the chemicals used to strip the furniture.


Place the hardware in labeled bags so you remember where everything goes when it's time to place it back on the furniture.
Plan to polish the hardware so that it matches your newly refinished piece. Alternatively, you could buy new hardware to spruce up your furniture.

Set up a work area.,
Apply the paint stripper.,
Scrub away the paint.,
Strip the old finish.,
Sand the piece.",How to Refinish Furniture2," Paint and finish stripping chemicals are highly toxic, so it's essential to set up a well-ventilated work area. Choose your garage, a work shed, or a spot outdoors.


Avoid setting up your work area in one of the main rooms of your house. Basements are not well-ventilated enough, either.
Unfold the drop cloth over a large surface area and lay out the paint stripper, brushes for applying the stripper, and the scraping tools you need to remove it.
Put on your ventilator (if indoors), gloves, apron and goggles.

, Dip the brush into the paint stripper and begin applying it to the furniture. If the piece you are refinishing is large, plan to strip the paint in sections, rather than all at once. The stripper bonds with the paint as you apply it, separating it from the wood.

, Use the steel wool and other scraping tools to scrape off the paint with the stripper. It should come off in large sheets.


Give the same amount of care to each part of the furniture. The stripping process affects the look of the wood underneath, so you want to make sure each part gets the same treatment to avoid an uneven finish.
If the furniture has multiple coats of paint, you may need to repeat the paint-stripping process more than once.

, Once the paint is gone, the finish underneath also needs to be removed. Use a paintbrush to apply the thinner finish-stripping solution, then sand it away using a clean piece of steel wool. All the furniture to dry completely.


Now that the wood has been revealed, be sure to scrub along the grain, rather than against it, so the wood doesn't get damaged.
If most of the old finish seems to have come off with the paint stripper, you still need to give the furniture a stripper rinse to make sure all traces of the old finish are gone. Rinse the furniture with denatured alcohol or mineral spirits, then let it dry.

, Use a sanding machine or 100-grit sandpaper to thoroughly sand the furniture. Work in even strokes and spend the same amount of time on each part of the furniture to ensure an even finish. Use a finishing sander to go over the surface again and create a completely smooth surface. Wipe the piece with a cloth to remove the dust, and your piece is now ready for its new finish.

Stain the furniture.,
Apply the topcoat.,
Sand the furniture.,
Replace the hardware.",How to Refinish Furniture3," Use a brush to apply an even coat of the wood stain you have chosen. Avoid overlapping brush strokes, since each brush of stain creates a darker hue.


You may want to test the stain on the underside of the furniture to practice using the right stroke and pressure to create the color you want.
Work with the grain so that stain doesn't build up in the crevices and make them look darker than the rest of the furniture.
Follow the directions for wiping off the stain with a soft cloth once it has soaked into the wood for a certain amount of time. Letting the stain stay on the wood for more time will create a darker stain.

, Use a brush to apply your chosen topcoat to the furniture, taking care to spread it evenly. When you're finished, let it dry completely.


Use an old cloth or t-shirt free of lint to further spread the topcoat and rub it evenly into the furniture.
Make sure you apply a very thin coat; a thicker coat could look murky, rather than shiny.

, Use a fine-grit sandpaper to sand the furniture evenly after the topcoat has dried. Spend the same amount of time sanding each section with the grain, so that all parts of the furniture look even. If desired, add another layer of topcoat, let it dry, and sand again. Repeat until your furniture's finish looks complete.

, Screw the knobs, hinges, pulls and other hardware back onto the completely dry and finished piece of furniture.

, Use a spackling knife to press either spackling compound or wood putty into any imperfections you wish to paint over, then allow the product to dry according to the manufacturer's instructions.

, Before you paint varnished cupboards, you must remove the high-gloss finish. You may do this either of 2 ways:


Take an orbital sander to cabinet surfaces you plan on painting, and sand them down until they are no longer shiny. Wipe the dust off with tack cloth.
Clean the cabinet surfaces with TSP (or a TSP substitute) � a heavy-duty cleaner that can be found in any home improvement store, which removes thick layers of grease, dirt and grime. Repeat the TSP cleaning process until the cabinet finish is dull, then wipe the surfaces down with water to remove any remaining traces of TSP.

, Before painting cabinets, you need to prime them to ensure the paint sticks.


Use any stain blocking and sealing primer that you purchase from a home improvement store.
Choose a color as close to your paint color as possible.
Apply the primer with a roller on long, wide surfaces, and with a brush for the areas that can't be covered with a roller.
Allow the primer to dry according to manufacturer's instructions.
Paint a second coat before painting cabinets if the first primer coat didn't fully cover the cabinet surfaces.

It ensures that the hardware is paint-free when you reattach it, and that the entire piece will be adequately covered with paint if you decide that you want use different hardware.

, Apply most of the wood filler to the damaged part of the wood, not to the undamaged wood, although there can be some overlap (and you'll be able to sand it down later). Use the putty knife to scrape away excess wood filler and allow it to dry.









If you're going to replacing any hardware on your furniture, fill in the old holes where the previous hardware was attached. Scape flush to the board with a putty knife and let dry.

, This can be managed by using a piece of sandpaper with a sandpaper block, or by using a hand sander for larger pieces. The goal is to remove any protective varnish or lacquer that is on the surface of the wood, making it easier for the primer coat to adhere.









Pay close attention to any scroll work or other indentations in the wood, making sure to sand those by hand as thoroughly as possible.
Pay special attention to the areas where wood filler was applied. Sand enough so that the filled portions are flush with the rest of the furniture.

, Wiping gently with a clean tack cloth will help remove the residue and leave the clean surface. If necessary, use a mild detergent and wipe the wood surface dry with the cloth.

Prime if you want an even look on your furniture.,
Sand the primed surface after it has dried.,
Paint the wooden furniture, first with a roller and later with a brush.,
Apply a second coat of paint, if necessary.,
Seal the paint job on the wooden furniture (optional).,
Finished.








",How to Paint Wooden Furniture2," Using a paintbrush and a roller, gently brush an even coat of the primer on the surface of the wood. Use a paintbrush along corners, edges, and harder-to-reach areas; use the roller to hit wide-spaced, even areas that aren't contoured. Allow the primer to dry before moving on to painting the furniture piece.









Do you really need to use a primer? If you want your coat of paint to adhere evenly to the wood, and you want the paint to last long, you're going to want to add a primer before you paint. Don't worry about getting even coverage with the primer; as long as it coats what you're going to paint, you're good to go.
If you're going for more of a weathered, distressed look on your furniture, you may want to skip the primer. Note that the paint may eventually chip if no primer has been set down before painting.
Prime often-used surfaces extra thick for added coverage. If you're painting a tabletop or a desktop, you may want to lather on a couple layers — or one thick layer — to give added protection and sheen to often-used parts of your furniture.

, Go over every area of primed surface with a fine-grit sandpaper. This will help your paint bond to the primer even better than it already does. Be sure, however, to wipe away any sawdust or residue with a tack cloth before you hit the surface with paint.








, Go over even surfaces of the furniture with a foam roller, if possible. Then, using even strokes, redo the area with a paintbrush, paying special attention to the places where rollers cannot apply paint — such as edges and corners. Allow the coat to dry, and inspect the piece for any areas that are not completely covered by the paint.









Consider using a paint conditioner to make your job easier. A paint conditioner, such as Floetrol for latex paints and Penetrol for oil paints, will slow down the drying edge of the paint, allowing you to get a more even look on your paint. (Paint that dries too quickly can look patchy or uneven.) Paint conditioners, although added to your paint, won't change the color.
Get a good quality paintbrush for the job. Poor-quality brushes will result in inferior looking projects; bristles will come loose and get stuck in the paint, or the coverage just won't look uniform. A good paintbrush is slightly more expensive, but with proper care, should prove you wise by lasting for several years.

, Most painters will find that a coat of primer and paint won't give the furniture that professional look that they're seeking. Wait for the first coat of paint to dry (overnight is best, but at least 6 hours), and then hit it with another coat of the same paint, using the methods described above.








, Once the paint is dry, apply a lacquer or sealant to protect the paint from nicks and scratches. This will also add a slight gloss to the piece, a feature that works well in many decorating schemes. Make sure the sealant is dry before moving the piece into the area of the home where it will be used.

If you cannot paint outside or in a well-ventilated area, make sure to keep a window open. If possible, keep a fan turned on, and turned away from you, so that it does not blow paint fumes or dust towards you.
If you start start to feel sick or lightheaded, take a break and move to an area with fresher air.;
, Painting can be messy, so you will have to cover your work area with something that can get dirty or be discarded, such as newspaper. If you do not have newspaper, you can use newsprint, butcher paper, old tablecloths, or old bed sheets instead. You can also purchase cheap, plastic tablecloths from a party supply store or an arts and crafts store and use those.

, Some paint may also get on your clothes, so wear something that you do not mind getting stained with paint. You can also wear an artist's smock.


If you have sensitive skin, consider wearing gloves to protect your hands in case you get paint on them. You can also protect a manicure with gloves.

, What primer and paint you will use on your furniture will depend on what the piece is made of. Choose an indoor primer and paint intended for the surface, be it wood, metal, or plastic. If your furniture has already been painted, consider choosing a primer intended for pre-painted surfaces. The label will tell you whether or not the primer and paint will work on the material your furniture is made of.

, You can use latex, acrylic, or oil-based paint. You can also use wood stains or spray paint as well. Each of these has pros and cons:


Latex, acrylic, and oil-based paints have little to no fumes and can be used indoors. Unfortunately, improper painting techniques can result in visible brush strokes and tackiness. Brushes used for oil-based paints will need to be cleaned with paint thinner, which can create headache-causing fumes.
Wood stain gives you more of a translucent look, but it also gives you a smooth finish. It is oil-based however, and you will need to clean your brushes with paint thinner.Spray paint is fast and easy to use, but it can also be expensive. It creates a smooth finish, and you will not have to clean any brushes afterwards. You will have to work in a well-ventilated area to prevent lightheadedness, however.

, Paint comes in all sorts of finishes, with its own benefits and drawbacks:


Glossy finishes look elegant, but they show any imperfections in the paint and wood, such as brush strokes and dents. Glossy finishes can also be easily marred.
Satin or semi-gloss finishes are decent at hiding imperfections, and are easier to maintain than glossy surfaces.
Matte surfaces hide imperfections the best, but they can look simplistic.
A chalkboard finish gives you a matte surface that hides imperfections well. It can create a fun, interactive surface that you can draw on with chalk. It also does not need to be sealed afterward.

, Before you start painting your furniture black, ask yourself what you want the finished piece to look like. To you want it to be completely black? Or do you want to add some designs to it? Alternatively, do you want the piece to be a solid color with black designs painted onto it? Asking yourself these questions will help you decide how much paint you will need as well as what other supplies you will need to get (such as thin paint brushes for detailing or stencils). For example:


For a weathered or antique look, paint your furniture a matte or semi-matte black, and then buff the corners with fine grit sandpaper. Keep in mind that anything underneath the paint will show through, depending on how much you sand. This includes primer, previous paint jobs, and the original surface of the furniture.
Consider stenciling some designs onto your finished piece in a contrasting color, such as white, silver, or gold.
Consider painting the entire piece a contrasting color first, and then adding black designs using stencils.

, If your furniture has removable pieces, such as drawers and doors, take these off and set them aside. If your furniture has any pieces that you do not want painted, such as hinges, knobs, and pulls, remove them and set them aside; if you cannot remove them, then cover them with painters tape.

, Imperfections show up on black surfaces, and even more so if that surface is glossy. If your furniture has any dents or holes, fill these in with some wood filler or putty., Before you can start priming and painting your furniture, you need to sand your piece. This gives the primer a rough surface to grip on to. Take some fine grit sand paper (between 180 and 220 grit) and lightly buff the entire surface of your piece.You do not have to strip the entire previous paint job; you simply need to create a rough texture.


If your furniture has a varnish on it, then use 80 grit sandpaper., You need to remove any dust created from when you sanded your furniture. Do this by wiping the entire surface of your furniture with a tack cloth.

, Grey primer helps make shadows more visible, which will help you find and fix any imperfections. You can either paint or spray on the primer. To prevent drips and puddles, apply several light coats of primer (while letting the primer dry between coats) as opposed to one thick coat.


Be sure to choose a primer intended for the material your furniture is made out of.

, Once the primer has dried, run 220 grit sandpaper over any imperfections in the primer, such as paint drips, bubbles, and globs.After that, wipe the piece down again with tack cloth.


If necessary, apply more primer and repeat the process. Remember, imperfections show up more on black surfaces, so your primed surface needs to be as smooth as possible.

, Before you start painting, let your primer dry at least 24 hours. Refer to the directions on the can, as some primers might require more time.

, Paint and wood stains can be applied to furniture in many ways: paint brushes, foam applicators, and foam rollers. You will need a foam roller or a large, angled brush (at least 1 inch wide) for the large, flat areas of your piece. You will also need a small brush to reach details such as carvings, crevices, and corners.


Consider using higher-quality brushes or foam rollers for best results. Avoid cheap brushes with stiff bristles if you can, as these are more likely to create brushstrokes. Remember, details and imperfections show up more in black paint, especially if it has a glossy finish.
You can also purchase spray paint and spray the paint on using light, even coats. Keep the can 6 to 8 inches away from the piece.

, If you have decided to use paint or wood stain, you will need to condition your paintbrush before using it. If you are using latex or acrylic paint, then dip your brush in water; if you are using a wood stain or oil-based paint, then dip your brush in paint thinner., Brushing or spraying the paint on in many, thin layers as opposed to one thick layer will give you a smoother finish and help reduce brush strokes.If you are applying one thick layer of paint, then wait at least 24 hours before applying a another coat.If you see brush strokes, you can smooth them out by going over them lightly with a foam roller. Keep rolling over the brush strokes while the paint is still wet until the surface is smooth., Use long strokes when applying paint to large, flat areas. If your furniture is made of wood, then apply the paint with the grain, not against it. Paint the corners and details last.

, Sometimes, the paint will puddle or drip, no matter how careful you are. Other times, bits of dust may fall onto your piece and stick to the paint. If happens, take a fine grit sandpaper, such as 220 grit, and buff the surface. Then, wipe the piece down with a clean tack cloth, and apply one or two more coats of paint.

, Some paint or stains come with a sealer already in them. Others will need to be sealed for additional protection. Look for a polycrylic or polyurethane sealer in either brush on or spray on form.


You can also consider using a wax sealer, but keep in mind that the finish will not be as durable.
If you are using chalkboard paint, do not use a sealer, as it will ruin the surface and prevent it from functioning.
After you have applied the sealer, sure that you give the sealer enough time to cure before you use the furniture. This can take anywhere between 24 hours to 1 week.

, Once the paint and sealer has dried, put your furniture back together. Remove any taped-off areas, screw on the knobs, pulls and hinges, and reinsert the drawers and doors.

Clean the furniture.,
Protect other surfaces.,
Sand the furniture’s surface.",How to Paint Plastic Furniture1," Fill a bucket with hot water. Add an ammonia-based cleaner to help remove mold or mildew on older furniture. Use a sponge to wash the entire surface of the piece you’ll be painting. Spray the furniture with a hose. Use a pressurized nozzle attachment if you have one. Make sure to spray every surface of the furniture from multiple angles to ensure a complete rinse.








To clean brand new plastic, wipe down with a cloth soaked in paint thinner.
An all-purpose cleaner, such as dish soap, will work if the furniture is not too dirty.
Dry the furniture with a cotton towel and allow it to air dry completely. Ensure the furniture is completely dry before proceeding.;
, Choose an area with good ventilation to paint your furniture. A garage with the door open or a flat surface outdoors are ideal. Cover the surface of the ground with a material you don’t mind dropping paint on, such as newspaper or a tarp. Use painter’s tape to cover any surfaces of the furniture you do not wish to paint.








For example, if you only want to paint the surface of a table, tape off the top portion of each leg.

, If the piece you’re working on has been painted before, it will need to be lightly sanded. It is often worth sanding a bare plastic surface, as this will help primer and paint better adhere to the furniture. Use sandpaper or a sanding sponge with fine -grit to gently brush the entire surface.








Test your sanding material in an inconspicuous spot on the furniture. Reduce pressure or use sanding equipment with a finer grit if any visible scratches appear.
After sanding, wipe down the surface of the piece with a tack cloth to remove dust.Skip to priming if the furniture is already smooth. Old furniture that has sat in the sun may be ready to paint after cleaning and drying. New plastic furniture will likely benefit from a light sanding.

"
"
Consider priming the surface.,
Apply a coat of spray paint.,
Allow the first coat to fully dry.",How to Paint Plastic Furniture2," Once the surface is clean, dry, and smooth, it’s ready to prime. Though combination paint and primer sprays exist for use on plastic surfaces, use a primer if you wish to paint your furniture in a color of paint that is not available for plastic materials. Choose a primer designed to be used on plastic materials that are stored outdoors.These will be available at your local home improvement store, and will come in a spray can. Shake the can and spray the entire surface you intend to paint.
Apply the primer in a steady back-and-forth motion while holding the can’s nozzle 12-18in (30-45cm) from the surface.

, Use a combination paint and primer designed for use on plastic or prime the surface with a plastic-specific primer first. A satin finish is recommended for plastic surfaces. Hold the can upright, with the nozzle 12 in (30cm) from the surface. Evenly spray the entire surface in sweeping, back-and-forth motions., Once the paint is dry to the touch, assess whether you need another coat. This is up to you. If you used a paint and primer combo, you’ll likely want to do at least one more coat. Once you’re happy with the paint coverage, let the piece dry for 24 hours before use. Don’t remove any painter’s tape until the piece is completely dry!"
"
Sand the furniture’s surface.,
Use latex-specific primer.,
Use 100% acrylic latex paint indoors.",How to Paint Plastic Furniture3," Prepare the surface of the furniture by washing it with warm water and an all-purpose cleaner. After rinsing and allowing it to dry, use fine grit sand paper to remove any visible scuffs in the plastic’s surface. Sand the rest of the furniture’s surface lightly, as this will help the primer adhere to the furniture.







, Apply a full coat of a primer designed for use with latex paint. This will help ensure your paint adheres to the furniture you’re painting. Since plastic does not hold paint as well as other materials, an adhesion primer is vital to make your top coat last.







, If you’re painting a piece of furniture that will be kept inside your home, you’ll want a paint that is less likely to release odor or gas. Further, paint of this type will be more resistant to stains and will be easier to clean than other option.








Go with either a satin or semi-gloss finish.
This sort of paint will have more color options in liquid form. Ask someone at the paint counter of your local hardware store for a sample portion of whichever color you favor, as this will be especially cheap and will likely be enough to cover a plastic chair, for instance.
Use a synthetic brush, or soak a bristle brush in water overnight before use."

Add protective coat of paint/lacquer to protect chairs.",How to Paint Metal Chairs," Place on drop cloth and inspect for any damage. You will only want to re-use chairs that have no broken pieces or at risk for breaking.;
, Use your stiff wire brush to get through thick rust. Use some muscle to remove rust as some chairs have wear and tear from several years.


Wear a mask and safety glasses while sanding to protect skin eyes and lungs (in the event of lead paint concerns).
Sand the remainder of the chair with your sanding block or fine grit sandpaper. Smooth over any rough patches without scratching metal.

, Wipe down with clean rag, removing any flecks of rust or debris. Allow chair to dry if you use any soap and water to clean chairs.


Apply primer, spraying approximately 10 to 12 inches (25.4 to 30.5 cm) away from the chair. Try to apply evenly throughout the chair. Allow to dry for 24 hours.







, As with the primer, apply paint from a distance of about 10 to 12 inches (25.4 to 30.5 cm) away. Use smooth sweeping motions so you achieve even coverage.


Allow first coat of paint to dry for 1 to 2 hours (depending upon humidity levels in the room) and then apply a second coat.







, While this step could be considered optional, adding this final coat will keep your chairs in good shape for a longer amount of time.

Not only can these get in the way when painting, but paint could also spatter and get on surfaces you didn't intend. Furthermore, your work area should have good airflow to prevent the potential buildup of dangerous fumes.A drop cloth or a tarp are both great ways of preventing paint from getting on the ground, furniture, or equipment.
The entire process of priming, painting, and sealing your stool will take a few days. A work area that's out of the way, like in a shed or garage, may be most convenient.;
, Missing an area when priming can make the end result of your paint job look unpolished or unprofessional. For this reason, you should start at one end of the stool and methodically work to the opposite end.

Generally, you should paint from the top down to prevent the formation of drips. To get into this habit, you may also want to sand, clean, and prime from the top down, too., Sanding your stool before painting will help you achieve a smooth, even finish that is more resistant to chipping. A thorough hand sanding should be sufficient in most cases, though you might find an orbital sander speeds up this process. When sanding:

Wear a dust mask to prevent lung irritation or damage from accidentally breathing in dust produced while sanding.
Use a medium grit (60 - 100 rating) sandpaper.Sand with medium pressure and overlapping strokes to prevent yourself from missing spots.
Target bumps, loose paint, and uneven surfaces when sanding. Sand until the entire surface is even and smooth.Even if the primer, paint, and sealer you've chosen for this job claims no sanding is necessary, sanding will always improve the end result., Sanding will usually create a fine film of dust on the surface of your stool. This can cause clumping or create unevenness in your primer coat. Dampen a clean cloth, and wipe all surfaces of the stool thoroughly. Then:

Allow the surface of the stool to dry completely before priming. You can speed the this process by following the damp cloth wipe with a clean, dry cloth wipe.
Mix your primer thoroughly, then dip your brush in it. Wipe excess primer on the inner lip of its can, then apply the primer to your entire stool in a thin coat.
Follow your primer's label instructions for the best results, but generally, after ten minutes your stool should be ready for another coat.
Typically, multiple thin coats are better than a single thick one. You may even be able to see the grain of your wood through the primer. Don't worry, this is natural., Open your paint and use a paint stirrer to thoroughly mix the contents of the can. Not mixing most kinds paint can cause its components to separate, resulting in a less than ideal finished product.

Some paint or hardware stores may offer to mix your paint in an automatic mixer. These can significantly speed the mixing process., Take a clean paintbrush and dip it into the paint. Wipe excess paint on the inside lip of the can and apply the paint in long, thin, overlapping strokes. Remember to paint from the top down, as this will help prevent the formation of drips in the paint.

Wait until the paint dries before adding another coat. Some quick drying paints may be ready for a second coat in as few as 10 minutes. Check your paint label to confirm your paint's dry time.
Very humid conditions can lengthen the amount of time it takes your paint to dry. If you live in a humid climate, touch test your paint at the end of its dry time to verify it's actually dry., After you've finished each coat of paint, step back from the stool and check all its surfaces for drips or unevenness. Use your paintbrush to touch up these areas, smoothing the paint until it is consistent on all surfaces.

Corners, edges, and downward oriented parts of the stool tend to collect paint and are frequent drip zones.

, Paint in the same fashion as previously described when adding a new coat. For simple or rustic projects, two coats may be enough, though ordinarily, multiple thin coats of paint are better than a single thick coat.

If you have time, aim for five thin coats of paint. This will ensure a better appearance and a more durable paint job., In most cases, your paint will need at least four days before it has cured to the point that sealer can be applied. Some paints, however, might require up to seven days before they are sealer ready.

At minimum, you should wait at least 72 hours for the paint to dry before applying sealer to the stool., If your stool has been recently painted, it's not likely it'll need a thorough cleaning, but even a near invisible coat of dust can negatively impact your sealing. Dampen a clean rag with water and then wipe all surfaces you intend to seal.After wiping with a damp rag, you'll have to wait until the stool is dry again before applying sealer. In many cases, 10 minutes should be enough.
You can speed the drying process by wiping residual moisture on the surfaces of your stool with a dry rag.

, Many sealers are polyurethane based, which can be difficult to remove from your hands. Wear rubber gloves when sealing to prevent this. Take a clean paintbrush and dip it into your sealer, then:

Wipe your brush on the inner lip of the can to remove excess sealer from the brush. Generally, your sealer should be applied in thin coats.
Use long strokes that overlap when painting on your sealer to get the most consistent and complete coat., Different sealers will require you to wait different lengths of time before they are ready to be sanded. Check the label instructions that came with your sealer to determine the wait time for your primer. Then:

Use a fine grit sandpaper that has a grit rating of at least 220 to lightly sand all sealed surfaces.
After sanding, dampen a clean cloth and wipe away any dust that has formed. Then wait until the surface is totally dry before adding more coats., In most cases, your sealer will be most effective with at least two coats, though you may find three works even better. In the fashion previously described, apply your sealer to the stool until you are satisfied with the result."

Remove the stopper from the drain.,
Create the tool you need.,
Remove the clog from the drain.,
Put the stopper back in.",How to Unclog a Slow Shower Drain1," Most drains are easy enough to unclog with either your hand, a wire, or clothes hanger. However, you first need to figure out how to release the stopper. Most drains are either drop stoppers or push/lock drain stoppers.To release a drop stopper, first lift it up slightly. It should have screw that sticks up a little. Simply turn the screw a bit to make it looser, then lift the stopper up.
For the push/lock drain stopper, first push down once like you are going to stop up the drain. Push it again to unlock it. Once it is unlocked, you should be able to unscrew the whole stopper and then pull it out.
In a shower, you may need to just lift up the strainer at the bottom. You may also need to unscrew the grating.;
, While you can remove some clogs with your hand, it will be easier, more effective, and less disgusting to use a tool. You can start with either a wire coat hanger or a piece of stiff wire, but you need to do a bit of preparation either way.For the coat hanger, straighten it out into a long wire. Bend the end of it with pliers so it makes a smaller hook that will fit down your drain.
For the wire, just bend the end in a little hook to catch the hair.

, With the bent wire, hook the clogged hair by shoving it through the clog. Use it to pull up the clog out of the drain, then throw the hair away. You may need to dip down more than once to get all the hair.If the hair is particularly stubborn, you may need to use a utility knife to cut it.
As you pull the hair up, slice through the middle so you don't need to untangle it.

, Once you are sure all the hair is gone, check to see if the shower is draining properly again. If it is, put the stopper back in the drain. You'll need to screw the whole push/lock stopper back into place, while for the drop stopper, you'll just need to screw in the middle shaft.If it's not draining properly, you'll need to move on to other options.

Using a chemical drain cleaner.,
Follow the manufacturer's instructions.,
Start with what you need.,
Run hot water down the drain afterwards.",How to Unclog a Slow Shower Drain2," Products like gel cleaners and other types of commercial drain cleaners can help you remove clogs from your drain. However, you do need to be careful with these products, as they are very strong, and they can damage your pipes or cause problems if you don't use them properly.Always read the bottle to make sure the product you have can be used on the types of pipes you have and the system you have. For instance, you may need a special product for a septic system. In addition, make sure you buy one appropriate for baths and showers.
Never mix more than one type of drain cleaner. For instance, if the clog doesn't move, you don't want to pour another kind on top. That can lead to toxic fumes, which can cause you health problems.

, Each drain cleaner will work a little bit differently, so it's important to read the instructions first. Make sure you are following the instructions to the letter because drain cleaners are powerful chemicals and they can be harmful., Generally, you start with about half a bottle to try to remove the clog, and then you wait a specified period, usually about 15 minutes. Use the whole bottle if it's not draining at all and half if it's draining a little bit. Usually, you can pour the cleaner through standing water but not always., After waiting the required time, you need to use hot water to clear the chemicals and the clog. Watch to see if it's draining properly. If it's not, you may need to try again with some more of the same drain cleaner. Make sure you don't try a different cleaner."

Use an enzyme detergent.,
Try hot water.,
Try vinegar, baking soda, and hot water.,
Help unclog the drain with a toilet plunger.",How to Unclog a Slow Shower Drain3," Pour 1 cup of Dawn liquid dish detergent, or any enzyme-based liquid dish soap, into your shower drain. Let it sit for at least an hour and then flush the drain with hot water from the tap.This solution can create a large amount of suds, so be careful.

, One natural solution that will get some slow drains unclogged is boiling water. If the water is still standing in your shower, let it drain out. Boil some water, and then slowly pour it down the drain, which will help move some minor blockages along.If you have regular PVC pipes, boiling water could damage the pipes. However, if you have metal or CPVC pipes (which can take higher temperatures), using boiling water should be fine.
However, according to most city codes, you should have metal or CVPC, not PVC.

, Another option for a natural solution is vinegar, baking soda, and hot water. These ingredients can help break up the clog when used in conjunction with each other, though you may not want to mix these solutions with chemical clog cleaners.Start by pouring a single cup of baking soda down the drain, followed by 2 cups of boiling water. Once you've given that about five minutes, follow it up with a baking soda-vinegar combo.
Pour a cup of baking soda down the drain. With the stopper ready to go in, pour in a cup of vinegar. Stop up the drain, and let the baking soda and vinegar foam together. Once it's done, pour another cup of boiling water down the drain.
Once again, make sure you have CPVC or metal pipes, as boiling water may damage regular PVC pipes. Nonetheless, most houses built to code should have pipes that can withstand boiling water.

, Tape over any overflow holes with duct tape, so you can get a better seal. Put water into the tub to cover the bottom of the plunger. If there is already standing water that is draining slowly, you can use that instead of adding more water. Place the plunger over the drain and plunge the drain a few times, moving it up and down, much like you would in the toilet.You may want to get a plunger specifically for this purpose so it will be cleaner. However, since you'll likely be cleaning out your shower when you're done, putting a dirty plunger in there won't be the end of the world.

Try a drain stick first.,
Buy or rent a snake.,
Push the cable in.,
Latch on to the clog.,
Make sure it is clear.,
Pull out the rod or cable.",How to Unclog a Slow Shower Drain4," A drain stick, such as a Zip-it, is a mini snake that can be used to remove clogs. Once you have the stopper removed, you stick the end of the stick down the drain. The barbs catch on any clogs, and you can pull them out. However, the stick is only about a foot long, so it won't work on clogs further down., A snake, also known as an auger cable or sewer rod, is used to find clogs further down. It's a cable that has a tip on the end to pick up clogs. You can buy or rent one at your local home improvement store to use on your drain., On a shower, remove the strainer part. On a tub drain, take off the overflow plate and go through that hole. Start threading the cable or rod into the hole. Keep going until you feel the line hit a clog, then stop pushing., With an auger cable, latch on to it by turning the handle clockwise. That twists the end into the clog. Keep pushing, pulling, and turning to get rid of the clog. With a sewer rod, push forward and back to break up the clog., If the standing water starts draining, that's a good sign the line is starting to clear. Keep working at the clog until it feels completely gone, and run some more water down it to make sure that it is draining properly and that there's not a clog further down the line.If there's a clog further down the line, you may need to feed in more rod or cable to clear that clog out.

, Once you're sure the line is clear, wind the rod or cable out of the pipe. Run some hot water down the pipe to ensure you are completely clear, and then replace anything that needs replacing, including the shower drain. Wind up the pipe and return it to the store or put it away."

Take measures to prevent buildup in drains.,
Flush your drain with hot water.,
Use baking soda regularly.",How to Unclog a Slow Shower Drain5," Use strainers to minimize the chance of hair entering the drain. These strainers just fit over the drain and catch hair before it goes down to where you can't get it as easily. You can purchase strainers from a hardware store near you.However, you do need to clean out these strainers regularly to keep your shower draining properly.

, Run hot water down your drain every time you use the shower or bath. This process will allow fresh build-up to be washed away, reducing the chances of prolonged buildup sticking to your pipes., You can also use a baking soda flush once or month or so. Simply start by dumping a cup of baking soda down your drain. Follow that with a cup of boiling water. Doing so can help keep clogs from building up."

Squeeze several squirts of liquid dish washing soap into the toilet bowl.,
Pour 4 more cups (0.9l) of hot water into the toilet bowl to activate the soap.

,
Wait 20 minutes.

,
Turn the water valve on and flush the toilet.",How to Unclog a Toilet Without a Plunger1," The soap can break up fat inside the clog, much the same way it dissolves grease in the kitchen sink.


If you cannot find dish washing soap, you can try shampoo or bits of bar soap. It will not be as effective as dish washing soap, but it may work.;
,,, This method is best if the bowl is not too full to begin with, since the soap will be more effective.

"
Remove the lid from the back of the toilet.,
If you are unsure whether the toilet is going to overflow or not, but you know that the toilet is clogged, take off the lid and keep your hand near the float.,
Turn off your water valve, to stop more water from entering the toilet.",How to Unclog a Toilet Without a Plunger2," Pull the float up, if it looks like the toilet is going to overflow. This will stop the flow and avoid a large mess.

, If it starts to overflow, you can be ready to catch it.

, This valve is a metal oval near the back base of your toilet. Turn it to stop more water from filling the tank.

Run hot water from your bathtub or bathroom sink.

,
Fill the bucket with 2 to 4 cups (0.5 to 0.9l) of hot water.

,
Pour the hot water into the toilet.",How to Unclog a Toilet Without a Plunger3,",, Wait 5 minutes. The water can loosen fat and break up the clog.


If you do not think that the toilet clog is very bad, you can try turning the water valve back on and flushing after this step. Keep your hand near the float, in case the clog remains and your toilet tries to overflow.

"
"
Pour 2 to 3 cups (0.5 to 0.7l) of household bleach into the toilet bowl.,
Add 1 cup of powdered soap.,
Wait 10 minutes while the chemicals react.

,
Turn on the water valve.",How to Unclog a Toilet Without a Plunger4,"


Use this method in place of the dish soap method, if your toilet is very full or you fear a serious clog.

, This can be conventional dishwasher soap.

,, Flush the toilet.

Cut a wire hanger with wire cutters.,
Put on rubber gloves.

,
Stick the end of the straightened hanger into the bottom of the toilet bowl.

,
Work at the clog by moving the hanger around to various places.,
Pull out the hanger.",How to Unclog a Toilet Without a Plunger5," Straighten the wire hanger as much as possible.


If possible, use a plastic coated wire hanger, since wire can easily mar the porcelain toilet bowl.

,,, This should break it up, so that it flushes more easily.

, Turn on the water valve. Flush the toilet.

Gather all the necessary materials.,
Make sure the shower is completely turned off.,
Lay down a blanket or tarp.,
Remove the existing shower head.,
Clean the threads of the shower arm.,
Tape the threads of the shower arm.,
Attach the new shower head.,
Turn on the water.",How to Replace a Shower Head," In order to effectively replace your shower head, you’ll need a blanket or tarp, an adjustable wrench, a pair of slip-joint pliers, and a new shower head. It would also be beneficial to have teflon tape.You can purchase these materials at a home improvement supply store.
, Make sure the shower knobs are completely turned off and are secured tightly. This will prevent any water from leaking out as you work to replace the shower head.


Don’t bother shutting off the water supply; this would require unnecessary effort.

, Lay a blanket or tarp down in the tub or on the shower floor to prevent any shower head bits from possibly falling down the shower drain, and to protect the tub or shower floor surface from falling tools or materials.If you’d like to be extra careful, you can put tape over the drain to ensure that anything that falls around the blanket or tarp won’t fall down the drain as well.

, Wrap a cloth around the base of the shower arm.Open up a pair of channel locks and grip them onto the cloth and shower arm to hold the shower arm secure when you screw off the shower head. Then wrap a cloth around the shower head, and use an adjustable wrench to clamp down onto the base of the shower head. Turn the shower head counter clockwise to completely unscrew the shower head from the shower arm.


Some shower heads are screwed on rather loosely, and can be easily removed by turning it counterclockwise with your hands. You can try removing with shower head with your hands initially, but if you can’t loosen it, use the tools and cloths to remove the shower head., Use a clean rag to wipe off the screw threads of the shower arm. You could also use an old toothbrush to get in between the threads, and clean out any built up grime and rust.Remove any old Teflon tape from the shower arm’s threads.

, Apply about 2-3 turns of Teflon tape to the threads of the shower arm, wrapping the tape tightly in a clockwise direction and making sure that it is embedding in the threads properly.Wrap the tape in a clockwise direction so when you screw on the new shower head, the sealing Teflon tape doesn’t come undone.


Be sure to press the taping into the grooves of the threads., Place the new shower head onto the shower arm, and twist it clockwise by hand to secure it into place. Once the shower head is secure, use the cloths, pliers, and adjustable wrench to tighten the shower head. Wrap the base of the shower head with a cloth, and wrap the base of the shower arm with cloth. Use the pliers to grip onto the cloth and hold the shower arm base in place. Use the adjustable wrench to clamp onto the cloth, and turn the shower head clockwise as much as it will go.


This same procedure is used to attach any kind of new shower head, fixed mount shower heads and hand-held shower heads alike.The only difference is that a hand-held shower head will have a diverter attached between the actual shower head and the shower arm.Further instillation directions will likely be included when you purchase the hand-held shower head.

, Turn the water supply back on, turn on the shower, and check for any leaks coming from the shower head. If you find any leaks, turn the water off, reapply the Teflon taping, and try tightening it a little more.When tightening the shower head, be careful not to overtighten it.

Inspect the caulk around the wall joint of your tub or shower.,
Use a putty knife to remove the defective caulk from the tab or wall joint.,
Purchase either silicone or latex caulk to replace the caulking seals around the tub or shower.,
Cut off the tip of the caulk tube at a 45-degree angle.,
Place a bead of caulk along the joint.,
Use a wet finger to smooth the caulk.,
Remove excess caulk with a rag or a caulking tool.

,
Allow the caulk to cure as directed by the manufacturer.

",How to Seal Wall Joints Around a Tub or Shower," Check to see if the caulk has pulled away from the tub or wall, or if it has formed cracks that may allow water to seep through to the wall.;
,


Silicone caulk is soft and rubbery and often comes off in 1 strip.
Latex caulk is harder and often more difficult to remove. You can locate a caulk-softening agent from a hardware store to help in the caulk-removal process. Use the agent and the least abrasive tool that you can use to remove the old caulk.

,


Latex is easiest to work with and clean up, but silicone is more durable.
Caulk may come in a squeeze tube, but for others you may need a caulk gun.

, Use a utility knife and a piece of wire or long nail to break the seal at the bottom of the nose piece.


Do not try to squeeze the caulk without piercing the seal because the tube may burst.

, Make sure that the caulk is being pressed into the joint and not just sitting on the outside of it.

, You may also purchase a caulking tool to shape and smooth the caulk.

Wipe up spills when they happen.,
Use warm water and a dishcloth or sponge.,
Try an ammonia-based cleaner.,
Pick another non-abrasive cleaner.,
Use a cleaner with oxalic acid.,
Try a cleaner with bleach.,
Remove hard water buildup with a lime remover.,
Skip abrasive scouring pads.,
Use a microfiber cloth when cleaning.,
Don't use hard solvents or anything with acetone.,
Protect it from heat.,
Buff out minor scratches.",How to Clean Corian Countertops," Like any surface, it's easiest to wipe up spills as you go. If you wait to wipe up the spill, it can dry on the surface, making it harder to clean. Since Corian counter tops are nonporous, the spill won't soak in, making it a breeze to just wipe it up with a clean, damp cloth.Always dry the surface immediately after cleaning. If you don't dry the surface, film will build up over time.;
, If the spill has dried, you can use warm, soapy water to clean it up. Put a bit of dish soap on a rag, then add warm water to make it sudsy. Wipe it over the spill or residue to clean it up, then rinse it with clean warm water., If regular soap and water don't remove the stain, you can use an ammonia-based cleaner. Spray or rub the cleaner in, then wipe it up. Make sure to rinse it with clean water, and don't forget to dry it so you don't leave streaks.Before using any cleaner, read the directions on the bottle.
Always test the cleaner first on an out-of-way corner, so you can rest assured it won't create a different problem.
Although glass cleaner does have ammonia in it, you should skip it for this purpose. It can leave a film on the counter top. Pick a household cleaner instead.

, If you don't have an ammonia-based cleaner, you can use another non-abrasive cleaner. It must be non-abrasive because Corian counter tops are easily scratched. Spray the cleaner on the counter, and use a clean, wet rag to rub the cleaner in.You can leave the cleaner on for a minute or two to help remove the stain.
Rinse and dry the counter top when you're done.
Make sure not to mix different types of cleaners, as that can create toxic fumes.

, Oxalic acid can help remove brown stains, particularly on white surfaces. You can find cleaners with oxalic acid at your local big box stores. Zud and Barkeepers Friend are two common stain removers with this ingredient.Just rub the cleaner in and leave it for a few minutes, then wipe it off, rinsing it with clean water. Don't forget to dry it afterwards.
You may need to repeat the process to get all of the stain.

, If you have white Corian counters, you can use a product that contains bleach. The material can withstand bleach, as long as you don't leave it on for more than 16 hours. You can also just use a mixture of bleach and water, but don't go any stronger than 50 percent bleach.You can leave the cleaner on the stain for a few minutes to help the cleaner penetrate. Wipe it up with clean water when you're done letting it soak.
If your counters aren't white, it's possible that bleach could bleach out your counter tops. Test it in an inconspicuous place if you want to use a cleaner with bleach on colorful counters.

, Limescale cleaners can help you remove hard water buildup. Generally, these cleaners are acidic to break down the limescale on the surface.To use this type of product, spray it on the counter before walking away for about 5 minutes. Wipe it down. Rinse and dry the counter.You may need to apply the cleaner more than once to remove all the limescale.

, You shouldn't use sponges that have an abrasive side (like the yellow and green scrubby sponges), at least on the abrasive side. In addition, you should skip steel wool or any other type of scratchy material. Anything too abrasive can scratch up your counter top., A microfiber cloth is best when scrubbing your counter top. It works well to remove stains, but it won't scratch the surface. You can find these cloths at big box stores, supermarkets, and even home improvement stores., Hard solvents, like drain cleaners, can cause serious damage to Corian surfaces. Similarly, acetone can also cause damage to the surface that you can't undo. If you spill nail polish on a Corian surface, you can remove it with nail polish remover; just be sure to pick one that doesn't have acetone in it.You should also try not to get other harsh chemicals, such as paint remover or oven cleaner, on your counter top, as those can also cause damage., While Corian counter tops are heat resistant, it's still a good idea to protect them from heat. Always put trivets or other heat protection under hot pots that you place on the counter. It's also a good idea to put a trivet under something that produces heat, such as a toaster., Corian counter tops have a tendency to get scratched, but you can take care of most minor scratches at home. The best tools are the abrasive pads put out by DuPont, which get progressively finer.However, you can also try something like Comet powder cleaner and a Scotch-Brite white pad. Fine sand paper may also work. It will need to be 400-grit wet-dry sandpaper.With the DuPont abrasive pads or sandpaper, clean the counter to remove any film, and leave it wet. Starting with the peach pad (or sandpaper), rub lightly in one direction over the scratch. Every once and a while, switch the direction you're rubbing perpendicularly. Run the pad under water to remove residue as you go. Keep scrubbing until the scratch is removed. You may need to work over a large surface area or use finer abrasive pads to help it blend.
With a Scotch-Brite pad, start with a clean, wet counter. Sprinkle on some Comet, and rub the scratch in circles. Next, move on to rubbing it the direction the scratch is going. Once again, you may need to work in a large area to blend in what you're sanding.
For deeper scratches, you're going to need professional help.

Prepare the area.,
Load the silicone gun.,
Test the sealing.,
Begin to gently apply seal around the desired area.,
Complete the seal with tooling.",How to Seal Around a Basin or Bathtub with Silicone," Remove any old silicone from the work area.


This can be done with a utility knife.
Any contaminants like oil and grease could prevent the silicone from bonding so clean the area thoroughly with alcohol.;
, With a knife, cut the tip at 45 degrees, keeping the hole fairly small. This will give you better control over the amount of silicone released. The opening should not be so big that a bead cannot be formed, and it should not be so small that caulk tube seems highly pressurized.


Pop the silicone seal. Most tubes have a thin barrier inside the tube to prevent the caulk from curing. Many silicone guns have a tool to do this built on them. However, if yours does not, then a long nail or something similar will work.
Load the tube of silicone into the gun.

, Silicone sealing can be tricky. Hold the caulk gun over trash and depress trigger to move caulk forward, filling the tip. Caulk should flow out, not squirt or drip. Release the trigger lock to relieve the light pressure inside the tube. You may want to first practice on a test piece if you have never done it before. Use the corner of a cardboard box. This will give you a feel for the gun and the rate of the silicone flow.


The tip should be slightly above the surface, nearly touching. As you begin to press the trigger, watch the flow of caulk. With one steady motion, move the caulk gun straight along seam, creating a uniform bead. Before flow stops, quickly release the trigger and begin to press again as you continue to create a uniform bead the entire length of seam. Do not stop until you reach the corner.

, For best results, hold the gun at a 45 degree angle. You want to apply the caulking in an even and steady manner. Be careful not to apply too much as it can be tricky to remove the excess. When you come to the end of the area you plan to seal then release the handle and give it a quick pull to eliminate any strings.

, Tooling is the process of using your finger to create a seamless, clean bond between the sink and the silicone sealer. Gently pull your finger around the silicone to complete the seal. You may wish to use latex gloves. Now wipe away excess silicone from your finger, and allow to dry. When smoothing the caulk, start in a corner and go 1/2 to 3/4 across. Then start in the opposite corner and meet in the middle. When meeting the already smoothed section, lightly lift your smoothing device so there isn't a hump.

Continuously use plunger 5 to 10 times followed by a flush.,
Use a drain snake or wire coat hanger to try to dislodge the roll.,
Try using a combination of first dishwasher soap, followed by a flush, followed by a drain cleaner, followed by another flush.,
Keep repeating these steps.,
Get a bucket of warm water, mix it in with some dish soap and gently pour it into the tank.,
If all else fails, call a plumber.",How to Unclog a Toilet from a Flushed Toilet Paper Roll," Sometimes it is not the roll that is clogging the toilet. If your toilet is clogged though, it's probably the roll.


Make sure water can get through when flushed. The properties of the roll will not allow much water flow but it will allow some. What should happen is your toilet should fill up abnormally high and then slowly drain. If the toilet water is not getting through you have a bigger problem.;
, Sometimes the roll is just right there in front of you and is not as big of a problem as you thought.

, This helps the roll soak and get softer in the water.


After this, remove the tablet. This step helps because more water gets through. Put on gloves to prevent infection.

, Sometimes a simple flush will dislodge the roll immediately because it has become soft and will now glide.

, Slowly press down with a plunger and then pull up. You should be pushing water into the toilet. Sometimes if you flush once, let the toilet fill up to that high level and then flush again it will add more water to the bowl and push the roll out more effectively. Be careful with this because you may overflow your toilet.


Eventually the clog should work its way out. If not move on to step 9.

, Simply try to push the snake or unbent wire hanger down the toilet to dislodge the roll. If you feel something slip try flushing.

, This will allow the roll to slide easier and then the cleaner should dislodge the roll and allow it to slide through.

, The more time you take the roll will get softer and softer and will dislodge more the more you flush.

, Do not get boiling hot water because too hot of water will crack porcelain. If you can get as little water in the tank as possible it will work better because you will be able to pour out more water. After/during pouring flush the toilet. This should help push it out the roll.

, Unfortunately sometimes this becomes necessary.

Treat tougher stains with specialty cleaning products.,
Spray the countertops periodically with a glass cleaner.,
Use only non-abrasive tools and cleaners.,
Avoid exposing quartz to high temperatures.,
Reserve quartz for indoor countertops.",How to Clean a Quartz Countertop," To keep your quartz countertops clean, you usually won’t need anything more sophisticated than a gentle soap solution. Generally, it’s best to use a mild dish detergent that doesn’t contain any astringents or harsh chemicals. These substances can wear down quartz with repeated use.The resins used to seal quartz make the finish resistant to everyday dust, dirt, stains and mold.Warm water is more effective for releasing resilient messes than cold water.;
, Go over the surface of the countertop using smooth, circular motions. The majority of messes should come right off with little effort. For dried or sticky residue, apply more soap solution as needed.Get in the habit of scrubbing your countertops every time you do any major cooking, baking or meal prep.

, Wring out and rewet the cloth or sponge, then go back over the countertops one more time to clear away any last traces of soap. Soak up standing water with a paper towel and allow the quartz to air dry.Soaps can dry into a scummy residue if they’re not properly washed away.

, Commercial quartz is non-porous, which means it won’t absorb and lock in stains. However, it’s still a good idea to address spills, crumbs and other messes before they have a chance to set up. This will save you the trouble of employing more intensive measures later on.The natural grain and color pattern of quartz may cause some messes to go unnoticed.
With a modest amount of maintenance, you can keep your quartz countertops looking new for years.

, You may occasionally have difficulty removing crusty, dried-on gunk with just soap and water. In these situations, you can chip away at the spot using a plastic scraper. It will also help to spray the gunk with warm water to soften it and make it easier to lift off with a little elbow grease.Use only flexible plastic scrapers (never metal) and be careful not to apply too much pressure. Doing so may create small scratches or abrasions that can worsen over time.Soak paper towels in hot water and use them to cover messes that are spread out over a large area.

, With time, food particles and mineral deposits from hard water can cause a film to develop on the countertops that a normal wipedown may just smear around. A little distilled white vinegar can cut right through this film. Combine equal parts vinegar and water in a spray bottle, mist the entire counter surface and run a soft kitchen sponge over it to leave behind a streak-free shine. If you don’t have any vinegar on hand, you can also use an equivalent amount of hydrogen peroxide.
Vinegar is a useful natural cleaner, but its sour smell can be overpowering. Mixing in a few drops of lemon juice or your favorite essential oils will infuse the room with a pleasant scent.

, Should you ever need to remove more troublesome items like chewing gum, ink or glue, grab an oil-based stain remover like Goo Gone. Apply the cleaner lightly to the countertops and let it sit for a couple minutes, then rub out the mess and the remaining cleaner using a damp cloth.Ordinary rubbing alcohol may also be useful for loosening unusual substances., As quartz ages, the clear resin sealant can start to appear cloudy. A spritz of glass cleaner will help reduce some of the murkiness, leaving the finish looking polished and sparkling. This is a good project to complete about once a month, or whenever you notice that your countertops no longer shine like they used to.Common household products like Windex, Clorox Multi-Surface and 3M Glass Cleaner are all safe to use on quartz.After using glass cleaner, wipe the countertops with a cloth or sponge rather than a paper towel to avoid leaving behind tiny fibers.

, Quartz is quite resilient, but it’s not indestructible. Abrasive agents are enough to create small scratches in the soft resin or underlying stone that are often permanent. Similarly, it’s possible for harsh chemicals like bleach and oven cleaner to cause bubbling, staining or discoloration. Play it safe and stick with harmless cleaning solutions like liquid detergents and vinegar.It’s never a good idea to scour quartz with steel wool, sandpaper, pumice stone or any kind of stiff-bristled brush.Use a separate cutting board when preparing meals to prevent accidental scratches and gouges., Quartz is not meant to withstand intense heat. Always lay out a hot pad or trivet when serving dishes straight out of the oven. If you need to set down hot pots and pans, do it on the cooktop instead of the counter.Most types of quartz are only designed to tolerate temperatures of up to 300-400°F (150-200°C). More extreme temperatures may cause sudden and severe cracking.A quartz countertop may not the best place for appliances that generate a lot of heat, like toaster ovens or metal rice cookers.

, When exposed to constant sunlight, moisture and fluctuations in temperature, quartz is at a greater risk of fading or cracking. For this reason, it’s one finish that’s better suited for kitchens and bathrooms inside your home. Quartz surfaces are also more likely to gather dirt and debris outside, meaning they’ll require more frequent cleanings.For your outdoor furnishings, you’re better off going with materials like stainless steel, aluminum, synthetic plastics and water-resistant woods such as teak and cedar.If you do decide to have quartz countertops installed in an outdoor area (a poolside bar or patio kitchen, for example), make sure they’re securely covered by an awning or overhang to protect them from direct UV light and precipitation."

Collect samples of different granite types from the showroom and set them in the room you will install the granite.,
Determine which sample best matches your style and needs.,
Finalize your granite choice, and then use a tape measure to record the length and width of the counter top that will use granite.

,
Locate 2 or 3 reputable granite fabricators by asking for personal referrals, searching the Internet, or looking in the phone book.,
Obtain estimates from each fabricator.,
Ask the fabricator to provide seaming samples to ensure the quality of their work.,
Establish each fabricator's warranty policy.,
Visit each potential fabricator's granite yard to view the quality of their granite slabs.,
Review all estimates and determine which fabricator best meets your needs.,
Pick out the exact slab you want.,
Read through the fabricator's contract, make necessary changes, and sign the contract.",How to Buy Granite Countertop," Granite comes in a nearly endless variety of styles, patterns and colors.;
, Compare and contrast the samples against the size and color of the room.

, Before finalizing your selection, perform a few simple tests to ensure the granite is of good quality.


Test the granite for porosity by letting several drops of water sit on it for 15 minutes. Wipe the water away with a clean paper towel. If there is any residue left behind, the granite is highly porous and may not be a good choice based on its water absorption level.
Test for the granite for acidity resistance by leaving a lemon wedge on its side on the sample overnight. After removing the lemon wedge, if you see that the natural sheen of the granite has been diminished or if patches appear, then this granite style will not wear well for long-term use.

,, Check each referral with the Better Business Bureau and consult your area Department of Consumer Protection to ensure the fabricators are reputable.

, The fabricator will come to your home, take measurements and discuss options with you.


Select which edge will work best for you. There are several aesthetically pleasing edges available on the granite. The fabricator can review the edges they can provide.
Discuss whether you will purchase an under mount, top mount, or seamed-in sink, as well as the faucet type you will purchase. All of these elements will factor into the cost of fabricating the granite.

, Seaming is where two pieces of granite are glued together. Verify that the fabricator attempts to match the pieces together so they appear as one piece.

, Many fabricators will offer a lifetime warranty on workmanship.

, You will also be able to assess quantities and varieties available.

, Base the decision on price, quality of product, quality of work, and referrals. Finalize your fabricator choice.

, Granite slabs vary in color, veining, and pattern, so arrange a meeting at the granite yard to choose the exact piece you want. This will help avoid problems during the installation process.

Measure the radius of the curve.,
Make sure the edge is square.,
Use the correct size laminate strip.,
Begin attaching on one of the straight sides.,
Bend the laminate slowly.,
Trim the excess.",How to Bend Laminate1," For instances where the radius of the curve is three inches or greater, you can cautiously bend the laminate without heating it, so start by measuring the radius of the curve.You can measure this by locating the spot on each side of the counter’s rounded edge where the curve begins and drawing straight lines perpendicular to those edges to the point where they intersect. Then measure the length of that intersection back to the edge.


You can think of the point of intersection as the point where you’d put the pin of a compass in order to trace the edge of the curve.The larger the radius of the curve, the gentler the bend. If the radius is three inches or more, then you can attempt to cold bend your laminate.;
, In order to stop any gaps, bubbles, or distorting of the laminate, you need to make sure that the vertical edge around which the laminate will bend is perfectly square with the top surface of the counter.Check this by ensuring that the horizontal surface edge and vertical edge come together perfectly with a T-square.If the edge is not perfectly square, then you can smooth down the vertical surface with a belt sander to finish preparing it for the laminate., You want to use a strip of laminate that is roughly 1/2” wider than the width of the edge to which you’re attaching it. This is just in case the laminate shifts a tiny bit as you bend it into place. It’s easier to use a router to trim the excess after the piece is in place than it is to place it perfectly., After applying your laminate glue to the strip, do NOT attach the laminate by starting at the curve and folding the sides back. You want to start with the end of the strip on one of the straight sides of the edge before the curve. Use a J-roller to roll this section down tight before bending over the curve.A J-roller is a roller with a rubber head that allows you to roll any bubbles out of the laminate without damaging the surface. You should have one handy for all laminate projects.

, Now that one end of the strip is firmly in place, begin slowly bending the rest of the strip around the curve. Keep your J-roller in your other hand, so you can firmly roll the strip as more and more of it comes in contact with the edge as you bend.Once the entire strip is in place, you want to continue making several more passes across the entire thing with your J-roller to ensure that you don’t have any bubbles or gaps., Read the instructions for the specific laminate glue you used, so you know how long it needs to set. Once it’s dry, trim the excess portion of the strip off with a router.

Determine what the old surface is.,
Choose the right method for removing the old surface.",How to Refinish a Dresser1," Usually it is paint and perhaps some varnish but it might be simply one or the other. Or, the old finish might be wax, a stain, shellac or something else. If you can't work out what it is, ask someone who is likely to know to help you. It is important to be sure, as the different finishes will require different removal techniques.;

Measure the radius of the curve.,
Purchase the correct grade laminate.,
Make sure the edge is square.,
Heat the laminate with a heat gun.,
Apply laminate glue.,
Attach the laminate carefully.,
Trim the excess.",How to Bend Laminate2," Since heat bending laminate is a more difficult process, measure the curve of your counter using step one from the cold bending method. If the radius is three inches or greater, you may be able to bend your laminate without heating it.

, For tighter radius curves, the first thing you want to do is ensure that you have the correct laminate for the job. Vertical grade laminate is thinner than standard grade laminate, making it easier to bend without cracking. You may also see thinner grade laminate advertised as post-forming grade, which is also suitable for tighter curves.


Another option if you cannot find vertical grade laminate in the finish you need is to thin your standard grade laminate by hand. Using a belt sander, carefully sand down the application side of the laminate across the area of the strip that you need to bend.Be extremely careful and sand the portion to be bent to a thickness of approximately 0.7mm

, Use a T-square to ensure the the vertical surface on top of which you will apply the laminate is perfectly square with the flat horizontal surface. Use a belt sander to even out any imperfections on the vertical sides.

, The exact temperature to which you must heat your laminate depends on the manufacturer and grade; however, the forming temperature will be approximately 170 °C (338 °F).


Heat only the section you need to bend and keep the heat gun moving over that section without focusing on one spot too long.
A temperature gun is recommended to verify your heated temperature. In excess of 170 °C (338 °F), your laminate can begin to warp or bubble and your application J-roller can begin to melt.

, Wearing heat resistant gloves, quickly apply glue to the application side of the laminate and line it up against the counter.

, As with the cold bending method, you want to leave an extra 1/2” to the width of the laminate to trim later. Beginning with one end, attach the laminate firmly to the edge of the counter, and use your J-roller to flatten and tighten it down. Still wearing heat resistant gloves, bend the heated and pliable section of the laminate over the curve slowly, using your J-roller to keep pressure against the strip. Roll the entire strip until it is tightly in place on the counter edge.


Depending on the manufacturer and grade of laminate used, this method can yield curved bends around a radius as small as 5/8”or 9/16”, You should give the laminate a full day to set before trimming the excess width with a router.

Place the dresser somewhere that can handle making a mess.,
Remove all of the drawers from the dresser.,
Begin sanding.",How to Refinish a Dresser2," This might be the backyard if the weather is good, the garage floor or a hobby room with plenty of ventilation and tarps on the floor.

, Place them on the ground singly (don't layer them), so that they can be attended to individually.

, In conjunction with the method specified for the old surface your dresser has on it (see articles suggested above), proceed to sanding off the surface. Even if you've used paint stripper, a hot-air gun, etc. to remove most of the old surface, sanding is still essential for removing any leftover stubborn or awkward spots, as well as smoothing the surface in readiness for the refinish. In general, the following things will apply to the sanding process:


If removing the old surface completely by sanding: Sanding a dresser will take a decent amount of time. You may need to set aside several days or slots in a row to complete this part. Start with a lower level of sanding grit, such as 150 grit, then work your way up to 200 to 300, depending on the surface. Each grade will do remove different parts of the surface, so don't skip the gradual changes in sanding grit levels.
While an electric sander is usually fine for large areas of the dresser, you'll still need to use a sanding block wrapped with sandpaper for tighter and harder-to-reach areas, such as corners or scorch marks, and more delicate surfaces, such as around decorative elements.
Stubborn areas of old finish may need special attention with a tool such as a razor blade, chisel, steel wool or similar, to lift off stuck or tough portions. Use with care. If you were removing the surface with paint stripper or a hot-air gun, all loose and blobbed paint and varnish should be removed first.

Undertake any repairs that may be needed before refinishing the surface.",How to Refinish a Dresser3," For a dresser, check that the following things are in good working order (and if not, repair them):


The drawers slide in and out without sticking.
The drawers are intact, have no nails or other sharp objects sticking out anywhere and have no broken bits.
Check that the legs are sturdy and that the dresser does not wobble. Test this on an even surface, otherwise you might assume that the dresser is uneven when it's actually the floor.
There are no unsightly indentations or scratches. If there are, treat these with an appropriate wood-filling agent and sand off before adding the refinish.
If the dresser has a mirror, check for cracks, chips or spotting. Mirrors can be DIY repaired to a certain extent, but you may wish to seek the advice of an expert.
If the dresser has spindles, check that these are in good order, without chips or cracks, etc.
If the dresser has doors, check that the hinges are in good condition. If not, replace these with nice new ones.

"
"
Decide on how you will refinish the dresser.,
The following sections cover paintwork, waxing and using oils as refinish surfaces.

",How to Refinish a Dresser4," Once the hard work of preparing the dresser is over, the fun part begins. Which refinish will you use? Each finish has its own special look, with some more complicated to apply than others. Some suggestions include:


New paintwork (acrylic, enamel, dual colors, a pattern, a design, etc.)
Spray painting
Distressed painting
A paint wash
Wood stains with wax
Wax alone

Varnish or varnish stains
Oils
French polish
Lacquered finishes (hard for non-professionals but black japanned finishes are one possibility)
Decoupage
Fabric.

"
Choose a paint type.",How to Refinish a Dresser5," The most popular paint for wooden surfaces is water-based acrylic. It's easy to apply, the paintbrushes wash out easily in water and the finish is smooth and durable. Enamel paint can provide a lovely glossy finish but it is slower to work with and the brushes require cleaning in mineral turpentine, which means more effort, odor and longer drying time.


In general, enamel paint should be preferred where the dresser will get a lot of wear and tear (such as in a children's playroom or in a retail outlet). Acrylic paint will be fine for a dresser not likely to get too much buffeting.

"
"
Prepare the dresser as above.

,
Paint the first layer of acrylic paint.,
Use a soft, clean rag to wipe over the dried painted pieces of the dresser.,
Paint the next layer.,
Sand the paint.,
Paint the next layer.,
Use a smaller brush for any ornate parts of the dresser.,
Sand again.,
Paint the final topcoat layer.,
Reassemble the dresser.",How to Refinish a Dresser6,", This becomes the undercoat. Paint the entire dresser shell, then paint each individual drawer. For drawers, only the outer portion on show needs painting. Allow all to dry.

, This will remove any dust or grit that may have attached to the surface during drying.

, This is the second layer of undercoat. Allow to dry.

, Use a 240 grit sandpaper and sand gently over all of the paintwork. Dust with the clean cloth.

, This is the first layer of top coat and it needs to be perfect; remove drips if they form as you paint.

, Allow to dry.

, Dust with the clean cloth.

, Let dry.

, It should look brand new and ready for use.

"
"
Prepare the dresser as above.

,
Paint the dresser frame and the drawers.,
Sand the undercoat layer lightly with 220 grit sandpaper.,
Paint the next layer.,
Sand lightly with 320 grit sandpaper.,
Paint the final coat.,
Reassemble the dresser.",How to Refinish a Dresser7,", For drawers, only the outer portion on show needs painting. Allow all to dry; this is now the undercoat layer.

, Don't press too hard or you'll sand through to the wood. Wipe the dust off with a soft, clean rag.


If you do sand too deeply, repaint the undercoat on that spot before painting the next layer.

, This becomes the top coat. Allow to dry.


Paint with long brush strokes and light pressure. Only use the tip of the paintbrush bristles.

, Again, do not press too hard or you'll need to reapply the paint if you reach the undercoat or wood.

, Use the same long, gentle strokes from the tip of the paintbrush to get a perfect finish. Let dry.

, The refinish will be glossy, shiny and durable.

"
"
Prepare the dresser as above.

,
Choose a wax.,
Apply plenty of wax to the applicator.,
Let sit for a few minutes.

,
Rub the waxed area with a clean cloth.,
Repeat for the drawers.

,
Repeat the process again.,
When you're happy with the finish, stop adding layers of wax.,
Reassemble the dresser.",How to Refinish a Dresser8,", Furniture wax is a good option, or you might like to try beeswax. You'll also need a nylon scourer or a steel wool pad to apply the wax with (the ""applicator"").

, Rub onto the dresser frame wood, rubbing into the wood grain.


Use even strokes and avoid allowing the wax to build up in any single area.

,, Rub continuously until the surface stops feeling sticky and feels smooth. This will take quite some time, so get into the rhythm and keep rubbing.


Keep your hands behind the cloth at all times; this will ensure that your natural body grease doesn't also transfer to the wood surface. For the hand holding the furniture, either wear a cotton glove or hold the furniture with another clean rag between your hand and the wood surface.
Turn the cloth around regularly to move to a cleaner part of it. The cloth will eventually get its own build-up and you may need several cloths to complete the whole dresser.

,, Add the wax layer again, then rub continuously to make it smooth. The dresser surface should have at least two wax layers added to it; more is great if you can, as the more layers of wax added, the better the finish will look.

, Consider whether you want to leave the dresser waxed as it is now, or whether you wish to seal in the surface with a varnish. Either way is acceptable, but be aware that an unvarnished waxed surface is more fragile and can be marked easily.

, Carefully return it to its home spot, ready for use.

"
"
Choose a finishing oil.,
Prepare the dresser as above.,
Brush the dresser frame and drawers with the oil.,
Brush oil into any areas that dry.,
Allow the oil to soak in.,
Repeat.,
Reassemble the dresser.",How to Refinish a Dresser9," Linseed oil is the most common oil used for oiling furniture pieces but there are other oils available––ask your retailer for specific advice.

, The dresser should be finely sanded and any blemishes treated with a filler that exactly matches the wood.


If there are any stains or color variations in the wood, stain these to match the surrounding wood before proceeding.

, Use a normal wide paintbrush that you'd use for painting the dresser. Be generous––the wood will soak up the oil to begin with.

, These areas need more oil.

, The time for this varies between 15-45 minutes, depending on the timber, its age and condition, and the oil. The humidity and temperature will also impact the time it takes for the oil to penetrate the wood––it will likely be faster in warmer weather and slower when cooler.

, Brush on a new layer of oil. The dresser will need about 5 to 6 layers of oil to provide a sufficiently durable surface. The finish will also look better for more oil layers.

, Place it back in its usual spot, ready for reuse. Keep an eye on its condition; oiled surfaces are the one surface that will need regular maintenance to keep the sheen. Rub in more oil every few months or half yearly, to keep the oiled appearance at its best and to continue protecting the dresser.

When cleaning, rub with the grain. Add a few drops of oil to restore sheen for cleaning, and simply buff.

Decide on the pieces you want to make.,
Organize the materials you'll need.,
Cut the pipe to the desired lengths.,
Prepare the PVC pipes for assembly.,
Assemble the various pieces.,
Finish out for functionality.",How to Make PVC Furniture," For practical applications, outdoor patio furniture like PVC tables and chairs are the most common items. Consider a matched set with the traditional centerpiece table and 4 chairs. Bar stools are also a popular choice. Search for design plans, and get ideas from conventional furniture sources such as catalogs or online stores.;
, PVC pipe and connection fittings are easily obtainable at hardware or plumbing stores. When determining the size of the pipe and fittings, remember thicker pipe is more sturdy. Standard size for PVC chairs should be at least 1-1/4 inches (3.6 cm) in diameter, allowing for the weight of a typical adult.

, Follow a specific plan to ensure an accurate fit when assembling. Although building PVC furniture seems unorthodox, employing standard sizes is recommended. Use a tape measure for correct measurements. Keeping the blade straight for an even cut, saw through the pipe with a hacksaw or an electric reciprocating saw. Use a pencil to lightly mark the pieces.

, Use fine grit sandpaper, if necessary, to remove any burrs or rough edges on the cuts. Locate the pencil marks to match the fittings. Use ""T's"", ""elbows,"" and 3- or 4-way fittings in the areas where the pipe needs to be connected. For example, ""elbows"" are required where the pipe needs to change to a 90 degree angle.

, Start at the base and connect the correct pipe pieces to the fittings, using a twisting motion. Be sure the pipe ""bottoms out"" by tapping firmly with a rubber mallet. Glue should not be necessary to make PVC furniture, unless the fittings are loose. Use PVC glue sparingly to avoid staining the pipe.

, Building PVC furniture for years of enjoyment can be completed with the addition of wooden seats designed to fit snugly on the chair frames. PVC tables and chairs can then be introduced to your guests at an outdoor party or summer gathering.


Cut notches in the corners of a water resistant portion of plywood to accommodate the pipes on the frames of the chairs.
Woven fabric can be attached to the PVC by looping around the front and back of the chair frame and sewing the end of the fabric together.
Your PVC table surface can be made of wood, as well. Teak or other rot-resistant wood should be used for outdoors. Simply cut to fit on top of frame.
For more stability, bolt the table top down by drilling holes through wood and the PVC frame, using bolts, washers and nuts. Tighten firmly with adjustable wrench.

Repeat with additional coats.,
Wipe down the wet wash for a distressed effect.,
Allow the piece to dry overnight.,
Sand the washed piece lightly.,
Apply a final clear coat.",How to Color Wash Furniture," Head down to your local home improvement store and browse their selection of paints to find one that’s the perfect match for the item you’re customizing. Color washes turn out best with matte or chalk paints, so stay away from gloss and semi-gloss for this project. One quart of paint should be more than enough to mix up a large batch of color wash.Any shade of paint can be used to mix a color wash, but pastels and subdued colors will work especially well for projects that are designed to make furniture look vintage or tastefully understated.
Save unused paints and keep them on hand for future projects.;
, Find a disposable receptacle that will hold about half a gallon of liquid. A plastic bucket or extra large storage container will work well for this purpose. Use roughly 5-8 ounces of paint to provide the base for the color wash.Use slightly more paint for a bolder, opaque finish.
You’ll dispose of the excess wash once your project is complete, so don’t use any more paint than is necessary.

, In order for the wash to go on properly, there should be a much higher ratio of water to paint making it up. The wash needs to be quite thin, as you’ll be applying it in multiple coats to achieve the right depth of color. Stir the wash together by hand until it forms an even, milky mixture.If you used 5 ounces of paint, for instance, you’ll want to add somewhere between 18 and 24 ounces of water.
Test the wash using scrap wood sticks before you begin painting. Adjust the amounts of paint and water until you find a proportion you think will work well for a particular piece of furniture., At this point, you can add a few ounces of another color of paint to change the hue of the wash as you see fit. For example, a splash of mint green can turn a basic sky blue wash to a more retro-looking seafoam. Similarly, hints or orange and opal will upgrade an ordinary red to sun-baked brick. Mixing your paints allows for a much greater degree of customization and control over the finished piece.Neutral colors like dark gray and white can be used to darken or lighten the overall shade of a wash, respectively.
Blending different colored paints can result in one-of-a-kind finishes that will make your furniture even more distinguished.

, Washes are designed to set into the actual material of a painted piece. For this reason, the furniture you paint should either be unfinished or have been stripped beforehand. Natural materials like wood, wicker, bamboo and terracotta are porous and will provide the most welcoming surfaces for the liquid wash.Washes are intended to soak into a painted piece rather than resting on the surface. This makes the tones of the pigment look more ingrained.
Treat previously-painted furniture with a chemical paint stripper and sand it thoroughly to remove all traces of the original color if you plan on finishing it in a different hue., Use long, smooth strokes and cover as much area as you can. The point here is to lay down a subtle base that you can then add to until the piece has just the right balance of color and natural grain.You may barely notice a difference after applying the first coat. This is normal. It will take a few layers for the wash to stand out.
Dip small or removable items like shelves, drawer faces and table legs in the wash to save time and create a more even finish., Once the initial coat has been brushed on, go back over the piece as many times as you like, layering on the color a little at a time. With each coat, the color will become bolder and more pronounced. Let each coat dry to the touch before adding subsequent layers.Washes act similarly to stains, soaking into unfinished surfaces to give it a tinge of color and provide a foundation for other colors and coats.
If the color isn’t as intense as you’d like, increase the concentration of paint in the wash mixture by a few ounces, then stir and try again., Before the color wash has had a chance to dry completely, run a damp washcloth or folded piece of cheesecloth along the surface of the pieces in light swipes. This will remove a little bit of paint with each pass, revealing the natural grain of the material beneath and leaving the piece looking more time-worn. Distress as much or as little as you like before the wash dries to give the piece some added aesthetic character.You can also use a rag soaked in water, paint thinner or mineral spirits to strategically thin dried wash, creating a unique texture in the finish.Try distressing furniture around the edges and corners for a more natural aged appearance.

, Once you’re satisfied with the look of the piece, set it aside somewhere out of the way to let the wash set up. Within 24 hours, the piece should be dry enough not to smudge or transfer color to other items it touches. At this point, you can add other unique accents or apply the finishing touches to seal the wash.Put down a dropcloth or plastic tarp to dry large or oddly-shaped furniture on.
Minimize contact between the color washed item and the surface it’s resting on to keep the outer coat intact.

, For a more even finish, go over areas where the wash has collected or set up thickly with a sheet of high-grit sandpaper. Focus on spots where the paint has dried in streaks or droplets. Your aim should be to make the overall tone of the piece as blended and uniform as possible.Color washes have a tendency to show up darkest in joints, contours and crevices, which can look jarring if the rest of the piece is still light on color.

, When you’ve got the piece looking the way you want it, use a thin coat of varnish or polyurethane finish to preserve the color and visual texture for good. You’ll be able to put your furniture to daily use without having to worry about the color fading or rubbing off. Use color washes to lend interest and enchantment to other pieces around your home!Clear coats protect against scratches, humidity and natural deterioration and can be reapplied as they wear out over time.
To clean color washed furniture, simply run a damp washcloth over the outer surface. The smooth clear coat will act to repel dust, dirt and stains and is easy to touch up with a simple wipe-down.

Be sure the surface is protected with newspaper, cardboard or other cover.






Note: Use ONLY spray enamel. Do not use a lacquer! Lacquer will eat up anything in its path, except other lacquer. Enamel is a safe bet over nearly any paint.
To be sure, spray a test area that will not be exposed when finished.

, Spray the sides of the cabinet lightly because you will be painting vertical surfaces and the paint is more likely to run.


Very light coats dry fast and can be recoated within a few minutes.
Allow about five minutes between very light coats so the paint has a chance to set.
This may require about four or five very light coats. Be patient!
You may apply a slightly heavier coat to the top of the cabinet, as you will be painting a flat, horizontal surface. This is similar to painting the drawer faces.

, Allow the cabinet and drawers to dry the amount of time recommended on the spray can before applying your color top coat.


If you create a design using masking tape, let the primer dry for at least 24 hrs. before taping, or the paint will peel when you remove the tape.

, Don’t worry about the primer coat showing through after the first couple of coats.


You may be tempted to go back and “fill in the blanks” with a heavier coat, but do not do that. It will ruin everything you have done up to this point.
Too heavy of a coat may cause the paint to “crinkle” and create a big mess, so be patient.
Be sure to hold the spray can about 10 inches (25.4 cm) from the surface as you spray, and make smooth passes from end to end.
Do not paint in a random zig-zag pattern or it will be difficult to get an even finish.

Note: Use ONLY spray enamel. Do not use a lacquer! Lacquer will eat up anything in its path, except other lacquer. Enamel is a safe bet over nearly any paint.
To be sure, spray a test area that will not be exposed when finished.

, Mask any hardware that hasn't been removed.


Use white or gray as this will make the final color more vivid.
Recoat with primer within the time indicated on the can.
Most enamels must be recoated within an hour.
Otherwise, you will have to wait until the following day.
Do not try to lay down one thick coat, because the primer will run and take a long time to dry.
Spray all drawers then set them aside to make room for the cabinet.

, Spray the sides of the cabinet lightly because you will be painting vertical surfaces and the paint is more likely to run.


Very light coats dry fast and can be recoated within a few minutes.
Allow about five minutes between very light coats so the paint has a chance to set.
This may require about four or five very light coats. Be patient!
You may apply a slightly heavier coat to the top of the cabinet, as you will be painting a flat, horizontal surface. This is similar to painting the drawer faces.

, Allow the cabinet and drawers to dry the amount of time recommended on the spray can before applying your color top coat.


If you create a design using masking tape, let the primer dry for at least 24 hrs. before taping, or the paint will peel when you remove the tape.

, Flat paints have a “dusty” finish and do not clean as well if the surface gets dirty in the future.


For a high-use item like a file cabinet, it is best to use a paint that can be easily cleaned in the future.

, Apply two light-to-medium coats of paint rather than one heavy coat.


Runs or drips can easily be brushed out while paint is still wet.
This type of paint usually cleans well with soap and water.

, Wait until paint is dry to add different colors or to paint designs over the final coat.


Using a roller adds an interesting texture to the paint.
Replace the hardware or change it to something completely different depending on the look you are trying to achieve.

Choose your paper.,
Measure the width and height of the drawer face.,
Cut the contact paper to size.,
Align and place the paper on the drawer.,
Trim off the excess and correct any misapplications.,
Add some extra decoration for a personal touch.",How to Give a File Cabinet a Makeover3," Using paper is a simple, but fun way to makeover your file cabinets.


Shelf paper or contact paper is usually made of vinyl and not paper.
Be sure to choose vinyl if you come across both types as it is more durable and is easier to clean.
The surfaces to which you will apply the contact paper should be dent-free, or the finished project will not look good. The exterior hardware MUST be removed in order for the paper to apply smoothly.

, With the drawer sitting face up, measure the width and height of the drawer face.


Most contact paper has a “criss-cross” grid on the back side.
This helps you cut straight lines. They are usually ½” or 1” squares.

, Cut a piece of contact paper about one inch larger than each measurement.


Peel back about one inch of the backing paper to expose the adhesive on the paper.
Do this along the “long” edge of the paper.

, Carefully align the exposed edge along the corresponding edge of the drawer face with about a half-inch overhang.


Carefully run your finger over the paper to stick it down to the drawer. Make sure the paper does not wrinkle while you do this.
Slowly peel back about ½” of backing paper at a time as you carefully stick the paper to the drawer surface.
Do this in very small segments to reduce the risk of bubbles and wrinkles.
Continue this process until the entire surface is covered.
It is recommended that you “prime” a vinyl surface with a solid white contact paper. Otherwise, the wood-grain pattern will show through if you are using a light-colored pattern.

, Use a razor blade or sharp utility knife to trim off the excess. You can use the outer edges of the drawer as a natural straight-edge to get a clean, straight cut.


If you get a wrinkle, be very careful if you peel the paper off the drawer. Vinyl stretches and it may not re-apply correctly.
If this happens, you can cut away the bad piece and replace it with a new one. Use a straight-edge to make your cut so it will be straight.
If you get air bubbles or pockets under the paper, use the sharp corner of a razor blade or the sharp tip of a utility knife to pierce the bubble and release the air. It should then flatten out nicely.
Repeat this method for all surfaces. Do one surface at a time on the cabinet and do not try to completely wrap the cabinet with one piece.

, Cut out decorative shapes with a contrasting color of contact paper and apply it to the newly covered surfaces.


You may also get pre-cut letters and shapes to personalize your cabinet.

Do not sand and re-stain wood cabinets.,
Use a “primer” sheet of solid white contact paper so the grain will not show through your final pattern.,
Choose a base color to contrast with the top coat.,
Apply a thin coat of the top coat color over the tacky base coat.",How to Give a File Cabinet a Makeover4," If you are giving a wood cabinet a makeover, it is not recommended to sand and re-stain wood cabinets.


This is because if the wood is thoroughly sealed, it will not absorb new stain very well. This will result in a blotchy finish.
If you are simply applying a new clear coat, remove all exterior hardware and clean the cabinet and drawers by buffing with very fine steel wool.






Wipe away all the dust and follow the same procedure as painting metal cabinets.







,


Wood can be made over the same way as metal when painting or using contact paper.







, White, black or gray are common choices.


Paint one thin coat of the base color that just covers the surface and let it dry until tacky to the touch.
This requires two contrasting paint colors and must be brushed. Acrylic paint works best.

, Let the base coat show through in streaks by completely brushing out the top coat of paint.


Use your own judgment on how much base you want to show through.
Sometimes, since the base coat is tacky when applying the top coat, the different phases of drying will create a wrinkled or distressed appearance of an antique piece of furniture.
Allow the paint to dry thoroughly before replacing the hardware and using the cabinet.

Understand the inherent qualities of marble.,
Determine how your marble countertop will be used.,
Choose a marble color.,
Measure your countertop space.,
Evaluate edge styles for your marble countertops.,
Determine your budget.,
Consider a sealant on the marble countertop.",How to Buy a Marble Countertop1,"


Choose marble because it is waterproof and heatproof. It is a long-lasting stone that provides an elegant look in any room.
Be aware that marble is a porous material that can scratch and stain easily. Small scratches can be polished out of the stone, but larger chips cannot be repaired. Marble countertops can be sealed to protect the stone's surface, but hard water deposits can stain even sealed marble surfaces. Sealed marble may need to resealed periodically to protect the stone.;
,


Avoid marble countertops in the kitchen. Because marble is made of carbonate materials, it is reactive with acids like those found in coffee, fruit juice, soda, salad dressing and alcohol. If the marble comes in contact with acid, etching will occur, which is a process that breaks down the polish and leaves a dull, lightly colored spot in the stone. Although sealing the marble will protect the surface from stains, it will not prevent etching. Marble also is easily scratched, which can make it a challenging work surface.
Choose marble slabs as decorative features in a kitchen. If you use your kitchen as an entertaining area and would like to incorporate marble into the d�cor, consider a marble slab instead of entire marble countertop. Marble is an ideal surface for bakers, especially for those who work with pie and bread dough. A small marble baking surface can add an elegant element to your kitchen while providing a functional application.
Consider marble countertops in the bathroom. Because most people typically don't use serrated knives or salad dressings in the bathroom, marble countertops are a more practical choice for a bathroom than a kitchen. In addition to the countertops, marble can be used for vanities, tile flooring, and bathtub and shower surrounds.

, Marble comes in a range of tones, including white, neutral, gold, orange, green, red, brown, gray and black. The veining or natural design in the stone complements most design elements. Professional interior designers typically recommend choosing a color shade for your marble countertops that is similar to the walls and floors.


Understand the color and veining variations in marble. Because marble is a natural substance, expect color variations and veining irregularities throughout the stone. A sample stone viewed at a marble contractor will represent the product, but will not be identical to the actual countertop you purchase.

, Measure the length of the countertop needed for your space. If you are including a sink in your countertop, include the measurement of where the sink will mount into the counter. The contractor will cut the stone to fit the sink into the marble countertop.


Determine how thick the marble countertops should be. Marble countertops are typically available in slabs that are 2 cm (.79 inches) to 3 cm (1.18 inches) thick. Marble counters that are 3 cm are more expensive, but are stronger. Marble counters that are 2 cm typically require wood supports.

, Most contractors offer a range of styles for the finished edges of the marble countertops. Standard choices typically include eased, bevel, bullnose, half-bullnose, triple pencil and ogee. You also may request custom-designed edges to match architectural features in your bathroom or kitchen.

, Several factors affect the cost of your marble countertop, including size, edging design, installation of sinks and faucets, and removal of the existing countertop. Marble is one of the most expensive materials available for countertops, so expect to pay between $50 and $150 per square foot.

, Because marble is a porous material that stains and scratches easily, most contractors will seal marble countertops. Sealant products can break down after time, so it is recommended to reseal marble countertops annually to protect the stone.

Determine the scope of your project.,
Decide if you can do it yourself.,
Find out about permits.,
Take into consideration your design knowledge.,
Find the stone.,
Draw a sketch of your project or provide blueprints showing walls, cabinets, sink locations and as many dimensions as possible.,
Visit a local stone distributor or fabricator and ask to see the available inventory.,
Ask the supplier if they fabricate or install their own material.,
Ask for a breakdown of material and installation separately so you can compare competing estimates.

,
Verify contractor's license and business licenses with the local or state agencies.,
Once you decide on the material and installer, ask for a written estimate and schedule.

,
For larger projects, when payment is made for material and labor, write a joint check to both entities.,
Ask if you can help with the layout of the project on your marble or granite slab.,
Try to be on-site the day of installation to answer any questions that may arise during installation.,
Make sure all stone is professionally sealed with a professional grade sealer.,
Finally, do not make a final payment until you are satisfied.",How to Buy a Marble Countertop2," Do you only need a small bathroom vanity, or is this a major remodel? This will help you determine how to handle other steps in the process.

, Do you need to hire a contractor? For small projects, you can handle much, if not all, of the details yourself. For larger projects, it may be best to hire a local contractor.

, Will you need to pull a construction permit? Typically, if the project involves major remodeling where electrical and plumbing are involved, you will likely need to hire a professional.

, Do you need to hire a design professional? Are you good with putting colors and textures together? If not, you may want to consider hiring a qualified professional.

, Once you have determined the scope of work you can get started searching for stone. If you are handling the project yourself, ask your friends or neighbors for a referral or recommendation. This is by far the most effective way to find qualified suppliers, fabricators and installers. If you do not have any references, search online for local marble installers or local stone distributors.

, This will help the supplier calculate area required.

, For a small countertop, ask if they have any remnants. There are always small pieces left over from previous projects, which can help you save money.

, If they do not, ask for a list of local professionals. The more choices you have to compare qualifications and price, the better.

,, Very Important: Ask how much the finished project is per net square foot. This will help you compare various bids for the finished price total. Note: Some installers disguise the final price by adding in various extras, like edge details, cutouts, extra travel, etc.

,, Ask if there have been any complaints or judgements entered against the contractor. Many states list these online.

,, Ask for a signed lien release form covering the amount of your payment. This protects your property against suppliers who do not pay sub-contractors.

, There may be a particular vein or pattern you wish to feature or avoid.

, You can avoid costly problems by being there to make sure the correct material and details were installed.

, This will help to avoid future staining and help you enjoy your new countertop for years.

, Once you have made a final payment, it is often very difficult to get problems corrected. Contractors have a way of conveniently disappearing once full payment has been made.

Find the right couch.,
Select a couch that fits your taste.,
Take pictures of the couch pre-upholstery.,
Carefully take the couch apart in the following order.,
Inspect the cushions for compromised filling material.",How to Reupholster a Couch1," Believe it or not, most furniture is designed to be re-upholstered, just as cars are designed to be worked on. Just because the fabric on an old couch has seen better days doesn't mean the couch needs to be consigned to the junk heap. There are riches to be found here.






;
, At the very least, find a couch that is of a style that can be molded to something enjoyable by the time it is completed.








, Take pictures of how the couch looks before you tear it apart, and especially all through the process of ""destroying it."" Take pictures inside and out, front and back. Take closeup pictures of any area that might be difficult.









Couches are not complex pieces of machinery, but this sort of project can take a long time, so it's good to have a nice ""photographic memory"" for referencing. You never know when you'll need to go back and piece something together about what the couch was like before you ripped its fabric off.

, While taking the couch's fabric off, take care not to damage the old cover or other parts that will be needed later, such as stuffing. Otherwise, remove the fabric in the following order:









With the sofa upside down or on its back, take off the dust-clothes and all the fabric around the bottom.
Turn the sofa upright and take off the outside back, the outside arms, the inside back, the inside arms and the deck.
If the old cover fits well, you can use it as a pattern to cut your new fabric. Keep the old cover around until you finish the sofa so that you can refer to it as needed.

, See if any filling material will need to be replaced once the couch has been stripped down. If the sofa needs new cushion filling, purchase high-quality foam (2.5 lb to 3 lb.), which will last for many years. Cheap foam quickly breaks down.









High-quality foam can get very expensive, very quickly — its cost is tied to the cost of petroleum, out of which its made — but don't skimp out, or else the couch will be great looking, but also saggy and uncomfortable couch.

"
"
Use your pictures as a guide.,
Cut your Fabric.,
Sew your fabric.,
Get a heavy-duty staple gun to attach the new fabric to the couch.,
Start attaching the new material from the inside out.,
Take pride in your achievements once the couch is finished.",How to Reupholster a Couch2," As you create and put the new cover on you may want to to consult the ""photographic memory"" compiled from before the couch was taken apart, or to ask for advice from a more experienced person.








, Find a large flat area (a large table or the floor) to roll out and cut your fabric. Use the old cover as a pattern to cut the fabric. Lay the old cover pieces on the new fabric, rearranging the pieces on top of the fabric as necessary to save fabric.









On seamed edges cut 1/2"" from the old seam.
On stapled edges add 2-3"" more, which will be used to pull the fabric cover onto the sofa.

, Older heavy duty metal sewing machines work better and hold up longer than the new lightweight plastic machines. Use the zipper foot to sew along the welting edges. Use heavy duty thread and a heavy needle to sew the fabric. Use a 1/2"" seam allowance.








, If you don't have one, purchase a good-quality staple gun, and go to town.








, First attach the sofa deck, then the inside arms, and the inside back, in that order. No matter which way you are attaching the fabric, be sure to pull the fabric snug as you attach it, or it will stretch over time.









When the inside is attached, fit and sew the cushion(s). If the cushions are a little too big or too small, you can adjust the size of the cushion area by loosening or tightening the bottom of the inside arms and inside back. Then attach the outside arms and the outside back.

, Perhaps the most important thing to do is show it off.

Remove the old straps.,

Heat the vinyl strap.,
Insert the fastener.,
Attach the fastener to the frame.,
Pull the strap.,

Repeat for each strap requiring fixing.",How to Replace Single Wrap Vinyl Straps," Using a pair of scissors, cut off all the old straps and fasteners.;
,, With a cloth measuring tape, take the hole-to-hole measurement. Wrap the measuring tape around the frame as if it were a strap.

, Take the hole-to-hole measurement and multiply it by .85 (85%). Then add one inch. This number will be your cut length.


For example: Hole to hole measurement = 22"" Hole-to-hole measurement x .8"" = 17.6"" Add one inch. Cut length: 18.6"".

, Using scissors and a measuring tape, cut the desired number of straps at the cut length.

, Using a leather punch or and electric drill with a 3/16"" bit, carefully drill a hole in the center of the strap, 1/2"" from the end of the strap. Make sure to drill a hole on both ends.

, Once all straps are cut and drilled, trim off the corners of both sides of every strap.

, This is done to soften it. There are at least two possible ways to achieve this satisfactorily:

Use boiling water to heat it. Using a hot plate or other heat source, boil a large pot of water. Once the water has come to a boil, insert several straps. Reduce the heat so the water remains hot but not boiling. Allow the straps to stay in the water at least two minutes, although leaving them in longer will not hurt them.






Use a heat gun. Move the heat gun around frequently; do not allow it to rest at one place. Thirty seconds of moving it around the strap and it should be heated enough to use.







, From here on, gloves are recommended to be worn as the straps can be very hot coming out of the water or after heating under the heat gun. Remove one strap with a pair of tongs and dry it with a towel, or simply lift up the hot heated strap with the tongs. Insert rivets into both ends of the strap.

, While the strap is still hot, approach the frame from underneath. Push the rivet into the hole in the frame and bring the strap around the outside of the frame.


If the rivet is difficult to insert, use a rubber mallet or hammer to tap it in.







, Using one hand to detain the chair, grab the end of the strap with the other. Stretch the strap evenly and steadily over top the opposite side of the chair.

, Using heavy thumb pressure, hold the vinyl in place and attach the rivet to the frame with the other hand. Release thumb pressure and the strap will contract as it cools.

, When it's all done, the chair is ready to sit on again.

Gather your supplies, tools, and materials, listed in the ""Things You'll Need"" section below.
,
See how the desk chair's seat is attached to its mount.,
Remove the padding (seat and back) from the desk chair.,
Unbolt the seat rails from your car seat.,
Measure the distance between the bolt holes for the seat rail, from front to rear.,
Measure the distance between the bolt holes from side to side.,
Go back to your stripped-down desk chair.,
Cut out the lengths you have marked on your box section.,
Lay these sections down on a flat surface, widest length down, and position them.,
Make sure the sections are positioned accurately then weld them together.,
Measure the width of the base plate of your desk chair (the opposite measurement to the one you took in step 5) and write it down.,
Take your old desk chair base.,
Finally, and optionally, use your angle grinder to clean up any messy welds.,
Mark out three rectangles on your steel plate.,
Mark a bolt hole near the top of each of these.,
Drill these holes out.,
Cut out your rectangles.,
Position your mounts on the subframe.,
Weld the mounts into place.,Optionally, paint your subframe and your mounts in black paint.,
Bolt your subframe to your car seat.,
Clean up the car seat.",How to Make a Desk Chair from a Car Seat,", In particular, measure how far forward the center of the base is from the inside surface of the chair back (i.e., where the tailbone area would rest when one is sitting in the chair). Because the seat back, torso, and buttocks are heavier than the seat front and legs, the mount is probably attached close to the back of the seat for balance. Arrange the new subframe you will make and the car seat's mounting on it to approximately preserve this distance, reducing the chance that the chair will tip backwards., This usually unbolts or unscrews. Sometimes the back support will be held on by a separate piece of steel; save yourself some time and cut this off, rather than fiddling around to remove it. Dispose of the old padding in an ecologically sound manner.

, This is usually four, slightly fiddly, bolts. Keep the bolts, as you'll need them later., Add about 20mm (just under an inch) to this number, then mark two of these lengths on your steel box-section. Write on the box-section what this length is for. We'll call these lengths ""Lengths A""., Subtract from this two times the width of the widest side of your steel box-section. For example, if your box section is 62mm, and the distance is 355mm, then you want 355 - 62 - 62 = 231 mm. Mark two of these lengths on your steel box-section. These will be ""Lengths B""., Measure the distance, front to back, of the steel plate that your padding used to be sitting on. Write down this distance on a piece of paper (you'll need it later). Then, subtract one widest-side dimension of your box section from this. For example, if it's 195mm, and your widest side of your box section is 62mm, then it's 133mm. Mark out two of these lengths on your box section. These will be ""Lengths C""., The easiest and quickest way is to use a band saw. Failing that, use an angle grinder; use the cutting discs to cut the sections out, then a grinding disc to clean up afterwards. Failing that, use a hacksaw. You will now have six small lengths of steel box section.

, Lengths A should be on the sides, pointing away from you. Lengths B should be between them, at right angles, with their centers as far apart as the measurement you wrote down in step 5 of this section. If there is significant rust or paint on your box section, note where sections A and B meet and clean them to bare metal with a wire brush (or with your angle grinder, delicately)., It might be a good idea to spot-weld them first then ""dry run"" them on your desk chair base to make sure everything's in order; it's easier to grind away and break a spot weld if you notice it's wrong.

, Go back to your subframe and position lengths C between lengths B, at right angles to it. You'll likely find that one or more will be slightly too long and won't fit; if this is the case, grind or cut them back. The centers of these sections should be as far apart as the distance you just measured. As above, clean up the mating surfaces then weld them in place. Your subframe is now finished.

, Turn it upside down and lay it on top of your subframe. Clean off any paint from the base where the two meet. Put on your safety gear, because it's not uncommon for the paint at the base to catch fire. Have a fire extinguisher ready. Weld the base onto your subframe.

, Be gentle!, These should be roughly an inch and a half wide by two or three inches down., To do this, measure the thickness of the bolts that used to hold the seat rails in place (you did save them, right?). As a rough guide, the centers of the holes should be about one and a half bolt-widths away from the top of the rectangle. They should be slightly off-centre; again, about one and a half bolt-widths from the edge., Use a slightly larger (by 2mm or so) drill bit than your bolts; this gives us a margin of error in case we position them slightly wrong later on. This will take rather a long time., By far, the easiest, quickest, and most accurate way of doing this is to use an angle grinder with a cutting disc fitted. After cutting them out, wait for them to cool (cutting them can get them surprisingly hot), use a bolt to align the bolt holes on all four and then clamp them together in a vice or a pair of mole grips (""locking pliers""). Use a grinding disc to make them all the same size. You will want to make the top corners as rounded as possible to give you the maximum clearance. Again, wait for them to cool before releasing them and handling them.

, They will be sitting on the corners of lengths A, with the bolt holes facing outwards, the off-centred side closest to the bolt holes facing towards the ends. Measure the distance between the bolt holes, front to rear, of your car seat and make sure that the bolt holes on the rectangular mounts are the same distance apart. The mounts should be sitting a couple of millimetres from the edge in the other direction., Wait for them to cool.,, Usually, it's best to bolt on the front first, then the rear, since the front ones are often harder to access than the rear ones. Unless your measurements and positioning were perfect (they never are), you'll likely find that the bolt holes on your mounts don't line up perfectly with the bolt holes on the car seat; if this is the case, drill the holes out a little larger. Alternatively, you can force the bolt in at an angle (""cross-threading"", though this might make it difficult to re-use the same chair on another base later on), or use a smaller bolt with a nut and washer on the other side (if you can access it)., You're finished!

",How to Make a Living Room Table from an Old Tire," While the tire treads will have no bearing on whether the tire will make for a sturdy base, you will want to ensure that the tire is intact and has no large rips or holes.


Scrub well with dish soap and a scrub brush. Consider doing this outside, preferably near your garden hose.






Hose off soap and debris.






Repeat if necessary.






Allow time for the tire to dry completely before starting your craft.





;
, Use your measuring tape to obtain the measurements of the tire opening to ascertain the plywood size. You will be cutting out a circular piece for the top.


Mark the measurements directly on the plywood using a pencil and then use the jigsaw to cut to fit. Don’t forget to wear your safety glasses when using the jigsaw.







, Instead of designing the bottom to match the top exactly, take the measurements of the tire’s diameter and then subtract 2 inches (5.1 cm). You will be creating a circular piece for the bottom as well.


Cut piece from the plywood and set aside.







, Using the plywood bottom, determine the spacing before you secure them in place. Position the legs in different areas of the tire bottom to see which placement has the best balance.


Use wood glue to secure the legs to the table bottom. Make sure wood glue has completely dried before adding screws.






Secure by drilling the legs to the plywood bottom and then secure them with L brackets.







,


Start with the bottom piece and use an ample amount of glue for both pieces.







, All wood pieces should have a few coats of stain or paint. Now is a good time to get a little creative and you can apply a variety of paint and stain techniques to the wood or just add a few smooth coats of stain to create a refined look.

, Apply construction adhesive to a small section of the tire and then (working quickly) wind the rope around the perimeter.


Wind tightly so you can no longer identify the base as being a tire.

Vinyl can be wiped down with a damp cloth. Be sure to remove any debris or dirt that is stuck onto the surface. Fabric should be vacuumed and cleaned with soap before paint application.Cleaning the surface well before painting assures that the paint will stick better to the upholstery surface.
Be sure that both types of surface are completely dry before paint application.;
, There are a wide variety of paint products that can be used to paint upholstery. What product you use depends on what type of surface you are painting and what type of application process you would like to use. Products can include:Spray paint for vinyl: Paints made for vinyl come in a spray can. They may be made for furniture or car upholstery purposes.
Spray paint for cloth: There are a wide variety of sprays made for cloth surfaces. Read the labels of those you are considering to make sure they will stand up the the use you are envisioning.
Brush-on paint for cloth: There are several types of brush-on paints that can be used for upholstery. There are some specifically made for upholstery and there are other paints, such as regular latex paint, that can be used for this purpose as well.

, As with painting most things, you need to protect other surfaces around from drips or over spray. This means putting down a drop cloth and taping off any surfaces that might accidentally get paint on them.You may need brushes, painter's tape, drop clothes, and a dust mask when painting. Get these supplies ahead of time so that you don't have to run to the store at the last minute.It is better to be safe than sorry when it comes to painting prep. Mask off more areas than you think might accidentally get paint on them so that you don't have an unfortunate mistake with the paint.

, When doing a craft project you should always take your safety, and the safety of those around you, into consideration. This means that you need to think about the need for ventilation, eye protection, protective clothing, and any other safety supplies that may be needed before doing your project.


If you are unsure whether you need to take safety precautions, look at the labels on all of the products you will be using and see if they have any safety precautions on them. This is a good place to start.

, If you are using regular latex paint to paint your upholstery, you will need to amend it. This means adding textile medium to the paint so that it sticks to the fabric.Mix together one part paint and two parts textile medium in a jar. This will thin out the latex paint and allow it to bond with the fabric.

, If you are applying paint to vinyl upholstery, you may need to apply an undercoat that helps the paint stick to the vinyl. This is only necessary for certain paints, so look at the directions of the paint you bought to make sure.The undercoat may be applied with a brush or from a spray can. This varies depending on the specific product you are using.

, Spray or paint on the first coat. Depending on the specific directions supplied on the product you are using, your first coat will either be very thin or thick enough to cover up the previous color of the upholstery.If you are painting vinyl, you want to be focused on a smooth, streak-less coat that does not drip. This is usually done by applying thin coats.
If you are painting fabric, your first coat is likely to soak in a lot. You may not have complete coverage but just make sure that the entire surface has paint applied to it.

, It is important to let your paint coats dry completely between coats. This assures that the paint solidifies and sticks to the surface you are painting correctly. It also assures that subsequent coats dry quicker.Follow the directions on the paint container for dry times between coats. Each paint may take a different amount of time to dry.

, Put on more layers of paint until the surface is covered to your satisfaction. This may be only one more coat, or it could be numerous additional coats.Be patient and do as many coats as it takes to get the finish you want. Skipping additional coats can lead to a less polished finish or a shorter lifespan for the paint.

, Remember to follow the drying time directions on the paint packaging. Allowing each coat to dry completely before applying the next coat will potentially help to make your finished product look better and last longer.


The drying time between paint coats will vary widely depending on the paint that you are using, the thickness that it is applied, and the climate it is being applied in.
Keep your project in a safe place until it dries completely. This will allow it to dry completely before being disturbed.
Avoid using your painted surface for anything until 100% dry.

, In order to keep your painted upholstery looking good, you will need to be careful with it and clean it gently. For example, if you spill something on it, soak as much up as possible quickly with a dry towel and then blot the surface with a damp cloth.


Painted upholstery can be more sensitive to use and abuse than fabric surfaces. Be sure to avoid setting rough or sharp surfaces on the upholstery, as it could scratch your paint job.

, If you paint upholstery you can always repaint sections or add new coats in the future. This can give your surface a whole new life after you have used it quite a bit.


Like with your original painting project, you should take the time to thoroughly clean the surface before you add additional coats in the future. This will help assure that the new coats stick to the old painted surface.

Disassemble your furniture.,
Sand the furniture with fine-grit sandpaper.,
Wipe away the sanding dust.,
Apply a coat of primer.,
Allow the primer to dry.",How to Paint Laminate Furniture1," If the piece of furniture you will be painting has drawers, doors, or other components that can be removed, you will generally get the best results if you disassemble the pieces before painting. This will make it easier to prevent drips and to get into the corners where the pieces fit together.









Take your time with this step. A lot of laminate furniture is not build with disassembly in mind, and particle board can be damaged fairly easily. Don't force anything. If two pieces refuse to come apart, paint them carefully in place.;
, Paint sticks best to slightly rough surfaces. To improve the adhesion of the primer and paint, you'll need to sand the entire surface of the piece with fine-grit sandpaper. Be careful not to sand so vigorously that you tear through the laminate into the particleboard beneath.









You can also use a random-orbit sander, which you can attach sandpaper to. Because you're sanding a laminate surface, it's important to not over sand, so just go over it lightly. It might be helpful if you sand the bulk of the surface with a sander and go over the corners and the sides by hand.
Make sure you sand all areas evenly. You want to get a good, sanded surface to work with, or the paint that you apply to the laminate will start to bubble. This is a clear sign that you haven't sanded enough.

, Go over the laminate surface with a vacuum. Next, use a tack cloth to thoroughly clean the piece of furniture of any dust left over by the vacuum.









Sanding dust can easily mix into your primer or paint and mar the finish of the furniture.

, After sanding, you can prime the furniture with any type of interior primer. The primer is best applied with a high-quality polyester-bristled brush, but can also be applied using a disposable foam brush. Apply the primer in long, smooth strokes, overlapping the previous stroke slightly, and aim for as thin and smooth a coat as possible.









A primer will help the color of your paint stand out, as well as give the paint a better surface to latch onto. Even so, be prepared to color with several coats of paint before you achieve the consistency and color desired.

, The primer will likely be dry to the touch within an hour or so, but it is best to wait a full day for the primer to set before painting. Waiting this long will help increase the durability and scratch resistance of the finished piece of furniture.

,
Measure the width of the chair seat.,
Measure the length of the chair seat.

",How to Measure for Chair Cushions,"


Only measure chair cushions that still fit the chair frame well. If you measure misshapen cushions, the measurements for your new cushions will be off.;
,,


The cushion is most likely to be misshapen in the width, so take 3 separate width measurements. Take one from the top width, middle width and bottom width. Use the smallest of the numbers you obtain.

, Use this number only as a reference point, because it's likely the cushion has been flattened from use.

,,,,


Don't measure using the seam as your starting or ending point. Simply measure from one edge to the other.

,, Subtract enough from the measurement that your cushion will fit easily into the spot without too much room to slide or move.

Paint the laminate furniture.,
Apply as many as four coats of paint to achieve the final finish you desire.,
Reassemble the furniture.",How to Paint Laminate Furniture2," You can use nearly any type of paint to paint laminate furniture, but latex-based interior paints are ideal.









Apply the paint as you did the primer, using long, smooth strokes. Use a combination of a paint roller and a brush: hit the long even surfaces with your roller, and hit the edges and corners with a brush.

, Wait a day between coats, spot-sanding areas with bubbles as needed. Multiple thin coats will always provide a better finish than a single thick coat.








, When the paint has dried thoroughly (at least one full day), you can put the pieces of the furniture back together.









Again, be slow and deliberate when reassembling the furniture: particle board, especially screw and cam holes, have a way of crumbling if treated at all harshly or forcibly.
With a small brush, touch up any areas where the paint gets scratched.
For best results, you may want to allow to paint to set up for a few days before subjecting the furniture to use.

,,


Fiberglass can release glass dust into the air when sanded, which is dangerous to inhale and can irritate skin.
To prevent this, wet the areas of the chair you're about to sand with water as you go. The water will trap the dust and keep it out of the air .

,, Let it dry.


If you're using the recommended paint sprayer, fill the sprayer's tank with your primer mixture and spray on the chair from there.
If you're stuck using a paint brush, just dip and prime.

,, Now you're ready to paint!

, Let the paint dry, then repeat the process.


Apply 2 to 3 coats.
If you're using the paint sprayer wash the primer out of it first.

, Use the sprayer if you have it or the brush if your don't.

Gather your materials.,
Remove staples with a flat head screwdriver.,
Slip off the fabric.,
Check for damage.,
Replace broken wood pieces.,
Use staple gun to secure the new pieces.,
Evaluate the padding and fabric.,
Slip on the padding and fabric.,
Tack the fabric in place.,
Secure the fabric with staples.",How to Reupholster a Footstool," Reupholstering a footstool requires some special tools and materials, but what you need will depend on how much work the footstool needs. Items you may need include:a flathead screwdriver (to remove staples from fabric)
new fabric for your footstool (if the existing fabric is damaged)
new padding (if the padding is bad)
a staple gun (to reattach the fabric and padding)
new wood pieces (if the structure of your footstool is damaged)
tacks (to hold the fabric in place)
a hammer;
, Use the flat head screwdriver to pry out all of the staples that are holding the footstool fabric in place. These staples should be visible if you turn the footstool on its side or upside down.To remove a staple, insert your screwdriver so that it is under the staple. Then, tilt the screwdriver handle downwards lift the staple out of the fabric and wood.
When the staple is almost out, you should be able to pull it the rest of the way out with your fingers. Repeat this process until you have removed all of the staples.
If the fabric was attached with nails, then use the back of a hammer to remove the nails.

, After you have removed all of the staples, slip the fabric and padding off of the footstool. If the fabric or padding is damaged, then you can discard it and replace it with new fabric and/or padding. If the fabric and padding are still good, then just set them aside for now., While you have the fabric off of the footstool, check the furniture for structural damage. If you notice any breaks or cracks in the wood, then you may want to replace these parts of the furniture. If the structure looks good, then you can just move on to reupholstering the footstool.If you have a wobbly leg due to a loose screw fitting, then you can just take a small piece of maple (a splint) and insert it into the screw hole. This should be enough to tighten the screw and stop the leg from wobbling.

, Remove any broken pieces that you find by loosening the staples or nails. You can use the broken pieces to trace and create new pieces. If you are not comfortable doing so, or if you don’t have power tools at your disposal, then may also consider taking the broken pieces to a hardware store to have new pieces made for you.To loosen a staple, insert your flat head screwdriver under the staple and push the handle downwards. This should lift the staple out and loosen it so that you can pull it out the rest of the way with your fingers.

, After you have created or purchased new pieces for your footstool, secure them back in place using a staple gun.You can also use a hammer and nails for this part if you prefer.


Make sure that you reattach the pieces in the correct order and locations.

, Sometimes you need to replace the fabric and padding when reupholstering a piece of furniture, but this is not always the case. To determine whether or not the fabric and/or padding needs to be replaced, take a moment to check.


If there are any tears, holes, stains, or other imperfections, then you may want to discard the fabric and choose some new fabric for your footstool. Make sure that you choose a nice, thick fabric to replace the old fabric. A thick fabric will be less likely to tear than a thin fabric, so it will last much longer.If the fabric has only minor damage that you can repair, such as by trimming the edges or sewing up a small tear, then go ahead and make any necessary repairs.
If the fabric was just ill-fitting, then you may not need to do anything at all to the fabric.
If the padding was insufficient, add some more padding or use all new padding to create a cushier footstool.

, Take your new (or old) padding and fabric and slip these materials back over the footstool. Adjust the padding and fabric as needed so that they are lined up as they should be. You can also tuck under the edges if they will be visible, such as on the edge of the footstool.If you notice any lumps or bumps, then remove the padding and fabric and smooth them out.
Keep in mind that the amount of fabric and padding you will need will depend on the size of your footstool. You may need anywhere from two to six yards.Measure the old fabric to be sure or purchase more than you think you will need.

, After you have the fabric and padding in place, turn the footstool upside down. Hold onto the fabric and then hammer in some tacks to secure the fabric in place. This will help to ensure that the fabric looks right before you fix it more tightly with your staple gun or hammer and nails.Place the tacks a few inches apart along the bottom of the footstool.
Make sure that each tack is going through the fabric and the padding.

, To complete your project, go over any other areas of the fabric that need to be secured with your staple gun. Make sure that you space the staples evenly.Securing the fabric in place again can be difficult, so you may want to ask a friend to help by holding the fabric in place while you secure it with your staple gun."

Identify what chairs you want to wrap.,
Determine what type of furniture covers you want.,
Use a tape measure, and measure the top of the first chair's back.,
Measure the distance from 1 end of the widest part of the back to the other.,
Record the chair's depth.,
Determine the leg spread or leg width of the chair.,
Compare your measurements to ready-made chair cover options available.,
Purchase the chair covers, and follow the manufacturer's instructions for installing them on your chairs.

",How to Measure Chair Covers," You need to know whether you are measuring chair covers for only one corner piece or an entire room.;
, Know what style and pattern you want to emulate so you know where to purchase the covers. You may also want to set an expected budget since some materials are more expensive than others.

, Extend the tape measure to the ground. This number is considered the height of the chair.

, This measurement is the chair's width.

, Run your tape measure from the chair's backrest to the front of the seat.

, Measure the distance from 1 of the back leg rests to the other.

, You can visit many home-decorating stores in-person or shop online to find the covers that best suit your needs. If you cannot locate covers that fulfill your sizing requirements, you can have the covers custom-made by a local tailor or online supply company.

Unzip your cushions.,
Add more stuffing your couch cushions.,
Zip them up again.",How to Fix Sagging Sofa Cushions1," Most sofa cushions, even cushions that are attached to the frame of the couch, have zippers that can be unzipped. Inside, you will see a couch cushion.


If your sofa cushions have no zippers, you could open the pillow with a thread cutter.;
, You should use either quilt batting or polyester fiberfill. Both polyester fiberfill and quilt batting can be purchased at a craft store or at a large store that sells home goods, like Walmart. Insert more foam, spreading it around to make it smooth and even. You can put it around the current couch cushion but inside the pillowcase. If it is badly worn, you may need to replace the foam.


If your cushions are filled with loose stuffing, stuff them with polyester fiberfill. You do not need to take any of the current stuffing out of the pillows. Use your hand to distribute it evenly.
If they are more like pillows, you can wrap them with quilt batting. Take the pillow out of the pillowcase and wrap it in the quilt batting. You can use an adhesive spray (purchased at a craft store) to secure the quilt batting to the current pillow.
If you have just a cushion inside the pillowcase, you can still add loose stuffing. Spread the polyester fiberfill evenly around the pillow to make sure that the pillow is not lumpy. When you stuff the cushions, use your hand to spread the stuffing evenly around.

, Put pillows back in the cushion covers and zip. Give them a good fluff and put them back on the couch. They should be plumper, more aesthetically pleasing, and more comfortable.If you opened your pillows with a thread cutter, you should sew the pillow back together again at the end of the stuffing process.

Clean the cabinetry thoroughly.,
Remove all hardware from cabinets.,
Prepare the area.,
Fill in any holes with a polyester wood or auto body filler, if necessary.,
Gather your supplies.",How to Paint Cabinets1," This is a very important step and must not be skipped or rushed. Cabinets are most commonly found in kitchens, which means moisture and grease are likely to have coated them. Any greasy or grimy build-up on cabinetry will make it impossible for paint to stick to its surface, so cleaning is essential. Wash cabinets thoroughly.


If you have access to a product called TSP (Tri-Sodium Phosphate), this can help you. Otherwise, use a suitable product or soap, ""elbow grease"" and water.
If there are some very oily/greasy buildups, try using a rag soaked in mineral spirits to remove these hard-to-shift spots.
Let your cabinets dry completely before doing anything else. A wet surface won't absorb paint or primer as well as a completely dry surface.;
, Hardware means all doors, mounting hardware, drawer pulls, and pull-out drawers. Remove these to protect them, being sure to label them methodically so that you know which hardwood and hardware fits where.


For the best results, you'll be painting the doors and drawers separately, not while mounted to the cabinets.
Of course, you should also remove all kitchen contents from the inside of the cabinets as well. If you've ever done any painting, you know that paint gets in the strangest places; removing all valuable and common contents from your cabinets before you paint them is always a good idea.

, Preparation is important for two reasons: You don't want any renegade paint splattering over areas it should not; you don't want to have to clean up a huge mess afterwards.


Attach masking tape to any areas that meet walls/borders etc. so that paint doesn't accidentally bleed onto these. This is especially important to allow you to get right to the edge of a cabinet — ensure that the masking tape fits tightly against the edge from the surface that you don't want painted.
Tape rosin paper over the countertops and tape plastic sheeting over the backsplash in between your countertop and cabinets.
Place newspaper or brown paper on the floor around the area you are working in. This will catch all paint spills and you only need to roll it up and throw it out when finished.
A canvas drop cloth also works really well, and it common for painting projects.



, If you want to relocate the hinges or drawers of your hardware, fill in the old screw holes. Mix the filler in small batches, as it dries quickly, and make sure to overfill the holes, as it shrinks when it dries. Sand it smooth once completely dried.

, Make sure that you have all the tools that will help you do the job.


Set up your brushes, rollers, trays, and paint in a central, easily accessible spot that you can reach with ease during the painting session.
Wear gloves if preferred; it saves your hands from paint coloring and if you might be allergic to any of the paint contents, the gloves will protect you.

Measure your chair.,
Pick out the fabric for your slipcover.,
Buy tracing paper.,
Outline of each section of the chair.,
Vacuum the chair.,
Cut out the patterns.,
Trace the patterns onto your fabric.,
Join the front and arm pieces.,
Join the back and front pieces.,
Join the seat and bottom pieces.,
Sew the skirt (if any) to the seat.,
Pull the new slipcover over the chair.",How to Slipcover a Chair1," To make a fabric slipcover that's tailored to the shape of your chair, you’ll need to begin by taking and writing down precise readings of the dimensions of the chair. Here's a checklist of the measurements you'll want to take:


Height of the back of the chair
Width of the back of the chair at its widest point
Thickness of the back of the chair
Distance from the top of the back to the seat
Length of the arms
Distance from the arms to the floor
Distance from the arms to the seat
Length of the seat
Width of the seat
Depth of the seat cushion
Distance from the floor to the lowest fabric edge (if you plan to include a skirt on your slipcover)
Distance around the bottom circumference of the chair (if you plan to include a skirt);
, Be sure to purchase enough fabric to fit your chair's measurements (plus a little extra for hemming and mistakes).


For maximum durability, choose a fairly sturdy fabric, like denim, thicker cotton/hemp blends, canvas, or twill.Fabric is sold in a wide variety of widths: 36 inches, 42 inches, 60 inches, and all the way up to widths over 100 inches. For slipcovers, it's best to buy one of the wider widths (60 inches or more) because the wider the fabric is, the less need you'll have to sew separate pieces of fabric together.
Some chairs are bigger than others, but as a very general rule, about four to six yards of a 60-inch-wide fabric should be enough for a standard armchair.

, You’ll need tracing paper in order to make the initial pattern for your slipcover. The most common types of paper used for pattern tracing are freezer paper, Swedish tracing paper, and medical exam table paper.


Freezer paper is relatively inexpensive and thick enough not to accidentally tear, though it’s also harder to see through.
Swedish tracing paper is easy to see through and doesn’t tend to tear accidentally, but it’s also relatively expensive.
Medical exam table paper is easy to see through and very inexpensive, but it’s also thinner and tends to wrinkle easily.

, It’s important to trace the pattern for each section of the chair onto tracing paper before attempting to assemble the slipcover. Without a clearly traced pattern, you’ll end up with an imprecise and ill-fitting cover.


Start by carefully drawing the back, front, seat, and arms of your chair on your tracing paper. Compare your tracings with the measurements initially you took for guidance.
If you plan to put a skirt on the chair, you can also draw a pattern for the skirt onto the tracing paper. You'll need a strip of fabric as long as the distance around the base of the chair and wide enough to hang from the bottom of the chair to the floor.

, Though the slipcover will eventually cover the chair completely, it's still important to clean the chair beforehand to remove any excess dirt and dust.


If you don't clean the chair before covering it, the chair can get musty after you’ve added the slipcover.

, After you’ve traced each section of the chair onto your tracing paper, begin cutting out each pattern. Leave a 1-inch margin around seams and a 2-inch margin around hems.This provides a seam allowance when sewing the pieces together.


Use a pair of scissors and/or an X-acto knife to cut out the paper patterns for your chair.
Be careful and take your time with this step--mistakes here can lead to imperfections in your slipcover.

, Begin by laying out your fabric with the wrong side facing upwards. Lay your paper shapes down so that they all fit on the fabric.


Carefully trace the edge of each piece, then cut the shapes with a pair of fabric scissors. There are many, many ways to mark your fabric without leaving a permanent mark; the most common include:Disappearing ink fabric pens/markers
Tailor's wax (essentially a crayon)
Washable colored pencils
Tailor's chalk
Tracing wheel
Sharpies, markers, etc. (use only lightly on the back side of reasonably thick fabrics)

, Once you have cut out each piece of fabric match them up and pin along the shared seams and sew the seams in place.


Pin and sew the cut-out for the front of the chair onto each of the arm cut-outs where they would naturally meet.

, Match up the back piece to the piece from the previous step (comprised of the front panel and arms) and pin in place. Then sew the pieces together along the seams you’ve marked.


When you're done, you should have a piece of baggy fabric that fits over the back and arms of your chair.

, Match the seat piece to what you’ve already assembled and pin along the seams. Sew the seams in place.


The rear edge of the seat should meet the ""back"" of the cutout, while the sides should meet the ""arm"" sleeves.

, Pin the strip of skirt material to the seat of the chair and sew it in place.


It should hang so that it is near the floor, but not pooled on it.
If possible, try to position the spot where the skirt material crosses over itself in the back of the slipcover where it won't be easily seen.

, Tuck the corners of the slipcover into the cushions and arms of the chair.


Gently sit down; your slipcover should feel comfortable and should conform easily to the weight of your body. If it doesn’t you may need to rip out and re-sew any seams that fit irregularly.

Remove the hardware.,
Give it a rough sanding.,
Repair the furniture.,
Go over it again with a fine sander.",How to Paint Furniture1," Use a power screwdriver or work by hand to remove knobs, handles, pulls, and any other hardware attached to the furniture. Place the hardware in labeled bags so you know the correct place for it later.









Consider taking a picture of the furniture before you remove the hardware, to help you find the correct place for each piece later.
Polish the hardware before you replace it, or consider buying new handles and knobs to match the new paint job.;
, Use a piece of medium-grit sandpaper or a power sander to sand the furniture on the top and all sides. This removes dirt, varnish, and residues from polishing and waxing compounds. Spend the same amount of time sanding each part of the furniture, so that one area doesn't get more worn down than the rest.





Sand with the grain, rather than against the grain. Sanding against the grain can leave permanent scratches on your furniture.
To sand curved surfaces, attach the sandpaper to a padded item, such as a rolled up sock.
Be careful sanding carved wood and turned legs. Sanding too hard could damage the design.

, If the furniture has cracks, gouges, or large scratches, now is the time to repair them. Painting over this type of damage will result in a sloppy-looking, uneven surface.









Use a wood-patching compound to fill in holes and cracks. These putty-like compounds spread smoothly over the surface of the wood and harden as they dry.
Don't attempt to sand away deep scratches. Pressing too hard with a sander will result in a dipped spot on your furniture.

, Use fine-grit sandpaper, emery cloth, or a fine sanding block to lightly sand the furniture one more time. This removes any remaining finish and evens the areas where the wood-patching compound overlaps the surface of the wood. When you're finished, wipe the surface of the furniture with a clean lint-free cloth to remove small wood particles and dust.

Unzip the cushion.,
Find a needle, thread, and four buttons.,
Refill the pillows.,
Zip the cushion.",How to Fix Sagging Sofa Cushions2," If the cushion does not unzip, open it with a thread cutter. Take out all of the stuffing inside the pillow and set it aside.

, Sew the four buttons onto the sofa cushions, two on the front and two on the back. Use the same piece of thread to sew on all four buttons, so that all four buttons are cinched by the thread.


You can also use more or fewer buttons depending on the size of the pillow. A throw pillow might require just two buttons, but a large sofa cushion might
Retrace the thread several times over. You want the cinching to be strong between the buttons so that it lasts a long time., Feel free to also add more polyester fiberfill or quilt matting if you desire. Make sure that the padding is evenly and thoroughly distributed inside the cushion.

, Sew it back together, if you used a thread cutter to open the cushion. Fluff the pillow and put it back on the sofa.

Put these supports underneath your couch cushions to give them more support and firmness., Measure the space underneath the sofa cushions and cut a piece of plywood to those dimensions. Place it underneath the cushions. You will feel more support underneath the cushions, and the couch should sag less., Flip the couch over and expose the springs underneath the couch. To repair the springs of your sofa, you will need to wear glasses and use a pair of pliers. If you see any springs that are bent out of place (i.e., they look different from the rest of the springs), bend them back with the pliers gently."

, The jute webbing of your couch is the bottom layer of upholstery. The springs press down on this layer and can make it worn and saggy with frequent use. If your couch is sagging because the bottom layer of upholstery is worn, you should bring your couch to an upholstery expert to repair it. Luckily, this problem is easy to fix for an upholsterer., If you don’t have the time or resources for any other solution, your sofa cushions will look more full and plump if you cover them with a thick blanket or piece of fabric. You can tuck it into the sides and back of the couch, too."

Sand with the grain of the cabinets using a 100-grit sandpaper.,
Prime.,
Patch any holes with spackle and tape any open seams with caulk.,
Spot prime any necessary areas and sand over again.",How to Paint Cabinets2," Use sandpaper, and do it by hand, as a hand sander won't be able to push the paper into the open grain. Hand sanders can also sand off too much grain and leave uneven surfaces.


Vacuum up the residue after going over the cabinets with the sandpaper. Any un-vacuumed or uncleaned residue will make its way into the final coat of paint — not a good thing.
Go over the vacuumed areas with a tack cloth, ensuring that all the residue has been wiped away. Unfold, and then crumble the tack cloth to grab more dust and residue.

, Priming is a very important step in painting cabinets, because raw wood may discolor or stain the paintwork if it has not been properly sealed. If you're priming on a tight-grained woods like maple or cherry, an oil- or shellac-based primer works fine. If you're priming on an open-grained wood like oak, you may need to use a thicker primer, such as brushing putty.


Start at the top of the cabinet and work your way down. Start off brushing against the grain and move back over the same spot, going with the grain.
Give the primer at least a day to dry.
Use a quality nylon-polyester brush to apply the primer. Understand that you may have to throw away your brush after each coat of primer, depending on the primer.
After the primer has dried, sand down any uneven surfaces using a random-orbit sander and 220-grit paper.

, Use vinyl spackle and a putty knife to fill any large holes, dents, dings, or scrapes. Go over open seams between wood with latex caulk, smoothing out the caulk with a dampened finger.

, If you've spackled any areas, or have had burn through on your primer, spot prime these areas with spray-on primer and let dry. Once the primer has dried, go over it with 280-grit paper, using a light motion. Vacuum and go over areas with tack cloth again.

Use brushes and/or rollers, depending on how much area you need to cover. Paint the edges of the cabinets first. Be careful to reach right into any finicky corners.


Use long, even strokes to prevent a mottled look. Be aware to remove any paint brush hairs or your own hairs that might fall onto the paintwork as you paint — they will cause unsightly ridges, and the paint will chip from these areas when knocked.

, Use a mini-roller to hit the inside of the cabinet, and wait for it to dry. Then go over the initial coat with a brand new brush, replacing the self hangers.

, This may mean contorting yourself a little bit, but it's worth it for achieving an overall even look.

, It is up to you where you feel most comfortable doing this; it might be on the floor over the drop cloth or perhaps resting on something else, such as a workbench. Paint one side of each door at a time (allow one side to dry before attempting the other).

, Professional contractors may hang the cabinets to dry, so that no contamination or rub-off occurs. It is often a good idea to wait for good daylight (even if this means waiting until the next day) to check that you haven't missed anything or have uneven patches of paintwork."

Select a sheet of material.,
Drape your fabric over the chair.,
Tuck the fabric into the folds of the chair.,
Trim off any excess material.",How to Slipcover a Chair2," Find a material in a pattern of your choice that’s large enough to completely cover your chair that reaches all the way to the floor.In general, a piece of fabric that's at least 6 x 9 feet should fit most chairs.A few fabric ideas that should work well for this project:
A canvas drop cloth (preferably not stained with paint, etc.)
An old bed sheet
An old quilt
Fabric purchased from a store (thicker cotton blends work well)

, When draping the fabric, arrange it such that the pattern of the material (if there is one) lays across the chair as you would like it to appear.


Lay your fabric over the top of the chair (with the center of the fabric lined up with the highest point on the chair) so that it covers the entire chair completely on all sides and drapes to the floor.

, Using your fingers, push the fabric into the various folds around the seat until it appears to hug the chair fairly snugly. Smooth out any unsightly folds or creases in the fabric itself as you go and create darts (folds made in the fabric that allow the fabric to lay flat) where needed to allow the fabric to lay smooth.


If desired, use fabric adhesive (available at most craft and fabric stores) to stick your slipcover in place. Doing so will hold your slipcover over the chair snugly and prevent it from falling, bunching, or slipping off.
Use the adhesive to adhere the rear of the new slipcover material to the top of the original chair fabric. You'll need to lift up the slipcover fabric and work underneath it to do this, so it can help to have a friend help you here by pointing out where to put adhesive.
Luckily, fabric adhesive is usually very forgiving before it sets. If you make a mistake, just pull the fabric up and reposition it as needed.
Different adhesive products will have different drying times, but, in general, most fabric glues take about two to four hours to set.Fabric adhesives can usually be washed safely after a few days. Check the product's label for more specific instructions.

, Once the adhesive has dried in place, you may carefully use pair of scissors or a fabric knife to trim the loose bottom portion of your slipcover.


Ideally, you want this ""skirt"" to hang an inch or two above the floor. Take care to cut in a straight line as you go.
If you make a noticeable mistake, just trim the slipcover back a few inches and glue a long, skinny strip of material around the bottom to make a new skirt.

Measure your chair.,
Go shopping for slipcovers.,
Vacuum the chair.,
Pull the slipcover over the chair.",How to Slipcover a Chair3," Using a measuring tape, measure the height, length and width of the chair as a whole.


Take these measurements carefully. If you're spending your hard-earned money on a slipcover, you will want it to fit well.

, Slipcovers are available at most stores and websites carrying home furniture and decorating items.


Most slipcovers range in price from about $20 to as much as $150, depending on the material of the slipcover and the size of the chair.
Have your measurements handy as you shop because most slipcovers will be advertised as fitting certain sizes of chair. If you're shopping at a brick and mortar store and need help choosing the right size slipcover, talk to an employee.
When in doubt, buy a slipcover slightly bigger than you think you'll need. You can always pull, sew, and trim a slipcover to make it smaller, but it's difficult to make a slipcover bigger.
For maximum durability, pick a slipcover made from a fairly sturdy fabric, like denim, thicker cotton/hemp blends, canvas, or twill., Before putting on the new slipcover, you'll want to remove any excess dirt and dust from your chair.


It’s also beneficial to periodically remove the slipcover and vacuum the chair again before replacing it to prevent the chair from getting musty underneath its cover.

, After pulling the slipcover on, go around the chair and tuck the fitted edges of the cover into folds around the seat.


Pull and tie any strings or ribbons on the front or back of the cover. These ties are added to keep the slipcover tight and secured in place.
Use a tight knot, but not one that's too tight to undo, as your slipcover may change size and shape slightly with repeated use and washing.

Paint the furniture with primer.,
Choose a type of paint.,
Paint the furniture.",How to Paint Furniture2," Applying primer to the surface of wooden furniture helps the paint stick and last for years to come. Choose a color a few shades lighter than the color you plan to paint your furniture.









Apply the primer evenly to the surface of the furniture using an angled paintbrush.
One coat of primer should be sufficient, but if there are areas of the furniture that don't look completely covered, go over it with a second coat.
Let the primer dry completely before applying paint.

, Most types of paint work fine on wooden furniture, so choose the type and color that will give your table, chair or cabinet the look you want to achieve. Consider the following options when you pick out your paint:









For an upscale, high-quality look, go for a paint with a glossy finish.
Eggshell or matte paint can give furniture a ""shabby chic"" look, perfect for a child's dresser or a bookshelf in your sunroom.

, Use a foam roller and a high-quality, angled paintbrush to paint the furniture evenly. All of your strokes should move in the same direction for a professional-looking finish.









It's not necessary to paint the inside of furniture drawers and dressers, since a coat of paint could cause the drawers to stick.
Depending on the type of paint you're using, you may want to paint more than one coat. Let the first coat dry completely before applying another one.

"
Consider adding a finish.,
Replace the hardware.",How to Paint Furniture3," Painted furniture can be left alone or finished with a seal, wax, or distressing technique to give it an antique look.




, After the paint has dried completely, use a power screwdriver or work by hand to replace the hardware.

Let's Prep!,
Taping!,
This is where it gets interesting...Open your paint, and take your mixing stick and mix the paint thoroughly!,
Now for the fun part!,
One last overcoat!,
Optional!",How to Paint a Fabric Chair," Before starting anything, we would recommend that you clean your couch or chair. Vacuum all the nooks and crannies, or you could even steam clean it! Pick a location for painting your couch or chair where dirt or high winds won't get to it. Once you’ve found a spot, grab your plastic cover and neatly place it on the ground, then place your couch or chair on top of it.;
, Take your painter's tape and cover all the trimming of the couch or chair. Cover anything and everything that you don't want paint on! *Optional: You can take your fabric softener (make sure you dilute it- 2 parts water to 3 parts softener) and pre-soften your couch or chair by 'painting' it on with a sponge. Make sure to let it fully dry before starting. Doing this will give it extra freshness and make it softer after the paint sets.

, Now you need to mix the paint and the textile medium. It took us about 64 ounces of paint and 32 ounces of textile medium for our chair, so estimate the amount you need accordingly. It’s supposed to be 1 part medium to 2 parts paint, so take the amount of medium you have, and add twice the amount of paint! There is a little bit of math involved, but that’s why you need to stay in school! Grab your painter's tray, pour in the right amounts of paint and medium, and mix well!

, Grab your rollers and start painting. See How to Use a Paint Roller. When you paint, you should have nice even strokes-very similar to painting a wall. You don’t want to dab too much paint onto one area, light strokes are the key! The fabric absorbs the paint very quickly, so don’t worry about the light areas, you will need to do a couple more coats once it’s dry.

, Once the paint is dry and the furniture's almost completely covered, go ahead and do one last coat of paint and medium. Make sure everything looks nice and smooth (this step doesn't require a lot of paint because it doesn't absorb so much). Once your furniture is completely dry, take your sandpaper and start sanding the rough areas to smooth it down and even it out. Then take a clothing iron and iron your couch or chair to set the textile medium; do not use steam,and keep the iron between low and medium. Don't let it linger in one spot too long!

, Take your fabric softener and your sponge and apply a light coat to all newly painted areas of your furniture, just to give the painted fabric some extra softness. It should feel just like fabric when you've finished. Once it's painted you can refinish the crowning of the chair or couch with wood stain to give it that brand new look. See How to Stain Wood. Wait for the fabric softener and/or the stain to dry and voilà ! You have successfully painted your piece of furniture!

Finish with a spray seal, such as polyurethane.",How to Ombre Paint a Dresser," Ombre painting simply means painting in a gradient, employing different shades of the same color to create the effect of fading. Before painting your dresser, decide if you want to create an ombre effect from top to bottom or from left to right.If your dresser has drawers stacked vertically, you can paint each drawer face a different color. This will make top-to-bottom ombre much easier.;
, When painting, decide whether you’d like to start with a lighter color and gradually move to a darker shade, or start with dark and move to light. You can use paint swatches to play around with direction before beginning.If you choose a vertical gradient and only paint your drawer faces instead of the entire dresser, you can mix and match light to dark and dark to light as the mood strikes you by switching the drawers around.

, You can either paint the entire dresser ombre, or you can choose a solid background color and paint the dresser drawers different shades. Although the choice is yours, the gradient will be cleaner if you paint different shades on drawers alone and having a single background color, such as white or gray.Although using a single background color is the most popular way to paint a dresser, you can mix paint colors to create a gradual color shift in the background, then have a more dramatic ombre effect using the drawers.

, Once you have decided on your preferred color and direction, purchase different shades of a single color of paint to correspond to your dresser. If you have five drawers, purchase five colors, etc.You could also create a few different shades by purchasing your preferred color and white and mixing the two in different ratios.

, Painting with both a brush and spray can is a messy affair, so lay drop cloths down wherever you decide to paint. Even if you are painting in your backyard, you’ll want to have a piece of fabric to catch any stray paint droplets.


If you opt for spray paint, you may also want to place drop cloths upright behind the dresser, or stand cardboard behind the surface., Most dresser drawers have at least one drawer pull, so be sure you remove all of these before you paint. Although you could paint around the pulls, you run the risk of spilling paint on them and ruining them. Removing the pulls will also help you get an even coat over the entire surface of the drawer or cabinet.This would be an excellent time to paint your drawer pulls if you’d like to alter them to better match your ombre colors.

, Even if your dresser has not been stained or painted previously, sand the area you are planning to paint. Paint cannot adhere to slick, smooth surfaces, so sanding will help toughen the surface a bit to help paint stick.If the surface of the dresser has not been painted or stained, this need not be a long process. Instead of using an electric sander, run a single piece of sandpaper over the dresser’s surface by hand once or twice.

, Sanding leaves behind a lot of residue, so be sure to thoroughly wipe the entire dresser down, including inside the drawers. Sawdust is infamous for getting caught in unwanted spaces and could easily make the paint clump as you go, resulting in an uneven finish.A damp cloth is enough to wipe everything down.

, Using long, consistent strokes, apply the first coat of paint. Allow the paint to dry before moving on to a second or third coat of paint. The more layers you paint, the darker your shade will be, so keep this in mind before you paint multiple coats.If you are painting the base white, you can begin there and move on to mixing colors next.

, To preserve the amount of brushes you need to use, finish with a single paint color before moving on to the next. Although this will require more time to complete, you will save money on brushes and will avoid having to go back over any areas after you’ve finished.This technique is particularly wise if you choose to mix white and one other color, as you could easily mix up your color shades.
Make sure you wash and dry your brushes thoroughly between colors to prevent running and splotchy color.

, If your brush dripped and you weren’t able to wipe the drip away quickly enough, or you didn’t see a drip until you’d finished, now is the time to sand down those areas and any still-rough areas or edges of the wood.


Make sure the paint has dried completely before you sand.Using a damp cloth, wipe the sanded area down again, touching up any areas rendered uneven by the sandpaper.

, Once you have completely finished painting, seal your paint job with a brush-applied sealant. There are some sealants specifically designed for furniture, if you’d like, but if your dresser will not be coming into contact with young children or animals, a simple coat of polyurethane will do.Sealing will help prevent fading, scratching, and scuffing, and will help your colors last longer.

, Spray paint is much thinner than paint you’d find inside of a tin, so holding the spray can closer could result in a blotchy, unattractive coat of paint. It could also make your paint drip.


As you paint, move your hand smoothly from side to side., Although spray paint typically dries faster than canned paint, you should still wait between coats to make sure each coat has completely dried. This will keep your color consistent and even, and will prevent the spotting effect frequently seen when using spray paint.Provided you are in a clean area, you can enlist the help of a fan to speed the drying process.

, As with canned paint, you must sand and wipe down any areas of the dresser with more heavily concentrated paint and wipe away the residue left behind. Thick drips are far less common with spray paint, but higher concentrations of paint (usually in a circular pattern) are common.After you sand, you might need to go back over the area.

, Unlike canned paint, you can move from one color to the next while you wait for colors to dry, as you will not need to share containers or brushes. Because spray paint dries faster than standard paint, you may be able to move through the painting process more quickly.


If you move back and forth between spray paint colors, make sure you paint on a different part of the drop cloth to avoid accidentally spraying the wrong color on your drawers.

, To keep the consistency of your paint, use a spray sealant rather than a tin of sealant. Many spray sealants are quite thick in texture, so a single coat of the sealant should do."

Repair any dents or marks.",How to Maintain Oak Furniture," Since wood furniture that you buy has probably been treated differently, it's important to read the manufacturer's maintenance instructions. Ask for a pamphlet with care instructions when you purchase your oak furniture.


If the furniture does not have any special instructions and has a light clear finish, follow general wood care recommendations.;
, If your new oak furniture has been recently oiled (especially on interior and back surfaces), it might have a strong odor. To minimize this, leave any drawers or doors open to help the smell dissipate. You might want to keep windows open or run an air purifier.


Furniture is often oiled before it is packed and shipped.
If the smell is strong, consider placing a bowl with baking soda, white vinegar, and activated charcoal near your furniture. This can absorb odors., If you're working with untreated oak furniture, you'll need to lightly sand the surface. This will smooth the furniture, ensuring that the stain goes on evenly. Take care to vacuum or wipe off all sawdust before staining. Apply your wood stain using a brush or a cloth dipped in stain. Let the stain rest before applying another coat (if you want a darker stain). There are several types of stains you can use with oak:Oil-based: This is a deep-penetrating stain that is permanent.
Water-based: This is easier on the environment and easier to clean up.
One-step stain and finish: This is a combination stain and finish.

, If the oak furniture has severe staining or you'd just like to change the look of the furniture, you may want to strip the wood. You'll need to determine what protective coverings are on the wood before you remove them. For example, if the furniture is covered in varnish, you'll need to apply varnish stripper according to the manufacturer's directions. You can then re-varnish or stain the furniture.


Test the stripper in a small inconspicuous spot before applying it to the whole piece of furniture.
Wear gloves to protect your hands. You may also want to wear old clothing when refinishing furniture.

, Oak is likely to absorb dirt if the surface is not sealed. Once you've applied stain, think about applying a finish. You can use a strong polyurethane (which is also available as a water-based poly) or a penetrating-oil finish which gives a beautiful finish. To use polyurethane, apply it in several thin coats, sanding between them. To use a penetrating-oil finish, apply the finish and let it soak in before wiping it off with a soft cloth.There are a variety of penetrating-oil finishes like Tung oil, Danish oil and Antique oil. These will need to be reapplied periodically (whenever the wood feels dry or looks dull).

, If the wood has been sealed and finished, you can simply wipe it down with a clean damp cloth. Take a soft dry cloth and buff out any moisture. If the wood hasn't been sealed, clean the wood using a gentle wood oil and then apply a moisturizing polish. To protect the wood, always use soft cotton cloths and consider wearing gloves while you work.


Avoid cleaning with common household cleaners, even if they're wood cleaners. Many household cleaners can leave behind a layer of oil that will buildup. Or, cleaners may strip your furniture over time., To maintain your furniture's shine and repel water, treat the wood with furniture oil, wax, or polish. Moisturize at least once a month to prevent cracking or more frequently (like once a week) if the furniture gets daily wear and tear. You may also want to oil a new or used piece of oak furniture that appears dry.


The dryness level in wood will equal the dryness of its surroundings after a few months. It does not need and cannot be ""replenished"" with lots of oil, although that can make the surface prettier. Rapid temperature and humidity changes always risk cracking, and oil buildup into unfinished surfaces can make wood abnormally flammable.

, Don't place oak furniture next to a source of heat or in direct sunlight. This can cause excessive dryness, difficult to fix cracks of body components, and color fading. If you must place the furniture right next to an air vent, close its louvers to reduce air flow (but don't close more than a small fraction of them all, as that could hurt the HVAC system.)


Keep your oak furniture inside. Unless specifically designed for outside use (such as regularly cleaned and oiled deck chairs), wooden furniture should always be used inside.

, Always clean spills and water off of oak furniture. Since oak is porous, it will easily soak up water. This can damage the finish and lead to staining. Wipe up spills with a clean dry cloth or paper towel.


The longer a spill sits, the deeper the spill can penetrate. This is why it's important to dry a spill as soon as you notice it.

, No matter how strong and sturdy oak furniture looks, always move it with care. To do so, lift it or gently push it with sliders and rollers. Carefully set it down to preserve the integrity of the joints. If a joint does come undone, it can usually be fixed with glue and a clamp.


Never drag furniture by it's legs or pull it across a room.

, Don't expose oak to strong cleaning agents, coffee, wine, water or other liquids. Modern finishes can generally be cleaned with a damp (not soggy), lightly soaped towel. Antique finishes can be more delicate, so test an inconspicuous area and wait a few minutes to see what happens before proceeding.


Avoid putting hot items such as dishes or pans directly on the wood. Instead, use trivets or heavy mats.

, You may be able to repair slight damages to oak furniture. You can use furniture markers and putties (available in a variety of colors) to fix small chips. To repair a mark or dent in unfinished furniture, try swelling the ding back out. Put a damp cotton cloth over the spot and place the tip of a warm iron onto the cloth so the wood rises up. Once the blemish is dry, sand it down with a fine-grain sandpaper, then oil it.


Furniture oil tends to darken light dings in overall hard finishes. Use the ""natural"" yellowish kind for a medium brown color. If you need nearly-black, try dark furniture oil. Don't soak too much oil into a waxy-type finish since it can really stain.
Some putties harden while others stay soft and removable. For penetrating fixes start with lighter tones.

, You might find that this requires steel wool pads, some abrasive cleaner, the kind used for sinks and bathtubs and lots of elbow grease.


Many nice vintage, even antique and ornate hinges have been found under layers of paint.

, Once the hinges have been cleaned, rub them with a medium-grit sandpaper to prepare them for the paint. This is termed ""priming"" and will ensure that old paint, grime build-up and rough surfaces are removed. Wipe with a tack cloth after sanding to clean off the sanding dust.

, Decide on the color––do you want to use a metallic paint that mimics the original metal or do you want to paint the hinge the same color as the cabinet or a complementary one?


Do not use latex paint as it will affect the movement of the hinge.
Spray paint is easier and faster than using a paintbrush and paint, but the choice is up to you.
Get some clear metal primer. Placing this on the hinges first will help ensure that the paint stays intact.

, Line a work surface with newspaper or another cover.

, Paint at least two layers to ensure an even coating. If spraying, keep moving the spray nozzle to ensure that it does not layer too thickly in any one spot.

This needs to be a well-ventilated place, dry, with temperatures between 45°F and 85°F (7°C and 29°C).
It should be fairly dust and insect free and where children and pets won’t disturb the bed frame as the paint dries.
There should be something in the area where parts can be propped against as you paint them and as they to dry. You could use a sawhorse, ladder or an old chair for this. You could also tape a drop cloth to a wall and lean the bed frame against that.;
, As you work, pay attention to how the frame was assembled so you can re-assemble it correctly. Store the nuts and bolts and other small hardware in a secure container.

, Pay attention to corners, and crevices in designs. Make sure all the dirt is scrubbed off.

, Push this brush along the surface of the chair, following the direction of the grain. This method is known as ""raking out"" and is done to remove loose soft wood. It will also drag up any dust trapped inside the grooves of the wood.


Try to use a good quality brush for this, to avoid leaving deep cuts in the wood.

, This will smooth it out nicely.

, Either use a brush attachment on the end of a vacuum cleaner or use a damp cloth and run it over the chair. Ensure that the chair is dry before you start lime washing.

, This will protect your skin.

, Rub the wax into the wood. This time you can rub both with and against the grain of the wood.

, This should take about half an hour, although it's a good idea to read the instructions accompanying the liming wax too.

, Rub over the chair where you've added the liming wax. This will lift off all surface liming wax. What will be left behind will be the liming wax stuck in all the grooves of the wood, showing up the grain of the wood. It's a really lovely effect, so enjoy your efforts!

Identify the type of leather that your furniture is made from.,
Call the manufacturer of your leather furniture when you notice a scratch.,
Assess the type of scratch.",How to Repair Scratches on Leather Furniture1," You can do this with a close inspection of the furniture piece. Since different types of leather are repaired differently, it’s important to begin by identifying your furniture’s leather type. The three types of leather used to make furniture are: “pigmented” (or “finished”) leather, “aniline” leather, and “bicast” leather.Most leather furniture (about 85%) is made from finished leather. This leather has a durable surface that resists scratching, and does not absorb liquids.
Aniline leather is made from very high-quality leather, and so aniline furniture is rare. Aniline leather does not have a surface coating, so the texture of the leather can be seen. Companies also produce semi-aniline leather, which is still made of high-quality leather, but are covered in a thin layer of coating.Bicast leather is technically a leather byproduct, although furniture made with bicast is still considered leather furniture. Bicast leather is made from inferior-quality leather, which is split into a thin layer, and then laminated to a polyurethane top layer.;
, Many manufacturers have specific ways they recommend to fix or repair their pieces of furniture. Sometimes they will even send you a free or discounted repair kit. If you do not have any luck with this step, proceed on to the next step.


The repair procedure that the manufacturer may recommend will be directly related to the leather type.

, Leather furniture can be scratched with different levels of severity. While a minor scratch will be easy to fix, a deeper tear in the leather is more serious and will require different procedures. You can determine how seriously your furniture has been scratched with a quick visual assessment.If the scratch is minor, only the coating of the leather will have been scratched, and the underlying leather itself will be intact.
Deeper scratches mean that the leather itself has been cut. You may be able to see leather fibers around the fringe of the cut.
If the leather has been completely cut through, you may even be able to see the inner stuffing of the furniture. At this point, you will not be able to fully patch the scratch on your own, and you’ll need to take the furniture to a professional.

Obtain some paste wax and steel wool.,
Apply the paste wax across the entire wood surface.,
Allow the wax to dry onto the wood furniture.,
Buff the paste wax into the wood.",How to Touch Up Scratches on Furniture2," If you have a wood surface that is covered in many small scratches, you can touch them up using paste wax, which is sometimes sold as ""finishing wax."" The wax is best applied using No. 0000 steel wool.

, Place a small dab of the wax onto the steel wool and apply it in smooth, circular motions. Aim to apply as thin a layer of wax as possible to avoid a finished appearance that is hazy or splotchy.

, After applying the wax, give it about 30 minutes to dry. Longer times may be required in cold or humid rooms.

, Use a soft cloth to buff the wood surface, removing excess wax and lending a lustrous sheen to the wood. The small surface scratches will be filled in with the wax and will be minimized in appearance.

"
"
Purchase a wax stick.,
Run the wax stick along the gouge.,
Remove the excess wax from the scratch.",How to Touch Up Scratches on Furniture3," Wax sticks can be purchased at hardware stores, where they are sold for use in patching deep scratches and gouges in wood furniture. They are often available in multiple shades, so you should try to match the wax stick to the wood's existing finish.

, Applying firm pressure, run the wax stick lengthwise along the deep scratch. As you do this, the scratch should fill in with wax. You may need to make several passes for very deep or awkwardly shaped gouges.

, When the cut is completely filled with wax, drag a putty knife (or the edge of a credit card) across the surface of the wood to remove any wax that is sitting above the surface. Allow the wax to dry and then buff it with a soft cloth.

Prepare a scratch removal compound.,
Rub the compound into the scratched glass.,
Wash away the scratch removal compound.",How to Touch Up Scratches on Furniture4," You can minimize the appearance of scratches in glass tabletops or cabinet doors by buffing a scratch removal compound into them. Make this compound by mixing together 2 tablespoons (30 ml) each of jeweler's rouge (can be purchased from a jeweler), glycerin (can be purchase from a pharmacy), and tap water. Stir these ingredients together in a small bowl.

, Use a soft cloth to gently rub the compound over the scratch using smooth, circular motions. Do this for about 30 seconds, and then allow the compound to dry into the scratch for another 30 seconds.

, You can wash the compound away using mild soap and water. Note that the scratch will begin to reappear in the glass after about 6 months, after which you can reapply the compound if desired.

"
"
Purchase a set of touch-up markers.,
Color in the scratch with the marker.,
Buff the color in with a soft cloth.",How to Touch Up Scratches on Furniture5," Small scratches in laminate furniture can be easily minimized by using specially designed touch-up markers. These markers are often packaged along with laminate furniture, but you can also find them at hardware stores and office supply stores that sell laminate office furniture. They are often sold in sets, but you should try to match the marker's color to your wood tone if you can purchase the markers individually.

, Use the touch-up marker in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Usually this will involve simply rubbing the marker's tip along the scratch a few times to fill it in.

, After some of the marker's ink has been deposited into the scratch, rub the area gently with a soft, clean cloth. This will help blend the color into the surrounding wood and will remove any excess ink.

"
"
Rub olive oil, baby oil or saddle oil into the scratch.,
Apply lanolin oil to the scratch.,
Use a heat source and a damp cloth to bring out the leather oil.,
Apply shoe polish to the scratched area.",How to Repair Scratches on Leather Furniture2," Use a cotton-swab applicator (such as a cotton ball or a Q-tip) for the procedure. After applying the oil directly to the scratch, rub it into the surrounding leather with a circular motion. Allow the oil to dry for an hour, then wipe it off with a clean cloth. If the scratch has not repaired itself after the first application of oil, try applying more oil, and let it sit for several hours.
As with all steps, test this in an inconspicuous area first as oil may absorb into the leather causing it to stain/darken.

, Find a clean cloth, such as a cotton rag, and dip the cloth in lanolin cream. Rub the cloth over the scratched area, perpendicular to the direction of the cut. This will smooth and repair the scratch, although it may take several re-applications before the scratch becomes invisible.Test the lanolin oil on a seldom-seen section of leather, as the oil may darken the color of the material.

, Before proceeding with this step, it is critical to be aware of your leather type. This process will only work on aniline leather types, as well as on bicast leather. To heat the leather, hold a hair dryer very close to the cloth, or press a warm iron against a damp cloth laid over the scratch.If you’re applying heat from a hair dryer, use your hands to massage the leather around the scratch. The heat should bring out the natural oil and dyes in the leather. If it does, the scratch may heal itself as a result.
If you’re using an iron and damp cloth, hold the iron on for 10 seconds. Remove it, and look at the scratch. If it seems to have disappeared, dry off the leather and prepare to use as normal. If the scratch is still there, repeat the step with the iron once more.
Avoid burning the leather. If it is uncomfortably hot to the touch, let the leather cool off before you re-apply any heat., Find a shade of shoe polish that matches your furniture.First, apply the shoe polish to the scratches with a clean cloth or a cotton-swab applicator. Then rub the shoe polish into the leather and, with a clean cloth, rub the scratch quickly to buff it.


This process will not heal the scratches, but it may help to disguise them.
If the color needs to be darker, repeat with another coat. If the color does not match your furniture once you have applied it, use a damp rag to wash it off immediately.
This process will be successful with more heavily pigmented leather (and also bicast leather), since shoe polish is not generally designed for use on furniture-grade leather.

"
"
Clean the area with rubbing alcohol.,
Sand or clip loose fibers around the edges of the cut.,
Apply leather heavy filler to the scratched area.,
Apply the correct shade of leather colorant.,
Apply a leather finish to the colored area.",How to Repair Scratches on Leather Furniture3," Deep scratches in leather furniture may be scuffed and dirty, so before you attempt to repair the area, make sure it’s clean first. Take a clean cloth and dip it in rubbing alcohol, then lightly buff the scratched area.








Rubbing alcohol dries quickly. Let the area sit for about 10 minutes, and it should be dry.
This method works most effectively with finished leather. If you have a deep cut in aniline leather, it may be irreparable.

, Unlike with a minor scratch, if your leather furniture is deeply scratched, the leather may be uneven, scuffed, or torn around the fringe of the scratch. Take a pair of scissors, and clip away any loose threads so that the area around the cut is smooth.








Alternately, take a piece of fine-grit sandpaper (around 1200 grit) and sand the area surrounding the cut until it’s smooth., Called “filler” for short, this material has the consistency of putty and will fill the gaps or cracks in the scratched section of your furniture. Using your finger or a small spatula, cover the scratch with heavy filler, until the scratched surface is even with the rest of the furniture’s surface.Once you have applied the heavy filler, let it dry for about 30 minutes.









Once the filler has been applied, take another sheet of 1200 grit sandpaper and smooth the surface of the filler.
Leather heavy filler should be available at your local hardware store, or at a leather-goods store. Additionally, the furniture manufacturer may sell bonder or filler, or even send you some for free.

, Now that the scratch has been sealed and covered with heavy filler, you’ll need to color the material to match the rest of the furniture piece. Apply the colorant to a sponge, and dab it evenly across the area covered by the heavy filler.








Apply as many coats as necessary to match the color of the furniture, but remember to let each coat dry before applying a new one.
To purchase leather colorant, you’ll likely need to visit a leather-goods store or a furniture store that specializes in leather.

, This will seal and protect the dyed heavy filler, and should prevent the same area from being scratched again. Pour a small amount of the finish onto a sponge or clean cloth, and then lightly rub onto the scratched area of your furniture.








Apply up to 3 or 4 coats for a consistent finish.
As for the leather colorant, you’ll probably need to purchase the leather finish at leather-goods store or a furniture store that specializes in leather. You may be able to purchase the heavy filler, colorant, and finish all together in a leather-repair set.

Choose furniture made of wood with high tannic acid content.,
Make the iron solution.,
Sand the furniture.,
Mix the bark tea solution.,
Apply the bark tea solution.,
Apply the iron solution.,
Apply a second coat of bark tea solution.,
Wash the furniture.",How to Ebonize Furniture," The wood ebonizing process depends on the chemical interaction between the tannic acid in the wood and iron oxide. For this reason, wood such as oak or walnut, both of which are high in tannic acid, work best for ebonizing.


If woods high in tannic acid aren't feasible for a project, you can wash on a strong black tea to increase the tannic acid.;
, This process usually takes about a week, so get started early.


Wash a piece of steel wool thoroughly in soap and water to remove all of the oil from the steel wool. Any remaining oil will interfere with the necessary chemical reactions, so be sure to get the steel wool very clean.
Drop the steel wool into a plastic bottle of white vinegar and seal the cap tightly.
Drill a small hole in the bottle cap. Gasses are released during the process of dissolving the steel wool and the bottle could burst if there is not a small hole to allow the pressure to equalize.
Wait for the steel wool to completely dissolve. You should plan for this process to take a week, but the solution can sit for several months before you use it.
Strain the solution through a coffee filter to remove any impurities. You can then pour it back into the jug.

, You can perform this step any time while you are waiting for the iron solution to be ready. Be thorough. If you must sand the furniture after you ebonize it, you will have to begin the ebonizing process in that area again because you will sand off the finish.

, You can prepare this solution immediately before beginning the staining process. Dissolve 1 heaping tsp. of bark powder into a pint (0.473 l) of hot water and stir.

, Using a small paint brush, apply the bark tea liberally to the wood. Use enough of the solution that the wood is completely soaked and the reaction takes place in the wood. Although you want the wood to be completely soaked, be sure to use a paper towel to clean up any of the solution that has pooled on top of the wood.

, Wait for the wood to still be damp with the bark tea, but not wet. Using smooth brush strokes, apply the solution to the wood. The wood should start to blacken immediately.

, Let the wood dry for a few hours so it is no longer damp to the touch. Use a clean rag to polish the surface and remove any iron deposits, and then brush on the second coat of bark tea solution as though you were painting the furniture.

, Use clean water to lightly wash the furniture. If you find imperfections, sand them down and perform the ebonizing process to that area again.

Turn the iron to low and rub it slowly over the fabric for a short period of time. Then lift the cloth to see if the stain has disappeared. If it hasn't, replace the cloth and repeat.Make sure the iron is set to no steam.
Act as quickly as possible. Dry as much of the table surface as you can before you begin.
Wipe away any moisture or water on the surface each time you remove the iron.White rings are caused by steam or liquid. The white color means they have only penetrated the wax or finish, which means they will be much easier to clean than a darker stain.;
, Buy a fine steel wool pad. Soak the pad in lemon oil. Very gently, rub the wool over the white ring. Then, rub over the stain with a cloth dabbed with denatured alcohol.The lemon oil is a lubricant and helps prevent the wood from scratching.

, Place toothpaste on your finger or a cloth. Rub the toothpaste with the grain of the wood until it heats. Dampen a cloth with water and then wipe away the toothpaste. Dry the water.Make sure the toothpaste you use is white and non-gel.You don't need a lot of toothpaste. Just a small dab will work.
Don't scrub too long. Try not to scrub outside of the stain area. This might wear the finish and top layer of wood.Repeat until the stains are gone.

, Take a blow dryer and turn it on high. Hold it close to the stain. The stain should start disappearing as the dryer dries the moisture. Make sure to move the dryer back and forth over the area.This will probably take 10-30 minutes.
Put a little olive oil on the wood afterwards to moisturize it., Products with oil, like mayonnaise, butter, and petroleum jelly, help seep into the wood and break up the moisture.Place the mayonnaise or petroleum jelly on the stain. Leave for an hour up to overnight.


Make sure to put more mayonnaise on the stain if it dries out.
To add some abrasive stain removing power, mix cigarette ashes with the mayonnaise or petroleum jelly., Mix baking soda with either toothpaste or water to remove the stain. If using water, mix 2 parts baking soda with 1 part water. Use a rag to gently scrub the stain.If using baking soda with toothpaste, mix equal parts together. Rub over the stain with a rag.

Before making any further attempts to remove your shower head, evaluate the fixture to determine why it is stuck:


Search for signs of rust—is there an orange or copper colored ring around the shower head’s connection to the shower arm?
Search for signs of mineral build-up—is there a white ring around the the shower head’s attachment to the shower arm?
If there are no signs of rust or mineral build-up, it is likely that your shower head is attached too tightly.;
, Typically, if you are removing your shower head by hand, it is not necessary to turn off the water. Removing a stuck shower head, however, presents more challenges and risks. Therefore, it is advised that you shut off the water source. The water valves may be located in one of two places:









Under the bathroom sink.
In the basement directly below the tub., Throughout this process, you will work with tools and chemicals that could damage your shower or tub. To prevent damage, cover the floor of your shower or tub with a thick work blanket. You will also handle small bits and pieces. To prevent the loss of parts, stuff a cloth down the drain.







, Often, you can rely on simple tools, such as wrenches or pliers, to loosen your stuck shower head. When one method does not work, try the next method.









Cover the fixture’s connector or plumbing nut with an old cloth to protect the metal.
Grip the connector or nut with a wrench or pair of locking pliers.
First, turn the wrench or pliers clockwise in an attempt to break the rust or mineral deposits.
Turn the tool counterclockwise to loosen and remove the shower head., Treating the rust and mineral build-up with chemicals may loosen the connector or nut.









Read the instructions on the bottle of rust, calcium, and lime remover. Apply the product as instructed.
Allow the product to sit for the allotted time.
Scrub off the product with a wire brush, removing the rust, calcium, and lime in the process.
Wipe the shower head and shower arm clean., Penetrating lubricants, like WD-40 and Liquid Wrench, can work wonders on a stuck shower head.









Apply one coat of the penetrating lubricant to the connector or nut. Allow it to sit for two hours.
Apply a second coat of the penetrating lubricant to the connector or nut. Allow it to sit for two hours.
Cover the connector or nut with a cloth.
Grip the fixture or nut with a wrench and attempt to loosen the shower head., Once you have removed the shower head, thoroughly clean the fixture to remove any rust or mineral buildup.


Place the shower head in a small basin.
Pour white distilled vinegar into the basin until the shower head is completely submerged.
Allow the shower head to soak over night.
Rise the shower head by running it under cold tap water., Following the vinegar bath, examine the shower head for signs of rust or mineral-build up. If rust or mineral build-up is visible, apply a rust, calcium, and lime remover to the shower head.After allow the product to sit for the allotted time, use a wire brush to scrub off the product.








Always follow the instructions listed on the product.

, Never re-attach a shower head to an uncleaned shower arm.









Peel off the old plumber’s tape from the shower arm’s treads. Use a wire brush or an exacto-knife if needed.
If rust or mineral build-up is visible, apply a rust, calcium, and lime remover to the shower head.
Allow the product to sit for the allotted time.
Use a wire brush to remove the product and scrub off the rust, calcium, and lime.
Use an old rag to wipe the shower arm clean., Applying plumber’s tape, or teflon tape, to the threads of the shower arm prevents leaks.








Wrap the shower arm’s threads with 2 to 3 layers of plumber’s tape in a clockwise pattern.
Press the tape between the threads., Once the shower arm is prepared, you may attach your shower head. You may choose to reuse your old shower head or purchase a new fixture. There are several fixtures to choose from:









Attach a fixed-mounted shower head. This is your basic shower head. Place the shower head onto the threads of the shower arm. Use your hands to turn in a clockwise direction to tighten the fixture.
Attach a hand-held shower head. This shower head is attached to a hose.

Place the shower mount onto the shower arm. Tighten the shower mount with your hands.
Connect one end of the hose to the shower mount and the other end to the shower head.Tighten the connectors by hand.
Place the shower head in the shower mount.



, Once you have installed your shower head, turn on your shower’s water supply. Turn on the facet and check for leaks. Tighten your shower head’s connectors until the leak has subsided.









Add more plumber’s tape if needed."

Clean the tub or shower area with a bathroom surface cleaner that also removes soap scum.,
Strip the existing caulk from the tub or shower area.,
Scrub the joints where the caulk had previously been with rubbing alcohol.,
Vacuum out any pieces of caulk that may have gotten stuck between the tile and the tub or shower pan.

,
Spray on a 10% bleach to 90% water solution that will kill mold and mildew that may have grown when water got into the loose caulk joints.,
Allow the tub or shower area to dry at least overnight.,

,
Smooth your finger over the fresh bead of caulk to press it evenly into the joint.,
Apply an additional small amount of caulk to any places that seem a little thin and seem to need a little extra caulk.

,
Allow the caulk to set and dry for 24 hours, then drain water when completely dry.",How to Recaulk a Bathtub," It is important that all surfaces you may be dealing with be clean and free of any substance that would come between the surface and the new caulk.;
,


Using a sharp knife, decide what kind of caulk is already in your tub or shower area. When you cut into the caulk, if it is soft and rubbery it is most likely silicone based; however, if the caulk is hard and crumbly then it is most likely water based, latex or PVA.
Determine the best manner of removal based on caulk type. Silicone based caulk may be removed using a razor blade scraper with a plastic handle, and the other types are removed best when warmed using an ever-moving hair dryer on a low heat temperature and then scraped using the tool.

, This will help to get rid of any remaining bits and pieces of caulk left after the scraping.

,, Let this sit and take effect against the mold and mildew for at least 5 minutes before scrubbing down with fresh, clean water.

, You do not want the dampness that crept into the joints when the previous caulk was loose, or the dampness that resulted from the cleaning you have just done, to impact the ability of your new caulk to adhere and stay in place.

, PVA and acrylic latex are best with ceramic fixtures that meet tile because the caulk is hard and easily removed in the long run. Silicone based caulk is best with fiberglass fixtures meeting tile or other fiberglass surrounds because the caulk is relatively soft when it dries.

, Make sure not to make the hole in the tip too large because that will control how much caulk comes out at once, and a smaller tip will help your caulking to be a success.


Some people say to half fill the tub with water before caulking, and keep drain plugged so water remains until caulk is completely dry, in 24 hours. This allows for the flexing that happens when the tub is used after the caulk is dry.
Others argue that this may just add potential moisture in the area that can effect the caulking and so the tub should be empty. A properly installed tub moves very little so which ever method you are comfortable with will work.

,, Your finger should capture any excess caulk which you can wipe off on a damp sponge.

Turn off the water supply to your shower head.,
Remove the shower head faceplate or the entire shower head.,
Immerse the faceplate or shower head in white vinegar for 8 hours.,
Manually remove leftover deposits.,
Check to see if the leaking shower head is fixed.",How to Fix a Leaking Shower Head1," At first you can just turn the shower off at the knob if you are just replacing the head or inspecting it. A leaking shower head can be caused by clogged holes, resulting from lime and other mineral deposits that build up in the holes over time. If you’re unsure what could be causing your leaking shower head, start here. It’s a simple, cheap fix that doesn’t require you to take apart your entire shower fixture. Shut off your water supply before you get started.


You can do this in one of two ways: locate and turn off the shutoff valve to the bathroom or turn off the main water line.
It will probably be easier on your household to turn off the water supply directly to the bathroom instead of cutting off the supply to the entire house.
While not all homes have a shutoff valve to the bathroom, if there is one it can usually be found somewhere near the shower or in the basement.;
, Because you’ll have to soak and scrub the parts of the shower head that have the lime and mineral deposit buildup, you’ll have to remove it from the rest the shower fixture.


Unscrew just the faceplate, if you can. If you can’t, then remove the entire shower head from the fixture. How you go about doing this depends on the make and model of your shower head.
In a typical disassembly, look for screws surrounding the shower head faceplate or the shower head itself to undo. Once the screws are undone, twist counterclockwise or pull the faceplate or shower head to remove.

, Purchase or obtain a container large enough to hold the faceplate or shower head. If you have more than one bathroom that you and/or your family can utilize, you could otherwise use the bathroom sink, if it’s large enough.


Fill your container or sink with white vinegar with some coarse salt. The amount of vinegar you use should be enough to fully cover the faceplate or shower head.
Set a timer for 8 hours, or calculate 8 hours from the time you set the faceplate or shower head in the vinegar. While it’s soaking, the vinegar will work to dissolve the buildup and deposits.

, After 8 hours, the lime and other mineral deposits have dissolved. Now you’ll need to remove it. First find a toothpick or a nail small enough to fit in the shower head holes. Stick the toothpick or nail into each hole of the faceplate to remove the debris. Then scrub the faceplate clean with a stiff plastic brush.


You can also use an air compressor to gently blow out debris.

, To determine if unclogging the shower head holes has fixed your leaking shower head, attach the faceplate or shower head back in place. Turn back on the water supply to the shower head, and ensure the faucet is turned off. If you no longer notice a leak, then you’ve solved your problem. If your shower head is still leaking, then consider another possible reason for the leak.

Turn off the water supply to your shower.,
Determine which rubber washer needs to be replaced.,
Replace the rubber washer in your shower head.,
Replace the rubber washer in your faucet.,
Reassemble the shower parts and check to see if the problem’s fixed.",How to Fix a Leaking Shower Head2," A leaking shower head can also be caused by a worn out rubber washer. Over time the washer, or “O ring,” starts to crack. Water seeps through those cracks, resulting in a leaking shower head. Replacing this washer will solve the problem. Shut off the water supply to your bathroom, which you can find either near your shower or in your basement, if you have one.


O rings should be maintained by applying lubricant.
If your shower faucet is a compression faucet, meaning it has two faucet handles to separately control the cold and hot water, you’ll need to feel the water leaking from your shower head to determine if the leak is coming from the cold-water valve or the hot-water valve.This will let you know which faucet you’ll have to work on.

, You can either replace the rubber washer in your shower head or in your shower faucet. The type of shower faucet you have will help to determine which rubber washer needs to be replaced. If you have a compression faucet, also referred to as a two-handle faucet, then you’ll likely need to replace the rubber washer that’s inside the faucet. If you have a single-handle faucet, then it’s likely the rubber washer located inside of the shower head is the one that needs to be replaced.

, To replace the rubber washer in your shower head, start off by taking the shower head apart. While different brands of shower heads are built differently, there should be a collar nut attached to the shower arm. The collar nut looks like a regular metal nut, but it extends lengthwise. It has a neck, or rather a collar, that’s typically about 1.5 times it’s diameter.Protect the fixture with a rag and, using a wrench, loosen that collar nut to separate the shower head from the shower arm. Once removed, look beneath the shower head’s swivel ball to find the rubber washer.
The swivel ball is a metal fixture that attaches directly to the shower head, and is what allows the shower head to move around. Look for a metal fixture that somewhat resembles a large nut with a metal ball on the end. If you can rotate it like you would a shower head, then you’ve found the swivel ball.
When you locate the rubber washer, pull it off, and then replace it with a new rubber washer of similar size and style. To ensure that the new washer works properly, it should look practically identical to the old washer. Be careful to get a washer of the same thickness as this could lead to leaking over time.

, Disassemble the appropriate faucet handle by unscrewing it. (The temperature of the leaking water should let you know whether you should be working on the hot or cold faucet handle.)


Depending on the style of your faucet this screw may be in plain sight or hidden behind a cover cap. If your faucet is an older model, look for the screw to be exposed on either the front or side of your faucet. If it’s newer, use a tiny pocket knife to lift the cover cap to expose the screw.
Once the screw is removed, pull the handle hard to pull it off of the faucet body. You may need a faucet puller to do this, if you’re unable to do it by hand. Once the handle is off, remove the trim and sleeve that covers the faucet stem. Then use a deep socket to unscrew the faucet stem. The faucet stem is held down by a hex nut, so you’ll need to use the deep socket to unscrew the hex nut. The hex nut is simply a nut with six sides. A shower valve socket wrench is made specifically for this.
Now you can replace the rubber washer. If you’ve purchased the faucet washer kit, you can also replace the flat washer at the end of the stem and the seals.

, If you changed the rubber washer in your shower head, connect the shower head back onto the shower arm, and turn back on your water supply to confirm whether the leak has been fixed or not. Be sure you just screw the shower head on snugly and do not over tighten.


If you changed the rubber washer in the shower faucet, then begin putting your shower faucet back together starting with the faucet stem. Use a little bit of plumber’s grease on the threads where the stem will go, then screw the stem back on. Put the handle back in place, but don’t screw it on until you’ve confirmed the leaking shower head is fixed, which you can test by cutting your water supply back on.

Unscrew and remove the faucet handle to expose the diverter valve.,
Take out the diverter valve.,
Clean the diverter valve or replace it.,
Reassemble the faucet handle and determine if the leaking shower head is fixed.",How to Fix a Leaking Shower Head3," A diverter valve allows the water to switch from the bathtub faucet to the shower head. Over time, this valve can weaken and become clogged by sediment buildup. A malfunctioning diverter valve will leak even when water should be flowing through the bathtub faucet. You can fix a diverter valve by cleaning it, but it is usually better to just replace it. Start by shutting off the water supply either through the valve to the bathroom or through your home’s main supply.

, Locate the screw to your faucet handle, which should either already be exposed or which may be hidden under a cap. You can remove the cap using a tiny pocket knife.








, To remove the diverter valve, you’ll have to separate the valve assembly from the hex nut on the faucet stem by unscrewing it. If you have difficulty unscrewing the valve, wrap a vinegar soaked rag around the components for a short period to break up any limescale build up. WD-40 may also help to remove buildup.

, With the diverter valve free, you can now clean it using a small stiff wire brush and white vinegar. Once you’ve removed all sediment buildup, check the valve for wear and tear. If you don’t see any, let the valve sit out to dry. If you see cracks throughout the diverter valve, replace the valve assembly.

, Reverse the previous steps to reassemble the faucet handle. Before you screw it back on, turn on the water supply to see if the leaking shower head is now fixed.

Turn off the water supply to your shower.,
Remove the faucet handle and expose the cartridge stem.,
Remove and replace the cartridge.,
Reassemble the faucet handle and check to see if the leaking shower head is fixed.",How to Fix a Leaking Shower Head4," In a one-handle shower faucet, a malfunctioning cartridge valve could be the reason for your leaking shower head. If the less-intrusive solutions to fixing your leak problem haven’t worked, then you may need to replace your faucet’s cartridge valve.Before you begin, shut off the water supply to your shower, either by shutting off the valve supplying water to your bathroom directly or by turning off the main supply of water throughout your house.

, Locate and loosen the faucet handle screw, which may be exposed or located beneath a cap on the handle. Once the screw is removed, you can pull off the handle.


Pulling off the handle may be difficult if the handle is pretty set. And if it is, try warming the handle with a hair dryer if you have one. If you don’t have a hair dryer at your disposal, or if the hair dryer simply isn’t working, head to your local hardware store to purchase a handle puller.
Once the handle is off, remove the stop tube, unscrew the cartridge retaining clip using a small screwdriver or awl (hold onto it well, it tends to spring off), and then remove the handle washer. You should then be able to see the cartridge stem.

, The method you’ll use to remove the cartridge will differ by manufacturer. There may even be a cartridge removal cap with the new cartridge you’ve purchased. In a typical removal, you’ll want to first unscrew the hex nut that covers the cartridge stem. Untwist the cartridge stem and then remove it with pliers.









If the pliers aren’t working, you’ll need to use a cartridge puller. Fit the puller over the cartridge stem and twist to unscrew it gently. Once it’s loose, use pliers to remove it.
Insert the new cartridge in its place, and screw it in. The new cartridge should be identical to the old one.

, Reverse the steps used to disassemble the faucet handle. Once everything is back in place, but before the handle has been fully screwed on, turn back on the water supply to the shower to make certain your shower head is no longer leaking.

If you know what you need, you can purchase replacement parts before you start the project. If not, then you should wait until you have removed the old parts and take them with you to the hardware store so you can match the new components exactly. Many shower components come pre-packaged as a set so you are sure to have everything you need, including new faucet handles. There are 3 styles of shower faucets available:


Single-handled shower faucets have a tee connection to both hot and cold water supplies and control water temperature and water flow with just 1 handle.
Double-handled shower faucets have 1 control for hot water and 1 control for cold water.
3-handled shower faucets work the same as the double handled faucets but have an additional handle for the bathtub. In this application, the third handle controls the strength of the water flow and determines whether the water goes to the tub or the shower.;
, Aside from the replacement parts or the new faucet, the following tools and materials are needed to complete this project:


Adjustable pliers
A large adjustable wrench or pipe wrench
Teflon tape (often called plumber’s tape)
Screwdrivers (Phillips and flat head)
A pan or container to catch any water remaining in pipes
Towels or rags for wiping up small puddles and drips
A box or container for discarded components
Safety goggles and gloves

, Locate the shut-off valve for the appropriate bathroom and turn the water off. Most homes have shut-offs in place for individual bathrooms as well as one for the kitchen so you should not need to shut off the water supply for the whole house.


If you are on a city water system, the shut-off valve should be located at the water meter. If your home is on a private well, you will need to find your pressure tank. Newer tanks are usually blue in color while older tanks may be any color.
Typically, the shut-off valve itself is located on the main outlet pipe near the tank. To close this valve at either source, turn it clockwise until closed. This will immediately stop water flow to the house. Once you have shut off the water supply, open the shower faucet valves to release remaining water from the pipes and ensure that the water is indeed off.

, If you're going to be cutting through the tiles or wall, it's important to drop some cloth to protect the bathtub. Make sure the shower area is clean and dry, then use a painter’s drop cloth or other protective covering on the shower floor and tub surface to protect it from scratches and chips.

, Use a flat-headed screwdriver to pry up the small caps on each of the handles. These caps are usually marked with a “C” or “H”. Under the cap will be a screw to release the handles.


Remove the retaining screws then remove the handles by pulling them off the valve stems. If the screws are rusted, it may take a little extra effort to loosen the screws. If necessary, use penetrating oil to help break through the rust.

, To remove the old spout, twist counterclockwise gently and pull towards you at the same time. There may be a small screw that will require removal before you can take it off. You may find that pliers or a pipe wrench are helpful when removing old fixtures. Use what tools work best for you.


On some faucets, the diverter handle will have an arrow on it. Use a flat head screwdriver or a butter knife or something similar to pry the cap from the handle to reveal the retaining screw. Before removing the retaining screw, you'll need to open the valve completely by turning the handle counterclockwise. This keeps the valve from turning while removing the screw.

, On most two-handle and three-handle faucets, there are chrome flanges about three inches long. Firmly grasp the flange and remove it by turning it counterclockwise. There is a white nylon threaded sleeve that may not come off as you remove the flange. If this happens, simply grasp the sleeve with your hand or a pair of pliers and turn it counterclockwise to remove it.


Single-handled faucets have a large round plate that is attached either with caulking or with screws. After removing the handle, remove the plate by removing the screws or by cutting the caulking with a utility knife. Then pull the plate from the wall.

, These should have a hex-shaped base near the wall and you can use an adjustable wrench or adjustable pliers to remove them. Turn them counterclockwise until they come loose. Once removed, use a damp cloth or an old toothbrush to remove debris from the threads of the water inlet pipes.

, If you're installing a brand new faucet, you need to measure and mark the spots where you will be installing shower faucets and a shower head. Shower faucets are typically installed at a height of 45 to 48 inches (114.3 to 121.9 cm) and shower head height 72 to 78 inches (1.83 to 1.98 m).


After making your measurements, drill holes using tile drill-bits of the appropriate size, depending on the size of your shower components, and remove enough of the wall to access the pipe for proper installation.
After making cuts, clean the shower walls with bleach water or white vinegar water. Do not mix bleach and vinegar, as it can release a noxious gas. Do not allow water to drip behind the wall. If it does, dry thoroughly before installing the new fixtures.

, Take all of the new valve assemblies and open them fully before installing them. Do this by turning the stems counterclockwise. Each valve needs to be opened when it's installed to allow it to seat fully on the pipe components. Be sure to identify the diverter valve and set it aside to install it last.


The process of installing a new faucet will be essential the reverse process of your disassembly. If you purchased an identical or similar kit to the version you removed, it should be quite easy.

, Take the roll of plumber’s tape and peel the end back a couple of inches. With the new valve in one hand, hold the threaded base pointing to your other hand. Place the loose end of the plumber’s tape over the threads and secure it with your thumb, then wrap tightly around the threads clockwise for three complete wraps. Pull tightly against the threads until the tape breaks. Roll the loose end over the taped threads. Done correctly, the tape will contour to the threads.


Repeat this process for all the new valve components. Taping the valves allows a tighter seal to be creating, ensuring a solid faucet that won't leak.

, Place the new valve into the pipe and turn clockwise with your fingers about three or four complete turns. There should be some resistance after that because of the plumber’s tape.


If the valve does not seat in the threaded pipe within the first turn or two, start again. Do not force an improperly seated valve. It will strip the threads and cause a serious leak. Repeat this step for all valves.
Completely tighten the valves with adjustable pliers or an adjustable wrench. Do not over-tighten or you risk damaging the valve or the water pipes

, Take the threaded white nylon sleeve, slip it over each valve stem, and twist it into threaded interior of the valve base. Do not use pliers or a pipe wrench, as this will damage the threads. Wrap a cloth rag around the sleeve and grip tightly with your hand and twist it into place.

, Take the chrome flange and twist it onto the nylon sleeve until the base of the flange is snug against the shower wall. Place the new faucet handle over the notched tip of the valve stem. Hold the handle firmly and insert and tighten the retaining screw. Do not over tighten to avoid stripping the threads. Turn the handle clockwise to close the valve and place the handle in the shut-off position. Repeat these steps for each of the valves.

, Insert the covers so “H” is on the left side, “C” is on the right side, and the arrow on the diverter cap is pointing down.

, Caulk the fixtures where they touch the walls using a silicon caulk, and allow to dry. In general, you shouldn't use a freshly caulked shower for at least 24 hours.

, Turn on your water supply and check that everything works properly. Do not be surprised by some initial sputtering of the water when you test your shower faucets. The water pressure is simply forcing air out of the line. The sputtering should stop within a few seconds.

If none of the first things seem to be causing the problem, look for swelling (bulging). There may even be moisture present. And consider the humidity levels of the room the drawer is in––anywhere near showers, baths, cooking areas, etc. are likely to have higher humidity than other parts of the house. Or, if you're in a humid climate or season, the entire house may be humid, which will affect your furniture.;

Soap up the wood.",How to Fix Sticky Drawers2," Using very basic soap, (one without moisturizers or oils), soap the wood of the sticky drawers on the sides, slides and bottom side rails. This solution works very well most of the time. In the kitchen and bathrooms, however, where moisture is more common, the soap solution will only help for a very short period of time. This method is best for the doors and windows all across the house.

Clean the drawers first.,
Spray the drawers with a silicone-based lubricant.,
Clean up!",How to Fix Sticky Drawers3," Wipe them down with a damp cloth, and try to remove all dust. (If you've been using the soap method, use a putty knife to remove the built-up soap.)

, Like the soap, this is not permanent. The lubricant will, however, last longer, and it won't build up as much as the soap will.

, This is extremely important if you use the silicone-based lubricant. If you accidentally sprayed anything other than the drawers with the lubricant, clean it up as soon as possible! It will make the floors very slippery, and if you do not clean it up quickly, it will be nearly impossible to get out. (If you don't trust yourself with the spray, put newspaper down before you spray anything at all.)

You may also need a hair dryer., You will need access to the pipes for the next hour or so. Tell family members or tenants that they will not have water during this time.








, This will drain any remaining water in the pipes.








, Pop the handle insert off with a small pocket knife or flat head screwdriver. The handle insert is the center of the handle and the part that usually says “hot” and “cold.”








, Over time, handles can corrode and weld the faucet on. Use a hand dryer to heat the handle and loosen it.









Don’t use too much force or it can break. Call a plumber if your handle breaks or will not come off.

, The trim is the decorative piece that fits around the outside of the faucet, generally just behind the handle, while the collar is generally a tubular piece that fits around the internal faucet parts. They should unscrew fairly easily. You can use a hair dryer to loosen them as well.









Repeat for the other handle if your tub has two.

, You will need to reconnect them in a similar fashion when you are done fixing the faucet.

, These are sometimes also called “cartridges.” Insert a bath socket wrench and turn it counterclockwise.









If you are unable to find a bath socket wrench, you can use a vice grip to hold onto the stem bonnet and loosen it., It has an elongated end so that you can stick it deep into the seat and turn it counterclockwise to remove the seat. The seat is the back portion of the faucet that extends into the pipe.








, Look at the parts you have just removed. You must find the part to replace. The best way to ensure you will fix the leak is to fix all the wearable parts on both hot and cold faucet valves., Take your old parts to a hardware store or home center. Since there are thousands of replacement parts available, bringing your old parts with you will ensure you purchase the correct replacements. In some cases, the parts may need to be purchased from a plumbing supplies distributor.

, You can replace the washers or the entire stem and bonnet portion of the faucet.Grease each new part with plumber’s grease before screwing it back on.








, Unscrew the seat washer screw at the back of the seat. Peel off the rubber seat washer. Replace the seat washer screw and the seat washer after greasing them.









Screw the seat back into place with the seat wrench. Tighten it with your hand. It should be tightly sealed but easy to remove by hand.

, Remove the bonnet washer from the end of the bonnet. Grease it and replace it on the bonnet.








, Remove the packing nut in the middle of the stem bonnet. Pry the rubber-packing washer from the nut with a flat-headed screwdriver. Grease the stem threads on the front of the stem and insert it into the bonnet.








, Grease your new packing washer and place it in front of the greased packing nut.








, Apply some pipe joint compound to the threads in your bonnet. Insert the bonnet and tighten it with your bath socket wrench or vice grip.








, Repeat on the other side to replace parts in the opposite handle.








, If you spring a new leak, you may want to call a plumber.

Obtain a plumbers snake.,
Push the snake or wire into the bowl and if possible, grab onto the object and try to pull it up and out.,
If the above doesn't work, you'll have to remove the toilet.,
Shut the water supply off to the toilet; there should be a shut-off valve under or behind the toilet where the water supply for the toilet exits the wall/floor.,
Flush the toilet to drain the tank.,

Please take extreme care while handling caustic soda.,
Do this at night; that way, hopefully nobody will need to use the toilet and you can leave the toilet to clear overnight.

,
Pour about 3 to 4 liters (0.8 to 1.1 US gal) of water in a plastic bucket.,
The water will heat up during mixing and will generate fumes.,
Once mixed, slowly pour the solution into an empty toilet bowl.,
Again mix caustic soda and water as described above for the second time.,
In the morning, pour a couple of buckets of hot steaming water into the toilet from about waist length.",How to Unblock a Toilet when You Have No Plunger4," You will require about 3 kilograms of caustic soda, a plastic bucket, a plastic pipe or any long plastic object to help stir, rubber/plastic gloves, goggles for your own safety and protection.


Never pour caustic soda directly into the toilet. Caustic soda crystals can solidify inside the toilet pipes creating a bigger block. So it is essential to mix caustic soda in water first before using the solution to unblock your clogged toilet.

,, Cover your nose with a piece of cloth, slowly add about 1 kg of caustic soda into the water very slowly. Stir the mixture slowly.









Make sure the room is well ventilated and do not inhale the fumes.
Get away from the room if it is taking longer to mix water and caustic soda.
Always add caustic soda to water, do not do it the other way. Do not add water to caustic soda, as the exothermic reaction between water and caustic soda will make the water boil quickly.

, Do not touch the mixture with bare hands as it will be highly corrosive. If a drop of the mixture falls on your skin, wash it with lots of water.

, Cover the toilet seat and get away from the toilet for about 45 minutes.








, and slowly pour it into the toilet and leave it overnight.








, By now the toilet will be able to flush out quickly. If not, mix water and caustic soda again as described above and pour it into the empty toilet. Wait for couple of hours and pour hot water into the toilet.

Place the end of the snake into the toilet.,
Turn the crank handle clockwise.,
Feel around for the clog in the pipes.,
Break up or pull out as much of the clog as you can.,
Cover the floor around the toilet.,
Wear gloves.,
Have a trash bag or other receptacle ready.,
Flush the pipes with toilet cleaner.,
Only put water-soluble items in the toilet.,
Reduce the amount of toilet paper you use.,
Identify the problem early.,
Keep the toilet and pipes clean.",How to Snake a Toilet," Unfurl the snake and lower the bulbous metal end into the toilet bowl. Begin the feeding the snake into the mouth of the drain. At the end of the snake is a curved hook, which will help break up and grab debris that has accumulated in the pipes.;
, Once the snake is in position, start steadily rotating the handle on the opposite end. This will extend the snake and force its length slowly through the pipes. Plumbing snakes are constructed with flexible metal coils, so it will be able to bend and follow the contours of the pipes as it is unwound.Unclogging a toilet with a snake is as simple as turning the crank a few times.

, If you notice the snake slowing down or coming to a stop, it may have encountered resistance. Jostle the shaft slightly to help the snake loosen up whatever is stuck deep in the pipes. Continue turning the handle in a clockwise direction until the snake clears the pipe.Don’t be rough with the shaft of the snake or try to draw out the clog by force. Just keep winding and unwinding and let it wear down the clog on its own.

, After you locate and work over the clog, rotate the handle in the opposite direction (counterclockwise) to retract the snake and examine what it has collected. Always pull out the clog rather than trying force it deeper into the pipe. Repeat this process until the pipe is completely unobstructed.Pushing the clog further in may end up making the problem worse, as eventually it can get so deep that you can no longer reach it.Always make sure to sanitize your snake after each use. This can be accomplished by rinsing the snake off outside with a garden hose. You can also leave the end of the snake in the toilet for a few flushes after you've added toilet bowl cleaner., Lay down a couple of towels or a sheet of plastic to protect the floor. It’s possible that water may splash out of the toilet bowl as the snake works on the clog. This water will often become dingy as whatever is causing the clog disintegrates and leeches back through the pipes. Covering the floor can keep you from having to deal with a second mess later on.If you’re using a towel, wash it immediately after you’re finished and wipe down the floor beneath with a disinfecting solution.

, Things are likely to get messy, so pull on a pair of rubber gloves to provide a barrier between your bare skin and whatever muck you may find on the other end of the snake. Toilets are full of germs, and if you don’t take proper care to protect your hands and keep them clean, the result may be illness and infection. Throw the gloves away when you’re finished and wash your hands for a full minute with antibacterial soap and hot water.Debris that is snagged on the end of the snake will have to be removed by hand.
Don’t forget to roll up your shirtsleeves as you work to get them out of the way.

, You’ve managed to pull out the clog that’s been blocking the pipe, but now what do you do with it? Rather than trying to flush it again and risk creating a new problem, have a trash bag or bucket on hand that you can put the icky clog material into. That way, you can simply drop the bag in the garbage or give the bucket a good rinse and carry on with your day.A plastic grocery bag makes a perfect means of disposal. After you drop the offending clog inside, tie off the bag and chuck it in the trash.

, Once the job is finished, plunge the toilet a few times to get rid of any remnants of the clog. Then, pour some concentrated toilet bowl cleaner into the toilet and give it a couple flushes. The chemicals in toilet cleaning solutions are potent enough to dissolve and whisk away whatever residual debris remains in the pipes. As an added bonus, your latrine will be sparkly clean, sanitized and ready for use afterwards.Only use cleaners that are intended for toilets. Regular drain cleaners can eat through galvanized plumbing pipes and wreak havoc on septic systems.A homemade declogging solution made from vinegar and baking soda can also work wonders on clearing out your pipes after they've been snaked. Simply pour about a cup of baking soda into the bowl, add two cups of vinegar (gradually, so that the mixture doesn't bubble over into the floor), wait ten minutes and flush., Before putting anything in the toilet, make sure that it’s meant to be there. The list of things it’s okay to flush down the commode is pretty short: in most cases, human waste and toilet paper only. Never try to get rid of paper towels, Kleenex tissues, makeup pads, tampons, condoms, cardboard, hair or any other materials that aren’t easily dissolved by flushing them. You’ll just be setting yourself up for inconvenience (and possibly expensive plumbing repairs) later on.Toys are a leading culprit of clogs in households with small children. If you have kids, keep the door to your bathroom shut and make sure they know that it’s not a good place to play.
If you’re not sure whether or not a certain item is safe to flush down the toilet, chances are it isn’t.

, Most clogs are caused by a buildup of excess toilet paper that gets stuck in the pipes before it has time to completely break down. Be aware of the amount of toilet paper you flush on a regular basis, and see that you only use as much as you need. If you have multiple bathrooms in your home, try using a different one from time to time so that one toilet’s plumbing isn’t constantly getting overworked.Be conservative. There’s no need to use half a roll of paper every time you wipe.If you often find yourself troubled with clogs, consider switching to single ply toilet paper. It may not be as comfortable or absorbing, but it breaks down much faster after it’s flushed.

, The best way to prevent a clog is to take note when you suspect one might be building up. If the water level in your toilet seems low, or it has trouble flushing or refills slowly, there may be an obstruction throttling the water flow somewhere. Use a plunger to dislodge clogs before they get bad enough that you have to break out the snake.Look for bubbles in the water in the toilet bowl and keep an ear out for rattling in the pipes. These could also be signs of blockage.
Snaking should be reserved for stubborn clogs. Plunging, cleaning and not putting anything in the toilet that doesn’t belong there should be your first defenses. If you’re careful, you’ll rarely find yourself in a situation that requires the use of an auger.

, Make sure that you’re cleaning your potty at least once or twice a month. Use chemicals specifically formulated for use in toilets and pay attention to any signs that suggest a clog might be forming. As has already been mentioned, chemical cleaners can help melt down stubborn clots of toilet paper and other gunk that’s become lodged in the pipes. Besides that, it will keep the place where you do your business fresh and pleasant.Cleaning your toilet’s water jets ensures that it’s flushing at full power, which will help knock out potential messes caught in the plumbing."

Choose a non-abrasive cleaning solution.,
Spray the product onto shower stains.,
Let the cleaner sit for 5-10 minutes.,
Rinse and wipe out the shower.",How to Clean an Acrylic Shower1," Acrylic is a soft, malleable finish, which means it can easily be scratched or marked up if you’re not careful. To prevent doing lasting damage to your shower, pick out a product that doesn’t contain any harsh chemicals or astringents. Your best bet is to use a mild acid-based solution like Lysol Power Bathroom Cleaner, Formula 409 All-Purpose cleaner or Bar Keeper’s Friend.Stay away from any type of astringent cleanser, including Comet, Ajax and Scrubbing Bubbles, as well as solvents like acetone.
Whenever possible, using natural derivatives to clean your bathroom will be your safest choice.;
, Apply the cleaner liberally to areas where grime, soap scum and hard water stains have accumulated. Focus on spots that suffer from visible dirt or discoloration. You may need to use quite a bit of cleaner in order to penetrate multiple layers of dried-on residue.


Be sure to remove all soaps, shampoos and other hygiene products from the shower before you get started so that you can clean underneath them.
Pull back the shower curtain all the way and turn on the overhead fan to keep the bathroom properly ventilated while you clean.

, After a few minutes, the dingy messes that have built up on the surface of your acrylic shower will begin to dissolve. This will allow you to wipe them away with ease.If you’re dealing with particularly heavy soap scum or stains, it may help to reapply the cleaner once or twice.
Use this time to take care of any other cleaning tasks you need to complete, like detailing the faucet or shower head.

, Turn on the shower head and direct the flow of water over the areas of the acrylic you just sprayed. Wash away as much liquefied grime and cleaning solution as you can. Once you’ve given the shower a preliminary rinse, go over the acrylic with using a soft microfiber towel or sponge to remove any remaining residue.Never use abrasive scrubbers, such as wire brushes or rough kitchen sponges, to clean an acrylic surface. These will leave behind tiny scratches in the finish that will then trap dirt in the future, making it much harder to remove."

Mix together vinegar and water.,
Treat problem areas with the vinegar solution.,
Leave the vinegar to break down stains.,
Scrub the acrylic with a soft cloth.",How to Clean an Acrylic Shower2," Ordinary vinegar makes a versatile cleaning solution that’s both safe and all-natural. Combine equal parts distilled white vinegar and warm water in a small spray bottle. Shake the bottle to make sure the two liquids are thoroughly blended.The heat from the water will be even more helpful for releasing dried stains from the surface of the shower.
For even better results, add a few drops of mild liquid dishwashing detergent. The soap will emulsify dirt and oil while the vinegar brightens and disinfects., Mist the inside shower with the vinegar solution. Be sure to address spots with the worst buildup. This may include unexpected places like the shelving at the top of the shower or the area around the drain.Don’t forget to get inside cracks and crevices and along recessed panels and soap dishes.
Pure vinegar makes the perfect antidote to mold and mildew growth., Vinegar is an effective natural solvent, but it requires a little time to work effectively. For most light or moderate messes, the vinegar should sit for at least half an hour. To remove heavier buildup, you may even want to let it remain for 1-2 hours to ensure success.If vinegar alone isn’t cutting it, sprinkle a little baking soda over the affected area before spraying it again. The foaming action produced by the two cleaners will eat away at stubborn gunk and grime.A mixture of hydrogen peroxide and cream of tartar can make a convenient substitute for baking soda and vinegar., Use a clean, dry washcloth, microfiber towel or sponge to erase any last traces of loose residue. Wipe with gentle circular motions and apply pressure where needed to break up tough stains. Afterwards, rinse the interior of the shower with hot water.Dig into hard-to-reach spots with your fingertips or the corner of a sponge.

Slice a large lemon in half.,
Rub the lemon directly onto the surface of the shower.,
Allow the lemon juice to sit for 10-20 minutes.,
Rinse the shower clean.",How to Clean an Acrylic Shower3," With a little creative application, a single lemon can serve as both cleaning solution and sponge. Cut the lemon down the middle widthwise. You can now grip it by the peel-side and use it as a handheld scrubber to treat yucky shower stains.Pick out the seeds before you start scrubbing so they don’t end up at the bottom of your shower.
The natural acids in lemon juice are safe enough for you to use them to clean your shower as often as you’d like without having to worry about wearing down the acrylic finish.
You may also have success using another type of citrus, such as grapefruit., Work the exposed fruit over the acrylic surface. As you press the lemon into the acrylic, the juice will gradually squeeze out, breaking up hard water stains, mold and mineral deposits.After you’ve worn the lemon down, simply grab the other half or cut a new one and keep going over the area until it’s spotless.
Just as a precaution, avoid using lemon in conjunction with other green cleaning ingredients like sea salt. Even water-soluble abrasives may be enough to scratch up acrylic.

, Once you’ve given the shower a thorough scrubbing, give the lemon juice a little time to work its magic. Though mild, the acids that the juice contains will usually be enough to deal with the majority of commonplace stains. The longer you let the juice soak, the better the end result will be.Lemon juice is especially useful for dissolving stains that result from exposure to hard water or chemicals.
Citric acid will not only clean and disinfect, it will also help brighten up the acrylic and restore it to its original luster., Flush every surface of the shower with warm water, taking care to get rid of any lingering juice or pulp from the lemon. If necessary, go back over the acrylic one more time with a soft towel or sponge. When you’re done, your shower should be pristine and have a fresh, clean scent!"

Install a tempering valve to the toilet to increase the temperature of the water coming into the tank.,
Invest in a tempering tank.",How to Stop Toilet Tank Sweating," Purchase a premade tank cover or use a piece of fabric to wrap around the toilet tank. Terry cloth, or towel material, is a commonly chosen fabric for this application. The fabric will absorb any condensation that accumulates on the outside of the tank.;
, Place a fan near the toilet, or turn on the bathroom's vent fan to dry out any condensation that forms on the toilet as well as to reduce excess moisture in the air. The moving air will better dry out condensation on toilets that have adequate space between the tank and the wall. If the air has no room to circulate behind and around the tank, it will not be able to evaporate the perspiration. You can also employ a dehumidifier to do the job; however, keep in mind that a bathroom is a moisture-rich environment and the machine may run constantly.

, Turn on your air conditioner to lower the temperature of the air around the toilet to be closer to the temperature of the water in the toilet's tank. This will minimize the condensation-creating action of warm air outside the tank reacting with the cold tank.

, This valve is attached to the cold water line going into the toilet and allows for the connection of a hot water line. This increases the temperature of the water going into the tank, decreasing the difference between the tank and outside air temperatures, thus reducing toilet tank condensation. The intake of hot water can also be shut off when tempering is not needed.

, Working in a similar fashion as the tempering valve, the water in the toilet tank is brought to a more equivalent temperature to the air outside the tank by tempering the water in a separate holding tank first.

Make sure the lid is on securely.,
Get to know the parts of your toilet.,
Wait for the noise to occur.,
Know when to hire a professional.",How to Repair a Noisy Toilet1," A heavy toilet lid can damper a lot of sound if it is placed on the toilet tank correctly. Thus, if the lid of your toilet is not completely in place, you may hear more noises than normal. Wiggle the lid around a bit to make sure it is seated properly.


Before troubleshooting for a more severe problem, making sure that the lid is in place can save you a lot of time and headache.;
, A toilet has a variety of parts that could be causing the noise. In order to figure out what the problem is, you will need to familiarize yourself with the basic internal parts of a toilet. Inside the tank of your toilet there is a:Flapper: The flapper is connected to the toilet handle so that when you flush the toilet, the flapper is lifted. This releases the water in the tank.
Float: The float can come in a variety of forms, usually a float ball or a float cup. It responds to the water level in the tank. When the water has filled back up in the tank, the float lifts high enough to switch off the water coming through the fill valve.
Fill valve: Also sometimes called a flush valve, this valve is responsible for allowing water into the tank. It is turned on and off by the position of the float.

, In order to find a problem, it is usually necessary for that problem to be occurring. Don't assume that a problem will be immediately evident even when it is not actively happening.


Take the cover off the tank so that you can hear any sounds coming from inside it. This is an area that noises often come from.
It may take some time and patience, but wait until the noise is happening to sleuth out the problem.

, Many small problems with a toilet can be fixed by you easily. However, depending on your skill level, there are some times when a professional plumber can be of great use. If you have tried your best to fix a problem but you just can't figure it out, call a plumber to come help you out.


Don't think of hiring a plumber as a failure on your part. Plumbers are actually skilled workers who have spent a lot of time building up their expertise. Why not hire an expert?

Make sure the toilet is not leaky.,
Check to make sure that the water rises to the water mark.,
Listen for a whistling noise or self-flushing sound.",How to Replace a Flush Valve," Before beginning any installation, shut off the water source leading to your toilet or the toilet will flood the bathroom.


The valve is usually located on the pipes running into your toilet from the wall.
Shut off the water by turning the valve clockwise until you feel resistance.;
, Flushing the toilet will drain most of the remaining water from the toilet, allowing you to access the its internal parts more easily.


This will also prevent any remaining water from spilling out of the toilet and all over the floor.
Soak up any remaining water with a sponge and bucket.

, Next, look at the bottom of the toilet and find the one hose attached to it, the supply hose, and remove it. Then, remove the nuts and bolts from the hose with your adjustable wrench, and lift up the tank.


Lift up the tank carefully, and it will come off the bottom portion of the toilet.
Turn the tank upside down, resting it on the toilet seat.

, Locate the thick, conical rubber gasket and remove it. Underneath the gasket you’ll see a large plastic nut. Loosen and remove the plastic nut to remove the flush valve.


Start to loosen the nut by turning it counterclockwise with your pliers.
The flush valve will come right off.
Undo the clip (looks like a paper clip) attaching the hose by pushing it off. This clip connects the flush valve to the filler valve.

, Use 409 or a similar cleaning product and Clorox with bleach to clean the surfaces that touch the flush valve.


This will prevent any debris or residue from interfering with the flush valve's seal, ensuring that you do not get leaks.
Use a rag and cleaning product.

, The new valve will go in the same way the old valve came out. Push the new valve through the bottom of the tank. Take the valve with the threaded side up and slowly direct it through the hole so your hand is in the tank. Be careful not to attach it too tightly, or it might cause the tank to crack.Make sure the black tube, extending from the top of the new valve, is one inch below the toilet lever or handle on the left side of the toilet tank.
Cut the tube to the correct height, before putting the hose back on. The manufacturer's instructions will specify what that height is. For example, with a Fluidmaster 507A/B/D flush valve, you'll want to cut the overflow pipe so it's at least one inch below the hole in the tank where the flush lever is mounted., Once the flush valve is in the hole, attach a new thick rubber gasket (the same type as you removed). Then, hold the valve steady and replace the attaching nut, screwing it tight with your hands.

, Replace the hose, attaching it to the black plastic tube extending from the top of the flush valve.

, Turn the toilet tank right side up, and put it back on the toilet carefully, in order to avoid damaging any of your recently installed parts.


Put the old nuts back on to make the tank sits snug on the toilet.
If you have purchased a toilet kit, use the new screws it includes.

,, The supply hose located on the bottom of the toilet tank should be reattached to the toilet at this point, to restore water flow. It has a plastic nut on the end with threads.


Connect it to the filler valve (looks like a little white tube) by threading the nut and bolt by hand.
Then, use a wrench to tighten the nut a quarter of a turn. Do not overtighten.

, Flush the toilet a few times to check for potential leaks that may have developed. If the toilet has a leak, it will leak immediately.


Get under the toilet with a flashlight and see if the toilet is dripping.
Identify where the leak is coming from. Generally, water could be coming from the supply line or from a leaky gasket.
Shut off the water to check over the conical gasket and the supply line attachment.
Inspect and tighten the connections to address leaks.

, The water level should usually line up with the water mark on the inside of the toilet bowl. If water does not rise to the right level in the toilet, adjust the filler valve.


You can adjust the filler valve dramatically by moving the entire valve up or down. For minor adjustments, use the filler valve's screw.

, If you hear a whistle or noise that sounds like air leaving a balloon, then the flapper valve is not closing. Make an adjustment to slightly raise or lower the valve. The screw for the flapper valve is usually found on the float that looks like a little barrel that moves up and down with the water level.


Use a screwdriver to adjust the flapper valve's screw, tightening or loosening until the noise ceases.

Remove the remaining water from the bowl by forcing it down with a plunger and mopping up the remaining water with a sponge. Then, remove the remaining water in the tank with the sponge as well.;
, Disconnect the supply line using a wrench. You may want to take the opportunity to replace the line. If keeping the line, only disconnect it where it attaches to the toilet.

, Take the caps (they look a little like domes) off of the bolts at the base of the toilet, then remove those bolts. After that, remove the bolts connecting the tank to the seat.

, Straddling the bowl, place a hand on either side of the base of the tank and lift it off, rocking it side-to-side a little to ease it off and making sure to bend with your knees. Put it somewhere out of the way but be sure to put it somewhere water resistant, as there may be residual water.

, Now you can remove the rest of the toilet. Grab the toilet and rock it side-to-side to break the wax seal underneath and lift it off the bolts. If the bolts are badly rusted and the toilet is getting caught, you may need to cut off as much of the bolts as you can see using a hacksaw. Remove the toilet and put it somewhere out of the way.

Seal the hole.",How to Remove a Toilet1," Begin by turning off the shutoff valve on the water supply line. Then flush the toilet to remove all the water from the tank and the bowl. Disconnect both ends of the water supply tube at the shutoff valve and at the toilet tank.


You want the toilet and tank to be as dry as possible before you remove it, so go a step further and use a sponge to soak up any water that's left after you flush.;
, Use a ratchet wrench or a basin wrench to remove the nuts from the mounting bolts that hold the tank onto the bowl. There will be one on each side of the tank, and there may even be a third one in the middle. Gently lift the tank off the bowl.


Once the tank is off , remove it from the bathroom or set it to the side or somewhere it won't be in the way.

, Pry the trim caps off the floor bolts. Use an adjustable wrench to remove the nuts from the floor bolts.


If you can't get the nuts off, try spraying them with penetrating oil. If you're still unsuccessful, you may have to use a nut splitter or cut the bolts with a hacksaw.

, There is a wax ring under the toilet that seals the bottom of the bowl to the end of the drain pipe (called the toilet flange). Straddle the toilet and gently rock it from side to side in order to break the seal. Once you do, lift off the bowl and place it nearby on its side.

, Using a putty knife, scrape away the old wax from the toilet flange and from the bottom of the toilet. Throw the old wax in a bucket line with a plastic bag. Clean the flange with a stiff wire brush.

, Put a rag inside the toilet flange/drainpipe to keep sewer gases from coming into the bathroom. Place a bucket upside-down over your rag.

Assess the water flow pressure into the tank.,
Clean out the fill valve.,
Replace the fill valve if necessary.",How to Repair a Noisy Toilet2," If the water pressure is too high or too low, it can create noise in the water flow valve. In order to assess the water pressure of the water coming out of the fill valve, pull off the refill hose right where it connects to the fill valve. Be careful, as water will be flowing if this is done while the toilet is filling.If there is a strong stream of water coming out, then the water pressure may be too high. If this is the case, try turning the water valve at the base of the toilet partly down, reattach the hose, and try flushing again. The lowered pressure may eliminate the noise.
If the water pressure into the toilet is very low, then you will need to increase it. This will require you to investigate the fill valve a little further.

, If the water pressure is too low, it may be restricted while it goes through the fill valve. In order to assess this, you will need to take the top of the fill valve off and clean it out. First, turn off the water to the toilet. Then, take the top of the fill valve. Look for debris that could be impacting the water pressure.To clean out the valve you will need a large cup that you can hold over the top of it. With the top of the valve off, place the cup over the top and turn the water back on for a few seconds. The water should shoot up into the cup, taking all debris and gunk that was in the valve with it. Then, turn the water off and replace the valve cap.

, If you have cleaned out your fill valve and it is still making a lot of noise when the toilet tank fills, then you may need to replace it. Turn the water to the toilet off and then drain the tank by flushing the toilet. Remove the existing fill valve and take it with you to your local home improvement or hardware store.By having the existing fill valve with you, you can be sure to get a replacement that will fit your toilet.
Ask an employee at the store to help you if you are unsure how to find the right part.
Take the replacement part home and follow the instructions it comes with to install it correctly.

Assess the float adjustment.,
Check the fill valve function.,
Check for flapper seal misalignment.",How to Repair a Noisy Toilet3," Open the tank and lift up on the float arm. If the toilet stops running when the float is lifted slightly higher than it sits in the water, then you need to readjust its position.Adjusting the float position is done differently on different toilet assemblies. In some cases there is an adjustment screw on the top of the fill valve. In other cases, it is done on the pole the float is attached to. You will need to assess your specific toilet assembly to figure out how.

, Another problem that can cause the toilet to run is when the fill valve malfunctions. In some cases, it does not turn off the water when it should, thus allowing the toilet to run constantly. If this is the case it needs to be replaced.Check the function of your fill valve by lifting up on the toilet float. If the valve shuts off water flow when the float is lifted, then it is working fine. If it does not, then it is the problem.

, Sometimes a toilet runs because water is slowly leaking out of the bottom of the tank, into the toilet bowl. This happens when the seal at the bottom of the tank, often called the flapper, is dirty, misaligned, or damaged. To assess your toilet's seal, first turn off the water to the toilet and then empty the tank by flushing the toilet. Then take a look at the seal.You can use a dye test to check for slow leaks into the bowl. If you put a few drops of food coloring in the water in the tank and leave the toilet untouched for several hours, if there is a leak into the bowl the bowl water will be colored.
If the seal at the bottom of the tank looks dirty and grimy, take the time to clean it off. This could be the solution to your problem.
If the seal doesn't completely cover the opening at the bottom of the toilet tank, then it needs to be realigned so that it does.
If the seal at the bottom of the tank has a crack in it, or is otherwise damaged, than it needs to be replaced.

, Pull the old bolts out of the flange (you will probably need to pull them to the side a little, as are placed like a nail hanging a picture frame). Dispose of the old bolts in an appropriate manner.

, Remove everything that remains of the old wax seal. You can use a putty knife, a rag, and any other tools you need. Wipe it clean when you are done.

, This is the round plastic or metal circle which was under the wax. Inspect the flange: if it looks damaged it may need to be replaced. You can also buy an adaptor (or super flange) if the original is a bit cracked or damaged.

, With the flange in good shape, you can now place new bolts into the flange. They should go in the long channels, in much the same way you hang a picture frame.

, Place the new toilet on its side on top of a towel or other padded surface. Then place the new wax seal over the hole, with the plastic or rubber facing out. Push it hard into place and turn it slightly like a doorknob to get it to stick in place.

, Rock the bowl back and forth a little and press it firmly downwards, either by pressing with your arms and hands or by sitting on the toilet. This will help seal the new wax ring.

, At the base of the toilet, put in the new washers and nuts. Do not immediately put them on tight though! Place a level across the seat of the toilet and use wood shims underneath the base to make sure the toilet is level. Then, tighten the nuts on each side, alternating between the two sides, tightening just a little at a time to make sure the toilet is kept level. Do not tighten the nuts too much: you don’t want to crack your new toilet!


Make sure you’re being careful at this point not to move the toilet too much, as this will cause the seal on the toilet to break.

, Place the new caps on the anchor bolts. If they are too high, you can trim them down with a hacksaw.

, Next, take the new tank and place it on its side. Insert the tank bolts and washers from the inside of the tank and then put the tank-to-bowl gasket around the hole at the base.

, Take the tank and place it on the main part of the toilet, so that the bolts fit through the appropriate holes. Then add washers and nuts and tighten them, alternating sides as you did with the toilet base. Make sure not to make it too tight.

Install the toilet valve assembly.,
Install the toilet seat lid and ring.,
Reconnect the supply line.,

Caulk the base of the toilet.",How to Replace a Toilet4," You may need to install the valve assembly (all the parts inside the tank) if it is not pre-installed. There should be appropriate instructions on the packaging when you purchase the assembly, but you can also ask your local hardware store employee for advice.

, If they were not already installed, you will need to secure these to the toilet with the appropriate bolts.

, Reconnect the water supply line, using either the new line or the old one if it was in good shape.

, Try flushing a few times once the water is on to make sure there are no leaks.

, Choose an appropriate caulk and thoroughly caulk around the base of the toilet. Once this is dry then you’re done.


You may prefer to omit this last step. If you have a leaking wax seal on your toilet, or if a wax ring seal leak develops later, you will trap water under the base of the toilet. If the sub-floor is wood it will eventually rot it out leading to all sorts of problems when repairs are necessary.

Investigate pressure-assist toilets.,
Consider your need for comfort.,
Declare a dual.",How to Remove a Toilet2," Manufacturers may choose to have their toilet models tested by Maximum Performance (MaP) a group that advocates for better toilet flush performance in North America. The group maintains a public database of about 2,500 toilets that have undergone voluntary testing my MaP. Access the site to see the flush performance of toilet models you may be considering.


MaP has set removal of 350 grams of waste per flush as the minimum acceptable level and the U.S. EPA's WaterSense Program sets the same minimum for their tank-type toilet specification.Since participation in this testing program is voluntary, you won't find information for all toilets in the database.

, A high-efficiency toilet (HET) is one that uses 1.28 gallons (4.8 liters) of water per flush. Since a toilet accounts for one-third of your home water use, these can be a great way to save money on your water bill. On the downside, staining and clogging can be an issue with some models, so do your research.


Check with your water utility company to see if they offer a rebate or some form of financial incentive if you install a high-efficiency toilet.
High-efficiency toilets earn the U.S. EPA's WaterSense label, a designation that means among other things that they perform as well or better than their less efficient counterparts and are 20 percent more water efficient than average products in that category., These toilets use a separate tank to hold water under pressure. When you flush, this water is released at high velocity and removes waste more thoroughly. These toilets are more expensive and noisier than traditional models and could present a challenge should they need parts or need to be repaired.

, Standard toilet bowl height is 15"", but you can purchase a toilet with a bowl height between 17"" to 19"" These toilets, made to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, are easier on the back and the knees and more comfortable for older and/or taller adults. Their added height comes with a bit of a higher price ($50-$100) and small children or shorter adults may find them more difficult to use.

, Dual-flush toilets, available in both gravity and pressure-assist models, use 25 percent less water. They cost a couple of hundred dollars more than other models, but you'll save money in the long run. They're available only in a limited number of colors and style options.

",How to Make and Use a Simple Bidet," Look in garden supply shops for compression or pump sprayers. Usually these are for applying liquid fertilizers or pesticides to plants. This is why you must get a brand new compression sprayer that's never been used. Compression sprayers come in many different sizes. A 1.5 gallon (5.7 L) tank is not too big to fit next to most toilets but still holds plenty of water. They also come in plastic and metal varieties. Consider that while some plastics can leach harmful phthalates into water, some metals (such as brass) can contain lead. Other benefits of plastic include its light weight and often translucency (so you can see the water level), while metal tanks are often more durable. Other features to look for include an adjustable spray head, flexible hose of sufficient length to reach your toilet seat, and an angled spray head or bent spray arm.;
, You should be able to reach it easily, and it should be close enough for the length of the hose that you can reach past the toilet seat with the sprayer.

, At first, you may want to dry off with a few squares of toilet paper until you feel proficient with the sprayer. The towel isn't for cleaning you, it's for drying you, so it shouldn't get very dirty. But if you feel more comfortable drying off with toilet paper, you will still reduce the amount of toilet paper you use because of how much more effective the sprayer is than toilet paper alone.

, Put the lid and pump assembly back on and tighten it well before pumping.

, You'll discover how much pressure is right for you with practice, but remember: Don't use too much pressure.

, If this is hard for you to visualize, imagine you are sitting on a stool and want to tilt the stool forward--tuck your tailbone and round your lower back. This will help you reach more easily and also keep the spray from ending up on the toilet lid behind you.

, No part of the sprayer should ever be directly below you, so that it stays clean.

",How to Plunge a Toilet,"


Do not buy the cheapest plunger you find at the store. These plungers often have flimsy rubber that does not make an adequate seal to do the job. You will end up needing to buy another, better plunger soon enough.
Buy a plunger with a funnel cup. This rubber plunger has a flange, or smaller piece of rubber in the center, below the cup. This locks with the toilet, creating more suction. It can cost slightly more, but should last a long time.
Expect to spend at least $10 on a good plunger.;
, Your ability to address a clogged toilet properly requires you to understand where you shut off the water to the toilet.









Your toilet should have a small metal knob near the floor that allows you to manually shut off the water. Turn the metal knob to ensure it stops the water flow to avoid messy overflow.
Remove the lid on the back of the toilet, and shut the flapper. If you cannot find the water valve, then you can stop water flow by closing the flapper, a plastic or rubber piece that lifts to allow more water into the bowl. It is attached by a chain, so you can simply push it down manually.

, Do not use the toilet or leave it, even if you are at another person's house.


Leaving a clogged toilet will put the responsibility on someone else, but it is more likely to result in costly damage and an embarrassing situation.

, Run hot water from the tap.









Pour 1 liter (4 cups) of hot water into the toilet. Do not flush the toilet. The warm water will work to loosen the clog.

, It will also help to break up fats inside the clog. Use shampoo if you cannot reach dish washing detergent.








, Occasionally this will break up the clog before plunging.








, Let it sit under the hot water for 30 seconds to warm up the rubber.








, Attempt to seal it to the center of the toilet bowl on all sides.









The angle will depend upon the toilet bowl you have; however, most plunging needs to be done in a downward motion, so you will need to stand right above the toilet bowl.

, Lift up sharply to create suction. Do this 4 or 5 times.








, The suction should cause the clog to dislodge and the water to drain.








,,,









If the level of water in your toilet did not go down after plunging, the clog is still there. Do not flush a toilet that has too much water in the bowl. It is likely to overflow.

, It is sometimes called a snake.

,, You have reached the clog.

, The auger may also break up the clog when it hits.

,, If the water level goes down in the toilet bowl, flush the toilet a final time.

Hand tighten the bolts on the bottom of the bowl as far as you can, and then tighten them a little more with a wrench.







, The nut should thread onto the bottom of the tank where the ballcock is found. It is important to only hand tighten this connection since using a wrench can easily break the plastic threads of the ballcock. Open up the supply valve found on the wall or the floor so water can fill up the tank.

, Install your toilet seat.

Make sure that it matches up with the kind of toilet you have (i.e. a round seat for a round bowl toilet).
Place the bolts through the holes provided on the toilet bowl.
Hand tighten the nuts that go on the bottom of the seat and then use a screwdriver and wrench if needed to fully secure the seat.

Whether you can spot clean or deep clean will depend on the material. Every upholstery tag should have a letter code on it that indicates how to clean the material, and they mean:W for water: use water-based cleaning solutions, such as soap and water. Fabrics with this tag are often made from materials like polyester, nylon, acetate, and olefin.S for solvent: clean your upholstery with a solvent-based solution that doesn’t contain water, such as dry cleaning solution. Most upholstery with this code is made from natural fibers like cotton and denim, rayon, linen, silk and wool, velour, and damask.SW: use solvent- and/or water-based cleaning solutions.

X: use neither solvent- nor water-based cleaning solutions; only clean it with vacuuming and light brushing to remove dirt and soil.;
, Check to see if the cushions have removable and washable covers. If the covers are removable, wash them according to the type of material. Otherwise, clean the cushions following the same steps as the rest of the upholstery.

, With a spoon or spatula, pick up large food particles, solid spills, rocks or dirt, and any other large debris that has accumulated on your furniture.

, Use the upholstery attachment or soft brush to remove dirt and dust from the upholstery and both sides of the cushions. Work from left to right, and top to bottom in short, overlapping strokes.Use a long, thin attachment to vacuum dirt and debris from corners and crevices.Remove stubborn pet hair with a clothing brush or pet hair remover if necessary.

, For fabric with a W or SW code, you can use regular water-based upholstery or fabric cleaners to remove small stains from your furniture. There are many commercial products available, so follow the manufacturer’s instructions regarding product application and removal. Apply the product with a clean cloth, gently rub or blot the stain, and clean the area with water or a dry cloth as instructed.


Hardware stores, general stores, and department stores all carry upholstery and fabric cleaners.
Always do small test patches of new cleaning products on your upholstery in a hidden spot to ensure it won’t cause shrinkage, color bleaching, or other changes to the fabric., Make your own spot cleaner by mixing a quarter cup of dishwashing liquid with one cup of water. Beat it with an electric mixer until it’s thick and foamy. Then:Apply the foam to stains on the upholstery with a microfiber cloth or soft brush.
Gently rub the stain with the suds, and then remove the excess foam with a spatula or spoon.
Wipe away the leftover suds with a clean, damp cloth.

, Steam cleaners can be rented from most grocery stores if you don't have one of your own. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions on your particular machine for the best results. Fill the reservoir with water and add the indicated amount of cleaning solution (if applicable). Start with the cushions and set them aside to dry when you move on to the main piece of furniture. Work in small sections, overlapping your strokes until you have cleaned all the material.To clean the entire piece of furniture with your homemade soap and water solution, start at the top and work your way down, applying suds to small sections of upholstery. Brush the area gently, remove the excess foam, and gently wipe the area with a clean, damp cloth. Move on to the next small section, and continue the process until the entire piece is clean.Deep cleaning should be performed every one to two years.

, Before returning cushions or sitting on the furniture again, make sure it has completely dried. To accelerate drying time, clean your upholstery on a warm, sunny day, and consider setting up an oscillating fan in the room to keep air moving over the upholstery as it dries., For fabrics with an S or SW code, use a water-free solvent to clean your upholstery. With a clean cloth or towel, blot the solvent onto the upholstery in areas that are dirty or soiled. You can also use a soft brush to gently work in the solvent and remove dirt.Popular products include solvents and dry cleaning solutions from Chemspec and KleenRite.
Only spot clean areas that are soiled.
Always use solvent-based cleaners in a well-ventilated area, never smoke nearby, and stay away from open flames.

, If areas on cushions require spot cleaning, it’s best to clean the entire surface to ensure a uniform appearance.Apply the solvent with a clean towel and blot or brush the surface of the cushion.

, Set up an oscillating fan so that it continuously blows fresh air over the upholstered surface.

, To remove additional solvent and dirt, vacuum the furniture and cushions once the areas have dried fully.

, Combine equal parts water and vinegar in a bowl. Dip a microfiber cloth into the solution. Wring out the cloth to remove as much moisture as possible. Wipe down parts of the upholstery that need some minor cleaning. Use as little liquid as possible, as water can stain leather., For areas that are more soiled and require a more vigorous cleaning, apply a small amount of leather cleaning product to a towel or cloth and gently rub the soiled area. Wipe away any excess cleaner and allow the spots to dry.Alternatively, you can also make your own leather cleaner by combining equal parts lemon juice and cream of tartar. Work it into a paste, and apply small amounts of the paste to a clean cloth. Gently rub soiled areas with the paste. Wipe down any excess and allow the areas to dry., Conditioning products help keep leather soft and moist, and prevent it from cracking. Apply small amounts of conditioner with a cloth and wipe away any excess., The most common cause of fabric fading is exposure to UV rays. You can help prevent this by positioning your furniture so it’s not in the path of the sun, covering your furniture with a protective material, or using UV-protective blinds and drapes to keep the sun out., In case of spills, it’s good to have cleaning products nearby to prevent staining. Be sure to use white or undyed towels or napkins to prevent dyes from leaching onto your furniture. Blot stains instead of rubbing them,and spot clean stains as necessary.

, Dirt and dust can make your furniture look grimy, but regular vacuuming will help prevent this. Every two weeks, use a soft brush to brush dirt and oil loose around head and arm rests. Vacuum all upholstery surfaces, including cushions and crevices.To deal with smells, sprinkle the upholstery with baking soda one night before bed and let it sit overnight. Vacuum it up in the morning., For messy, busy houses where furniture is prone to frequent staining, consider spraying your upholstery with a fabric protector that repels liquids and stains. Make sure the product is suitable for use with your upholstery code.

Start by deciding what kind of fabric you want.,
Look for a color or a pattern that will complement the room.,
Shop for construction that is simple.",How to Choose Furniture Slipcovers2,"


Select something that is easy to wash if you have children, pets or eat on your furniture frequently. The best fabrics for this lifestyle include cotton, denim or corduroy.
Remember that thin, stretchy material which is often made from polyester will fit your furniture easily, but will be less durable than a thicker fabric.
Choose a fabric such as micro-suede, chintz, chenille or imitation leather for furniture that gets less traffic. You will not have to worry about removing and washing these slipcovers as often.

, Whether you are choosing a slipcover for the living room, bedroom or home office, you want your furniture to match the rest of your decoration.

Choose pillows that fit the area.,
Select pillows with contrasting shapes.,
Use pillows with texture.,
Select accent pillows with high quality filling.",How to Choose Accent Pillows1," If you are putting accent pillows on a sofa that is a typical size, around 16”-18” x 16”-18”, standard sized pillows will fit neatly in the space. Standard square accent pillows are around 18 inches. Having average sized pillows on your sofa will keep the area comfy looking but not overwhelmed by the pillows.If you have a larger sofa or a larger bed, go for oversized square pillows, which are around 24 inches. Oversized pillows can create a comfy feel and make the space more inviting.
If your sofa has a low back and is slim, go for square pillows that are 16 inches. This way, the pillows do not overwhelm the sofa and still complement the size of the sofa well.;
, Accent pillows come in four main shapes: bolster, square, rectangle, and round. Go for a mix of shapes to add dimension to the sofa or bed, especially if the space is sparsely decorated. Rectangle shaped pillows are good for supporting your back and neck, so they may be a good base shape for a bed or a sofa. Then, add two round pillows or two bolster pillows to create variety on the bed or sofa.If you have a couch made of leather, bolster pillows are a good option as they provide lumbar support and won’t slip down when propped up on the couch.
If your bed or couch has severe or sharp lines with very little padding, soften it with round pillows. If the bed or couch is more soft and squishy, sharpen it with large square pillows.

, Contrasting textures can add a sense of design to the space. Look for pillows that will contrast the texture of your sofa or bed. Contrast a set of linen pillows against a smooth leather couch or pillows made of silk against a fuzzy couch or a bed.You can also use pillows that have a texture that will help them stay in place on your sofa or bed. For example, you may go for pillows made of linen on a silk couch so they stay in place. Or you may use cotton accent pillows on linen sheets so there is traction and the pillows do not shift or move around.

, To ensure your accent pillows last and do not become lumpy or saggy, go for ones with high quality filling. Cheaper accent pillows will be filled with feather, foam, or a synthetic mix. However, if you plan to use the accent pillows to lean on or sleep on, cheaper ones will not last. Instead, go for accent pillows that contain goose down, which is softer and higher quality.If you are a vegan or want a cruelty-free option for pillows, you can try pillows made of high quality synthetic material. Pillows stuffed with wheat husks and cotton are also good options."

Choose quality tools and materials.,
Plan your trim design.,
Draw your design on the upholstery.,
Pound in the nails according to your pattern.,
Remove bent or warped nails.,
Pound the nails in the rest of the way and enjoy your trim.",How to Add Nailhead Trim to Upholstery1," Poor quality nails will bend and warp when you’re installing the trim, which will make the process more difficult. A regular hammer will work just fine on nails, but a rubber mallet or hammer covered in cloth will protect your upholstery should you miss a nail.


There are many different size, shape, and color nails you can use in this project. Check your local hardware or craft store to find unique nails for your trim.
For a more precise pounding tool, you might want to use a specialized tack hammer. These can be found at most hardware stores and craft shops.;
, When using individual nails to create your nailhead trim, you can be more flexible with its spacing and pattern. For instance, you can have the nails occur immediately one after another, or you might space these out so there are gaps between them.It may help to visualize different patterns, spacings, and styles for your trim by doing a rough sketch of the chair and drawing your desired trim design on it.

, Use painter’s tape to overlay the area you’ll be applying your trim. Trim is often used along edges and seams. With a pencil, mark the locations you’ll be pounding in nails on the tape. If you’re including spaces between nails, measure these carefully with a tape measure so the end result looks uniform.


If you’re planning on using nails without any spaces in between, it may be easiest to draw a straight line on your tape where the nails will be attached.Be especially careful that your marks are even. If the nails forming your trim are angled or otherwise out of alignment, it will be easy to see.
In some cases, you may be able to write directly on your upholstery and erase marks that are unaligned. However, to prevent damage to your upholstery, tape is recommended., Pound the nails into your upholstery following the marks on your painter’s tape. To protect your fingers and increase visibility so you can see the mark on the tape better, hold the nail with a pair of needle nose pliers, then pound it in with a hammer.


If using painter’s tape, pound the nails in most of the way, but leave a small space between the nail head and the tape. This will make removing the tape easier. Needle nose pliers aren’t a requirement for this project. You may be just as accurate holding nails between your pointer and middle fingers, sinking the nail partway into the upholstery, removing your fingers, then finishing pounding., It’s likely that while installing the nails a few will bend, warp, or become deformed. Don’t try to force these into place. Doing so can make them look unsightly and difficult to remove. Instead, use a tack puller to remove ruined nails.


Tack pullers are generally long handled tools with a prong on the end. Slot the nail inside the prong, then pry upwards with the puller to remove the nail., Once you’ve attached the nails for your trim, you’re nearly finished. Peel away the tape from the nails. Then use your hammer to pound the nails in the remainder of the way. Your nailhead trim is complete.You may need to tear the tape in certain places to completely remove it from around the nail. In the event tape sticks stubbornly to the upholstery, use your fingernail or a knife to gently peel away the tape.

Consider the type of sofa bed replacement mattress.,
Consider foam density, or pounds per cubic inch.,
Consider Indentation Force Deflection (IFD).,
Consider the thickness of the mattress.,
Consider the fabric on the underside of the mattress.,
Look into the warranty, which should be around five years.",How to Choose a Sofa Replacement Mattress," You can choose between an innerspring mattress, or a foam mattress. A spring mattress can get deformed and uncomfortable when stored inside the body of the sofa; as it just isn’t designed to be folded and stored for long periods of time. On the other hand, a foam sofa mattress has a high resiliency, thanks to its innate ability to form and shape itself into any situation. Once the sofa bed is opened up for use, the foam mattress springs back into its original shape, perfect for sleeping, thus making the foam mattress the better choice for sofas. (In the following look at the steps you need to consider when shopping for a foam sofa mattress.);
, This is a key factor when buying a foam mattress for the sofa, as you will want a replacement mattress that won’t “bottom out” with the weight of the sleepers. Densities between 1.8 and 2.5 pounds per cubic foot have longer lifespans and offer great support.

, A mattress with good IFD will have some ability to absorb shocks, meaning you won’t get bounced around every time someone else moves on the mattress. IFD is also a measure of the mattress's firmness.

, You will want a sofa replacement mattress thick enough to fit your needs, but not too thick or it might not fit your sofa bed mechanism when it’s folded up. Typically, four to five inches thick is perfect.

, Ideally, it should be made of a heavy duty backing fabric and ticking material, compatible with the rest of the mattress. You will want something comfortable and durable.

, You never know what is going to happen, and you don’t want to invest in a new replacement sofa mattress and have to replace it all over again in a short amount of time. A warranty gives you that peace of mind to know you are covered, no matter what small sofa disasters life brings your way.

Stick to one color palette.,
Have a balance of prints and solids.,
Consider the color scheme of the room.",How to Choose Accent Pillows2," Create a color palette based on the base color of the couch or the bed and stick to it. Choose one main shade and then one to two complementary shades for the accent pillows. This way, the accent pillows look cohesive and fit well with the color of the sofa or the bed.For example, let’s say you have a couch that is white. You choose a main shade like cobalt blue for the larger accent pillows. Then, you choose accent pillows in complementary colors like silver, red, peach, yellow, light green, or light pink to go with the main color palette.

, If you want to have accent pillows with a print on them, go for a balance between prints and solids. Start with one solid pillow, one simple print, and one busy print. Have the largest pillow be the busy print and then have the solid pillow be the next largest. Finish with the simple print in the smallest size.For example, you may have one striped accent pillow, one pillow with a woven design, and one solid pillow. Arrange them so the woven design is the largest, followed by the solid pillow, and then the striped pillow.
For a more simplified look, you can try having one bold print and one solid color for the accent pillows. Then, add or remove a less bold print as you see fit.

, When you are choosing the color scheme of the accent pillows, you should think about how the color scheme will complement the room. If you are adding accent pillows with a print to your sofa, think about how the print complements the color of the walls in the room and the other furnishings. Ideally, you want the color scheme of the accent pillows to reflect the color scheme of the room.You may choose accent pillow colors based on the colors already in the room. This way, you know the accent pillows will complement the space well.
You can try taking fabric swatches of the accent pillows and comparing them to the color of the walls in the room and the color of the other furnishings to ensure it all works together.

Go for a traditional theme.,
Try a modern theme.,
Create an eclectic theme in the space.",How to Choose Accent Pillows3," If you’d prefer to have a traditional theme in your space, use an even number of accent pillows. Choose two to four large pillows in the same size and shape. Go for pillows in complementary colors. Then, arrange them on either side of your sofa or bed. This will create symmetry and order in the space.Go for contrasting fabrics for the pillows, such as velvet and silk or leather and linen. Try accent pillows with trim or fringe, such as cord or tassels.

, If you want a more modern feel to your space, go for an odd number of accent pillows, such as three or five, instead of the traditional pairs. Choose big pillows as well as oblong pillows for some variety. Try pillows with large geometric prints, especially if your couch or bed is covered in cotton or linen. Don’t be afraid to use a bold color scheme, particularly if you are adding accent pillows to furniture that is more neutral in color.Base the color and texture of the accent pillows on the colors in a piece of art in the room or other decorative item. This can help to make the room feel unified and modern.

, An eclectic theme can make a room feel more casual and relaxed. Choose an odd number of accent pillows in a similar size. Select accent pillows in different fabrics, but make sure they have at least one color in common. Keep the pillows simple, with little to no trim.Pick accent pillows that fit the color palette of the room or add a pop of color to the room.
To ensure the sofa or bed does not look cluttered, arrange the pillows with an odd number on one side. This way, the design will appear eclectic without looking too overstuffed or uniform.

"
"
Organize the pillows in symmetrical layers.,
Arrange the pillows from biggest to smallest.,
Remove pillows if the space feels overcrowded.",How to Choose Accent Pillows4," If you are more into a symmetrical look for the space, try arranging the accent pillows in symmetrical layers. This means having the same number of pillows on either side of your couch or bed. Layer them on top of each other so there are contrasting shapes, textures, and colors in the space.For example, you may layer one round, print accent pillow with one solid square accent pillow on either side of your sofa. Or you may layer two round solid accent pillows under a smaller square pillow on either side of your bed.

, To create a good visual, arrange the pillows so they get smaller as they move towards the inside of your sofa or your bed. Keep the largest pillows on the far corners and the smaller pillows on the inside. This will ensure the space is comfortable to rest on and create a balanced visual.


For example, place a large square pillow first, followed by a smaller round pillow, and then a small bolster.

, There is such a thing as too many accent pillows on your sofa or bed. Do not be afraid to remove any accent pillows from the space if it starts to feel overstuffed or overcrowded. Try testing out the accent pillows by sitting or lying down on the sofa or bed. If it feels like there are too many pillows and you cannot sit on the sofa or bed comfortably, you may need to remove some pillows.You should also consider the rest of the space. If the room has a lot of decoration and other furnishing, you may cut down on the number of accent pillows you use. If the room is more sparsely decorated, you may increase the number of accent pillows.

Select a suitable pre-made trim.,
Outline your trim placement on your upholstery.,
Install your trim along the trim outline.,
Check the straightness of your trim and enjoy.",How to Add Nailhead Trim to Upholstery2," Pre-made trim comes in many different styles, colors, and shapes. Choose a trim that matches or compliments your upholstery. You can find pre-made trim at most hardware stores and craft stores.Some trim is accented with a piece of leather or cloth beneath the nails. This can be a great way of drawing a little more attention to your trim.

, Use a pencil and a straightedge, like a ruler or meter stick, to draw an unbroken line where your nailhead trim will go. Be especially careful that this line is the same distance from the outside edge of the upholstery. This will help keep your trim straight.


When attaching your pre-made trim, you’ll only have to pound in nails every few inches (7 to 10 cm). The trim will cover your outline, hiding it from view., Attach your trim in sections to the outline. Do this by holding the trim in place over the line and pounding in nails to attach the trim where it has gaps. Continue this for the entire length of the outline.Your pre-made trim should have come with special nails that match or accentual the design of the trim. Use these for attaching the trim.
If your pre-made trim didn’t come with nails, go to the hardware store to find nails that match your trim pattern. This way the nails used to attach the trim won’t look out of place.

, Even slight deviations from your trim outline can leave your trim looking unsatisfactory. Step back and check for evenness. Adjust the trim where necessary by pulling out nails with a tack puller and reattaching the trim. Enjoy your nailhead trimmed furniture.When adjusting trim that is uneven, use fresh nails to reattach it. Nails that have been pulled out will be more likely to warp and need to be removed again, or they may deform, which can result in an undesirable appearance.

Add ribbon or fabric beneath the nails of your trim.,
Make a curve in your trim design.,
Use different finishes in your nails to create variety.,
Create unique designs with different shaped nails.,
Anchor corners with larger studs and ornate nails.",How to Add Nailhead Trim to Upholstery3," Cut a piece of fabric or find a ribbon of suitable thickness. Use a pencil to draw an unbroken line on your upholstery where the trim will go. Attach the ribbon or fabric to the upholstery with tape so it follows your trim outline. Pound in nails or a pre-made trim to attach the ribbon or fabric according to your trim pattern.For certain kinds of fabric, like braid, it might be easiest to draw your nail placement on the fabric, push the nail through the fabric, then pound in the nails with the fabric already attached.

, Get a piece of semi-rigid card stock that will flex if it's bent. Cut a thin strip from it that is 1¼ times the size of your edge. Hold the ends of your strip at the start and end of your planned arc. Flex the strip so it bows in an arc shape. Draw a guide line with a pencil by following the arc formed by the strip.In some cases, you might need to adjust the size of your card stock to achieve the right kind of arc.

, Bright silver or gold nails are the most common colors in nailhead trim, but a different combination of finishes in your nails can create a new dimension in your trim design. Try mixing and matching burnished or tarnished colors to add character to your trim.Some nails have a colored finish that might look great when added to uniform designs. Nails with different finishes can be found at hardware stores and craft stores.

, Nails come in many different shapes and sizes. Alternating between square and circular head nails, for example, can create a pleasing pattern. Explore different nail shapes at your local hardware store or craft shop.Nails are relatively cheap, and even if you find some don’t work with your design, you can always save them for a later project.

, Corners form the outside boundary for the lines of the trim and are natural places the eye is drawn. This is why corners are often embellished with larger or more ornate designs. For this reason, you might want to use a larger or more ornate stud or nail in the corners.


You can find ornamental and large sized nails at most hardware and craft shops. If you’re looking for something fancy, a craft store might be your best bet.

Begin with a clean, perfectly smooth wood surface and a clean, dust-free, warm room.,
Mix 3 ounces of shellac flakes with 1 pint of denatured alcohol.,
Soak a wad of gauze in shellac, then place it inside a cotton cloth (a piece of an old bed sheet or white tee-shirt works well).,
Add a few drops of olive oil to the pad.,
Apply the shellac to the wood surface in a gliding or sweeping motion, working one small area at a time, perhaps 2 square feet.,
Build a fresh pad, then add a few drops shellac and several drops of alcohol to the cloth.,
Allow the work to sit for a couple of hours so any oil can come to the surface.,
Let the work sit for several hours so it can dry completely, then repeat the boding, stiffing and spiriting sessions.,
Polish the surface with rottenstone and olive oil.,
Finish with a thin coat of furniture wax to help protect your French polish from damage.

",How to Apply a French Polish," Any imperfections in the wood or dust that settles onto the surface while you're working will show up in the polish. A cold room will cause the polish to be cloudy.;
, Keep the mixture in a tightly sealed container, pouring small amounts into a shallow bowl as you work. Although you can buy shellac already mixed, the fresher it is, the better the results will be. Use gloves when working with shellac.

, Tie up the ends of the cloth with string to make a sort of handle. Squeeze the pad to force most of the shellac out.

, You may want to use an eyedropper to keep from adding too much. The purpose of the oil is to keep the pad from drying out and sticking as you apply shellac. If the pad does start to stick, add another couple of drops of oil.

, Gradually change to circular, then figure-8 motions. Each sweep will leave a thin layer of shellac, and your goal is to leave about 100 of these layers in one boding session.


The shellac will dry quickly, so using an improper motion will leave an imprint of the pad on the surface.

, Begin your stiffing session by sweeping the pad in even strokes from one side to the other to smooth out any unevenness in the shellac. Take care not to remove any shellac.

, Then repeat the stiffing session to remove the oil. This is a separate step called spiriting.

, You will do this several times to build up a thick shellac surface on the wood.

, Place the rottenstone in a salt shaker and sprinkle it on the surface, then apply a few drops of olive oil to a fresh pad and rub the entire surface until you're satisfied with its appearance.

If you attempt to do so on a piece of furniture that is poor quality, you’ll experience two things: increased difficulty with the process, and an increased likelihood that the furniture won’t last long (making your time/money investment pointless). Start out on the right foot by selecting furniture that is high quality with an ugly ‘skin’.


Look for furniture that is made of solid wood, not veneer or plywood. Solid wood will maintain its value and last a very long time, while veneers and plywood furniture aren’t quality enough to last very long.
Check the furniture for any squeaks, noises, or imbalances. Move the furniture around a bit - if it wobbles or makes noises when you do, it’s not in fantastic shape and probably isn’t worth reupholstering.
Look at the overall construction to determine if there is any major damage or problem areas. Nails/screws that are sticking out or missing, broken boards/pieces, or sagging areas may be a sign that the furniture will require more work to fix up than you want to put into it.;
, Although you can technically reupholster furniture with any kind of fabric, most fabrics won’t be thick and sturdy enough to last for many years. Look for special upholstering fabric, which is thicker and made to stand against wear-and-tear better than other types of fabric. Keep in mind that the type of furniture you use will depend on the placement of the piece; you can get away with using regular fabric on a piece of furniture that won’t be frequently used, but you’ll definitely need upholstering fabric for pieces that are used often (like a couch).Because reupholstering is such a time-consuming process, try to select a fabric that is relatively neutral and will stand the test of time in terms of style. That way, it will fit with your interior design preferences for more time than a bold or trendy fabric choice would.
If you get a patterned fabric, try to choose one that won’t require you to match specific sections of the pattern (like wallpaper) when you cut it into sections. You can still use a cut-specific pattern like this, but it will take much more time trying to lay the pattern out so that each piece is going the same direction as all the other pieces., There aren’t any special tools required in reupholstering furniture, but you will need some for the job. Get these in advance to make work easier. You will need:


A flat-head screwdriver (or a butter knife - this will be for prying)
Pliers
A hammer
A staple gun with staples (the length of the necessary staples will depend on how thick the fabric you’re using is)
Sewing machine with associated supplies.

, You may not need the following supplies depending on your specific project, but they may come in handy for certain reupholstering projects. Scan through the list and see if any might be applicable for the piece of furniture you’re working on:


Cleaning supplies (specifically for old couches)
Fabric piping for seams/edges
Cotton batting for added padding
Buttons (with upholstery needle and thread)
Cushion zippers
Replacement feet/legs

, Work slowly and meticulously to remove the fabric from your furniture by pulling out all the staples/tacks/screws that are holding it in place. Use your flat-head screwdriver or butter knife to carefully pull out every staple. Do not cut any of the fabric to remove it, as you will be using the pre-existing fabric as your pattern for the new upholstering fabric.


If you’re removing fabric from a couch, you’ll need to flip it over and take the fabric off the bottom and back as well.
Remove any cushions that might be there, but if they don’t have a zipper, you might be able to make a cover for them rather than removing all the current fabric.
Side panels of fabric (like on a sofa) may not require fabric removal, because often you can tack your new fabric over the top.
Be careful not to cut yourself on the staples or tacks, as these are a very real tetanus threat.

, Removing the old fabric often exposes the dirty underside of your used furniture; it is best to clean up any messes or dirty areas prior to adding new furniture over the top. For couches, vacuum out the inside of the frame, and spray fabric cleaner onto the cushions and foam to freshen them up. Use a bit of wood oil or cleaner to prepare the wood parts of your furniture, and seal it if necessary.


If your furniture was damaged or scratched, you should take time now to repair it and prep it for new fabric.
If you want to stain or paint the wood on your furniture, you should do so at this point.

, Lay out all the fabric you removed from you furniture, making sure that you know which piece goes where (or where it went originally). Layer your new upholstery fabric out, and trace the old fabric shapes onto the new. This will serve as your pattern, and allow you to cut out all the necessary pieces for your project. Once you’ve gotten all the pieces measured/traced, you can very carefully cut out each section, making sure that you mark or keep track of where on the furniture it will be put.


Use fabric shears for cutting your fabric, in order to make smooth, clean cuts.

, Not all of the fabric you upholster will require sewing, in fact typically only cushion and arm covers or pieces of fabric with corners will require any sewing. Use the original fabric as your pattern, and mimic the same sewing pattern with your new fabric. #*Use a thread that will match the fabric, or use a clear plastic thread.


If you’re able, use a serger along the edges to prevent the fabric from fraying.

, Work one section at a time, lining up your new fabric with its corresponding location on the furniture. Use your staple gun with staples of the appropriate length to attach the fabric securely to the furniture. Make sure there are no gaps, and fold/tuck the edges of each piece of fabric to give it a smooth finish.


If you need to apply extra layers of batting or cushion, do so prior to re-attaching the fabric.
Some fabric will have to be attached using upholstery tacks, but you’ll know this based on how the original fabric was attached.

, When all the fabric has been re-attached to your furniture, you should sew on any piping, buttons, or attach the feet/legs to the bottom of your furniture. This is your chance to make any last-minute changes or to add design details that might not have been on the original piece of furniture. If you decide you’re completely finished, give your piece of furniture a once-over to verify that there are no loose threads so-to-speak, and that it’s ready to be placed as a permanent fixture in your home."

Understand the costs and benefits of oiling.,
Prepare your tools.,
Clean the furniture and let dry if necessary.,
Select a ""teak oil"" or ""teak sealer"" product.,
Use a paint brush to apply teak oil.,
Wait fifteen minutes, then wipe down with a cloth.,
Wipe up spills and drips with mineral oil.,
Reapply regularly.",How to Oil Teak Furniture1," Applying teak oil maintains the furniture's glossy, brown appearance, and may make scratches and other damage less visible if it occurs, since the surface will have a similar appearance as the inner wood.However, once oiled, the furniture may become dependent on repeated oiling, at least once every three months, to maintain its appearance. If, however, the furniture has never been oiled, it can remain sturdy for decades.



Warning: Teak furniture manufacturers strongly recommend avoiding oil of outdoor furniture or furniture that is kept in damp environments. This is due to the increased chance of mildew brought on by creating an environment likely to promote the growth of mold colonies.;
, Place a cloth or newspaper beneath the teak furniture to catch spills. Put on gloves to avoid getting oil on your hand, which may cause skin irritation. While most teak oils are not highly toxic, long-term exposure may cause health problems, so working in a well-ventilated area is recommended.Keep teak oil away from heat sources, as it can be highly flammable. Select several clean, disposable rags to use for oiling your furniture.

, If the furniture is cleaned regularly, dust it thoroughly. If it appears dirty, feels sticky, or has grime buildup, wash with water and mild soap, or use a specialized ""teak cleaner."" See the care section for more detail.



Warning: Dry the furniture after cleaning and leave it for 24–36 hours to remove all moisture before applying the oil. Even if the surface moisture has dried, moisture just below the surface could be trapped by the oil, altering color and longevity., The ""teak oil"" products used for this purpose are not actually made from the teak tree, and composition can vary between them. Of the common ingredients, tung oil may be more effective than linseed oil.Teak oil sometimes comes with an artificial color or an additional sealant product mixed in, so read the label carefully before selecting. Teak sealer typically requires less frequent application than teak oil, but otherwise operates in a similar fashion., Cover the teak in even strokes with a wide brush. Continue to apply the oil until the furniture has a matte appearance and cannot absorb any more.

, Allow the oil to penetrate the wood. You may notice the surface oil changing to a tacky consistency as the wood beneath it is absorbed. Once this occurs, or after fifteen minutes, wipe the furniture with a clean rag, taking care to remove all excess oil.A second clean rag can be used to buff the surface once it is dry.

, Moisten a clean cloth with mineral oil to pick up excess oil and drips. Teak oil may stain other furniture or floors if not removed immediately.

, Your furniture will now fade in color if oil is not reapplied. Reapply oil once every few weeks or months, whenever the color and sheen fades. You may apply an additional coat to deepen the color, but only apply a new layer once the furniture surface is completely dry to the touch.

"
"
Simply dust occasionally if you enjoy the natural color.,
Clean the teak furniture instead if you would like to restore its color.,
Use teak cleaner for more significant cleaning.,
Apply a clear protective coat to avoid damage.,
Consider covering the teak when not in use.,
Lightly sand off stains.",How to Oil Teak Furniture2," There is no harm done to your furniture if you let it fade to a light brown, and eventually to an aged silvery color. If you enjoy this appearance or the low maintenance, just dust your teak furniture regularly, and wash it occasionally if dirt or moss builds up.


During the initial weathering, your teak furniture may look uneven in color or slightly cracked. This should even out over time., You may scrub the furniture with a soft-bristled brush and warm soapy water to temporarily restore a slightly brighter color. Avoid hard bristles or high-pressure hoses, which may damage the teak.

, A specialized cleaning product, called teak cleaner, can be used if soap and water is not enough to remove dirt or brighten the furniture's color. There are two major types of teak cleaner available:One part teak cleaner is safe and easy to apply. Scrub it in with a soft-bristled brush, for approximately 15 minutes. Gently rinse with clean water, using an abrasive cleaning pad or bronze wool to open up the pores of the wood and remove the cleaner. Avoid steel wool, which may discolor the teak.
Two part teak cleaners are harsher on your teak's lifespan and texture, but operate faster and may dissolve tough grime. Apply the first part, an acid, and wait according to the instructions on the packaging. Scrub in the second part, which neutralizes the acid, making sure to cover the furniture thoroughly.

, If your teak furniture is heavily used or kept in an area with energetic activity, you may wish to protect it from stains in advance. A clear, protective sealant can be applied anytime the teak is dry to form a hard layer over the teak's surface. The name and application method of these products vary between brands. Look for ""teak protectors"" or ""clear coat"" for teak, and follow the instructions on the packaging.


The use of a sealant and oil at the same time is controversial, as some believe them to have negative effects in combination. Some cleaning product manufacturers, however, recommend both.

, One of teak's attractions is its extreme durability, which makes protection usually unnecessary. However, a porous cover such as canvas may make cleaning easier. Never use a plastic or vinyl cover, which traps moisture on the furniture.

, Some stains, such as red wine or coffee, may be difficult to remove by washing. Remove the top layer of wood instead with medium-grain sandpaper, then create a smooth surface with fine-grain sandpaper once the stain is gone.This will likely brighten the furniture's appearance where sanded, as the interior of the teak still contains natural oils.

Gather the necessary tools and materials.,

Start with the doors.,
Use a damp rag to gently wipe the painted surface.,
Know what to do if the paint becomes sticky.,
Apply additional coats as desired.,
Once the paint has dried, apply a coat of clear urethane.,
Reattach the cabinet doors and clean up.",How to Black Wash Cabinets," To black wash your kitchen cabinets, you will need the following tools and materials.


Black acrylic latex paint (semi-gloss or satin).
Several poly-foam paint brushes (2” to 4” wide)
Two or three disposable bristle paint brushes (2” to 4” wide)
Clean rags (old t-shirts make the best rags for this project)
Water-based satin urethane (Varathane Diamond Coat ® or Minwax Polycryilic ®)
Empty paint can (for mixing)
Water
Phillips screwdriver
Masking tape
Household window cleaner or 409 ®
220 grit sandpaper or very fine (#0000) steel wool
Paint mixing sticks from paint store;
, Your paint and clear finish products will account for the majority of your costs.


A gallon of black paint will yield two gallons of black-wash, since the paint is cut with water. The water-based urethane is about $25 per quart.
A typical kitchen can be black-washed for under $200 DIY compared to having a professional do it for around $1000 or more.

, Some cabinets and furniture have a wood grained “foil” or vinyl coating that looks like wood but is not. If you are unsure, take a door to your local home center and have an expert tell you if this is the case.


If your cabinets do have a vinyl coating, this process will not work successfully as a black wash finish will not stick. You can successfully repaint this type of covering with paint that is made specifically for plastics.

, Begin by removing the cabinet doors with a Phillips screwdriver and set the drawers aside. Then clean the cabinet surfaces with household window cleaner or 409 ® and allow to dry thoroughly. Repeat the process with the removed cabinet doors.


Remove any stubborn grease or “goo” stains with cleaner and steel wool or sandpaper. Scrub just enough to get the surface clean.
Wipe down the surfaces with a slightly damp rag to remove any leftover residue from the steel wool or sandpaper.

, Slowly add an equal amount of paint. The can should be about half full after you add the paint to the water.


Mix thoroughly with a paint mixing stick. The sticks from the paint store or paint department work best for determining the thickness (viscosity) of the wash. The mixed viscosity should be “soupy” compared to the unmixed paint.
Unmixed paint will drip off the mixing stick in long thick “glops,” while the paint mixed with water will run off the mixing stick in a steady flow. The mixed paint should be thin, but definitely thicker than water. If you suspect that it is too thin, add a little more paint and mix thoroughly. A little thicker is better than too thin.
Mask off any adjoining surfaces you want protected from paint. Once completed, stir the paint mixture again to ensure a thorough mix.

, They are easier to handle and wipe clean if you make a mistake. Stir the paint mixture often to keep it mixed properly.


Dip the foam brush into the mixed wash and apply to a small section on the back side of the cabinet door. The thinned mixture should look like thin paint when applied, but some of the wood grain or previous paint color may show through slightly. This is normal.
If you are satisfied with the coverage in the test area, then completely paint the entire surface of the door using the foam brush. No special brush stroke is needed, as you will be using a clean rag to blend the finish.

, After about five minutes, use a clean, very slightly dampened rag (as described in list of materials) and gently wipe or “wash” the surface you just painted.


Do this in one smooth “wipe” from one edge to the other, going in the direction of the grain of the wood. Just “thin” the coat as you wipe; do not wipe off all the paint!

, If the paint is left too long before wiping, it will become sticky and ""peel” rather than “wash.”


If the paint is sticky as you wipe it, dip a clean bristled paint brush in clean water enough to make it damp. Lightly brush over the painted surface with the damp brush. Do not slop water all over the paint…just a damp application!
Immediately wipe with a clean rag as instructed in the step above. The dampened surface should break up the drying and allow for a smooth wiping. If it is still sticky, re-coat with another coat of the paint mixture and wipe immediately.
The result will be a streaked finish with much more of the wood grain or previous finish showing through. A streaked, opaque finish is what you want.

, If desired, apply additional coats of the black wash to hide more grain or more of the previous finish. Always allow each coat to dry completely before applying another.


If the final coat makes the cabinets too dark for your taste, use a wet (but not dripping) rag to wipe off the final coat before it has a chance to dry. If you have allowed the previous coats to dry properly, the damp rag will not affect those coats.
The idea is to have some of the grain or previous finish showing through for the proper effect.
Repeat this process on both sides of the remaining doors, on cabinets, and on drawer faces. Be patient! If you are putting on additional coats, let the previous one dry first!

, Let your black wash dry overnight before applying the clear urethane. If you skip this step, chances are your black wash will slowly disappear a little each time you clean your cabinet.


Thoroughly stir your water-based urethane finish to mix it. Do not mix by shaking. Shaking creates lots of foamy bubbles that set into the finish, preventing the surface from being smooth.
Dip a polyfoam brush into the urethane and apply over the black wash finish. One medium coat should be enough for the cabinets, but two coats will give added protection to doors and drawer faces that are frequently opened and closed.

, Reattach the hinges to the doors and carefully mount the doors onto the cabinets. Stand back and admire your work!


Clean up your supplies with soap and water. Tightly seal the cans of thinned and non-thinned paint for future use and touch-up as needed.

If there are already scratches on the furniture, that's good, they'll enhance the character of the furniture piece.

, Sand over the laminate lightly.


Only sand gently and briefly over each portion of the furniture. There is a risk of the particleboard underneath shredding if you sand too deeply.
Wear a mask and safety goggles to protect your respiratory system and eyes while sanding.

, Dispose of responsibly.

, Do this in a well-ventilated, covered area. (Note: This step cannot be skipped; the primer serves as the agent that keeps the new paint stuck to the piece of furniture.)


Follow the spray can directions. This usually includes a good shake before starting. Don't spray too closely or you'll get splatter––unless, of course, that's the distressed look you're after!
Spray several times to coat well, each time spraying thinly.
Allow for drying time between coats.

, Sand off any paint drips that have accumulated. In general, accumulated paint does not add to the distressed look but simply appears sloppy. However, that's up to you.

, Usually non-wood paint works best but experiment and see––the primer will help many paint types stay in place.


Paint two layers for a complete finish.

, This part is tricky. You can't over-sand in case you shred the particle board. Use the 80 grit sanding paper again and lightly sand ""patches"" here and there to lighten the paint in partial spots on the furniture.

Reorganize your closet so there's not as much weight on the closet rod.",How to Fix a Sagging Closet Rod1," Possible ways of doing this include:

Shift items to another closet entirely.
Unpack hanging closet storage racks and multiple garment hangers, and hang each item individually. This distributes the weight more evenly across the closet rod. Or at the very least, hang heavy storage rocks near the ends of the rod where it's less likely to sag.
Stack shoes on the closet floor, or store them in an over-the-door holder, instead of in a holder suspended from the closet rod.
Store out-of-season clothes, especially heavy sweaters, under the bed or on closet shelves instead of hanging from the closet rod.

Slide this all the way down or up, until you can see the metal cylinder underneath., You will not be able to adjust the height after this repair, so make sure you have it right. The seat of the chair should be level with your knees when you are standing.


If the chair won't stay up even when no one is on it, lay it on its side.
If the plastic skirt covers the cylinder at this height, you will need to remove the skirt first. To do this, turn the chair upside down, push the retaining clip at the base with a screwdriver, and pull off the wheels, then the skirt. Slide the wheels back on.

, Get a ¾"" (2 cm) hose clamp (Jubilee Clip) from a hardware store.Loosen the screw on the hose clamp (Jubilee Clip) and pull out the belt end. Wrap the clamp around the metal cylinder, but do not tighten it yet.

, The clamp will need to be very tight to hold the chair up. Give the clamp a better surface to grip by wrapping a strip of rubber or a couple layers of duct tape around the cylinder.Do this at the highest visible point on the cylinder,


Alternatively, scuff up this area of the cylinder with sandpaper.If the cylinder looks dirty or greasy, clean this off first.

, Slide the hose clamp to the top of the cylinder. Double check that the chair is at the correct height. Pull the hose clamp tight and fasten it by rotating the screw.

, The chair should now be unable to slide down past the clamp. The built-in height adjustment will still not work properly. If the chair is at the wrong height, move the clamp higher or lower on the cylinder.


If the clamp slides off, fasten it over a strip of rubber to improve the grip, or try the PVC pipe method below.

Measure your chair's cylinder.,
Buy a length of PVC pipe.,
Saw through the PVC pipe lengthwise.,
Snap the pipe onto the chair cylinder.,
Add more pipe to adjust the height of the chair.",How to Fix a Sinking Desk Chair2," Pull down the plastic skirt cover the extendable, metal cylinder. Estimate the diameter of the cylinder by holding a ruler across it horizontally. Also measure the length of the cylinder when the chair is at the perfect height.


You shouldn't need an exact measurement, but you can calculating the diameter from the circumference if you prefer to be precise.

, This pipe will fit over the pneumatic cylinder of the chair. It should be about the same size as the cylinder diameter, or slightly larger. Pipe 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in diameter works well for most models.Buy enough straight pipe to extend from the wheel base of your chair to the seat, when the chair is at the preferred height.


The pipe does not have to be in one piece. It may be easier to work with in smaller pieces, although you can easily cut it yourself at home.
One user reports using a tall stack of plastic shower rings instead of PVC pipe. These are even cheaper and easier to install, but they may not be sturdy enough to support your weight. Try at your own risk.

, Secure the pipe in a vise. Use a hacksaw or back saw to cut through the pipe from tip to tip, but only on one side. The end result should be a pipe with a slit in it, not two half-pipes.


Wearing a mask or respirator is recommended while cutting PVC to avoid inhaling irritating particles.If you do not have a vise or cutting tools, just leave the pipe intact and remove the chair's wheels so you can slide on the pipe. In most cases, you can remove the wheel base by pressing a retaining clip on the underside with a screwdriver., Pull the chair's plastic skirt up or down to reveal the metal cylinder. Push the slit side of the PVC pipe against the cylinder to snap it around the cylinder. It should now hold the chair in place, preventing it from sliding down.


If you're having trouble snapping the pipe on, saw it into shorter pieces and try again.

, If the chair is still too low, raise it and snap on another piece of pipe. You will not be able to lower the chair again without removing the pipe, so make sure you set it to the perfect height.

, You can use an old soft toothbrush on the smoother portions of the wicker. In the weave around the legs, you may want to use a new, soft paintbrush with an inch cut off the ends of the bristles. This gives you a slightly stiffer brush yet gives you enough bristle to reach into corners and hard to reach areas.

Test your recliner's tension.,
Tilt the recliner forward.,
Look for an adjustment mechanism.,
Rotate the mechanism.,
Test the adjustment.,
Repeat as needed.",How to Adjust a Recliner Chair1," ""Recliner tension"" refers to how easily the backrest of the recliner leans backward. Sit in the recliner and lean back against the backrest. If it's too difficult to lean back, you'll need to decrease the recliner tension. It can also be a good idea to decrease the tension if you have a petite build since reclining the chair will then require less strength.
If the recliner leans too far back for comfort, or if it leans back too easily, you may need to increase the recliner tension. This is usually a good idea for heavier individuals, taller individuals, and people needing firmer back support.;
, Make sure the back is in the upright position and the footrest is closed, and carefully tilt the entire recliner forward, to expose the underside of the chair.


Rest the recliner on the front of the armrests and the top of its back. You may need both hands to adjust the tension, and the process will be difficult to complete if you attempt to hold the chair the entire time.

, Recliners with adjustable recliner tension should have a pair of thumb wheels or wing nuts beneath the seat. If no mechanism is present, you may not be able to adjust the tension.Look for a thumb wheel or wing nut on the right and left of the underside of the chair. Each one should be positioned at the end of a bolt, and tension springs should be connected to the same bolt from the other side.
The exact placement of the mechanism may vary by manufacturer and model, but in most cases, the mechanism can be found beneath the seat and toward the back of the recliner. In some instances, the mechanism might be positioned more toward the bottom center.

, Turn the thumb wheels or wing nuts clockwise to increase the reclining tension. Turn them counterclockwise to decrease the tension.Both wing nuts and thumb wheels should be adjusted in the same way when you're dealing with recliner tension, so the basic instructions should remain the same.
Try turning the mechanism with your fingers. If it feels too tight, you may need to use sturdy pliers instead.
Work in small increments. Only turn each wheel or nut by a quarter turn each time, and repeat each adjustment on both sides of the chair to keep the tension even throughout.

, Return the recliner to its upright position. Sit in the chair and check the recliner tension by extending the leg rest out and leaning back in the chair.


If the recliner tension feels comfortable enough, you can end the process here and relax in your newly adjusted chair.
If the recliner tension still feels too loose or too stiff, further adjustments will be needed.

, Continue adjusting the recliner’s tension as needed by following the same steps. Close the footrest, tilt the chair forward, and rotate the adjustment mechanism in the proper direction.


Only adjust the tension by one-quarter turns each time. It might seem tempting to make larger adjustments, but doing so will usually cause you to overcompensate and may adjust the tension too far in the other direction.
Never loosen or tighten the adjustment mechanism all the way. Doing so can cause permanent damage to the tension spring.
The tension spring should be unable to move on the bolt after your adjustments. If it does move around, it is too loose, and you should turn the mechanism at least one clockwise half-turn.
Similarly, if the spring becomes completely compressed and too tight, turn the mechanism at least one counterclockwise half-turn to remedy the problem.

Turn your recliner over.,
Identify the attachment points for the tension springs.,
Remove the old, damaged springs with pliers.,
Purchase heavy duty replacement springs.,
Stretch the springs.,
Install the springs.,
Remove the nickels separating the coils.,
Return the recliner to the upright position to test the springs.",How to Adjust a Recliner Chair2," With the footrest down and the back in an upright position, gently flip the recliner forward to reveal the frame underneath the seat of the recliner.

, Look on either side of the recliner for clips or tabs where springs attach. If the springs are still present, you just need to locate where they attach to the frame on either end of the spring.

, Firmly grasp one end of the spring and disconnect the spring from the frame by pulling and twisting it loose with pliers.


Be careful when removing the spring as it will be under high tension.
Wear safety goggles to prevent eye damage from potential flying metal.

, The best springs to use in a recliner would be manufacturer replacement parts made for your recliner model.


Contact a local recliner retailer to inquire if they provide replacement parts.
Search online for recliner repair or parts dealers.
If exact matches can’t be found, ask a retailer which springs would be compatible with your recliner model.

, Place a screwdriver through the loop on each end of the spring. Pull the spring apart gently. Slide a nickel in between each coil of the spring to separate the coils. You can also use washers in place of nickels., Connect one end of the spring to the attachment point of the frame. Using a pair of pliers, pull the spring to attach to the frame at the other end.


Be extremely careful when working with springs under tension. Locking adjustable pliers are good to ensure you have a solid grip on the spring.

, Gently pull the nickels from between each coil with a pair of pliers. Once the nickels are removed the spring will return to its normal tension.


Ensure the spring is securely attached at both ends prior to removing the nickels.

, Flip the recliner back over and sit in it. Lean against the backrest to test the tension of the springs. There should be some resistance when you lean the backrest back. If the resistance isn’t right, you may need to try another set of springs.

Sit in the recliner in the upright position.,
Tilt the recliner forward.,
Locate the cam bolts.,
Loosen the back bolts.,
Remove the front bolts.,
Adjust the frame.,
Return the front bolts.,
Tighten the back bolts.,
Test the pitch.",How to Adjust a Recliner Chair3," Place your back against the backrest without reclining. Evaluate your recliner’s pitch for optimum comfort. ""Recliner pitch"" refers to the height of the chair front when the recliner is in its closed, upward position. You can usually adjust the pitch by altering the appropriate bolts at the bottom of the chair.


If the recliner pitch is too high, your feet won't be able to touch the floor when you sit down. Adjust the pitch downward.
If the recliner pitch is too low, your knees will bend upward and above the seat when you're sitting down, which may lead to discomfort and an unhealthy posture. Consider adjusting the pitch upward.

, With the back in an upright position and the leg rest closed, lean the entire recliner forward to expose the underside of the chair.


Allow the recliner to rest on the top of its back and the tips of its armrests when you lean it forward. Doing so frees up both hands, making it easier to make the necessary adjustments to your chair.

, You'll need to adjust the bolts holding the cam, or full base mechanism, securely in place. These bolts are typically located toward the center bottom of the chair.Note that these bolts are not the same as your recliner tension bolts. Your recliner tension bolts feed into the recliner spring, but the cam bolts are located in the metal frame of your base mechanism.
Typically, there should be a total of four bolts holding the frame in place. Look for two bolts at the back of the frame (one on either side of the chair) and two bolts at the front of the frame (one on either side of the chair).

, Use an appropriately sized wrench to loosen the cam bolts on either side of the bottom mechanism.


Make the bolts loose enough for you to wiggle the chair around, but do not loosen them completely. Do not remove the bolts or allow them to drop out of the frame.
Note that cordless power ratchets might be easier to use than mechanical wrenches for this task. Either option should be acceptable, though.

, Using a wrench or cordless power ratchet, loosen and completely remove the two cam bolts at the front of the bottom mechanism.


Unlike the back bolts, the front bolts must be completely removed. Keep them nearby and in a safe place, however, since you'll be needing them again soon.

, Move the front of the frame up or down to adjust its position. Doing so will also adjust the recliner pitch.


Slide the frame up and back to bring the front of the chair closer to the ground, to increase its front pitch. Push the frame down and forward to draw the front of the chair further away from the ground, thereby increasing its rear pitch.
Look at the slot at the front of the cam. This area is where the front cam bolts fit. For most recliners, the slot has grooves that allow for five different settings, and two sets of holes for the bolts to fit through. In total, you can usually alter the pitch to as many as nine different settings.
Even small adjustments can make a big difference in the pitch of the recliner once you test it out, so it's best to work in small increments.

, Once you've positioned the cam as desired, insert the front bolts back into the bottom frame.


Loosely twist the bolts into the correct holes using your fingers. Check the positioning before you continue. Both bolts should be fitted into the same position on either side of the chair.
Once the bolts are properly positioned, use a wrench or power ratchet to tighten them securely in place.

, Using a wrench or cordless power ratchet, completely tighten the back bolts of the recliner.


Try to wiggle the bottom mechanism or frame after tightening all four bolts. It should remain firm and stationary. If not, check and re-tighten the bolts as needed.

, Return the chair to its upright position and sit down. Your feet should be able to touch the floor and your knees should be bent at an approximate right angle.


To maintain proper posture, your body should be positioned in right angles at the knees, hips, and elbows. You should also have approximately 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) of space in between the edge of the chair and the back of your calf.If the pitch is correct, no further adjustments are needed. You can stop here and relax in your newly adjusted chair.
If the pitch is still incorrect, continue adjusting it as needed to fix the problem. Repeat the same sequence of steps to make these additional adjustments.

Remove the existing finish from the wood furniture.,
Clean away the sanding dust.,
Mix a paste using water and oxalic acid.,
Apply the oxalic acid paste to the wood furniture.,
Wipe away the oxalic acid paste.,
Match the furniture's stain color.,
Refinish the wood furniture.",How to Bleach Stains On Furniture," In the area surrounding the water stains, the finish will need to be stripped off. The most straightforward way to do this is to sand the finish away using medium-grit sandpaper. If the water stains cover a large portion of the furniture's surface, you may want to strip the finish from the entire piece of furniture to avoid the difficulty of matching the new finish to the existing one.;
, After sanding, use a dry tack cloth to remove all of the dust from the furniture. Removing this dust will allow you more control over the bleach application and will prevent you from marring the new finish of the furniture.

, Oxalic acid is a mild bleach that is sold in hardware stores, usually in the form of small crystals. In a plastic cup, mix 3 parts oxalic acid crystals to 1 part hot water, stirring until the mixture is dissolved. Do not use a metal container or a metal utensil when making this mixture, as the oxalic acid can discolor the metal.

, Use a foam paintbrush to liberally apply the bleach paste to the areas where the furniture is discolored. On softwoods such as pine, the mixture will only need a few minutes to soak. Bleaching hardwood furniture will require 1 or 2 hours of soaking.

, Use paper towels to wipe away all of the paste after it has penetrated the wood thoroughly. If the water stains remain, you can use a second application and increase the soaking time. Excess paste can be cleaned away by moistening the paper towels with water.


Note that the oxalic acid will lighten the color of the wood, especially if the wood has been stained a darker color. You will need to try to match this stain in the areas you bleached to restore the furniture's uniform appearance.
If you are worried about matching the furniture's stain precisely, you can apply oxalic acid to the entire piece. In this case, you can use an equal ratio of water to oxalic acid crystals to make a thin wash that can be easily spread over the entire piece.
Wiping down the surface with vinegar after removing the paste will help neutralize any remaining bleach. This ensures that any wood stain that you apply later does not lighten in color.

, Apply a wood stain to the areas where you bleached the water stains away to deepen their color back to the original tint. You can control the intensity of a color achieved with a given wood stain by varying the time you leave it on the wood.

, The final step after bleaching away the water stains from your furniture is to apply a protective finish. Polyurethane, tung oil, and Danish oil are 3 popular options for finishing wood furniture.

Screw the new faucet onto the pipe using your hands to rotate the faucet.,
Screw the handle back onto the stem.,
Turn back on the water and test to see if the faucet works without leaking.",How to Change a Bathtub Faucet1," This should always be the first step when taking on any plumbing project in your home.


Also have some rags and a bucket handy in case you need to clean up water quickly.;
, The faucet stems are the parts of your faucet that control the flow of water. There are a ton of different styles out there but they all fall into two general categories: washerless or washer-type. While changing out these two different types of faucets is very similar, you will need to know what type you have in order to replace it with the appropriate type.


A washerless faucet has a single handle that rests on top of a metal plate. This type of faucet controls the mixing of hot and cold with one handle.
A washer-type faucet usually has two or three handles. With this type of stem, you have to adjust the mix of hot and cold with two separate handles. If you have a third handle, it is usually to divert water between the tub and a shower head.

, If changing out a washer-type faucet, open up both the hot and cold water handles to make sure neither has any water pressure.

, Some handles will have a decorative cover, concealing the screws underneath. If so, gently pop off the decorative cover with a flat-head screwdriver.

, The mechanism behind the handle will vary quite a bit, depending on model and maker of the faucet., The entire stem should disconnect from the water pipes. Use caution when removing the stem of the faucet.


Pay attention to whether the exposed pipe has a “male” (exterior threads) or “female” (interior threads) connection. This will be important when buying the replacement.
If you cannot easily figure out how to remove it, you may want to consult a professional. Damaging the pipes inside the wall when removing the stem could cost you a lot more in the end than hiring a plumber to replace your faucet in the first place. Not to mention that they have the right tools for the job!, While the mechanism inside the stems can fail, leaks at the stem are usually caused by worn washers. If this is the case with yours, consider simply replacing the washers and keeping your faucet. It is much easier, cheaper, and less wasteful to replace the washers instead of the whole faucet.

, This new faucet should have the same measurements as your old faucet so that it can easily screw into the wall.


Make sure that the valves on the faucet have a connection that will screw onto either the male or female bathtub pipe connection. If the connection is “male-male,” for instance, then you will need to purchase an adapter.

, Wrap the exposed threads on either the faucet or the bathtub pipe with Teflon tape to prevent leakage.


If your new faucet does not look like it will attach easily to your pipes, don't be afraid to return it and try another. It will be easier to get a new faucet in the style of the old one than to alter your plumbing.

, Tighten the connection by hand until the faucet is tightly attached to the pipe and in the right position to turn “on” and “off” the water supply.

, Remember the position they were in before you removed them and be sure to reattach them in that same position.

, If you have a leak, check that the connection points you just made are tight enough.

Also have some rags and a bucket handy in case you need to clean up water quickly.

, There are several different ways the spout could be connected, depending on how it is internally connected to the plumbing.


Look for set screws on the top or bottom of the spout.This will indicate that you have a slip-on spout. This type will slip off easily once the set screw is removed.
If your spout doesn't have a set screw, then it is probably a screw-on style spout. Rotate the spout counterclockwise, being cautious and gentle but holding onto it firmly with a wrench if need be.

, If it looks to be in good shape, with no rusting or cracks, then it does not need to be replaced. Measure how far it comes out of the wall. This will help you when buying your replacement faucet spout.

, Make sure that whatever you buy will fit onto your existing plumbing or buy whatever fittings will make a new secure connection between your old plumbing and your new spout.


There are two basic kinds of spouts, one's with diverters and ones without.The diverter directs water to a shower head, instead of out the lower spout. If your old spout had a diverter, be sure that the one you buy has one as well.

, Follow the manufacturer's directions, making sure that your connections are secure and sealed well.

, If you have a leak, check that the connection points you just made are tight enough and try it out again.

Place a flat, hard object underneath the mattress.",How to Fix a Squeaking Bed Frame," This should clue you in to the general location of the squeak. Pay particular attention to the joints and corners of your bed frame, as these are common noisemakers.


If you can’t enlist an aide for this task, you can move across your bed yourself. It will give you less flexibility, on account of your ears needing to stay relatively close to the rest of your body as it moves across the mattress, but this can still provide the necessary information.
Lift your mattress and box spring up if you’re unsure where your bed frame’s joints are, or drop to the floor and look at your bed from beneath it. At the very least, many bed frames will have support (and corresponding joints) width-wise along the head and foot of the bed, and length-wise along the middle.;
, If crawling across the bed wasn’t sufficiently illuminating, you (or your helper) should go to the foot of your bed, grab hold of the bar or footboard, and gently rock your bed back and forth (pushing toward, and pulling from, the headboard and pillows). If you have help, again listen to your bed’s joints and corners while this is going on.


Not too rough! Any bed will start squeaking if you really go to town on it. Push gently, with a slow rhythm.

, If you’re still in the dark, you might have an easier time finding the squeak once you’ve isolated the major components. It’s also possible that the culprit isn’t your bed frame at all, but your mattress.


The mattress and box spring take up a lot of room, but find somewhere you can lay both down flat on the ground, as if they were on your bed. This will allow you to continue to effectively test them.

, Repeat the techniques above, now that your bed has been partially disassembled. Gently rock your bed frame, and crawl across your mattress and box spring with a friend listening closely (or vice-versa).


If you locate a prominent squeak in your box spring, this can be efficiently treated by applying WD-40 to the base of the specific, noisy spring.

, In the event that you’ve been unable to locate your squeak, you might need to broaden your investigation. The squeak could be coming not from the bed, but from a loose floor board beneath you bed. It could also be caused by unevenness in your floor.


Towels or folded-up sheets under a leg of the bed frame might solve minor floor-height discrepancies, but you should consider moving your bed to a spot in your home with more even flooring, if possible.
Keep in mind that it might not be a single squeak you’re dealing with, but two or more. Be thorough in your assessment.

, Before you entirely disassemble your bed, try tightening its bolts. This is a relatively simple task. You need only to determine the size of the bolt or screw, obtain an appropriate wrench (if it’s a bolt) or screwdriver (if it’s a screw), and then tighten them.


If you’ve been unable to isolate the squeak, try tightening every fastener on your bed.
With older, wooden beds held together by nails, tightening the fasteners (or taking the frame entirely apart) is not really an option. In this case, application of a lubricant to each intersection of support slat and bed frame will go a long way toward silencing the bed.
If a bolt continues to back out and loosen itself, it may need to be replaced (with a cost of roughly 50 cents). If the holes that the bolts go through are worn, however, this would indicate it may be time to rework or replace the frame.
Keeping the bolts tight will greatly increase the life of a metal frame, because the bolts can't ream out the holes as easily.

, To properly lubricate the squeak, you’ll need to be able to coat every component of the joint with wax or grease. With your mattress and box spring off the frame, unscrew the bolt or screw at the problem joint.

, Look for potential balance problems, such as an uneven floor or a damaged leg. Some bed frames use hard, plastic wheels at the corners and plastic standouts in the center of the frame; over time, this arrangement may distort the balance of the bed frame if the bed is on a soft surface, such as a carpet.


Removing the center standout from your frame and adding another type of support (e.g., a couple of books and a jar lid) might help.

, You’ll want to coat everything in wax or grease: the nut, the screw, the washer, the bolt, the aperture in the frame itself, and any other component that may be a part of your bed. The squeaking is being caused by friction, which you will reduce by lubricating every surface. WD-40 or a similar substance also works, as will any oil, silicon, or lithium based lubricant, though they tend to emit strong odors. Open your windows and air out your room for several hours before sleeping on the bed, to avoid nauseating fumes.
Paraffin wax is an excellent choice for lubricating your bed’s joints, and is sold in bar form at many supermarkets.
A bar of soap, candle wax, skateboard wax, or surfing wax are items you might have on hand that you could use to grease up these contact points.

, For wooden beds which connect through pegs and not bolts, you don't really have anything to tighten. Instead, try sliding corking or furniture pads between the pieces of your bed frame to provide cushioning. You can place it around the pegs as necessary, or get crafty and cut small holes in the pad or corking for the pegs to pass through.

, You’ve got to sleep in this thing, right? After you’ve thoroughly lubricated the components of your bed frame, put it back together. Ensure your frame’s fasteners are tight, but don’t force them once they won’t move for you.


If your frame has wheels, turn the middle wheels toward opposite corners of the room.

, These should be wedged in each corner, laid out as smoothly as possible, and along each slat or metal bar if you have enough towels (or towel substitutes). These should prevent your box spring from shifting too much within the frame. After you’ve placed them, carefully replace the box spring.


Repeating the tests of part one are recommended at this point.

, An object bracing your frame can provide support to a squeaky frame. This can lessen extant squeaks, and prevent your bed frame from loosening as time goes on.


Corking, furniture pads, towels, or multiple other objects can also serve this purpose.

, Uneven weight distribution often results in a squeaky sleep experience. Mattress can easily become misaligned, especially if you don’t sleep alone.

, Again, balancing the weight distribution on the springs can often make a huge difference. Mattress manufacturers recommend that you periodically rotate the mattress to ensure even wear and tear.


Older mattresses should be flipped as well, though newer mattresses are designed so that flipping unnecessary. If you have a coil or foam mattress, however, flipping it wouldn’t be bad; the only mattress you should absolutely not flip is a pillow-top. Box springs should also be rotated, but should never be flipped.

, A piece of plywood is appropriate for this. The added pressure may not remove the squeaking entirely, but will certainly reduce it. You should feel minimal additional firmness when lying on your mattress.


If you found a particularly squeaky spot during your earlier investigation, try placing a hardcover book directly underneath it instead.

Line shelves or drawers, if desired.,
Move into your new closet.",How to Install Closet Organizers," Is it a bedroom where you will store mostly clothes, or does the room have some other purpose, like a craft room, play room, or computer room?

Notice which side of the closet you naturally approach or open first, especially if it has two doors. Your preference may be because of the room layout or your tendency to be right- or left-handed. Plan to put the most frequently-used items where they're easiest to reach.




 Look familiar?

Notice anything that ends up in piles or hanging on doorknobs in or around the closet.
If you just moved in, try using the room and the closet as-is for awhile. It's not that much trouble to empty a closet when the time comes to work on it, and you'll learn about your usage patterns.;
, Measure height and depth in addition to width.


Check where the studs are because this will also help determine your plan. The mounting screws must go into studs and not just drywall.
Also, measure how much the frame of the closet and how much it overhangs the space inside.

, Give some consideration to the choice of materials.

Compare materials. Metal wire shelves are inexpensive and reasonably strong, but they may not have the aesthetics of finished melamine. Melamine and manufactured wood products can be finished to resemble wood, but they are generally costlier and heavier than wire.
Decide whether appearance is important. It may be important for a large, walk-in closet in a master bedroom or for any exposed storage that is acting as a closet. In a broom closet, on the other hand, it may not matter.
Compare costs of different systems and stores. Home improvement and hardware stores often carry closet organization systems. So do container and organization stores, not to mention IKEA. Shop around.
Note what parts are in stock at your local store(s) and what other pieces can be ordered.
Pick up a brochure or catalog showing what parts are available, so that you can decide which parts will fit your closet. While you're in the store, get a price list or write down prices of the parts you think you will use.
Understand what's involved in assembling the different systems and make sure you're up to the task. Most of them are fairly straightforward, aimed at do-it-yourselfers.
Ask which pieces (shelves, rods, and even support rails) can easily be cut to a custom length if the standard length doesn't quite fit your closet. Many of the stores selling closet systems can even cut the pieces for you, so ask if cutting is available and how much it costs.

,

For your final plan, draw to scale. In general, you will draw an elevation of the closet, the view you will have when you open both doors, but you should also check the depth to make sure that hanging items and shelves fit.

, In a clothing closet, hanging storage will probably occupy most of the space and cost relatively little, so plan it first and give it an ample share of the space.

Measure your existing rods and how much clothing you have, in rod length occupied by hangers, adding enough space to slide hangers apart for easy hanging and selection.
Arrange hanging storage so that it hangs well back from the door. Remember that rods for hanging clothing need clearance both in front of and behind them.
Plan in terms of upper and lower rods, with rods for longer hanging items like dresses and bathrobes. Many closet systems will allow double hanging for shorter items such as pants and shirts. Measure how long your longest garments hang.
If this is a shared closet, consider how you can use the closet system to divide the space, giving each user their own rods, shelves, and so on. Try to divide the space equitably, but consider who will store more belongings there.

, This depends on whether you will be storing clothing or other small objects in the closet. Drawers and baskets are among the more costly items you can install in most closet systems.





 Another source of drawer storage.

If you have a dresser, captain's bed, or other storage elsewhere, you may not need drawers in the closet.




 Bins organize craft supplies.

Placing bins or baskets on shelving may be a cheaper, more flexible option for storing and organizing small objects in a closet. Choose drawers if you need frequent access; shelving if you don't mind a bin-and-basket approach, or if you need flexibility.

, Measure the height of the tallest objects that will go on shelves to help determine the spacing., Do you keep a clothes hamper in the closet? Do you want it to be built in or loose?, Will you make space for sports equipment? Will you put your DVD player out of sight, in the closet?, Will this closet house a sewing machine or computer? Be sure to leave space for the user of these items to access them comfortably., If this space is also near the top of the door to the closet, make sure that the shelf up there is shallow enough that objects can pass through the space between the door and the shelf.,,

Incorporate starter kits, if they are available, with a few basic accessories. Often, buying several items as a kit costs less than buying them individually, so compare prices. For a larger closet, you may be able to combine multiple kits with a few connecting pieces.
Shelves can usually be shortened if the standard lengths don't quite fit. Often, the store selling the shelving can help you to cut it down, particularly for metal wire shelving.
Consider the height of the user. Kids may not be able to reach upper shelves and rods until they grow. Shorter people and people in wheelchairs may want certain rods and shelves lower, too.

, Include any hardware (screws, etc.) that is not in the kits. Take this list to the store., Take a vehicle large enough for the widest and longest parts., You'll also need some floor space away from the project to assemble things like drawers if you're using them.

Now is the time to paint the closet, if you want to.
Lift sliding doors off their tracks for better access.

, It is very important that your mounting screws go into studs and not just drywall., Depending on the closet system you choose, these will generally be horizontal or vertical metal rails. In any case, make sure that the holes where you will put the screws line up with studs.,, You may be able to mark right through the mounting holes. Mark the bracket edge location, if you want.

Mark holes so that you can find both the horizontal and vertical location after you remove the bracket.

, Make them about the same size or a little smaller than the minor diameter (smaller diameter) of the screw thread., Line them up again and drive long screws through the brackets and into the walls., Most closet systems will come with instructions specific to the design., Read the manufacturer's instructions for specific details., to the support rails or to the walls as required. Here again, secure into the wall studs or, if necessary, use bolts designed for use in drywall.,, For laminate shelves on adjustable pegs, make sure each shelf has four pegs and that all four are pushed in all the way and have the flat side up, supporting the shelf. Screw them in if the peg design requires it.,, Shelf liners can keep wooden and laminate shelves looking nicer longer, block moisture and spills, keep things from sliding around or, in the case of metal shelves, take up the space between wires so that smaller objects don't fall through.,

This would be a great time to organize the contents of your closet or storage space and throw out what you don't need.

Remove the toilet tank lid.,
Turn off the water supply to the toilet.,
Examine the float and fill valve.,
Use a screwdriver to raise the float height.,
Flush the toilet to test the water level.",How to Increase the Water Level in Toilet Bowl1," Lift the lid off of the tank and set it aside on a flat, stable surface. You’ll now have access to the flushing mechanisms inside the tank. Take note of the water level inside the tank. If it seems excessively high or low, the issue may be a faulty flapper or fill valve.Be careful not to drop the lid or set it somewhere that it might fall. Toilet tank lids are made of ceramic and can break fairly easily.
The water in the tank should ordinarily rest an inch or two below the fill valve and overflow tube (the large open pipe near the center of the tank).;
, Locate the external water valve on the wall behind and beneath the toilet. Rotate the oblong knob clockwise as far as it will go, then flush the toilet. After it flushes, the tank will not refill itself. This will allow you to work inside the tank unobstructed.Keep turning the knob until you hear the water stop running.
You should not attempt to adjust or repair any of the mechanisms inside the toilet tank without first emptying it.

, Look over the flushing mechanisms to see what kind of condition they’re in. In particular, you’re looking for the toilet tank’s float, which will appear as a plastic ball attached to a long arm at the top of the fill valve. The height of the float determines how much water remains in the tank after it refills.Make sure the float is properly connected to the fill valve and fill valve and overflow tube are both above water level.
If you notice any obvious damage or defects, you might need to call a professional to have the part repaired.

, Directly on top of the fill valve you should see a single screw. Turn this screw clockwise one full rotation. This will elevate the float and permit more water to enter the tank before the fill valve closes, increasing the water level in the toilet bowl as a result.You should only make minor alterations to the height of the float. Doing too much at once could cause the toilet to flush inconsistently or create other new issues.

, Turn the water to the toilet back on and give the tank a minute or two to fill up. After you’ve flushed the toilet, observe the water level in the bowl. Ideally, the bowl should be about halfway full. If the water in the bowl still looks low, try adjusting the float again until yo get it right.Raise the float about half an inch at a time, then perform a test flush.
If there’s is still an inadequate amount of water in the bowl after adjusting the float, call a plumber.

Raise the float one half inch.",How to Increase the Water Level in Toilet Bowl2," Some newer toilets are equipped with more modern one-piece floats (also sometimes known as “floating cups”) rather than the old fashioned ball-and-arm design. These types of floats have been engineered as solid cylinders fitted to the shaft of the fill valve itself. If you have a fill valve with a cylinder float, you can adjust the water level in your toilet in just a few seconds.


These types of valves are easy to install, remove and perform maintenance on, and can be set manually even by inexperienced users.
If you’re still using a valve with a ball-and-arm float, it’s recommended that you upgrade.Turn off the water supply, then flush the toilet to empty the tank before you start working.

, The adjustment stem is a long, slender tube that connects to the larger fill valve. In most models, it will either run parallel with the valve or extend horizontally out from the top. The adjustment stem is used increase or decrease the amount of water in the tank.Take some time to familiarize yourself with the construction of the mechanisms inside your toilet tank before making any drastic changes.
Some types of cylinder floats can be positioned by squeezing a release clip on the float itself and simply raising or lowering it to the desired height., Use two fingers to grasp the notched dial on the end of the stem. Twist the stem counterclockwise one full rotation. This will cause the float to rise gradually. Once you’ve found a suitable height for the float, replace the toilet lid and turn the water valve back on.If you’re having trouble turning the adjustment stem, see if there’s a notch for you to use a screwdriver.Flush the toilet a couple of times to check whether the water level in the bowl has risen if not, the float may need further fine-tuning.

Shut off the water and drain the toilet.,
Detach the fill valve from the outside of the toilet tank.,
Lift the worn out valve out of the tank.,
Slide the new fill valve into place.",How to Increase the Water Level in Toilet Bowl3," If you've adjusted the height of the float and your toilet is still low, you may need a whole new fill valve. In order to install the replacement valve, the toilet tank needs to be completely empty. Otherwise, you’ll have a mess on your hands when you try to remove the defective valve unit.Replacing a fill valve involves opening the hole at the base of the tank, which can cause whatever water is remaining in the tank to pour out onto the floor.

, To do this, you’ll need to unscrew the large nut and slide off any washers connecting the small water supply hose to the base of the toilet tank. Pull the hose out of the bottom of the valve, which should now be plainly exposed.You may need to use a wrench or pair of pliers to loosen the nut.
Lay down a towel in case any residual water leaks out of the detached water supply hose.

, Extract the entire fill valve unit, including the attached float. The unit should simply come out in one piece.Be careful not to accidentally damage or dislodge any of the other mechanisms inside the tank.
Discard the old valve, or consider having it repaired and keeping it on hand in case of an unforeseen leak.

, Fit the bottom portion of the valve through the hole in the base of the tank so that the rest of the unit sits upright. Then, reattach the water supply hose, slide the washers back into place and tighten the nut. Turn the water back on and give the toilet a test flush to ensure that the new valve is working properly.Make sure the hose, nut and washers are all tightened and secure before restoring water to the toilet.
Valves that make use of cylinder floats are less likely to experience mishaps than traditional ball-and-arm floats, which means you won’t have to replace your valve again for years.

Turn off the water to the toilet.,
Remove the toilet tank lid.,
Inspect the toilet’s internal flushing mechanisms.,
Repair or replace faulty parts.",How to Increase Water Pressure in a Toilet1," Before you get started, you’ll want to make sure that there’s no water running to your toilet while you’re examining it or making adjustments. Find the shutoff valve on the wall near the base of the toilet and turn it clockwise to stop the flow of water. Then, flush the toilet to drain the tank.Prior to draining the toilet tank, test for possible leaks by squeezing a few drops of food coloring into the tank and checking back the following morning. If the water in the bowl has changed colors, it means you’ve got a leak.
Rotate the shutoff valve until it stops turning to ensure that the water is completely off.;
, Lift the lid carefully off the back of the toilet and rest it on a flat, stable surface. You should now have an obstructed view of the inner workings of the toilet. From here, you can start searching for the culprit of a weak flush or low overall water level.The majority of water flow problems can usually be traced to the components located in the tank of the toilet.Be careful not to drop the lid or handle it carelessly, or it could break.

, Take stock of each of the individual pieces in the tank. Look carefully for any signs of cracking, chipping, warping or tearing. Gradual wear can eventually lead to leaks and improper filling. When these issues occur, it can cause malfunctions in the toilet’s flushing action.While the toilet tank contains many small parts, your attention should be focused on the two main components: the fill valve and the flush valve. The fill valve is a narrow vertical tube that refills the tank, while the flush valve is an opening at the bottom of the tank fitted with a rubber or plastic flapper on a chain that releases water when the toilet is flushed.Pay particular attention to the condition of the ballcock arm (balloon-like rubber ball on the fill valve that gauges the water level), and the chain on the flush valve.

, After identifying the part responsible for the feeble flush, make a note of its exact specifications, then take a trip down to your local home improvement store to purchase a replacement. You can attempt to put in the new part yourself by following a basic instructional guide, or call a plumber, who will have the part you need along with the know-how to install it professionally.Broken and damaged parts should always be replaced as soon as they’re brought to your attention to avoid more extensive repairs later on.
Only buy parts that are compatible with the model of toilet you're repairing.

You should see a white plastic tube called an overflow tube in the tank.






Attached to the tube will be the flapper guides, two arms that hold either side of the rubber flapper. This sits near the bottom of the overflow tube.






Attached to the guide arms is the flapper, a round piece of rubber that is supposed to fit tightly in a hole in the bottom of the tank.






Attached to the top of the flapper will be a chain or metal rod.






The chain or rod is hooked to a bar at the top of the tank, which is generally attached to a mechanism on the overflow pipe near the top.






There is another rod in the toilet that turns on and shuts off the flow of water into the tank. The level of water can be controlled by a float ball on a rod or by a mechanism that turns like a dial.







,


When you push down on the flush handle the bar at the top lifts, pulling the flapper out of the hole.






The flapper floats for a moment but as the water drains out of the tank it should settle back into the hole, closing it off.






After the flapper closes the hole the toilet fills with water to the top of the overflow tube, when it should stop.







, Generally they hook into holes in the rod. Use the middle hole first. Try another if the flapper doesn’t seal right.

,, There are 2 ways.


Move the hook on the chain to a different hole on the bar.






Move the hook on the chain further down to shorten it.






The chain should be fairly straight between the flapper and the bar when the flapper is properly seated in the hole.







, Otherwise you can straighten the wire and bend it back a little shorter.

,,, There should be a turn off valve below the tank. In some cases you may need to go into a basement beneath the toilet to find the valve.

,,, You may need to turn it off and try again.

, This is a simple job. Just follow the package directions.

Empty the toilet tank.,
Locate the fill valve.,
Reset the height of the fill valve.,
Test the toilet’s flush.",How to Increase Water Pressure in a Toilet2," In order to increase the amount of water released with each flush, you’ll need to have access to the tank. Shut off the water supply, remove the lid and hit the plunger to drain the tank. Once this is done, you’ll be able to work unobstructed.Do not attempt to change your toilet’s fill level while there’s still water in the tank.

, On most standard toilets, this will appear as a large upright tube positioned on one side of the tank. This is the part that controls how much water enters the tank when the toilet refills. Your toilet’s fill valve will most likely have either a ballcock or floating cylinder construction—both can be tweaked manually in just a couple of minutes.Ballcock valves make use of a floating rubber ball to gauge the water level, while cylinder valves can be set to designate the cutoff point.If there’s any obvious damage to your toilet’s fill valve, the wisest option is to simply purchase a new one.

, If your toilet uses a ballcock design with a floating rubber ball attached to a separate arm, you can manually adjust the water level by twisting the stem at the top of the arm counterclockwise. If it uses a newer sliding cylinder construction, simply pinch the clips on the edge of the cylinder and raise or lower it to the desired height.You may need to use a screwdriver, coin or some other slender object to change the position of a ballcock stem.Take note of the normal water level, as indicated by hard water discoloration. This will give you an idea how much water is typically needed to achieve a satisfactory flush.
On some newer toilets, the manufacturers specify the optimal fill level with a line etched on the interior wall of the tank., Turn the water supply to the toilet back on and wait for the tank to refill. Lift the toilet seat and flush. If you’re satisfied with the flush, replace the toilet tank lid and continue using your toilet as usual. If not, continue adjusting the height of the fill valve to improve the flushing power to your liking.


It may take you a few unsuccessful tries before you finally get the water level exactly where you want it.
Be careful not to set your toilet tank to overfill. This will cause it to run incessantly in an effort to drain excess water, which is wasteful and expensive."

Shut off the toilet’s water supply.,
Fill the tank with vinegar.,
Place duct tape over the siphon jets.,
Flush the toilet.,
Remove the tape and clear the jets.",How to Increase Water Pressure in a Toilet3," Locate the shutoff valve and turn it clockwise to cut off the water flow to the toilet. Remove the toilet tank lid and set it aside.Since your toilet will be out of commission for half an hour or more while you clean it, schedule the project for a low-traffic time so that it won’t be an inconvenience.

, Pour in roughly ½-1 gallon of pure distilled white vinegar. Depending on the exact size of your toilet tank, you may need to use slightly more vinegar—it should be enough to totally submerge the flush valve.Vinegar contains mild natural acids, which makes it perfect for disinfecting and dissolving dirt and grime safely.Make sure the rubber flap of the flash valve is securely closed before pouring in the vinegar.

, The siphon jets are the small openings around the rim of the toilet bowl that release the water from the tank into the bowl when the toilet is flushed. Work your way around the bowl, smoothing a strip of tape over each of the jets. You may have to use several pieces of tape to cover every last jet..


Over time, mold, mineral deposits and other gunk can build up in the siphon jets. This makes it more difficult for water to flow through them, and the result is a much weaker flush.
If you’re having trouble getting the tape to stick, try dabbing the area around the jets with a towel before applying it.

, As the vinegar drains from the tank, it will fill the siphon jets. With the duct tape in place, however, it will have nowhere to go. It will therefore stay in the jets, clearing them of troublesome clogs. Leave the vinegar to sit for at least an hour.For best results, allow the vinegar to soak the clogged jets overnight.

, After ample time has elapsed, peel off the strips of tape and turn the water to the toilet back on. Scrub the area around the siphon jets vigorously with a stiff-bristled brush to clear away any remaining surface buildup. Then, flush the toilet a couple of times to get water moving through the jets. You should discover that the toilet’s flushing power has improved considerably.Plan on cleaning out the jets of all the toilets in your home about once a year, or whenever you observe that flushing power is suffering."

Shut the water off.,
Get a plunger.,
Fix the suction cup onto the opening at the bottom of the bowl.,
Use a plumber's auger or a ""snake.""",How to Fix a Toilet1," If your toilet has become clogged, don't try to flush it or you'll risk overflowing the toilet. Find the water valve on the wall that connects the waterline to the toilet and turn it clockwise until it stops. Water should stop coming into the tank.


With any tank or flushing issue, you'll want to shut the water off first as a safety precaution. Cleaning up a toilet that's overflown is obviously the biggest of bummers.;
, It's called the plumber's helper for a reason. Some plungers have complicated bulb shapes and some are simple suction cups, but you just need to make sure your plunger is big enough to cover the opening at the bottom of the bowl.


Make sure there's enough water in the bowl to cover the cup of the plunger. It's easier to have some water to force the clog out with, but now that you've shut off the water you can't flush anymore in from the tank. Get a few cups of water from the sink to add to the bowl if you need to.

, Pump it forcefully and evenly. You should start to hear a gurgling in the pipe and feel some pressure building if you've created a suction with the plunger. After 5-10 pumps with the plunger, break the seal and see if the clog comes loose. If not, try again.


If you can see the clog come up, you can try to flush the water down without turning the water back on. There should be enough water in the bowl to flush it.
If the water all flushes down by itself after plunging, turn the water back on and let it run for a few minutes. When the water settles, try flushing it, but watch carefully and make sure it doesn't start to overflow. Shut off the water quickly if it does.

, If the clog is close to the top, the plunger should get it. If it has worked its way down the pipe, however, you might need the heavy artillery. A plumber's auger, also called a ""snake,"" is essentially a long wire that you can reel out and guide through the pipe to forcefully dislodge the clog and then reel back up.


Aim the tip of the auger into the bowl drain and reel it out. Be very careful not to force it and crank slowly and evenly.
You don't want to bust a pipe fitting or get the auger stuck. When you've run the auger out, or feel that you've broken up the clog, reel it back in and try to plunge the toilet again or flush it and see if the clog has worked it's way through.
If you don't want to buy an auger, you can fashion a simple device with a wire hanger to try to get at the clog.

Find the screws and pry up the cover.,
Center the toilet seat on the toilet.,
Tighten the bolt.,
Apply tension.,
Keep screwing until the seat is tight.",How to Fix a Loose Toilet Seat1," The back of your toilet seat is usually connected to the toilet with two long screws that run through the porcelain at the back of the bowl. The screws are secured by two nuts underneath. In the front of the cover, look for a small groove that is designed to help you pry up the cover. Then, use a small screwdriver to pry up both the seat and the cover.In cheap toilets, the screws are made from plastic. Most toilets, however, use steel screws, and more expensive models may even use brass or stainless steel.Be especially careful with plastic screws!;
, If the seat is loose, then it may wobble back and forth, in and out of alignment with the rim of the toilet bowl. Straighten out the seat so that it rests evenly atop the bowl. Consider sitting down to test it out for comfort., Turn the screwdriver clockwise to tighten. Remember: ""righty tighty, lefty loosey."" There usually is a nut with a wing attached to prevent the nut from turning.


Decide which screwdriver is the best fit. Make sure that the screwdriver head is big enough to fit into the notches of the bolt head. If the screwdriver is too small, then the bolt will not turn. The friction from the slipping screwdriver will quickly wear down the bolt and make it unusable.

, If the bolt keeps turning without tightening up, clamp the nut underneath with a small pair of pliers. Clamp onto the end of the nut, and hold it steady as you screw the bolt. Once you have twisted the bolt several times, the wing on the nut should prevent it from turning anymore.

, Once the seat does not wobble back and forth, push down the lid. It should click closed.

Remove the top of the tank and lift up the floating arm.Find the rod attached to a ball that floats on the top of the water and controls the intake of water from the pipes into the tank.,
Check the floating arm for misalignment.,
If it doesn't seem to be caught on anything, unscrew the ball from the arm by twisting it counter-clockwise.,
Check the flapper seal.If lifting up on the arm doesn't halt the running water and adjusting the floating arm doesn't seem to help, the problem is probably with the flapper assembly, which creates the seal at the bottom of the tank leading to the bowl and connects to the toilet handle by a rod.",How to Fix a Toilet2," This is the floating arm. If you lift up on the arm and the water stops, then your problem is that the water in the tank isn't coming up high enough to turn off and the pipes are getting the message that more water needs to come in, so the toilet runs constantly, or often.


A running toilet can cost a fortune in wasted water. While it may seem like a minor inconvenience, a running toilet is a serious and usually easily fixable problem.

, Sometimes, the floating arm will be bent so the ball will rub or catch on the side of the tank or the tank ball arm. Flush the toilet and see if the arm catches on anything. If it does, just bend the arm gently so it floats freely and can rise to the level it needs to.

, Sometimes, water will get trapped in the ball, weighing it down and keeping the water from rising as it should. If this happens, dump the water out and replace the ball by screwing it back on.


If the ball is cracked or otherwise damaged and allows water in freely, replace it with a new one.

,


Shut off the water and flush the toilet to empty the tank of water. Examine the flapper for signs of wear or corrosion. If you find build-up from the water or other gunk, scour it off with a kitchen pad or a pocketknife and see if you can get the flapper to create a good seal. Also check the opening for the same corrosion issues and clean it.
If water still gets through the opening, examine the wire rod that connects to the toilet handle and make sure it's aligned and allowing the flapper to fall freely and plug the hole. Like the floating rod, you should be able to bend it back into place relatively gently, or replace it with a new one. Some are connected with a chain that can become tangled or loose and may need replaced as well.
If none of this seems to stop the toilet from running, you'll probably need to replace the ballcock assembly.

Determine if you have a sealed plastic ballcock assembly or a metal one.,
To fix a metal assembly, remove the thumbscrews.,
Look for a locknut assembly at the bottom of the tank on the inside and on the outside of the tank.,
Screw the new ballcock assembly in place.",How to Fix a Toilet3," Many newer ballcock assemblies, which control the water as it flows into the tank from the water pipes and connects the floating arm and flapper assembly together, are sealed, making it difficult or impossible to take apart and repair. These models will just need replaced by removing the threaded screws and replacing it with a similar model.


Unscrew the floating arm from the assembly after turning off the water and flushing the tank. Then remove the entire assembly from the overfill tube (the tall tube that keeps water from overflowing the tank).
The perk of a plastic assembly is that it won't corrode and it costs less, but you can't fix it if something goes wrong. A metal assembly is sturdier and you can try to repair it. Choose what works best for you if the assembly needs replacing.

, On most older metal models, a couple of thumbscrews will hold the valve together. Unscrew them, revealing the washers or gaskets in between the valve parts.


Examine them. If any of these is worn out or broken, it will allow water to seep through and could be the cause of the toilet running. If that seems to be the problem, simply replace the gaskets and reassemble the ballcock assembly. If not, you'll need to remove the entire assembly.

, This should be what's keeping the assembly in the tank. You'll need to unscrew it from both sides with an adjustable wrench and lift the assembly free.


At this point, you should tighten the arms of the ballcock assembly, testing to make sure the arm functions and nothing seems to be broken, missing, or misaligned. If you don't see anything wrong but the toilet is still running and none of the other maintenance options have helped, you'll just need to replace the assembly with a new one. Typically, they'll cost anywhere between $10-$30.

, Follow the reverse of the steps you followed in removing the assembly, screwing it in tightly and re-affixing the floating arm (though, it'll probably come with a new float arm and possibly a new flapper). Turn the water back on and let the toilet run for a few minutes before attempting to flush it.

Check the water level in the tank.,
Check the flush valve at the bottom of the tank.,
Check the water ports on the underside of the toilet bowl rim.,
Check to see if the joint that connects the tank to the toilet bowl is leaking.",How to Fix a Toilet4," If there isn't enough water coming into the bowl to thoroughly clean it out, it probably means that not enough water is getting into the tank in the first place. Find the floating arm and try bending it up slightly to allow more water to fill into the tank.


Be careful not to raise it too far past the overflow tube, or the tank will run constantly.

, After shutting off the water and flushing the tank, check to make sure the valve isn't closing too soon, shutting off more water from getting into the bowl. If it is, adjust the rod arm or the chain.


There should be three or four different height settings to allow the assembly to customize to your toilet. Try different settings until enough water flows into the toilet.

, These will often become clogged with mildew or rust because it's a difficult area of the toilet to clean. Take a toilet brush with toilet cleaner to the underside of the rim to make sure enough water can get through the ports.


To see if they're clogged without sticking your head in the toilet, use a small mirror and check them out in the reflection.
You can also use a wire hanger to clean the ports out if there's anything lodged in there you can't get out with a brush.

, Generally, a pipe connects them. Look at the base of the tank and check the nuts to see if they need tightening, replacing, or new washers.


If part of the tank or bowl is cracked or leaking, this may result in a weak flush or other problems and you may need to replace the toilet completely.

Remove the old seat.,
Get a new seat.,
Install the new seat.",How to Fix a Toilet5," One of the most common and easily fixable issues with a toilet is a broken or otherwise malfunctioning seat that needs replacing. First, you'll need to remove the old seat and dispose of it by removing the nut from the mounting bolts under the rim of the toilet and pulling the seat and lid off.


Look under the lip of the toilet rim where the seat and lid connect to the bowl. You should see the nut and washer holding the seat on. Unscrew it with an adjustable crescent wrench and remove the washer and nut. The bolts should easily slide free from the top and you can remove the seat.
If the nut is stuck or rusty, spray some WD-40 on it to help it come loose. Be careful not to struggle with the wrench too much and risk cracking the bowl of the toilet with your wrench or smacking your hand on something.

, Typically, most toilets are manufactured in two sizes, so make sure you've got the right size to match your particular toilet. Measure the width and length of bowl from the mounting bolt to the lip and take your measurements to the hardware or housewares store to make sure you've got the right size for your toilet.


While you're at the hardware store, you'll probably want to buy replacement washers, nuts, and bolts unless the seat comes with them. Make sure they fit your toilet. Take in the old ones to have on hand for comparison.

, Fix the bolts through the holes in the toilet rim and screw the nut onto the bowl. Be careful not to use too much force when tightening, but make sure the seat is secure.

Install the new seat.",How to Fix a Loose Toilet Seat2," If the bolts are damaged, then you may just want to replace the individual pieces but leave the seat intact. If the body of the seat itself is in poor shape, however, then you may just want to swap it out for the sake of longevity. Look for toilet seats at a local hardware or home-and-garden store.

, There are two standard commercial toilet seat shapes: round and elongated. The round seats are perfectly round, while the ""elongated"" seats are oblong and egg-shaped. Buy the seat that matches your bowl.


Try to find a seat made by the same company that manufactured your toilet. Off-brand seats may well do the trick, but they may not fit quite so perfectly.

, You will need to unscrew the old seat, set it aside, and then tighten the new seat onto the bowl. Make sure that the new seat is aligned straight onto the toilet!


Save the bolts and nuts from the old seat in case you need to replace a bolt on your new seat.

This is important to ensure that the cleaning solution isn’t too heavily diluted., Fill the bowl so that the vinegar covers up the hard water spots. Cleaning vinegar, which is especially acidic, is best for removing hard water stains. However, distilled white vinegar can also work if it is all that you have., Use a rag to spread the vinegar over hard to reach spots, like under the rim of the toilet. You can also apply vinegar to the outside of the toilet, if there are any water spots around it.You can also apply the vinegar to toilet paper and stick it on spots overnight. This will help to ensure maximum exposure to the acidic vinegar.

, The vinegar will slowly eat away at the stains. Close the door and be sure that pets and children do not get into the bathroom., Use a brush with stiff nylon bristles to scrub at the hard water stains, removing anything that remains after the soaking. The vinegar should have loosened them so that they come up easily. If not, repeat this process., If the toilet brush isn’t getting the job done, try using a pumice stone instead. Many people report that it is good at picking up hard stains, without damaging the porcelain. Scrub the stain gently in conjunction with a cleaner, like vinegar, to pick up the stain."

This will make it less likely that hard water spots will form and save you the trouble of an intensive clean., Bleach can be a good disinfectant. But it will cause rust stains to set, making it more difficult to remove some hard water spots. It can also be dangerous when mixed with other toilet bowl cleaners., Older toilet bowl cleaners had metal bristles. These could scratch up the insides of a toilet. This is counterproductive, because once a toilet bowl is scratched, it is easier for dirt to get into the scratches and next to impossible to get it out., When you flush with the bowl open it is possible for water to escape, getting some all over the toilet. This is unsanitary and increases the risk of hard water marks forming., If given the time, these stains will only settle in and become more difficult to remove.

Look at the bigger picture.,
Examine your flush handle.,
Examine the flush lever nut.,
Shut off the water supply.,
Drain the water.,
Examine the flapper chain.,
Examine the trip lever.,
Examine the flapper.,
Buy and install replacement parts.,
Turn the water supply on.,
Wash your hands.",How to Adjust Toilet Tank Handles," The flush handle is just one part of the system called the 'flush mechanism', which allows water to flow from the tank to the bowl in a way that creates a flush. Problems that you notice in the handle are often due to a part else where in the mechanism, so its important to know how they all fit together. So go ahead and carefully remove the tank lid and peek in. There are 5 parts that make up the flush mechanism for you to identify.


The Flush Handle is what you push down on to create a flush. It is the effort arm of the flush lever.
The Trip Lever is the bar inside the tank, and attached to the Flush Handle. Pushing down on the handle makes the Trip Lever pull up on Flapper Chain. It is the load arm of the flush lever.
The Flush Lever Nut is the lock nut inside the tank that holds the Flush Lever in place where it enters the tank.
The Flapper Chain is the chain that connects the Trip Lever to the Flapper. When the Trip Lever is raised, the chain allows it to pull on the Flapper.
The Flapper is the part covering the Flapper Valve near the bottom of the tank. It is pulled up by the Trip Lever to let just enough water flow through the valve.;
, The problem you feel or see in the handle is very rarely a problem with the handle itself. Look at how your handle sticks out of the tank. If it looks too far in or out, or if it is wobbly, you might either have the wrong type of flush lever or a loose flush lever nut. The handle will be mounted one of six ways: on the front, side, or corner of the tank, and may be on the left or right side. If your flush lever seems to fit incorrectly, check the Handle product name or number online to see if it is compatible with your mount and tank type.

, Grasp the lock nut with your hand, and, from your perspective, turn it clockwise, from your left to your right, until it feels tight. This will keep your flush lever from becoming wobbly, which could cause an incomplete flush. If it is broken or stripped, it will have to be replaced.

, This may seem like common knowledge to some, but every plumber has forgotten this step at least once. Find the water shutoff valve, which is the almost always near the floor to the left of the toilet when you are facing it. Turn its head clockwise, from left to right, until it stops to shut off water supply to the toilet.

, Now that the water supply is off, no more water should flow in to refill your tank. Press on the flush handle to let most of the water out into the bowl. There will be some left in the bottom of the tank however, as the flapper valve is not on the floor of the tank. You can remove this water by soaking it up with sponges or towels, or by using a siphon of some sort. You now have full access to your tank system and a decreased risk of soaking your bathroom.

, There are a few types of flapper chains, but they all serve the same basic function. Make sure that it is connected to flapper and trip lever, it is not broken, and none of its links are bent out of shape. If the links have been bent, try to bend them back carefully with needle nose pliers. If it has simply come disconnected, find the hook or closing loop connector on the ends. Connect the more angled hook or the closing loop to one of the holes in the Lever, and the other end to the loop on the flapper. Move the Lever connector to different holes until you get as close as possible to about a half inch, or 1.27 cm, of slack. If the flapper chain has a flapper chain float, make sure its attached to the chain by the circle clips on either side of it. Adjust it closer to the flapper to gradually increase the size and duration of the flush it they are normally to short or weak.

, Make sure the lever is not notably too long, broken, or bent up and down. Some Trip Levers are meant to be trimmed down or bent horizontally in order to fit effectively in different types of tanks. If it is metal and bent, try to bend it back with a pair of pliers or an adjustable wrench. If it is plastic and too long, you can try to trim it down with a hacksaw. If, while the Lever is at rest, the chain is taught still, attempt to bend the Lever closer or you must replace the lever or chain. Push the Handle down and watch how the rising of the Lever affects the chain and flapper. The chain should start slightly slack, and become taught after the lever raises approximately a half of an inch. After that, the flapper should raise with the lever.

, If, by this time, you are still having an issue with water level, refill speed, flush size, or the chain not moving, the problem, if it lies withing the flush mechanism, will most certainly lie within the Flapper. There are a multitude of Flappers, but they all end up with the same problems and require the same fix. If the tank water level is constantly low, takes a very long time to refill, or flushes are incomplete, your flapper might be leaking. If the these problems occur when the chain is slack and the flapper is at rest, you should first examine and adjust the refill mechanism for the long refills and low tank water level, but replace the flapper is they persist.

, Make sure you check new parts for compatibility within the remaining parts and toilet. There may be parts that classify as 'OEM', standing for 'Original Equipment Manufacturer' and 'will-fit'. If it is an OEM, it means that the toilet company for one toilet brand decided to have it incorporated with an existing part from a part manager under the toilet company's brand. If it is will-fit, the company of that brand made that product specifically for that brand of toilet. This means that you can find OEM parts to be almost identical and cheaper than the will-fit parts. However, the will-fit parts sometimes out perform the OEM part. If you have a choice, decide upon which would be best.

, Now that you have successfully adjusted and improved your flush system, its time to allow the water to flow through it once again., Toilets aren't clean, you know?

Turn off your disposal.,
Determine what's causing the clog.,
Manually turn your blades to try breaking up clogged materials.,
Do not pour chemicals down a garbage disposal.,
Shut off the electricity to the garbage disposal completely.",How to Unclog a Garbage Disposal1," Before doing anything to your sink and disposal make sure that you turn off the disposal to prevent any accidents and injury.


You don’t have to cut the power to your disposal just yet as you’re only checking to see if there is material clogging the drain.
Don’t stick anything into the drain until you cut the power, however. Look under the sink and make sure to unplug the disposal. For older makes, you may have to go to your fuse box to cut the power.;
, Use a flashlight to look down the drain. Depending on what kind of blockage you see, you will be able to determine what tools you will need to remove the clog.


If you believe your disposal is clogged by something other than food, do not run water and try to unclog it using the same methods you would with food. If it is a valuable object, such as a ring, you may want to call a plumber immediately to improve the chances it can be removed safely.
If the clog has developed over time, it is most likely because there is too much food debris sticking to your pipes. The water hasn't been able to flush it down into your disposer. You may have to plunge the sink.

, In some cases, you may find that your disposer is clogged under your sink. You will need to manually run it to remove the clog.


Manually turning the blades on your disposer will help you identify where the clog is.
This method can also help you break up some debris. Manually turning the blades lets the blades move slower and not get stuck as easily.
This method involves using an Allen wrench to manually turn the blades. You can usually find the manual operator at the bottom of the disposer.
Insert your Allen wrench and turn the blades manually. This method allows you to slowly break down materials.
Refer to your manual if you are manually turning the blades for proper instruction.

, Unclogging a kitchen sink is different than unclogging garbage disposals. The chemicals used to unclog a drain can eat away at the plastic parts of your disposal. , If you have determined that you need to manually remove debris from the disposal, shut off the switch. Then, cut the power for the disposal with the breaker box, in case the switch is faulty.


You can also go under your sink and unplug the actual disposal unit. This will also ensure that nothing accidentally turns on.
If your disposer is also connected to a dishwasher, use a clamp to tighten and pinch the flexible part of the drain line. This ensures that no dirty water flows back into the dishwasher cabinet.

Determine the cause of your stains.",How to Clean a Stained Toilet Bowl1," Before you begin cleaning your toilet, it is best to check your manufacturer's instructions. Certain products can damage the inner-workings of your toilet--such as the flapper--while others may cause discoloration.Look for a brand name printed or engraved on your toilet.
Perform an Internet search for ""+ safe cleaning products.""
You can also look for a phone number to the manufacturer and give them a call.;
, Before you can work on removing stains from your toilet, it is best to perform a general cleaning. If your toilet is very dirty, it may benefit from an overnight soak before scrubbing. Pour 1/2 cup (118 ml) of white vinegar into your toilet bowl and close the lid. Leave it to sit overnight., Once again, before you can tackle tough stains, you must perform a general cleaning of your toilet. In order to do this, you will need some form of cleanser and a toilet brush. Simply apply the cleanser of your choice to the inside of your toilet bowl and around the edges. Then use the brush to remove debris, and flush. You may want to wear disposable gloves while you do this.Some cleansers to choose from include:


Store-bought products, such as Comet, Soft Scrub, and other toilet cleansers.
DIY alternatives, such as baking soda, white vinegar, borax, or bleach.

, Depending on the nature of your toilet stains, you may use a variety of products to eradicate them. The most common sources of toilet stains are hard water. mold, and mildew.Look for the following symptoms to determine what type of stains are present for you.


Hard water - These stains will appear as rings around your inner toilet bowl. They may be pink, red, brown, or white.
Mold - Mold stains can occur anywhere on your toilet. Mold will be slightly fuzzy and can be blue, green, yellow, gray, black, or white.
Mildew - Mildew can also occur anywhere on your toilet, but is common near the top of the toilet bowl or on the toilet tank. Mildew usually starts out white, but may turn yellow or brown in time.

Use a plunger to lift out other debris that is causing a clog.,
Remove any material from the sink.,
Turn on the power to the garbage disposal.",How to Unclog a Garbage Disposal2," Stick the end though the disposal, around the blades.


If you see a buildup of food that you can reach with tongs or pliers you should remove the loose materials fist. Removing any loose food will allow you to see better and clear out space. These types of food may be peels from fruits like bananas, fatty strips of meat, or vegetables.
Never place your hands inside a garbage disposal. The blades are sharp, and can easily cut you without the motor running.

, Once you remove any larger debris, you can then inspect the drain again and get ready to plunge. If you see anything that is not food in your disposal be extremely careful when trying to pull it out. Never use your hands. You may find it best to call a plumber.

, Once you’ve removed loose material, you can try running your disposal again to see if it’s unclogged. If the disposal is still clogged, you can use a plunger to pull up stuck material.


If you test the disposal again and hear a low humming sound, that means the blades are unable to turn. When testing, always keep water running so as to lubricate the blades and help break down any grime that may be sticking.
With everything properly turned off again, fill the sink with a few inches of water. You will need a bit of water so the plunger sticks to your sink. Place the plunger over your sink hole and start plunging.
The plunger will hopefully create enough suction to lift any stubborn debris or materials out of the disposal.

, Continue plunging until you feel that nothing else is coming up, then scoop out the material you pulled up.


If the water in your sink drains after plunging, you will have a clear pipe and disposal.
Wait 15 minutes before running the disposal again. If you’ve been running the motor a lot while trying to unclog your drain and disposal, waiting will allow the motor to cool. And overheated motor won’t properly deal with any blockage and could permanently damage your disposer.

, Run some water through the drain and then run the disposal to see if it works again.


Make sure to unclamp the drain line after plunging and before testing.
If your disposal is working again you’re all set.

Disassemble the P-trap.,
Place a bucket and towels under the pipe before removing it.,
Loosen the slip nut on the trap arm assembly and the continuous waste tee.,
Remove the trap and clean.",How to Unclog a Garbage Disposal3," Your garbage disposal unit will be attached to a pipe called a P- or S-trap. These are the pipes that look like a “P” or “S” behind your disposal unit, which connects to the trap arm on the back wall of your cabinet. Oftentimes, when removing debris and plunging doesn’t do the trick, it’s because there is a lot of sludge buildup from coffee grounds and grease in the trap. This buildup prevents new material from properly breaking up and draining.
To get your disposal to work properly again you’ll have to remove and clean this pipe.

, Also, sponge up any water in your sink to avoid the water dripping out of the open pipe.


Before you go ahead and remove the P-trap you’re going to want to prep the area so that you create as little a mess as possible. If there are grounds and other waste clogging your trap, a bucket and towels will minimize any mess.

, Your trap will be connected by nuts to two pipes which you will have to unscrew. Once you have loosened the nuts, you can wiggle the trap free from the pipes. The trap arm is the small pipe extending from the back of your cabinet and looks like a faucet.
The waste tee is the pipe above the trap. It looks like a large golf tee and connects the trap to the disposal.

, When you remove the trap, you will most likely find it full of grime and other materials such as ground coffee.


Some traps have a clean-out plug in the base that allows you to clean without removing the trap. If your's doesn't, you'll have to remove it. Keep your bucket under the trap so that any debris that falls out goes into the bucket.
You may have to pull out a lot of debris by hand before you can rinse the trap with warm water. You can also use a coat hanger to remove debris.
When rinsing your trap, keep the bucket under the trap, especially if you rinse it in the sink. If you are rinsing your trap in your sink you want to prevent the material from going back down. As well as any water pouring through your open pipe.
Once the trap is cleaned out, reattach the trap carefully. Make sure not to over tighten and crack any of the components. Plastic parts will easily snap – just tighten them snugly.
If your trap is clean, but you still have draining problems, you may have to snake your drain.

Use lemons to clean the disposal once or twice a month.,
Use Vinegar and baking soda to break down grime.",How to Unclog a Garbage Disposal4," Never insert bones, metals, or plastics.


Your disposal and the blades aren’t meant to break down hard, solid objects. Your disposal is only built to break down food to prevent clogs.
Inserting anything that’s solid or too large can prevent the disposal from properly working.

, This is in addition to running the water while it is grinding.


Running the water for half a minute after your disposal grinds up food will ensure that the blades stay lubricated. Water also ensures that you don’t get any food sticking to your pipes or blades.
The running water will help flush down any materials that are sticking to anything.

, Depending on how often you use the disposal, cleaning it naturally will help remove buildup and combat smells.


Cut the lemon in half. Place it in the garbage disposal. Let it run for 2 minutes. The lemon's acidic juices will clean away odors and small clogs.

, You can also use vinegar and baking soda to create a fizzy solution that will help dissolve any grime. Pour hot water down your drain, then add about half a cup of baking soda. Let sit for a few minutes. Then rinse with vinegar and hot water. Let the solution soak for a few minutes before rinsing.

Apply lemon Kool-aid.,
Use a pumice stone.,
Scrub with a dryer sheet.",How to Clean a Stained Toilet Bowl2," Hard water stains are both common and unsightly. Fortunately, you can remove them using items you may already have at home. One choice is lemon Kool-aid. Simply sprinkle one package of lemon Kool-aid around the toilet bowl, wait one hour, and use a toilet brush to scrub away stains.Lemon Kool-aid is available at most grocery stores for a little as $0.25.

, Pumice stones are excellent at scrubbing away hard water stains. Use a pumice stone you already have at home, or purchase a ""pumie"" (a pumice stone on a stick designed for this purpose). Soak your pumice stone in water for 10-15 minutes, then use it to scrub away stains., Dryer sheets are another great product for scouring away hard water stains. In fact, used dryer sheets seem to work even better than brand new ones! Wear a pair of rubber gloves, then use an ordinary dryer sheet (used or unused) to scrub away stains."

In addition to being ugly, it is important to remove it from your toilet for these reasons. In order to remove mildew, you can use the same products as you would for mold--white vinegar, bleach, or tea tree oil--but the procedure is a little different. To begin, select which product you want to use., Place the solution of your choice--bleach water, vinegar water, or water with 10-15 drops of tea tree oil--into a spray bottle. You can re-purpose an old spray bottle you have at home, or purchase a new one., Mildew loves water and thrives in damp environments (like your toilet). In order to clean it effectively, you need your toilet to be a little bit dry inside. So flush your toilet to start the cleaning process.

, While the inside of your toilet is empty (or as close to empty as possible), use your spray solution to coat the inside of your toilet bowl with your cleanser., As quickly as you can (before the toilet refills with water), vigorously scrub the mildew from the inside of your toilet bowl. You may need to repeat this process until all of the mildew is gone."

Remember that most of the time systems are not ""broken"" and only need to be cleared of compacted sludge or waste that has accumulated over time.;
, You may find that you need bacteria added. Bacteria acts like an acid and will digest the blockages that have developed. Whatever you do, don't add chemicals!. Chemicals do nothing more that free up sludge and allow it to go further into your system, which can make things worse.

, There are many companies selling different products for different situations, so make sure you find something strong and get it into your system quickly to get the product working.

, This may take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks depending on how much sludge you have in your tank, lines and field. If you system is very old and has been neglected, the bacteria can take up to 3 weeks, but keep in mind, once the bacteria is in the system, it multiplies rapidly and eats everything organic in its path. Bacteria are completely safe and will not harm your system as chemical agents can and often do.

, This simply isn't always true. Back in the early days when we didn't use bleach, antibacterial soaps and harsh cleaners, we did actually produce enough bacteria in our own stool to degrade and digest our waste but in modern times, it simply does not hold true. Do your research and find out for yourself.

Determine whether you are going to use the existing outflow pipe for both pumps or add a second pipe for just the bilge pump.,
Know where it needs to be installed.,
Install the bilge pump in the sump.,
Connect the battery, fuse, control switch (optional), bilge level control switch, and bilge pump with heavy-duty wiring.,
Test the battery-only operation.,
Attach the charger to the battery and plug in the charger.,
Final testing should include making sure the original sump pump and the new bilge pump sequence properly and work simultaneously.,Make sure all connections are taped and all wires are tied or taped and you should be done.Make sure the charger is set to automatic mode (it will maintain the battery normally but switch to charge mode if there is a draw on the battery or it is discharged after an outage).",How to Repurpose a Bilge Pump As a Sump Pump," There are arguments for both approaches -- two pipes are better than one in terms of flow capacity, but adding a second pipe may be a more-difficult plumbing job.

If using the existing pipe, you will need to cut it and install a check valve and T-connector. The check valve goes below the T-connector between the T and the existing sump pump. Make sure the flow direction for the check valve is correct! A second check valve will be installed between the side of the T-connector and the new bilge pump.
If installing a new bilge pump outflow pipe, run that to the same place that your current sump outflow exits. For such a long run, you should use electrical ties to keep the pipe from sagging when full of water.;
, The bilge pump secondary level control switch needs to be installed a few inches above the existing sump level control switch. There are many possibilities for mounting this switch. The main consideration is that the switch must be mounted so that nothing interferes with its operation and that it is solidly mounted., This will entail finishing the plumbing by either attaching the bilge pump to the anti-backflow valve or to the independent outflow pipe. (No backflow valve is required for the independent pipe approach.)
, Make all connections above the water level. Use wire nuts and anti-oxidation compound for long-term reliability. Polarity is important for DC circuits!
, If the sump pump runs but does not pump, you may have the polarity reversed., You should see at least a trickle-charge if not a several-amp charging current. Test the pump again with the charger and battery., Also, the bilge pump should work properly with no house power available.,"

You will need a drill with 1/2” and 3/4” drill bits.;
, You will be stacking the buckets on top of each other to let gravity pull the water through the filters. Drill two 1/2” holes in the bottom of the upper bucket. These holes should make a line across the diameter of the bucket.


Drill two matching holes into the lid of the bucket that will be underneath. The holes should line up when the buckets are stacked.

, Install the spigot, making sure that it is properly sealed so that no water can escape.

, These are installed into the upper bucket. The nozzle for the filter element secures through the hole drilled into the bottom of the upper bucket. Make sure both filters are securely installed. The nozzles should be protruding from the bottom of the bucket.

, The newly-installed filter element nozzles should fit directly into the holes drilled into the lid of the bottom bucket.


Consider sealing the space between the two buckets if you don’t plan on moving your filtration system often. This will help keep debris from getting in between the buckets and contaminating the clean water supply in the lower container.

, Fill the top bucket with water. It can take a long time for water to start filtering through new filter elements. The process will speed up as they get used more.


Continue adding water to the top bucket to increase the speed of the filtration process. More pressure on the filters makes them work faster.

, As solids build up on the outside of the filters, the filtration process will slow. Clean your filters with a plastic scouring pad to keep them flowing. If the water you want to filter is cloudy, pre-filter it with folded cloth to remove excess debris.

Turn off incoming water by isolating the Aqua-Pure system with existing valves on your homes water supply system.,Bleed the pressure from your Aqua-Pure unit by pressing down on the red button (pressure relief button) on the top of the filter housing

,
Take your filter wrench and slide it up from the bottom of the filter housing towards the head.,
Remove the housing, and wipe it clean, and then insert your new Aqua-Pure AP810 water filter.

,
Add a small amount of silicone o-ring lubricant (available at most hardware stores) to the O-ring and screw the housing back into the head.

,
Turn back on your water supply to the system.

Boil your water.,
Add chlorine bleach.,
Use SODIS to disinfect.",How to Make a Water Purifier2," Boiling is widely viewed as the safest way to purify water. Pre-filter cloudy water with a coffee filter or folded cloth.


Boil the water for one full minute, then let cool and drink. If you are above 2,000 feet (609.6 m) altitude, boil for three minutes.
Add a small amount of salt to improve the taste of the water as it’s boiling.
Make a cotton and charcoal filter. Crushed charcoal in a cotton trap will work well in removing the impurities and some of the bad taste from the boiled water when you filter through it. Charcoal will also help in capturing some of the toxins that other methods will not catch.

, Using bleach should not be attempted unless boiling water is not possible. Make sure that it is unscented and soap-free bleach. Household bleach should contain between 5-6% bleach.For two liters of water, you will need to add 5 drops of bleach. Mix vigorously and let stand for at least 30 minutes. If the water is particularly cloudy, double the bleach and let stand for at least 60 minutes.

, SODIS stands for solar water disinfection. Fill transparent PET bottles half full with water. Shake them repeatedly to mix oxygen into the water, then fill the bottles to the top and cap them. Place the bottles in a location that will receive at least 6 hours of direct sunlight.


This method works best if the bottles are angled towards the sun and are resting on a conducive material such as a corrugated tin roof.
Glass bottles are ineffective for this method, as they block crucial UV rays.

,,, Most water softeners have 2 tanks, and you need to set them next to each other.

, Cut a piece of copper tubing that length, and solder fittings on the ends. Water conditioner installation includes some soldering work.

,, With water softener installation, you must provide drainage.

, Adjust the screws on the stainless steel clamps with a screwdriver to seat the valve. When you install a water softener, be sure to have all your tools ready.

, Use a wrench to tighten the supply tube nuts. When you put in a water softener, don't wrench the nuts too tight.

,


Scrub the fittings and the pipes with steel wool. When installing a water conditioner, you'll need to solder the fitting to the pipes.
Solder the fittings together by applying flux and melting it with a propane torch.

,, Water softener installation includes setting up the brine tank, and you'll need to add 40 lbs. (18.144 kg) of potassium chloride salt or sodium chloride to the unit.

, To put in a water softener, open the water supply valve to the 1/4 position to let oxygen run from the drain line.

,,, If any water is escaping, check your soldering and the nuts. Re-solder or tighten nuts to repair any leaks.

Troubleshoot a broken machine.",How to Maintain Your Water Softening System," Salt is an essential part of the water softening process, as it regenerates the resin beads to prepare them for more softening. The softener manual should instruct you on the ideal salt level. As a general rule, fill the tank at least half-full with salt, and keep it at least 3 inches (7.5 cm) above the water level. High salt levels (within 4 in/15 cm of the tank top) may improve efficiency, but reduce this to a lower level if you notice old salt clinging to the sides.If you use block salt, it may be best to have a technician raise your water level to submerge the block completely.;
, Your water softener manual will tell you whether your machine runs on granular, tablet, or block salt. Granular salt is the most common choice, because it dissolves most easily. Buy it in pellet form if possible, since ordinary salt crystals can easily clog the tank. There are also different grades of salt to choose between:Rock salt (coarse salt) is cheap but contains more impurities, which decreases efficiency and dirties your tank, requiring more frequent cleaning.
Solar salt is much purer than rock salt.
Evaporated salt is the highest-quality option, but also the most expensive.

, Salt can form a solid layer or ""bridge"" in the brine tank. This prevents the loose salt on top from mixing with the water down below, preventing the softener from working. Push a long broom handle several times around the center of the tank, all the way to the bottom, to break up any solid layers that have formed.Pouring hot water over the bridge makes it easier to break.If you have repeated problems with bridging, use less salt, and let the salt drop lower between refills.Cleaning the brine tank should also help.

, The salt can also form a mushy pile at the base of the tank, causing the water to rise around it instead of mixing in. You can use a broom handle to break this up if it forms a large mound.It also helps to scoop up the mush and dissolve it in a bucket of hot water, then pour it back into the tank., Modern water softeners can go without cleaning for 5–10 years. Clean them only if your water has turned hard and the basic maintenance above doesn't fix the problem within a couple days. Older models (especially electric ones) can benefit from an annual cleaning., Use the bypass valve to shut off water intake. Siphon or dump all water out of the tank, then dump out the salt and throw it away.


Keep the waste away from your garden, as salt kills plants.
Dissolve blocks or bridges of salt with hot water if needed.

, Some models have a mesh platform at the base of the brine tank. Set this aside before cleaning.

, Mix a generous amount of dish soap into one or two gallons (4–8 liters) of water. Pour it into the tank and scrub the entire interior with a long-handled brush.

, Dump out the soapy water and rinse with plain water.

, Pour ¼ cup (60 mL) of household bleach and 2–3 gallons (8–11 liters) of water into the tank. Stir and let sit for fifteen minutes to sanitize the tank. Most organisms cannot grow in concentrated brine, but it's a good idea to make sure.

, Rinse out the bleach thoroughly. If there was a grid in the tank, put it back. Replenish the tank with water and salt as normal.


Wait at least a couple hours before regenerating the tank, to give the salt time to dissolve.

, About once a month, adjust the bypass valve in to temporarily cut off the softener from your water supply. (The bypass valve is usually a rod you push in to block water flow.) Twist the intake and outtake valves to the off position, then back to their original position. Return the bypass valve to its old position. This keeps the valves in good working condition.If a valve leaks or drips, disassemble it and replace any damaged washers or seals.

, Once every few months, pour water softener cleaner into the brine tank, following label instructions. Manually start a regenerating process (or pour in the cleaner right before a scheduled regeneration). This helps keep the resin efficient and functional.If your water has high iron levels or other issues that interfere with your softener, use a high-strength product, or buy an attachment that automatically adds a small amount of cleaner each time the system regenerates.

, The nozzle and venturi valve between the tanks creates the suction that pulls water in to regenerate the system. Disassemble and clean these parts about twice a year, or whenever the brine tank gets clogged.Follow the exact instructions in your manual. Failing to relieve water pressure before disassembling the valve could damage parts or cause injury., If you have tried everything above and your water is still hard, go through this checklist:Double check that the bypass valve is open, the regeneration timer is set, and that there are no kinks in the hoses.

Address any recent water pressure issues.
If your household's water use has increased or your water has become harder, set the timer to regenerate more often.
If the computer display is not working, check that the circuit is powered and all wires and fuses are intact.
If all else fails, have a plumber investigate your resin tank. Your manual may provide instructions for how to check it yourself, but attempt it only if you are comfortable working with plumbing and electricity.

Make a plant xylem filter using a water bottle and a pine branch.",How to Make a Water Filter," You will be making a water filter that relies on layers to make dirty water clean. If you plan on drinking this water, you will need to boil it after you have filtered it.Here is a list of what you will need:


Plastic bottle with a cap
Craft knife
Hammer and nail (optional)
Coffee filter
Large cup or mug (optional)
Activated charcoal
Sand
Gravel
Container to catch the water (jar, cup, mug, etc);
, Stick the knife into the side of the bottle, and start cutting it slowly. You may find that making short, back-and-forth cuts (like sawing) may be easier.









If you are a child, ask an adult to help you with this step
Add handle so that you can hang it while it filters the water. Start by poking two holes near the cut edge of the bottle. Make the holes opposite of each other. Thread a piece of string through the two holes. Tie the string in a knot.

, The hole will help slow down the flow of water and make the filter more effective. If you don't have a hammer or nail, use a craft knife to stab an X shape into the bottle cap.








, The coffee filter will keep the activated charcoal inside the bottle and keep it from falling out. The cap will hold the coffee filter in place.








, This will help keep the bottle steady while you fill it. If you don't have a cup or mug, then you can place the bottle down on a table. You will need to hold it steady with one hand.








, If the charcoal comes in large pieces, you will need to break them down into smaller pieces. Do this by putting the chunks inside a bag, and crushing them with a hard object (such as a hammer). You don't want the chunks to be larger than a pea.









Charcoal can get very dirty. You can keep your hands clean by wearing some gloves.

, You can use any type of sand you want, but avoid using colored craft sand. Colored sand may leak dyes into the water. Try to make the sand layer about as thick as the charcoal layer. The bottle should be a little more than half-way full by now.









Try using two types of sand: a fine grained sand and a coarse grained sand. The finer sand will go first, on top of the charcoal. The coarse grained sand will go next, on top of the fine-grained sand.This will create more layers for the water to pass through, and help make it cleaner.

, Leave an inch (2.54 centimeters) or so of empty space between the gravel and the cut part of the bottle. Do not fill the bottle all the way with gravel, or the water may spill over if it does not drain fast enough.









Try using two types of gravel: a fine grained gravel and a chunky gravel. The fine grained gravel will go first, on top of the sand. The chunky gravel will go next, on top of the fine gravel., Make sure that the jar is clean and large enough to hold the water you plan on filtering. If you don't have a jar, try using a bowl, cup, pot, or a mug.

, The cap should be pointing towards the bottom of the container. If your jar has a large opening, try setting the water filter down on top of it. This way, you won't need to hold the filter. If you made a handle for your filter, hang the filter up now. Place the jar right under it.

, Make sure that you pour slowly. This way, the water will not overflow. If the water starts to reach the top of the filter, stop and wait for the water level to go down. Once you can see the gravel again, pour some more water.








, This will take about seven to ten minutes. As the water passes through the different layers, it will become cleaner.

, Slide a new jar under the filter, then pour the filtered water back over the gravel. You may need to repeat the filtering process two or three times before the water runs clear.








, The water will also still contain dangerous bacteria, chemicals, and microorganisms. You can get rid of all these by boiling the water for at least one minute.








If you are higher than 5,000 feet (1,000 meters) above sea-level, you will need to boil the water for at least three minutes., Do not leave the water standing for long, or new bacteria may form inside it.

, Get a round, cup-shaped coffee filter and turn it upside down so that it fits over a cup like a lid. Wrap a rubber band around the coffee filter to keep it in place. Slowly pour the cloudy water over the coffee filter. Boil the water afterwards to make it drinkable.









If you don't have a coffee filter, use a paper towel or a piece of cotton fabric instead. Make sure that the square is big enough to fit over the mouth of the cup. Try to use white fabric or a blank paper towel. Colored fabrics and paper towels contain dyes, which may bleed into the water.

, Fruit peels have the ability to absorb bacteria. Peel a banana, and grind the peel in a blender. You may discard the banana or eat it; you won't need it for the filter. Once the peel is blended, put it into a coffee filter. Hold the filter over a cup. Pour water through the coffee filter. The banana peels will help absorb bacteria, and the coffee filter will help make the water clear again.







, Sapwood, such as pine, contains xylem, which can absorb and filter out dirt and bacteria. It can remove up to 99.9% of bacteria from water, but will not remove viruses such as hepatitis and rotavirus.You will need to boil the water after filtering it to make it safe to drink. Here's how to make a xylem filter:








Cut a 4 inch (10.16 centimeters) long piece from a pine tree branch.
Peel off the bark, and make sure that it can fit into the neck of the bottle. If it is too wide, shave it down using sandpaper or a pocket knife.
Slide the first inch (2.54 centimeters) or so of the stick into the neck of the bottle.
Cut the bottom of the bottle off and turn the bottle upside down.
Fill the bottle with water, and let the water drain through the stick.
Do not let the stick dry out. If it dries out, it won't be as effective."

Look under your kitchen sink and identify the cold water pipe feeding your cold tap.,
Ensure the section of copper pipe is suitable for installation of the saddle valve clamping device.,
Remove the saddle valve from the packaging - This is the device which looks like a small clamp, with tubing attached to it.

,
Identify the diameter of the pipework - for a UK installation this will be 15mm or 22mm.

,
Set the small mounting block from the clamp on the pipe - the side you use will be determined by the diameter of the pipe.

,
Fit the clamp over the pipe and mounting block, and tighten the nut at the base (turn anti clock-wise).

,
Take a bucket or similar receptacle, and place the red end of the tube into it.

,
Turn the T-Bar handle on the top of the clamp clockwise fully down - this will pierce the copper pipe.

,Remove the filter housing, housing bracket and screws from the packaging

,
Screw the bracket to a suitable part of the kitchen cabinet, you will need to check the dimensions of the housing to ensure it will mount.

,Open the filter cartridge supplied with the system

,Unscrew the filter cartridge housing

,
Install the cartridge into the housing - cartridges are usually threaded or flat seal - flat seal cartridges simply sit in the housing and when its tightened up form the connections necessary.,
Re-assemble the filter housing.

,Mount the filter housing on the bracket

,
Drill a suitable hole in the worktop or kitchen sink for the drinking water faucet/tap.,Seat the tap base over the hole - this neatens up installation

,
Push the tap tubing through the hole (from the top side of the hole), and mount the tap into its desired position.

,Fit the tap washer over the tubing beneath the sink, and push up to the worktop/sink base

,
Fit the tap nut over the tubing and turn anti-clockwise.,
Connect the red tube you have in the bucket to the input side of the filter housing - these are simple push fit connectors.,
Connect the blue tube from the tap to the output side of the filter housing - these are simple push fit connectors.,
Carefully turn the T-Bar on the saddle valve anti-clockwise - this will allow water to flow through the red tube, to the filter housing, and on to the tap.

,Check for leaks - if leaks are found see the tips section

,Wait two minutes

,
Turn on the drinking water tap, and allow the water to flow for two minutes.,
Adjust the saddle valve to ensure optimum flow to 1.5 liters (0.4 US gal) per minute - turn clockwise to reduce the flow, and anti-clockwise to increase the flow.

,
Installation is complete, continue to check the plumbing connections periodically for the next few days.

",How to Install an Under Counter Water Filter System," If you have a monoblock style tap with flexible hoses where it is difficult to determine which pipe is the cold main, run the hot tap for a couple of minutes, and you should clearly be able to see which is the warm pipe and which is the cold by touching the copper pipes.;

Change the filter cartridge as needed.",How to Install a Brita Filter on a Faucet," Check the contents of your Brita filtration system kit before proceeding. You'll need to make sure that all necessary pieces have been included.


The base system is the most crucial element.
Your kit should also contain a replaceable filter cartridge and a packet with two sets of faucet adapters and washers. The adapters and washers may not be needed, but they should be in your kit nonetheless.;
, Grab the aerator portion of your faucet between your thumb and first two forefingers. Twist clockwise to unscrew it.


If there are any rubber washers beneath the aerator when you remove it, peel those off, as well.
If you have difficulty removing the aerator with your bare hands, grab it with a dry, coarse towel and try again.

, Check the faucet for any signs of limescale or rust. Clean off any buildup you spot before proceeding.


The safest way to remove lime scale or to remove rust from a kitchen sink is with vinegar.

Fill a plastic bag with white vinegar.
Place the bag over the faucet, holding it in place with a rubber band. Make sure that the buildup is submerged in the vinegar.
Let the faucet sit in vinegar for one hour.
Remove the plastic bag and run warn water through the faucet. Scrub away any additional buildup with a recycled toothbrush or sponge.



, Look at the threads on your faucet. Faucets with threads on the outside do not usually need an adapter, but faucets with threads on the inside do need an adapter.


When dealing with a faucet that has interior threads, use one of the adapters that come with your kit.
If you do not need to use an adapter, skip the ""Attaching an Adapter"" section and begin directly with the ""Attaching the Brita Filtration System"" system.
If your faucet has exterior threads but the filtration system does not fit on it directly, you will need to call customer service. Similarly, if none of the adapters fit on your faucet even though it has interior threads, call customer services. The company should send you a special set of adapters free of charge.
See the “Tips” section for information on how to get in touch with customer support.

, There are two different adapter and washer sets provided with your kit. Examine your faucet and examine both adapters to determine which adapter should be used.


You should be able to determine which adapter is correct by comparing the size of the adapter to the size of your faucet.
If the first adapter you try does not work, however, try the second adapter.

, Sit the appropriate washer into the recessed end of the adapter.


Gently push the washer into the adapter using your index finger. It should fit snugly into the recessed portion of the adapter.

, Place the adapter beneath your faucet, washer-end up. Align the threads of the adapter with the threads of the faucet, then twist in a counterclockwise direction to tighten the adapter onto the end of the faucet.


Continue twisting until the adapter feels snug and cannot be moved any further.
You should be able to twist the adapter onto your faucet by hand.
If you cannot adequately tighten the adapter by hand, place a coin into the notch at the bottom of the adapter and use the extra leverage to help twist the adapter in place.
Do not use pliers to attach the adapter since doing so may cause damage to the threading.

, Hold the base system beneath the faucet with the filter cup portion sitting to the left side of the faucet.


This means that the Filter Replacement Indicator should be facing you.
Note that these instructions are the same regardless of whether or not you used an adapter. If you used an adapter, the filtration system will be mounted to the adapter instead of the faucet itself, but the steps are otherwise identical.

, Hold the base system steady with one hand. Use your other hand to rotate the mounting collar at the top of the base system, twisting it onto the faucet or adapter until it feels snug.


Tighten the mounting collar by hand. Do not use pliers since doing so could damage the threading.
If you have trouble twisting the mounting collar in place, rotate the body of the base system back and forth while tightening the mounting collar. This may allow you to tighten the collar further.
The mounting collar should be snug, but avoid over-tightening it since doing so could cause damage.

, Hold the filter cartridge over the filter cup on the base system. Push the cartridge down until it clicks into place.


You should support the bottom of the base system with one hand as you insert the cartridge with your other hand.
The insert groove near the bottom of the cartridge should line up with the filter replacement indicator and the front of the base system.
Do not force the cartridge into the filter cup. If it does not glide into the cup smoothly, reposition it and try again.

, Tug on the cartridge, gently pulling it up, to verify that it has been engaged in the system.


Once the filter cartridge has been engaged, the filter replacement indicator should reset itself and turn on. You should see a green flashing light.

, Move the filter handle toward you to activate the filtered water setting. Turn on your faucet and run cool water through it for five minutes.


Only use cold to warm water. Do not use hot water.
Flushing out the cartridge removes excess carbon dust and activates the filter. Do not be alarmed if you see carbon dust appear; this is normal.

, Adjust the handle on the base filtration system to activate and deactivate the filter.


All Brita filtration systems have a basic filtered water setting. To activate it, move the switch to the setting labeled with the ""Brita"" symbol. Only use water that comes directly from the filter port when the system is in this setting.
All systems also have a setting that allows you to access a stream of unfiltered water. Activate this setting by moving the switch to the single water drop icon.
System Model FF-100 also has a setting that allows you to access a spray of unfiltered water. Access this setting by moving the handle to the rear position labeled by three water droplets.

, The filter replacement indicator will let you know when your filter cartridge needs to be replaced. This indicator sits at the front of the base system.


The exact amount of time a filter cartridge lasts will depend on the system model you have.

Model OPFF-100 filters last for 94 gallons (360 L).
Model SAFF-100 filters last for 100 gallons (378 L).
Model FF-100 filters last for 100 gallons (378 L) or four months, depending on which comes first.


When your filter is in working condition, a green light will appear.
A flashing amber light or mixed green and red light indicates that your filter has two weeks 20 gallons (75.7 L) (75 L) left before it needs to be changed.
A red light indicates that your filter needs to be changed immediately.

, When the filter replacement indicator tells you that you need to change the filter cartridge, do so by lifting the old cartridge out and inserting a fresh cartridge in its place.


With the water turned off, press the filter cartridge release button located near the back of the filter cup. While this button is depressed, simply lift the cartridge up to remove it.
Insert a new cartridge following the same procedure used to insert your first cartridge.

Rub any toilet rings with the stone.",How to Clean a Ring in Toilet Bowl1," Pumice stones are known for their ability to exfoliate and remove dead skin cells. If you have one of these objects lying around, it can do wonders for your toilet bowl! You can also a purchase a pumice stone affixed to a stick--known as a Pumie--created for this very purpose.If you'll be using a traditional pumice stone, you will need to submerge your hands in water, and you may want to wear rubber gloves.;
, Before you begin scrubbing your toilet, it is important to soften the pumice stone in water. Place the stone inside your toilet bowl and wait 15 minutes., Once the stone has softened a bit, simply rub it against the rings in your toilet. The pumice stones acts almost like a pencil eraser, removing hard water rings before your eyes! When you are finished, give your toilet a flush."
"
Keep the toilet from overflowing.,
Prep the bathroom.,
See if you can clear the obstruction.,
Use a high quality plunger.,
Insert the plunger into the bowl.,
Flush the toilet to check the drainage.",How to Unclog a Toilet1," If your toilet doesn't flush properly after one flush, don't flush again. This will cause more water to be pumped into the toilet bowl. Instead, take the lid off of the toilet tank and close the toilet flapper. Closing the flapper will keep more water from entering the bowl.


The flapper looks like a circular drain stopper attached to a chain.
The water in the tank isn't dirty, so it's fine to stick your hand inside to close the flapper.;
, In case splashing occurs, place newspapers or paper towels on the floor to soak up liquid. The paper will make for easier cleanup later. You should also turn on the ventilation fan or open a window to minimize foul odors.


If the clog is serious, put on a pair of rubber gloves. Toilets are unsanitary, but a good pair of rubber cleaning gloves will protect you from any germs within. Choose gloves that reach up to your elbows.
You may also want to put on an old set of clothing, just in case things get messy.

, If you can see the cause of the clog, reach in and remove it from the toilet if possible. If you can't clear it with your hands, but you know there's an object (such as a child's toy) causing the clog, skip the plunging and go straight to another method.

, It is important to use a large heavy-duty rubber plunger, either the ball-shaped type or one with a fold-out rubber flange on the bottom which forms a seal. Do not use the small cheap suction-cup type of plunger. These will often not work.If your plunger is not making a tight seal, try wrapping an old rag around the end of the plunger to stop any leaks.
Run the plunger under hot water before using it. This will soften it up, which will help with create a seal.

, Make sure the plunger completely covers the hole. The plunger should be submerged in water to be effective. It is important to be pushing and pulling with water, not air. Add water from the sink to the bowl if necessary.


Pump the plunger over the hole. Start slowly at first, since the first plunge will push air into the bowl. Push down, then pull up sharply to disturb the clog and loosen it. Continue vigorously pushing and pulling until the water begins to drain. It may take 15 to 20 times before the toilet unclogs.Be patient, as long as you're sure there's no hard object, plunging alone often suffices. It might not work immediately but would often work after a few repeated efforts/flushing, with each effort constituting of dozens of plunging. .

, If the plunging eventually drains the bowl, but the clog is still blocking a free flow down the drain, leave the plunger in the bowl and fill the bowl with water again. Fill it to the point it is normally after a regular flush, then plunge again. Stubborn clogs might require you to do this a number of times.

The size and spacing of mounting holes for most modern toilets are standard, as is the width of the seat (with small variations). The most important thing to know is if your seat is ""round"" or ""oblong"". Round seats are about 16 inches (40.6 cm) from front-to-back, and oblong are about 18 inches (45.7 cm) from front-to-back.;
, Once you know the right size toilet seat to choose, you will need to pick out the seat itself. The number of options you have can be surprising, and since toilet seat sizes are fairly standard, all of these various options should be available to you as long as you have a standard toilet.Toilet seats come in a variety of materials. The most common materials include cushioned vinyl, plastic, polypropylene, real wood, and molded wood.
Consider the lifespan of the seat when you pick it out in the store. Most manufacturers will mark an estimated lifespan on the package, but even if you cannot find an exact lifespan, there are a few points worth remembering. Plastic and polypropylene are the most durable and tend to last longest, while cushioned vinyl is the least durable and prone to rips.
Pick out a color that coordinates with your décor. White and ivory seats are the easiest to find since those colors are the most common, but you can order a seat in a variety of colors, ranging from black to green. You can even get toilet seats that have patterns on them, like seashells.
Consider getting a slow-close toilet seat. These toilet seats are specially designed to prevent the lid from slamming down hard on top of the seat. As such, they are safer and quieter options.
Nowadays, you can even get ""luxury"" toilet seats. Luxury seats offer features like warm water streams, heated surfaces, warm air drying, and deodorizers. Note, however, that you will need to hook up these luxury seats to an electric supply in order to use them.

, Pry off the plastic cover pieces covering the mounting holes; then unscrew the bolts holding the seat in place. Once free, simply lift the seat up and off.

Use a flat head screwdriver to pry open the plastic cover pieces.






Unscrew the plastic or metal bolts currently securing the seat to the rest of the toilet. There might be plastic or metal nuts on the other side of the bolts. If this is the case, you will need to hold onto these nuts with your hand or a pair of pliers as you remove the bolts.






At that point, you can lift away the old seat and discard it.







, Since the bolt area rarely gets cleaned, you will need to take this opportunity to wash it.

You can usually use a standard toilet bowl or bathroom cleaner on the area. If you notice rust or mold, use a cleanser that is specially formulated to deal with these issues.






Dry the area thoroughly after washing it. If you fail to dry this area before you install the new seat, moisture could build up underneath the bolts and cause mold or mildew.







, Place the new toilet seat on top of the bowl and secure it in place with bolts. Replace the plastic covers once the seat is in place to finish the task.

If there are adhesive pads on the seat, remove the cover sheets from those pads before putting the seat in position. Those pads can further secure the seat on top of the bowl.






Wind new bolts through the mounting holes in the seat and into the mounting holes on the toilet.






Attach new nuts to the opposite end of each bolt, as well.






The protective plastic covers should simply snap back in place over the bolt heads.

Purchase an enzyme waste removal product.,
Follow the instructions on the container.",How to Unclog a Toilet2," Look for a product that contains a mixture of enzymes that liquify waste materials. These enzymes are used in septic systems to break down waste.Products of this sort can be usually be purchased at home improvement stores in or near the plumbing aisle. Enzyme waste removal is preferable to using a drain-clearing chemical because it will not harm your pipes or the environment.This method will only work on organic waste, not toys or other objects.

, Pour the recommended amount of the enzyme product into the toilet bowl. You will typically be instructed to wait overnight for the enzymes to go to work on the clog. The toilet should drain once the clog has cleared.

"
"
Heat half a gallon of water.,
Pour 1 cup baking soda and 2 cups vinegar into the toilet.,
Pour the hot water into the bowl.,
Let the mixture stand overnight.",How to Unclog a Toilet3," If the toilet tends to clog easily as the result of trying to flush too much waste, using a combination of hot water, baking soda and vinegar will often do the job as well as a commercial drain cleaner. Boil half a gallon of water, then let it cool for a moment while you add other ingredients to the toilet bowl.


Use at least half a gallon. A small amount of water won't work, since it won't have enough force to push through the clog.
The water should be no hotter than a hot tea you can drink comfortably. It should not be boiling, since very hot water can crack porcelain. You want to raise the temperature of the water passing around or pressing on the clog.

, The baking soda and vinegar create a chemical process that help to dissolve clogs. Distilled white vinegar is commonly used, but any type of vinegar will work. The mixture will fizz a great deal. If you don't have baking soda and vinegar on hand, try adding a few squirts of dish soap to the toilet bowl. The soap may help to loosen the clog. This method isn't likely to work for clogs caused by a hard obstruction, such as a toy.

, Pour it from waist level, rather than right near the rim. The force of the water falling into the bowl can help to clear the clog.

, In the morning, the water should have drained. This homemade drain cleaner should successfully clear clogs caused by organic material. If the water won't flush on your second try, you may have hard obstruction causing the clog. Try using a wire coat hanger or a drain snake.

"
"
Purchase or borrow a plumbing snake.,
Insert one end of the snake into the drain.,
Twist and push the snake through the obstruction.,
Snake in reverse.",How to Unclog a Toilet4," A plumbing snake (also sometimes called a ""flexible cleaning tool"" or ""auger"") is a flexible coil of wire that can ""snake"" through the curves of a drain and get deeper than a wire can. The best snake is a ""closet auger"" which is designed specifically to clear toilet clogs without damaging or staining the bowl. A plumber would likely use a closet auger., Push down, feeding the snake further into the drain until you feel an obstruction.

, The goal is to break up the obstruction into smaller pieces that can move through the pipes. It may take a few minutes of maneuvering to clear the obstruction. Once the water drains, flush to toilet to see whether it drains as quickly as normal.

, It may become necessary to remove the toilet and run the snake through in the opposite direction. This is especially true with hard obstructions that may have been flushed by a curious child. If a hard obstruction is known, and you are not comfortable removing and replacing the toilet, contact a plumber.

"
"
Unravel and straighten a wire coat hanger.,
Stick the wrapped end of the wire into the drain.,
Flush the toilet once the water has drained.",How to Unclog a Toilet5," Then wrap the end of the wire with a rag. Use duct tape to keep the rag in place. This will prevent the sharp end from damaging the porcelain in your toilet.The wire hanger method will generally work if there is an obstruction in the first few inches of the drain.

, Once the wire is in the drain, twist it, push it, and maneuver it in a circular motion to clear the drain. If you can feel the obstruction, push against it. Keep going until the water begins to drain.


Make sure you're wearing rubber gloves as you do this. You may get splashed as you move the wire around.
If you can't feel an obstruction, and the toilet won't drain, the clog must be out of reach of the hanger. Try the plumbing snake method to clear it.

, The obstruction and dirty water should now be able to flow through the drain like normal. If the toilet is still slow to drain, the obstruction may have gotten pushed further back, out of reach of the hanger. In this case you'll need to use a plumbing snake to clear it.

Purchase a chemical drain cleaner.,
Pour the specified amount into the toilet.",How to Unclog a Toilet6," They're available at most grocery, hardware, and ""big box"" stores. Use this method only as a last resort. The chemicals used in drain cleaners are toxic to people and pets, corrosive to pipes. Also, chlorinated drain cleaner are very damaging to the environment.If you suspect that there is a hard obstruction, do not use a chemical solution. Instead, use a snake or call a plumber.
Only use chemicals that are specifically made for toilets. Using other drain cleaners may damage your toilet.

, Be sure you follow the manufacturer's instructions. Keep the lid down to prevent toxic fumes from filling your bathroom.Never use a plunger right after adding the drain-cleaning chemicals. The chemicals could possibly shoot back up onto your skin.
Make sure the bathroom is well ventilated so you won't inhale the chemicals.

Buy or borrow a wet/dry vacuum.,
Empty the water out of the bowl using the vacuum.,
Place the end of the vacuum hose into the drain.,
Turn on the vacuum.",How to Unclog a Toilet7," If you have tried plunging and snaking to no avail, consider using a wet/dry vacuum. Do not use an ordinary vacuum cleaner––it must be the wet/dry variety that can cope with water.

, The bowl must be free of water and any other debris in order to vacuum out the obstruction.

, Push it into the toilet bowl a few inches into the hole. Use just the flexible hose, rather than an attachment. Coil an old towel around the hole to create a seal around the drain.

, Use one hand to put pressure on the towels to create a good seal. Wait a moment or two for the vacuum to work. There's a good chance the vacuum can suck out the clog.

Use a flexible silicone sealant in your kitchen and bathrooms, too, to seal the edges of your back-splashes and showers/tubs.;
, Seal them accordingly. Do the same for any leaky pipes or appliances.

, Obviously, this is only doable if you're building from scratch! But an impermeable layer, like plastic sheeting, will help keep rising damp at bay, if put underneath concrete floors and other floor coverings., Give sufficient slope to the terrace and ensure that the balconies where flower pots are kept have an away slope.

, Having good air flow throughout your house will help water evaporate and escape. Avoid the urge to seal everything as tight as can be to keep in heat. Coating all walls with impermeable layers can actually backfire, Before you start treating a damp wall, the first thing you must do is determine the source of leakage. You need to identify what kind of source is creating problems on your wall and gauge its severity. It helps you immediately resolve the issue and avoid future damage.

, Opening a window can help, but also consider using vents and extractor fans (especially for kitchens and bathrooms). You might want to buy a dehumidifier, too., Special damp-proof substances can be injected into your walls to stop damp from rising.Such a treatment is subject to regulations and has to be carried out by a reputable company specializing in damp problems.

, In areas like cellars and basements with little sunlight, you can use a radiator or small heater on a low setting to help keep the air drier.A dehumidifier may also help.

, Keep an eye out for water dripping from pipes or appliances, or in your bathrooms. Get a plumber as needed to deal with any problems.

, Identify the problem and resolve it early before severity increases to avoid unnecessary expenses later on.

, You can have a damp-proof treatment done through an expert waterproofing engineer, or do it yourself by treating the area with crystalline technology based damp block made especially for waterproofing.

Look for a faucet/tap on the pipe that leads to your toilet cistern/tank.,

If you have an older system (pre-1970s) your toilet may not have a shut-off valve.,
Try slipping a narrow length of wood under the lift arm/float lever (3) and straddling the board across the tank (front to back) to hold the lever up.,
Flush the toilet to empty it.,
After the completion of your repair work, simply remove the board and or strapping to allow the float to refill the tank.

",How to Turn Off the Water Supply to a Toilet,"
If you find a valve, first inspect the condition of the water supply valve which allows water to fill the toilet tank (shown by a red arrow in the photo). This is usually a 90 degree angle valve. Overtime due to minimal use, this valve can become very stiff and brittle. Forcing it closed, and then fully open again can cause weeping, leaks, and breakage. Carefully attempt turning the handle clockwise (without over-forcing) to turn off the water to the toilet.
If you've successfully turned it without any problem, you can skip the remainder of these steps and continue with your repair job.;
, Take the lid off the tank, and find the float (1). It will be a small container of air, designed to float on top of the water in the tank. When it floats to a certain height, the valve stops letting water into the tank; when you flush the toilet, the float falls with the water level and reopens the water valve. This allows the toilet to refill, stopping when the float reaches the correct height again. To prevent water refilling the tank, you must secure the float to prevent the valve from opening after a flush., If the sides of the tank are too high to do this, then straddle the board above the float lever, and wrap a length of stiff wire around both the float arm and the board to hold the float in the fully upright position.

, The tank should empty, while the wood/wire strapping holds the lift arm up preventing the valve from refilling the tank.

Find the source of the problem.,
Lift the tank cover.,
Check the chain connecting the flushing handle to the flapper.,
Adjust the chain if needed.",How to Fix a Slow Toilet1," “Slow toilet” can mean one of two things. Either the bowl isn’t filling quickly, or it isn’t draining quickly. If you’re dealing with the latter, the drain is likely clogged. You’ll need to unclog the toilet. If the bowl isn’t filling quickly enough, you might only need to check the tank.
, The tank is the upright portion of the toilet, where you find the flushing handle. Lay the tank cover on the floor carefully; the heavy porcelain can potentially damage your floors., The flapper is a piece of plastic or rubber which sits over the valve at the bottom of the tank. Unless your toilet isn’t flushing at all, there should be a chain connecting this to the trip lever, a small arm running from the flushing handle.The chain should have just enough slack for the flapper to rest over the valve, sealing it. But it should be tight enough to lift the flapper when the flushing handle is used.

, Performing this adjustment is rather simple. The chain should run through a hole in the flushing handle. You can easily disconnect the chain, and place a different link through the hole to adjust the chain’s overall length. The chain should be left with about half an inch of slack.Adjusting the chain means you may come into contact with the water in the toilet’s tank. As long as you wash your hands afterwards, this is perfectly safe.

Flush the toilet.",How to Fix a Slow Toilet2," Use a bucket to pour the water into the bowl. The hot water will help dislodge the residue that might be slowing the flow of water out of the bowl.Let the hot water sit in the toilet, don’t flush it.

, Make sure to use a product suitable for a toilet. The product you choose should have instructions detailing the amount you should be using.

Make sure to read the label carefully. Some products aren’t meant for use on ceramics, and may require that you use protective equipment.
Always follow the instructions listed on the product. Some drain cleaner may require immediate flushing, whereas others need time to work before being flushed.

, You can find this upright pipe in the toilet’s tank. It will usually have a small tube running into it.You should put a small amount of dishwashing liquid in, only about a tablespoon., This will give the dishwashing liquid time to seep down the overflow pipe. Additionally, the calcium and other deposits will slowly dislodge from the toilet’s walls, making for an easy clean., This will send water through the tank’s pipes, and out through the holes below the toilet rim. The dishwashing liquid will dislodge any residue in the tank. The drain cleaner will remove any clogs or mineral deposits in the drain, improving the toilet’s flow."

Take the necessary safety precautions.,
Turn off the water to the toilet and flush.,
Take off the tank cover and insert a plastic funnel into the overflow tube.,
Carefully pour muriatic acid through the funnel.,
Tape a clear piece of poly-film over the toilet bowl and tank opening.,
Let the acid sit in the toilet for 24 hours.,
Remove the poly-film and flush a few times.,
Check the rim holes for proper flow.",How to Fix a Slow Toilet3," Make sure to wear gloves, mask and eye protection. You should also wear an apron and rubber boots to protect yourself.


You should maximize ventilation by placing a running fan in the bathroom window to exhaust air. If you have a bathroom exhaust fan, turn that on too.

, Use a sponge to remove the water left in bowl. This will ensure the acid will clean the bowl to the bottom, including the critical jet-hole. This is a smaller hole at the bottom of the toilet bowl; water is pushed out of it forcefully to help the toilet flush. You’ll see it in action at the end of a flush, and buildup here may be responsible for a slow flush.

, If there is a fill tube on top of the overflow tube, carefully take that off first. The funnel’s opening should be as large as possible, to facilitate pouring, but fit snugly in the overflow tube.


Make sure not to use a metal funnel; the acid will corrode it.
Rinse the funnel well after use and do not reuse it for food.

, You should only pour a few ounces of acid into the tube.You should pour fast enough that it begins to flow out of the holes in the toilet bowl rim but not so fast that the funnel overflows or falls out, as this would splash acid and be extremely dangerous.


Pour the rest of the gallon into the toilet bowl; this will help clear the drain.

, The tighter the seal the better. Just cover the bowl portion, do not include the seat. This will keep the acid’s fumes from filling the bathroom.Alternatively you can use a clear trash bag to cover the toilet bowl.

, If there are children or pets in your home, make sure the door to the bathroom is closed and locked. The acid will dislodge mineral deposits in the toilet bowl and the drain over time., You’ll have to make sure to turn on the water first. Extra flushes are advisable in older homes with iron drain pipes, as prolonged contact with concentrated acid will damage them., You can find these holes under the toilet rim. They propel water to fill the bowl whenever you flush. Make sure that water flows freely from these holes whenever you flush. You can also use a coat hanger to check the holes for obstructions and other build ups.


Repeat the procedure if necessary.

Test the fill valve.",How to Fix a Running Toilet," Before you can check the flapper for problems, turn off the water to the toilet. Flush the toilet to drain excess water from the tank. This will allow you to inspect the flapper without having the toilet running constantly.


The flapper is a round rubber seal that stops water from draining from the tank and into the toilet bowl. When you flush the toilet, the chain pulls the flapper up so fresh water can fill the bowl.
Problems with the flapper are among the most common causes of a running toilet.;
, Lay down a towel somewhere safe and out of the way, such as in a corner. Hold either end of the lid firmly with both hands and pull the lid off the toilet. Place the lid on the towel to prevent it from getting scratched.


Toilet lids are made of heavy ceramic, so don’t place them anywhere they can easily be knocked over.

, The chain that pulls the flapper up can cause problems if it’s too long or too short. When the chain is too short, it will pull up on the valve when it shouldn’t, allowing water to drain constantly. When the chain is too long, it can get caught underneath the flapper and prevent a seal.If there's too much tension on the chain, remove the hook attaching the chain to the flush lever. Move the hook up one or two links until the chain has more slack. Reattach the hook to the flush lever.
If the chain is so long that it can get caught under the valve, use a pair of wire cutters to trim a few links from the top of the chain. Reattach the hook to the new top link and reattach it to the flush lever.

, Remove the flapper by unhooking the sides from the pins at the bottom of the overflow tube, which is the open tube in the center of the tank. Inspect the flapper for mineral deposits, warping, discoloration, disintegration, and other signs of trouble.You can clean a dirty flapper that’s got mineral buildup on it.
A flapper that shows other wear-related problems should be replaced.

, Mineral deposits from the water can build up on the flapper and prevent it from sealing properly, allowing water to run.To clean the flapper, soak it in a bowl of vinegar for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, scrub the rubber with an old toothbrush to dislodge buildup and dirt.


When the flapper is clean, put it back in place. Attach the hooks on the side to the pins on the overflow tube.
Turn the water back on and let the toilet tank fill.
Listen for the sound of water running to see if that fixed the problem.

, Take the worn flapper to the hardware store and purchase a new flapper in the same style and with the same dimensions. You can also buy a universal flapper that will fit any kind of toilet.To attach the new flapper, fit in into place and attach the hooks on the side to the pins on the overflow tube.
Turn the water back on and test the flapper to see that it’s functioning properly, and that the toilet isn't running.

, When flapper trouble isn't the cause of a running toilet, the next most common cause is the water level. When the water level is too high, water will constantly drain into the overflow tube.


With the water running and the tank full, look at the overflow tube. This is an open tube in the middle of the tank that connects the tank and the toilet bowl.
Check to see if water keeps draining into the tube. If that’s happening, you can adjust the water level by lowering the float., Water comes into a toilet tank via a fill valve. The fill valve has a float on it that rises or lowers with the water level. The float height is what tells the fill valve to shut off when the tank is full. Therefore, you can lower the water level in the tank by adjusting the height of the float. There are two main types of floats:A float ball fill valve will have a long arm attached to the fill valve, and at the end of the arm there will be a rubber ball-shaped float.
A float cup fill valve will have a small circular cylinder wrapped around the body of the fill valve. The cylinder, or float cup, slides up and down on the fill valve shaft, and its height determines the water level.

, On top of the fill valve, there will be a screw attaching the float arm to the fill valve. When you turn this screw, you can adjust the height of the float. With a screwdriver, turn the screw a quarter turn counterclockwise to lower the float.Flush the toilet and let the water in the tank refill. Check the water level.
Ideally, the water level should be 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) below the top of the overflow tube. Continue adjusting the screw by quarter turns until the water level is right., The float on a float cup fill valve is adjusted in much the same way. There will be an adjustment screw on the top of the fill valve. When you turn this screw, it will adjust the height of the float. Turn the screw a quarter turn counterclockwise to lower the float.Flush and refill the toilet tank.
Check the water level.
Make another quarter-turn adjustment if necessary until the water level in the tank is 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) below the top of the overflow tube.

, The refill tube is a tube attached to the fill valve that fills the tank with water after it’s been flushed. This tube should always be above the water line, otherwise it can lead to intermittent running. When the tank is full, make sure the tube isn't in the water.


To correct a fill tube that dips into the water, simply trim enough of the tube so that it sits above the water line., When fixing the flapper and adjusting the water level in the tank doesn’t fix a running toilet, it usually means there's a problem with the fill valve. The solution for this is replacing the fill valve. To do this, you must work with an empty tank:Turn off the water to the toilet.
Flush the toilet.
Use a sponge to absorb remaining water from the tank. Soak the sponge, wring it out in the sink, and continue until there's no water left in the tank.

, On the outside of the toilet, there will be a water supply line running into the tank. To disconnect this, unscrew the locknut securing the line in place. Turn the screw counterclockwise to loosen it.


You may need a pair of pliers to loosen the locknut., Once the supply line has been disconnected, you'll see a lock nut attaching the fill valve assembly to the toilet on the outside of the tank. Remove this by using an adjustable wrench to turn the lock nut to the left (counterclockwise). Once the lock nut is off, you can pull the old fill valve assembly out from the toilet tank.You may want to take the old assembly to the hardware store when you purchase the replacement. That way, you can be sure to get the right size and style fill valve for your toilet.You can replace older ball float fill valves with more modern float cup style ones.

, Insert the new fill valve into the same place in the tank. Fit the valve into the hole in the tank where the water supply line comes in. Hook up the water supply line. Tighten the nut in a clockwise direction to tighten it.


Once the locknut has been hand tightened, use the pliers to turn the nut another quarter turn.

, Connect the fill tube to the water output nozzle at the top of the fill valve. Position the fill tube so it’s draining into the overflow tube. If there's a clip on the overflow tube, attach the fill tube to the clip to keep it in place., Check the manufacturer’s directions to determine the correct float height for the fill valve you purchased. Use a measuring tape to measure from the bottom of the tank, and adjust the fill valve to the right height by turning the adjustment screw., Turn the water back on and let the toilet tank fill with water. Check the water level, make sure the fill tube isn't in the water, and listen that there isn't any water running. Adjust the float height if necessary. Test the toilet by flushing it and letting it fill up again.


Once the toilet has been fixed and is no longer running, carefully place the tank lid back on.

Also put nylon around the vacuum rod; this is to block air from escaping there; now more pressure will be on bits of glass.


After you're done, clean the vacuum too; likely there will be water in it too; this is to avoid mold forming in there.

,


Reconnect the garbage disposal to the power source.
Partially cover the drain with an old plate. This will prevent any objects from flying up, but still allow the water to drain out.
Turn on the cold water faucet.
Turn the garbage disposal on. Any remaining small pieces of glass will now be chopped up and washed down the drain.
If the garbage disposal still jams, there's probably still glass stuck in it. Turn it off immediately, turn of the cold water, and repeat the process from the beginning.

,


If none of the previous solutions work, use your product manual to remove the garbage disposal from the sink. If necessary, enlist the help of a family member or friend, as garbage disposals are usually quite heavy.
Once you've removed the disposal, carefully remove any remaining pieces of glass.
Reinstall the garbage disposal following the instructions in the manual.

Make sure your gutters are unclogged and free of leaves and other debris, and that water can flow easily through them into the downspouts.Make sure your downspouts carry water far enough away from the house and that you're not getting back flow. The downspouts should dump water 4–5 feet (1.2–1.5 m) away from the foundation.
Make sure the soil around your foundation slopes at least a couple of feet away from the house. If you've got pits that catch the water and force it downward, you might have problems getting water in your basement. Correct these issues before thinking about a sump.;
, Most homes built in the last thirty years have foundations built upon a certain amount of gravel to correct for inconsistencies in the excavation process. If you've got contact with the builder of the home, you should be able to figure this out, or ask neighbors with similar homes whether or not this is the case.


You might not know this until you break through the floor, which is another reason you want to explore alternatives before you get in over your head.

, You'll want to place the sump near a wall in the basement, since the sump pump discharge will need to exit the basement and travel at least 10 feet (3.0 m) outside to discharge.


Look for a spot that will be easy to work in, and where you can punch a hole through a rim joist to reach outside.
Stay at least 8"" away from the foundation wall, to avoid hitting any footings.
Make sure you're not going to cut into the waterline. If the water enters your home through the wall, you'll be fine, but check the building codes in your area to make sure where the line will be if it comes in under the home. Typically, the pipes will run from the street, 4–6 feet (1.2–1.8 m) away from the sewer pipe., Leave a 3–4 inch (7.6–10.2 cm) gap around the liner to make it easier to fit the liner in the hole (you will fill in the gap with gravel and concrete later).

, This can be relatively quick work with an electric jackhammer, if you can rent one. Cut the concrete you're removing into manageable pieces and avoid just shredding the concrete. When you've got squares cut, move the jackhammer at an angle to pry up the pieces and remove them from the area.


Alternatively, you can make do with a hammer drill rigged with a masonry bit, a good sledgehammer, and a masonry chisel. Using the largest masonry drill bit you can chuck in the drill, begin making holes every few inches in the concrete along the outside perimeter, then use the hammer and chisel to crack the concrete between the holes.
Continue drilling holes and hammering the concrete until you can remove it in chunks. If your floor has reinforcing steel mesh installed in it, you may need a pair of heavy wire cutters or a metal grinder to cut it.

, You will want to dig the sump hole at least 12"" deeper than the sump liner. Use 5 gallon (18.9 L) buckets to cart the debris outside.


Place, or replace, some coarse gravel in the bottom of the hole, so that the sump liner sits flush with the basement floor when placed in the hole. This gravel will promote good drainage, and help water move into the sump where it can be pumped away (instead of moving into your basement at another spot).
It may be difficult to dig the sump if the soil is sandy and wet. If water infiltration is causing the hole to erode there are a few options. You can wait for the soil to dry, dig faster than the water enters or use a garden hose. For the garden hose method, you will need to place the sump liner in the started hole and fill it with water. Then use a garden hose and push it under the liner. The water from the hose will push the sand out from under the liner and will stop the erosion. The weight of the liner will cause it to fall in the void underneath. As the liner drops into the ground you may have to wiggle the liner to keep it straight
Depending on the liner used, you may have to drill numerous holes in the sump liner to allow water to enter so the pump can pump it away. The drilled holes should be smaller in diameter than the size of gravel used so that gravel does not come through.

, Place gravel around the sides of the sump liner, coming up to about 6"" below the level of the floor. Use any size of gravel between 3/8 and 1/2 inch.

, Mix your concrete, and pour a 6-inch layer of concrete over the gravel, filling in the floor up to the edge of the sump liner. Trowel the concrete to achieve a smooth surface. After the concrete has set up reasonably well (at least 8 hours), you may resume working on the sump.

, Most pumps use 1.5"" PVC pipe, but review the instructions that came with your pump to be sure. Leave a short stub of PVC pipe on the outside, you can attach a flexible hose to go the rest of the way.


When assembling the piping, be sure to dry-fit the entire section before gluing anything. Work in a well ventilated space, to minimize exposure to the solvent fumes and complete the seals with caulking agent on both the inside and outside contact points. The particular couplings will depend upon your house and foundation, which makes this a job for a fairly experienced DIY plumber.Use a hole saw with the appropriate sized bit to cut a hole through your siding and rim joist. It's usually best to bore from the outside in, using a 2 inch (5.1 cm) drill bit.

, Place the pump in the liner, attach the final section of pipe, and plug your pump in.


It may be necessary to drill numerous holes in the liner to enable water to get in to be pumped out. The diameter of the drilled holes must be smaller than the size of the gravel used so that no gravel can enter the sump liner.

, Pumps come with different types of floats, but for any type it is important to ensure that the float on the pump is unobstructed so that it can rise and fall with the water level in the sump. As water flows into the sump the float needs to be able to rise to a level that will activate the pump switch and fall back down without getting stuck between the pump and the sump liner wall. Usually it is a simple matter of just centering the pump in the sump liner, but it is best to double check your set up.

, This is used to expel the water left in the tube after the pump turns off, avoiding a motor burn out and an endless on/off cycle. Most check valves come with hose clamps and couplings, which feature directional arrows. Fix it appropriately on the riser and tighten it with a screwdriver.

, Fill a bucket with water and wet-test your rig. Check the piping for leaks and make sure it empties outside like you want it to, and that your check valve functions correctly when you shut it off.

Prepare and design your system.,
Wait for approval.",How to Install a Septic System1," The first step in any septic installation is to perform a site survey and do a percolation (soil) test on the area where the POWTS is going to be installed. The system then can be designed based on the findings of the survey and results of the soil test. After this, the appropriate permits and approvals can be applied for.


Site survey findings that influence the design include things like:

available space
topography
intended purpose and perceived water use based on the size of the dwelling/building the system will service.


location of the well and/or neighboring wells.
Soil test findings that influence the design include things like:

soil type and layering (sand, clay, rock, and where it is located relative to depth)
ability of the soil to drain and filter wastewater.



, Upon receipt of the necessary permits and approvals, the system can be installed. Be sure to perform the following procedures in compliance with any and all laws and applicable plumbing and building codes."
"
Assemble the equipment and tools needed for excavation.,
Find where you want to go into the building relative to where you want to place the septic tank.,
Excavate a hole large enough to set the concrete aerobic tank below ground.,
Place (in most jurisdictions) ""inch-and-a-half washed drain rock"" from a nearby gravel pit around the pipe.,
Cover up the pipe and tank once you have a green tag from the health inspector.",How to Install a Septic System2," You will need:


Backhoe
Laser transit and grade pole
4"" Sch. 40 PVC pipe(and fittings if needed)
4"" ASTM D2729 perforated pipe
4""ASTM D3034 pipe and fittings
4"" Sch. 40 vent caps and test caps
PVC primer and glue
Saw (either hand saw or cordless reciprocating saw)
Hammer drill and bits(to go through wall if necessary)
Hydraulic cement (to seal around pipe if going through wall)
Shovel
Inch-and-a-half washed stone (quantity depends on system size)
Tape measures (regular and also at least a 100' tape)
Septic fabric (cut roll to 3' long or so)
Septic tank and risers (concrete, or plastic if allowed)
Con-Seal (for concrete) or silicone caulk (for plastic) to seal risers
Septic filter (ex. Zoeller 170 or similar) if required.
distribution box (either concrete, or plastic, if running more than two laterals.);
, Excavate to at least 2 feet deep and drill a hole through the wall, or go deeper and go under the footing, whichever is desired, or necessary. Plan for the flow to go downhill from here, as this is exactly what a gravity fed system is all about. It does not use a mechanical means other than gravity to discharge the waste from the tank to the drain field.


Pipe 4"" Sch. 40 going a foot through the wall or under the footing, and to a minimum of five feet outside the building toward the tank. Set it level where it's going through the wall or under the footing, and from there run with about an 1/8"" per foot of pitch (slope) toward the septic tank. Go further or all the way into the tank if required. If not, switch to 4"" 3034 with the appropriate adapter and pipe toward the tank with 3034.

Be sure to put a test cap on the end going into the building. If going through the wall, seal around the hole with hydraulic cement, inside and out.
Don't run too much pitch going out to the tank. If there's too much, the water runs away faster than the solids, and the solids may get left in the pipe. Also, there may not be enough pitch to get to the drain field, depending on the depth your drain field is, and how close it will be to the outlet of the tank.



, Use the laser transit and ""shoot"" the top of the pipe going out to the tank. Measure the distance from the top of the inlet, to the bottom of the tank. Add this (go up on the grade pole) plus 1 1/2"" to the number you shot off the top of the pipe. The grade pole is now set to the depth that you need. Proceed to use this to excavate the hole to the appropriate depth.


Lay out and excavate your leech field as it has been determined by the test done in the permit process. When laying out and excavating, remember to maintain a positive flow between the tank and the drain field.

, This is required to hold the pipe steady. See your local health requirements for the size of embedment needed and the size of gravel. The perforated pipe in a gravity drain field has no slope end to end and has capped ends.

, All areas depending on the rules of the local health department will require a special filter fabric, newspaper, four inches of straw or untreated building paper to cover the drain rock before backfilling.

"
"
Install a pump chamber after the septic tank.,
The construction details including the layout of all sewers outside of the home, the location and depth of all tanks, the routing and depth of pressurized effluent lines and other system parts such as the drain field and any additional ATUs must match the septic system plans as approved by the local county health department.

,
Cover the tank and pressurized lines once the inspector has given his final approval and the system is activated.

",How to Install a Septic System3," The pump chamber or sometimes known as a pressure tank, or dosing tank contains the electric pump which is utilized to move the effluent from place to place, and eventually into the drain field for final disposal.


Set up the pump chamber as you would the septic tank. The pump chamber contains the effluent pump and floats to pump out to the drain field at measured or timed intervals. This is a sealed system. The electrical installation will usually require a licensed electrician to satisfy state regulations. In areas with high ground water, be aware that the pump chamber or additional ATUs may be mostly empty much of the time, and these tanks may have to be protected against flotation by the use of extra weight or other protective structures.

"
As a rule of thumb, look to add shallow rooted plants and shrubs when designing your drain field landscape.,
Keep trees to a minimum and stick to varieties that truly have a very shallow root system and the same applies to shrubs.",How to Plant on Your Septic System Drainfield or Leachfield," Some species of herbaceous plants have minimal root depth and only require a moderate water supply to flourish.


Most drain fields and leach have perforated piping that run anywhere from 6 to 46 inches (15.2 to 116.8 cm) below the surface and heavy thick roots from the wrong type of flora can greatly inhibit or degrade the systems performance. Always consult an expert of what plants and shrubs might work best for your situation and do a little research before taking the plunge since digging up freshly planted shrubbery is not on the agenda.
Some plant recommendations might be shallow-rooted plants such as flowering perennials and annuals, turf grass, and other short root additions most often will not damage the lines and their root system is usually contained within a few inches of the base stem or trunk. When working with your drain field or leach field, remember to proceed with caution and carefully move the soil as you prepare for the additional shrubbery. Small trees and medium to large shrubs are possibly not the best choice for your drain field being their root systems might wander too deep and therefore interrupt the function of your field through root damage, soil shifting and excessive water absorption.;
, If you do have a requirement in your design to add trees or heavy shrubs to the drain field or leach field system, attempt to place the flora outside of the drain field perimeter thereby allowing the root system to develop and thicken outside of your systems footprint. If you currently have deep rooted shrubs or trees near your drain field, you may want to consider relocating them to another part of your yard or removing them all together.

Figure out what kind of garbage disposal you need.,
Gather tools and other supplies.,
Turn off the power.,
Detach the dishwasher hose.,
Detach the waste line.,
Take off the disposal.,
Take apart the rest of the mounting assembly.,
Wire the disposal.,
Install the drain flange and mounting ring.,
Mount the disposal.,
Connect the disposal to the P-trap.,
Check the disposal.",How to Install a Garbage Disposal," When you're shopping for a new disposal, there are several factors to take into consideration. Think about who will be using the disposal, whether a noisy disposal is an issue in your household, and what kind of plumbing you have at your home.









If you have children who will be using the disposal, consider getting a batch feed disposal rather than a continuous feed disposal. Batch feed disposals, which are a bit more expensive, require the use of a stopper prior to operation, which can be safer in households with kids. Continuous feed disposals start running when you flip a switch and keep running when you switch it off. If someone drops a utensil down the drain or sticks their hand inside, this can be a dangerous situation.
Choose a motor that's right for your household. Models with lower horsepower, usually about 1/3, are suitable for small households with a small amount of food waste. Models with 1/2 horsepower are better for larger households with more food waste.
Consider the features you want the disposal to have. For a higher price, you can buy a disposal made to function more quietly, one made from stainless steel, or one that connects to your dishwasher.
If your plumbing is connected to a septic tank, you need to buy a disposal made especially for septic tanks.;
, In addition to an appropriate garbage disposal, you'll need the following equipment to complete the installation:









A screwdriver
A disposer wrench
A hacksaw
Water pump pliers
Plumber's putty
Electrical cord
Safety supplies, including goggles and a dust mask

, Make sure the power to the garbage disposal is turned off while you're installing it. Cover the panel box to make sure no one can turn it back on until the job is complete.








, Not all disposals are connected to a dishwasher, but if yours is, use a screwdriver to loosen and detach the hose attaching the disposal to your dishwasher.








, Remove the ""P"" trap waste line running from the disposal by using a wrench to unscrew the slip-nut connecting the disposal to the trap. You might want to place a bucket under the trap to catch any wastewater sitting in the bottom.








, Remove the disposal by inserting a screwdriver into the mounting ring lug and turning counterclockwise until it comes loose.








, Remove the ring on the sink sleeve, the sink sleeve, the flange, the fiber gasket, and the plumber's putty. Finish preparing the sink for the new disposal by cleaning the sleeve, flange and sink opening.








, Some disposals come with appliance wires attached, and others do not. If yours doesn't, remove the cover plate beneath the disposal and attach the wires according the manufacturer's instructions. Most standard disposals have you attach white wires to white wires and black wires to black wires. When you're finished, screw the cover plate back on.








, Roll plumber's putty between your hands to form a snake about 1/2-inch thick and 10 inches (25.4 cm) long. Apply it to the underside of the drain flange under the sink. Insert the flange into the drain hole and press down evenly to attach it. Then snap on the backup ring, fiber gasket and mounting ring.









Working from beneath the sink, use a screwdriver to screw the mounting ring tightly against the sink. It helps to alternate sides, screwing one screw and switching to the other, so that the mounting ring tightens evenly.
Some of the plumber's putty will have squeezed out around the flange. Use a knife to trim it away.

, Place the disposal into the mounting ring, making sure that the disposal's outlet is facing the drain pipe connection. Tighten it until the disposal stays in place.








, Measure the discharge pipe and use a hacksaw to cut it to size, then attach it to the outlet on the disposal. Be sure to read the manufacturer's instructions to make sure you connect it properly. Attach the dishwater discharge tube as well.








, Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and turn on the disposal to make sure it works. Check underneath to be sure there aren't any leaks. Run some food through the disposal to be sure it grinds and gets disposed of properly.

Place the generator in a safe and enclosed place like at garage or shed, but make sure the area has adequate ventilation.,
Measure the distance between the sump pump and the generator outside.,Fill the generator with fuel until the tank is full.,
Start the generator, and while it is running, connect the extension cord to the sump pump plug briefly to make sure the sump pump is working properly.",How to Install a Generator for a Sump Pump," Most generators run on fuel such as gasoline or diesel, so it is very important that the machine be in a location that will allow the exhaust to dissipate. If you store a generator in an unprotected area, the generator may sustain damage from rain, ice, lightning strikes or falling objects.
, Use this measurement to determine how long of an extension cord you will need when you install the generator to the sump pump. You may require multiple extension cords.,, You will know the pump is working because you will hear the water being pumped away from the building and you will see the water begin to drain in the sump pump hole. Once you know the pump is working, make sure water continues to drain and is sent away from the building until the water is at a low level in the pump hole."

Bring a sample of your pipe.,
Buy the right couplings.,
Drain the basin.,
Turning off the sump pump.,
Locate the discharge pipe.,
Cut the pipe.,
File the edges.,
Fit the valve.,
Fit both ends together.,
Seal the points of contact.,
Let the cement dry.,
Test your sump pump check valve.",How to Install a Sump Pump Check Valve," Having a check valve will make sure that the water lingering in the sump pump’s discharge line does not flow back into the basin of the sump pump after you shut the pump off.
, Make sure that you have everything you will need throughout the entire process to be better prepared. You will need the following:

Tape measure
Pipe cleaner
PVC cement
PVC cement applicator
Utility knife
Sump pump check valve
Adapters or couplings
Pipe cutter

, Pay attention to the diameter of your existing discharge pipe. You can go to the local hardware store and buy the corresponding check valve (which comes with the correct diameter). It is important that you do not buy a valve with a smaller diameter than your current drainpipe.,  If you are going to a hardware store, it is a good idea to bring a sample of your pipe with you if possible. This allows you to try to fit the valves with your pipe, just to be sure that you have a good fit. Because there are so many different valves available, you can opt for whatever suits your needs., You also need to make sure that you buy the adapters or couplings that are going to fit according to the size of your drainpipe. Again, if you are unsure, having the pipe with you at the store is going to eliminate a lot of the confusion., You also need to make sure that you buy the adapters or couplings that are going to fit according to the size of your drainpipe. Again, if you are unsure, having the pipe with you at the store is going to eliminate a lot of the confusion., Just to be sure, before you ever get started, you should turn off the electricity to the pump. If you want to be extra cautious, make sure that you unplug the sump pump altogether., Now you have your sump pump check valve. The next step is looking at the discharge pipe and figuring out where exactly you should place your check valve. The traditional option is to have it close to the sump pump itself, next to the sump pit. This is going to ensure that you do not have too much water trapped between the pump and the check valve., Use a pipe cutter to cut the discharge pipe in two places. This is going to ensure that there is enough room to fit your new valve. You want to make sure that you do not cut too much of the pipe right away. Instead, measure first and then cut little by little. It is better to have to cut the pipe two or three times than realize that you took out too much., After you have made the cut the right way and you are happy with the result, you can smooth out the edges of the pipe. You want to file down the edges of the pipe as much as possible in order to smooth them out., You have a gap in your discharge pipe, now you want to fit the check valve into the recently created gap. If you were secure in determining the appropriate size at the start and with your cutting of the pipe, you should find that the valve actually fits perfectly., Both ends of the discharge pipe go into both ends of the valve. Now all you have left to do is secure it. Join all the ends together by using the couplings., If you have your sump pump check valve in place, you will now want to seal the points of contact. Use some PVC cement to create a good seal. Grab an applicator, put some cement on the applicator, and apply the cement across the gaps between the connections., Before you try your sump pump check valve make sure that you thoroughly clean the area. There should be no more open gaps., Now we have arrived at the final test, actually running your valve for the first time. In order to test your check valve, you have to open the pump and pump in some water from the sump pit. Pay close attention and listen carefully when the initial water pressure runs through the valve. You should be able to hear the flap inside of the valve open as the water pressure increases."

Dig a ditch 4 feet (1.2 m) wide, 26 feet (7.9 m) long, and 3 feet (0.9 m) deep.,
Assemble all the supplies, parts, and equipment.,
Cut a hole in the top of each drum the size of the toilet flange pipe outside measurement.,
Attach a 4"" toilet flange to each hole.

,
Cut two holes in the top side of the lower drum, as shown in the photo, 45 degrees away from a perpendicular line drawn from the hole on top to the far side.

,
Cut one hole in the upper drum opposite the hole in the top, as shown in the photo.

,
Place the drum with one hole in the side at the end of the trench.,
Dig a hole about one foot deeper for the placement of the second drum in front of the first.

,
Dig the hole mentioned in step 8 a little deeper and fill with gravel until the 90 ell fits perfectly from the hole in the side of the top drum to the toilet flange of the lower drum.

,
Cut a 3 1/2"" piece of 4"" ABS pipe (nipple) and glue it into one end of the 90 ell.,
Test the fit for alignment between the two drums.,
When you are sure about the fit, glue the end of the 3 1/2"" nipple into the toilet flange.,
Glue a ""Y"" to 3 1/2 nipples and add a 45 degree bend to the left side of the ""Y"".,
Cut and glue (2) 2 1/2"" nipples to the remaining two 45 degree bends at one end only and insert into holes in the side of the lower drum, as shown in the photo in step 7.,See photo in Step 7

,
Pound a stake into the ground so that the top of the stake is level with the bottom of the 45 degree bend coming out of one side of the bottom drum.

,
Tape a 1"" wide block to the end of a 4 foot (1.2 m) level, as shown in the photo to the right.

,
Start the second stake a little less than 4 feet (1.2 m) down the trench from the first.

,
Lay the end of the level without the block on the first stake and the block on the second.,
Repeat this process until you have stakes the length of the trench.

,
Place the gravel in the trench until the top of the gravel is equal with the top of the stakes.

,
The gravel should now slope away from the drums at 1/4"" to the foot.

,
Place two pieces of 10 foot (3.0 m) 4"" perforated drain pipe connected with a slip coupler (holes down).,
Check the drain pipes with the level and block to see if the 1/4"" grade is consistent along the length of the pipe.,
Seal the 45 degree bends and the 90 degree bend to the lower and upper drums, respectively.,
If sealant has cured, fill drums with water to prevent the drums from collapsing under the weight of the gravel.,
Lay landscape fabric over the gravel.,
Fill the remaining trench area with soil, compacting well to the original grade.

,
Fill the upper drum with water.

",How to Construct a Small Septic System,";

, It should be near the edge. A saber saw is best for this task.

,,,, Level the drum. The top of the drum should be at least 4 inches (10.2 cm) below grade.

,,, Cut another nipple about 2 1/2"" long and glue it in the other end.

, The end with the short nipple should go into the upper drum. It should look like the photo in Step 9.

, We will deal with sealing the connection to the upper drum later.

, Align the ""Y"" to meet the incoming waste line, and glue it into the toilet flange.

, The face of the two 45 degree bends should be perpendicular to the trench.

,,,,, Pound the stake down until the level shows level when the block is on the second stake. The second stake is now 1"" lower than the first, or 1/4"" per foot.

,,,, Slide one end into the 45 degree bend of the lower drum. Repeat on the other side.

, Adjust by adding or removing gravel under the pipe.

, Try a two part epoxy. You could also use silicon caulk. See the photo in step 6 for finished view of epoxy. Consider using flex pipe for this, so that if the ground shifts it will give a little.

, Bury the trench to the top of the bottom drum with the remaining gravel.

, This will prevent the soil from seeping into the gravel.

Find the odor source.,
Look for other possible sources of the odors.,
Request a plumber's assessment of the installed plumbing fixtures.,
Let air flow through your home.",How to Get Rid of Sewer Odor," This can be simple sometimes. Look for floor drains in the basement, and plumbing fixtures that don't get much use like guest baths, and laundry sinks. Over time the trap under these fixtures can go dry, thereby letting sewer gas in by losing the water seal. The fix is as simple as pouring a few cups of water in the trap. Now you know why the ""U"" shaped pipe under the sink is called a ""trap""––it traps sewer gas in the drains!

Dry traps are sometimes hidden by carpets.
Consider infrequently used sinks in basements. These can be a source of odor, so run water through them more regularly.;
, Here are some typical odor source areas in the house (you may be able to check for these yourself but in some cases, it's best to ask the plumber to do it, especially if you're unsure).

Check old laundry drains no longer used. These should be capped off.
Get your HVAC equipment serviced. If it's not working properly, it can be a source of odors.
Check the shower drain. Odors can be caused when hair hangs on the strainer and touches the trap water.
Look at the toilet. When the toilet wax seals have gone bad between the piping and the toilet base, odors can emerge.
Consider vent areas. Clogged vents on the roof or in the yard can cause gas backup.

, Improperly installed plumbing fixtures, such as no trap, can cause sewer odors.

Check for broken or leaking pipes in the basement or walls. A plumber can do this for you.

, If you can, open the house to get the smell out, then close everything up and start in the basement and work your way up to find the where the odor begins."

Understand your septic tank.,
Conserve water.,
Keep heavy things away from the tank.,
Don’t flush or pour non-biodegradables and chemicals down the drain.,
Avoid garbage disposals.,
Put a liter of spoiled buttermilk down the toilet and flush it once every few months.,
Use septic-safe products:

Use environmentally safe soaps as much as possible (dish or hand soap).,
Provide good maintenance around the tank:

Cut down all large trees and shrubs near tank and drain (leach field).,
Get the tank pumped.,
After minimizing the amount of grey water (wash water) that enters the system, filter all washing machine water with a high tech washing machine lint trap filter.",How to Care for a Septic System,"


In a septic tank, solid waste settles to the bottom and scum rises to the top. Excess liquid goes out to the drain field, either by gravity or with a septic pump. If the system has a filter (typically located in the outlet tee) learn how to clean and care for it. If a pump system with alarm, periodically test the alarm for function. Bacteria break down solids in the tank but they need to be pumped out periodically.





;
,


Your septic tank can handle only so much water at a time. The tank needs time to separate the solids and liquids and send the liquids to the drain field.






Check for running toilets and leaky faucets.






Consider installing low flow or high efficiency toilets.






Choose the right load size when doing laundry. Washing a small load on the large load setting wastes water.






Spread out laundry days. Instead of doing all laundry on one day, spread it out to allow time for the septic tank to recover.







,


Do not put anything heavy on the ground over your tank or drain field, such as a shed, parked car or RV, cement, asphalt, or above ground pool. These can damage the tank and pipes, compromise the effectiveness of the drain field, and are in violation of laws in most jurisdictions.

, These can clog the tank and drain field; chemicals can kill bacteria that help break down solids.

Bleach.







,


If you have a septic tank, don’t install a garbage disposal.






Use a garbage disposal sparingly. It can clog the drain field and leads to more waste water.






Using a garbage disposal means more frequent pumping of the septic tank, ideally every year.







, Great bacteria!,
Use septic-safe toilet paper and septic-safe pre-moistened cloths.
Flush ""RID"" (in toilet) every few months.

, Keep it clear of roots; the roots of trees can damage pipes and the tank. Be especially careful of trees with aggressive roots such as willow trees.






If the leach field is near rain fall-off from the roof, install gutters to divert water away from the drain field.

,


Pumping the septic tank costs around $200-$300 but can vary by region. Cost will be higher if digging to locate the tank is required.






How often to pump depends on the size of the tank and number of people in the household. Average is about every 1-5 years.






Garbage disposal use increases the frequency for pumping needs.
For a 1,000 gallon (3,785.4 L) tank providing service to four people in a household with no garbage disposal, pumping every 2-3 years is normal. With only 2 people in the household, 4-5 years.
When having the tank pumped, consider having it inspected it to make sure it’s in good working order.

, Surprise: one could carpet a living room with the amount of tiny non-biodegradable fibers entering a septic system each year.

Use bottled drinking water and iodized salt.,
Get a heavy ceramic mug and a large glass bowl.,
Make sure you have access to a spot with direct sunlight, like a window sill.,
Pour 1 inch of drinking water into the mug.,
Put the salt water into the large glass bowl.,
Cover the glass bowl with plastic cling wrap.,
Place the bowl in direct sunlight.,
Leave the bowl in the sun for three to four hours.,
Check the cup for fresh water.",How to Desalinate Water," Before you can desalinate the water, you will need to create salinate water, or salt water. Do this by buying a bottle of drinking water and iodized salt from your local grocery store. You can also use a bottle of tap water if you do not want to buy a bottle of water.If you happen to live near an ocean, you can skip these materials and fill a bottle with seawater. Seawater is full of salt and great for use in the desalination process.;
, You will use the ceramic mug as a container for the desalinated water and the large glass bowl will act as a receptacle for the salt during the desalination process. The glass bowl should be big enough to fit the mug.You will also need a piece of plastic cling wrap, enough to go over the glass bowl, and a small weight like a rock.

, You will need to place your desalination device in direct sunlight to warm up the water in the device and create humid air. The humid air will then condense into water droplets that you can drink., You do not want to fill the mug up too much, just until it appears 1 inch deep with water.Mix enough salt into the water so it tastes salty. Start with a small amount of iodized salt and taste it to ensure it is salty. Make sure you fill the mug with more water if you drink some of it, as you want there to be a depth of about 1 inch of water in the mug.

, You will then need to rinse and dry the mug to ensure there is not salt residue in the mug.Once you have rinsed and dried the mug, you can put it in the center of the glass bowl in the 1 inch of salt water.

, Make sure the cling wrap is stretched tightly over the mug and the sides of the bowl, with no open areas around the rim of the bowl.

, Look for a window sill or a spot on your deck outside that gets lots of direct sunlight and make sure the bowl is on a nice, even surface in the sun.Place the small weight or rock on the top of the plastic wrap, right above the cup. The plastic wrap should sag in the center of the cup due to the weight of the rock. This will ensure the condensed water falls into the cup so you can drink it.

, After several hours in the sun, there will be a build up of humid air in the bowl. This will lead to the formation of water condensation on the plastic wrap. The water droplets should then flow downward into the cup.

, After the bowl has been in the sun for three to four hours, check the cup for a small amount of water. Remove the plastic wrap and drink the water in the cup. You should taste pure, clean fresh water that has been desalinated.This desalination device works by using the sun to warm up the salt water. The plastic wrap helps to trap the water vapors in the bowl as the salt water evaporates. Because the top of the plastic wrap is much cooler than the rest of the bowl, the humid air in the bowl condenses on the top of the plastic wrap and forms water droplets.
Over time, the water droplets on the plastic wrap grow larger and start to flow to the center of the bowl due to the weight of the rock. As the water droplets build up, they grow heavier and eventually fall into the cup. The result of this simple desalination device is a cup of fresh drinking water that does not contain any salt.

Obtain the annual water supply quality report from our city.,
Purchase chlorine test papers to determine the chlorine levels in your home water.,
Place the water to be dechlorinated outside in a sunny location.,
Dechlorinate water by boiling.,
Use vitamin C tablets to dechlorinate water.,
Install a carbon filter dechlorination system to filter your home's entire water system.,
Install an under-the-sink carbon filter to remove chlorine.",How to Dechlorinate Water," There are currently ongoing laboratory tests on the long-term effects of chlorine exposure. However, some health officials are advocating the dechlorination of drinking water.


An increased risk of bladder cancer may be seen in communities that drink chlorinated water.
Chlorinated water may have an effect on lipid levels, such as increases in high density lipoproteins (HDL) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL).
Chlorinated water may elevate the cholesterol and HDL ratio.
Asthma may be triggered by chlorinated water.;
, Federal recommendations and research indicate that people should drink water containing no more than 4 ppm (parts per million) (equivalent to 4mg/l) of chlorine.

, A water report may also show the level of generated by-products compared to federal regulatory guidelines.

,


Place the chlorine test strip into a glass of tap water. Swirl the paper in the water for 10 seconds. Remove the strip from the water, and compare the color of the water to the chlorine test kit indicator guide.

, The chlorine will escape the water in the form of a gas. This method is helpful for dechlorinating swimming pools just before they are drained so that damage is not done to surrounding areas. Lawns, landscaping, and animals may be adversely affected by heavily chlorinated swimming pool water if it is not dechlorinated and drained correctly.


Setting the water out also works well when preparing aquarium water.

, Place the water in a large pot, and boil for 20 minutes.

, Depending on the brand, 1 tablet can treat up to 100 gallons (378.5 L) of water. Dechlorination tablets work well for bathwater and hot tubs.

, These tank systems come in a variety of tank sizes, but they may be the most expensive dechlorination option. This method provides total dechlorination of the home water supply. The filters require some care, such as washing out the carbon filter every 6 months and replacing it as recommended by the manufacturer.

, The filters in these units need to be replaced more often than a whole house filtration system, but they are an inexpensive option.

Shut off the water.,
Take the filter out.,
Remove the plastic netting on some filters.,
Hose the filter down.,
Soak the filter.,
Rinse the pleated filter thoroughly.,
Prepare the filter.,
Insert the filter back in the housing.",How to Clean a Water Filter1," You'll have a valve on the way to your water filter. That valve needs to be turned, usually so it's running perpendicular to the pipe rather than parallel, but yours may be different. Also, you may need to isolate the water filter globe by turning another valve.Some filters will need to be depressurized. You press a button on top. Use a rag to catch the spillover.;
, You can have several different types of filters. Most paper filters cannot be cleaned, but you can clean synthetic fiber pleated filters and carbon-based filters.With a synthetic pleated filter, you'll likely be turning the clear housing with a wrench (designed for the housing) to remove it and the filter from the system.You might also have an opaque housing system that also unscrews from the top.


Have a bucket underneath to catch any spills. Dump the water from the housing down the sink or outside.

, Some filters (particularly carbon-based ones) have a plastic netting to help keep the paper part of the filter in place. To clean the filter, you need to remove that netting. Use a box cutter to slice around the edge of the netting at the top, just under the first ring. Do the same at the bottom. Also, cut through the paper underneath, going down to the carbon. However, while you want to cut the netting completely off, leave a small strip of the paper attached to make it easier to keep track of., The best way to begin cleaning any filter is to hose off the excess gunk first. With a pleated filter, you can set it in a sink or outside and use a strong spray of water to get as much of the junk off as you can.With the carbon filter, unroll the paper. Spray down both sides of the paper and the carbon underneath, making sure you don't lose any parts., For the pleated filter, shake out as much water as you can, and place it back in the housing. Pour in oxalic acid, and let it sit until clean, about 20 minutes or so.For the carbon-based filter, mix up a tablespoon of bleach in a gallon of water. Use a soft-bristled brush to scrub down the paper, then let the whole filter soak in the bleach solution for 5 to 10 minutes.To make the oxalic acid, mix 62.5 grams of powdered oxalic acid per gallon of water, which you can find online., Once the pleated filter is clean, take it out to rinse. You can either save the acid or neutralize it with a couple of tablespoons of baking soda before dumping it. Once you remove the acid from the housing, also rinse it with clean water. Use the housing to vigorously dunk the filter in clean water for a few minutes before dumping it again and rinsing it one more time., Before placing the pleated filter in the housing, you can add 1/2 an ounce of bleach to a small cup, and fill the rest with water. Pour it in the housing. This step helps clean some of the bacteria in the system.For the carbon filter, roll the paper back around the carbon as tightly as you can. Use zip ties to hold it in place. Place one each on the top and bottom (just under the plastic rings) and a couple in the middle., As you place the filter back, make sure it's centered. Screw the the housing back into the main part of the filtering system. If you have clear housing, burp the air bubble by turning on the water to the filter before turning the valve to the house. Let it fill up with water, then use the pressure button to release the air at the top. Then you can turn the other valve to release the water to the household.If you do use bleach, use the valve bypass to push the water directly into your pipes. Then you can run the bleach out by turning on a hot water faucet in your house, followed by a few minutes on the cold water side."

Choose a pitcher filter.,
Try a faucet carbon filter.,
Install a whole house filter.,
Try distillation.,
Purchase a reverse osmosis system.",How to Clean Tap Water1," A pitcher filter, or carafe filter, is a filter that you place over the top of a pitcher or large dispenser. The water is filtered into the pitcher or dispenser when you pour the water into the carafe. This system removes lead and chlorine, but doesn’t remove fluoride, bacteria, or pesticides. This system is stored in the refrigerator.You have to replace the filter every couple of months. The pitchers are cheap, and the filters are usually under $10.
You have to remember to replace the filters when needed, which can be inconvenient.;
, Carbon filters fit over the faucet and filter water through when you turn it on. Some filters connect to the water line under the sink. Water runs through a carbon bed filter. They are relatively cheap, so it won’t break your budget. They remove a variety of contaminants, including some pesticides, radon, chlorine, some bacteria, and heavy metals like lead. Additionally, carbon filters leave the minerals in the water that are good for you.Read the package carefully to determine what the filter doesn’t remove. It varies by model. Most carbon filters will not remove fluoride.
These systems can be more expensive at first, but you only have to replace the filters once or twice each year.

, Whole house carbon filters are installed directly into your home’s water supply line. This filters all the water that enters into the house, including water in the bathroom. This system will remove chlorine and many industrial chemicals, but not bacteria and nitrates.These systems are relatively cheap, and need their filters changed periodically. The schedule of filter changes depends on the model.

, Distillation is a process where water is boiled and the vapor collected for drinking. This process removes bacteria, heavy metals like copper and mercury, and harmful elements like arsenic. However, it won’t remove chlorine or chlorine byproducts unless paired with a carbon filter.Distillation takes out all the beneficial minerals.
You can buy a home distillation system that can remove almost all contaminants.

, Reverse osmosis is a process where a large tank is attached to the water pipe under your sink. The water is pushed through filters that remove contaminants. Reverse osmosis wastes water during the purification process. Some models waste more water than others, from three to 20 times more water than it filters to use, so check the model before purchasing.This process eliminates bacteria, nitrates, asbestos, and heavy metals. This process leaves in chlorine, but removes all beneficial minerals like fluoride. Check the label to see exactly what the model removes.
These systems are expensive, ranging from $500 to $1000, though the overall filtering cost may be cheaper in the long run than other systems. You should replace the filter once each year.

Back flush your filter.,
Brush the filter.,
Use chlorinated tap water.,
Dry it for storage.",How to Clean a Water Filter2," Start by reversing the flow of the filter to flush away any gunk that has collected. How you do it depends on the type of filter, but generally, you use a syringe or hose that comes with your water filter to reverse the flow by pressing water through it backwards.If you're using your filter often, all you need to do is reverse the flow. If your filter has been dry for a while, you need to moisten it by letting water go through it in the normal direction before reversing it.

, Some filters can be brushed to remove the gunk instead of reversing the flow. However, your filter must be designed for brushing, so always check the manual first. To brush it, simply use a soft-bristled brush to gently remove any gunk and build up on the filter., Tap water that has chlorine (as many cities add chlorine to the water) can help clear out bacteria in the filter. Run a gallon or so of water through the filter the normal way to help clear off the bacteria.If your tap water isn't chlorinated, add 8 drops of clear liquid bleach (unscented) to a gallon (about 2 liters) of water. Stir it up, and then let it sit for half an hour before using.If you want to be sure your filter is disinfected, you can make the bleach solution a little stronger, with about a capful of bleach in a quart (about a liter) of water.

, If you're planning on storing your water filter, you need to dry it thoroughly. You can let it air dry in a warm, ventilated area. Just don't put it directly in sunlight."

Turn off the water.,
Let the pressure off with the bleeder valve.,
Remove the filter.,
Wash the filter.,
Turn the water on a bit and then reinstall the filter.,
Turn the water back on.",How to Clean a Water Filter3," Find the control panel that runs to the filter, and turn the valve until you hear the water going off.Generally, it's under a green panel in your yard.

, On the filter itself, you'll find a valve that you can turn to release the pressure. As you turn it, be aware that it will blow air and water out of the filter, so be careful.If it doesn't have a valve, just unscrew it slowly.

, Unscrew the filter housing from the pipes. It may be tight, but you just need to apply a little pressure. A large wrench can help you get it unscrewed because it will help you grip the filter better. Pull the filter out of the housing., Most filters are either a disc type or a mesh type. If it's a disc type, you'll need to unscrew the ends so you have enough space to get in between the discs a bit. Using a hose or a bucket of water, get the filter wet. Use a stiff nylon brush to scrub down the filter, adding water as needed to clean off the gunk. You can scrub inside and out., Before putting the filter back in, turn the water back on so you push out anything that might be in the pipe. After a few seconds, turn it back off. Screw the filter back into its housing., Shut off the pressure valve. Turn the water back on slowly, letting it run into the valve and the whole system. If you turn it on too fast, the water will push the air in the system ahead of itself, which can cause problems."

Contact your local water source.,
Ask questions about your water quality.,
Contact the EPA.,
Test your water.",How to Clean Tap Water2," If you want to check on the status of your local water, contact the local water utility company or the local government authorities. Start by looking on your water bill for a number to contact the water company. You can also contact the city or town hall about reports on local water quality.You can also try calling the local health department.

, When you talk to someone from the local water authority, you need to know the right questions to ask. You can ask basic questions, like is there fluoride added to the water and when was the last time the EPA tested the water. You can also ask if they use any other disinfectants than chlorine.You can ask about the source of the water. Groundwater is generally cleaner due to the natural filtering from the soil. Surface water has a tendency to pick up more pollutants.
If they tell you that the EPA has tested the water, ask for the results. You can also ask for a copy of the test results since by law they have to provide you with information about water contaminants.

, If you cannot get any information from your local water authorities, you can try contacting the EPA. You can look up your local city’s “Consumer Confidence Report.”You may also contact the EPA safe drinking water hotline at 1-800-426-4791.You may also contact the EPA via their online form found here.You can also email the EPA at hotline-sdwa@epamail.epa.gov.

, If you have well water, or you are concerned about your community’s water, you can test it yourself. Only send your water to a state and EPA-certified laboratory. You can find approved labs by contacting the EPA hotline.The cost of testing the water ranges from $25 to $100, depending on the thoroughness of your test.

Boil the water.,
Purify your water with bleach.",How to Clean Tap Water3," One way you can make your your water cleaner is to run the water for a full minute first thing in the morning. This can get rid of some of the lead in the water that sat in the pipes all night., Water that is cold from water pipes may be safer to drink than when it is hot. Heavy metals like lead are absorbed more easily into hot water than cold water., If your water has a lot of chlorine in it, boiling it can help get rid of some of the chlorine as a gas. If your water tastes a lot like chlorine, boiling it can help improve the taste. If you are in a boil water advisory area, bring your water to a full roiling boil for at least one minute. This can help kill bacteria and parasites in the water., If you are in a boil water area and your water is cloudy or you have no power, you can use bleach to purify it. Add around 1/8 of a teaspoon of plain unscented bleach to a gallon of tap water. Mix the water and bleach thoroughly. Then leave the water for 30 minutes.Repeat if the water is cloudy.
Make sure the container you place the water in has been disinfected with purified water.

, Under-the-sink water filters use one of these methods to remove pollutants in your water.


Choose an activated carbon system if you want to use a replaceable cartridge. This type of system will capture chemicals, pesticides and other chemicals by using carbon in the filter.

, This system will remove larger particles from your water and flush them as waste. The water pressure will be higher, and excess water is stored in a tank under the sink.

, Many under-the-sink models include an attachment for the faucet which will allow you to get purified water for drinking, which uses the filter, and then regular tap water when you are cleaning or washing dishes.

, You can pay between $100 and $300 for an under-the-sink water filter.

, Major chains such as Lowe's and Home Improvement carry them, and you can also check with your local hardware store.

, Specific brands sell them on their websites, and you can also find them on sites such as eBay, Amazon, Overstock and other online retailers.

, Installation of your under-the-sink water filter can be timely. Some companies will install the filter for you.


Use a professional if you are planning to utilize a warranty. Many warranties will require you to have your filter professionally installed.

, Most under-the-sink filters are easily maintained. You will want to find out how often to change the filter and what to do if it breaks or malfunctions.

Learn about the POE and POU systems.,
Learn about the different types of POU systems available.,
Find out what’s contaminating your water.,
Evaluate your specific water filtration needs based on the contaminants in your water and the POE and POU systems.,
Pick a filter certified by an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) accredited certification body (examples: NSF or WQA Gold Seal) and is designed to reduce the contaminants found.,
Consider all the maintenance costs.,
Purchase the water filter.,
Install the filter according to the manufacturer’s instructions.,
Keep track of when your filter needs to be replaced.",How to Choose a Home Water Filter," These are the two types of water filters available for home use. POE systems treat all of the water that enters your home and connects to the water meter or pressurized storage tank.POU systems, however, treat water at the point where it is being consumed, such as a shower head or sink.


POU filters can be attached externally or can be installed inline.
POU filters that are installed inline filter all the water passing through a pipe.;
, These types of filters are very common and come in many different formats. POU filters include pitcher filters, personal water bottles with built-in filters, and refrigerator filters. They can be mounted to a faucet, under the sink, or the countertop.Smaller carafe-style pitcher filters are good for single people or couples since they only filter a small amount of drinking water at a time.
Some people do not like filters attached to their countertop or faucet; see which style of POU filter suits you best.

, This will help you decide if you need to target any specific contaminants when choosing a filtering system. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires water companies to provide a consumer confidence report (CCR) every year, which analyzes the water quality in your area.The information is available on your local government website or newspaper. If you want to test the water yourself, call the EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for the names of state-certified testing labs, which may offer low-cost or free test kits. You can also go to www.epa.gov/safewater/labs to find out more information.


Visible particles in your water can be rust or sediment, and houses that rely on wells often have bacteria in the water.
The contaminates your water has will depend on your home.You may discover you do not need a water filter at all because your water contains no contaminants.

, If you have a family that drinks several gallons of water a day, a single carafe-style filter would need to constantly be refilled, but a smaller family or couple’s water needs would be met by a simple filter.If the contaminates in your water are very toxic, you probably want a POE filter to clean all the coming into your house water.
On the other hand, if you are only filtering the water for taste, a POU filter on the faucet will suffice.
Research the different options. Consider talking to a Certified Water Treatment Professional.

, Now that you know the contaminants found in your water, which will vary, you can buy a filter based that will clean your water effectively. When picking a filter, you may use the WQA or NSF’s online database to see if the filters you are considering are certified: https://www.wqa.org/Find-Products#/ or http://info.nsf.org/Certified/dwtu/. Type this URL into your browser’s search bar.


These databases will ask for the manufacturer, brand, and other information to check the safety of the filter.
Enter all the required information once you navigate to the database.
Do not pick a filter that isn’t certified by an ANSI accredited Certification Body, and do not pick one that will not clean the contaminants found in your water.

, Filters need to be periodically replaced to function properly, and the cost of replacing a filter can range from $20 to $400.Whether you’re shopping online or in stores, manufacturer’s recommendations for when filters need to be changed should be readily available. Choose a filter you can afford to maintain.

, You may also want to purchase a warranty and extra filters.

, Many POE and POU systems will be easy to install, but you can also hire a professional to install the filter for you. Some POU filters require you to run some water through the filter before consuming the water. Read and follow all of the manufacturer’s instructions when installing the filter.

, If you use the filter and do not change it when it is supposed to be replaced, your water will not be clean anymore. Use a calendar or other reminder to keep track of when you need to change filters.

Empty your shed to check for damage to its structure and contents.,
Throw out anything you don’t need to make space.,
Gather up messy tools.",How to Organize a Messy Garden Shed1," Before you proceed with the organization of your shed, wait until a dry day and drag everything outside.


Check the shed's structure carefully for any signs of damage and water entry.






Examine the contents you took outside carefully for any signs of water damage, as this may indicate a leak you can’t see.






Check for any pest attack, such as moth damage to any fabric stored in the shed.






Make sure that all chemicals are sealed, the containers are undamaged, and the labels are still legible. Repair any structural damage to the shed and give it a sweep out before you put everything back inside.






If it begins raining while your shed's contents are outdoors, throw a tarpaulin over the contents.






Also, remember that chemicals should never be left in hot or direct sunlight, and mustn’t be allowed to leak into the ground or water.





;
, You should sort through the contents of your shed and throw out anything that is unnecessary or past its usefulness. If you aren’t sure how to declutter, follow these simple rules:


First, admit you aren’t going to get around to fixing any broken items.
Then get rid of anything broken!
Safely dispose of any chemicals that have passed their expiry dates.
Get rid of anything you haven’t used for 2 years.
If you are fortunate enough to have duplicates of useful items, celebrate your good luck by donating them to people less fortunate than you.

, Garden tools tend to come in all shapes and sizes, and so does the rest of the contents of many peoples’ sheds.

Bundle some Velcro wrap around collections of garden canes or longer hand tools such as hoes and spades. This will hold them together.






Use tall boxes to store long tools that you rarely use.

Determine what size you need.,
Research local regulations.,
Decide whether or not you'll be selling your home in the near future.",How to Choose a Water Softener1," If you are looking for a full-home solution, take the size of your family and property into account. For instance, if you have a family of three people or less, and have only one or two bathrooms in your home, a small to midsize water softener will be adequate. If you're a family of four or more people, and you have more than three bathrooms, you will need a mid to large sized softener., Contact your local municipal representative for information about water softening measures. Some municipalities do not allow the use of water softening systems because of their use of salt and resins. Before deciding on a water softener, find out what your restrictions are and consider alternatives if needed., Think about whether or not you intend to sell your home in the foreseeable future before choosing a water softener. If you have hard water, a whole-home water softening system can go a long way to making your house more attractive in the real estate market. Take into account the hassle and cost of replacing or repairing household parts and appliances damaged by hard water (e.g. pipes, water heater)."

Raise things off the floor to improve your storage space.,
Store sharp hand tools in a rigid container.,
Modify your shed's walls to create tool storage space.,
Take advantage of your shed's ceiling for storage.,
Use jars and cans to store miscellaneous items.",How to Organize a Messy Garden Shed2," If you have a messy shed, it’s probably because you have limited storage options within the shed. Consider the following solutions to improve your storage and raise things off the floor of your shed:

Install shelves.






Install pegboard.






Install tool hooks or velcro tidy straps.






A cheap shoe tidy hung on the back of the shed door adds valuable storage for smaller items.






Consider hanging items from the ceiling. For example, overhead storage racks, hooks, bike pulleys or lifts, or even jelly jars attached by their lids to the ceiling offer increased storage.






Consider a fold-down workbench or get one with integrated storage cupboards underneath.







, Consider using old ammunition boxes or stout wooden crates to store your sharp hand tools.


You can also store them upright in a rigid plastic bin, such as an old dustbin. This will prevent any contact with the blade.
It’s best if you don’t jumble bladed tools together to avoid blunting the edges.

, There are a variety of ways, beyond shelves, to utilize the walls of your shed for storage. Consider these solutions:


You can nail lengths of Velcro wrap to the shed wall and use these to attach your tools directly to the wall.
Drive some hooks into the shed wall at a height just slightly above your knee. Take some bungee cords or ratchet straps with hooks on the end, hook them to the wall with fairly strong tension, and make elasticated wall storage that will hold your tools flat against the walls.
Peg board is a terrific way to store items on walls. Get some hooks to hang your tools from the pegboard, and you can hang boxes from them for smaller items like screws.

, Don’t neglect to hang things from the roof. Here are some ideas for roof storage:

Bikes can go on a bike rack or pulley system on the ceiling.






Ladders can also rest in a simple frame holder you can hang from the ceiling.






Also, consider hanging a length of rigid plastic pipe such as a water pipe length from the ceiling. You can slot long narrow items such as garden canes or lengths of dowling rod into this.







, Sheds are usually filled with all sorts of useful smaller objects that defy categorization, such as the fitting for a hose pipe, different sizes of screws, and tulip bulbs.


One way to store smaller items is to glue the external lid of a jelly jar to the internal roof of your shed. Just reach up and unscrew the jar lid to access the contents.
Avoid nailing through the roof as this will ruin the water seal. You can also nail or screw jars to the underside of shelves.
Clear jars help you see what’s inside.
Glue old cans or short sections of water pipe to the walls to make easy storage for small items like gardening gloves.






Cut the spout and the top few inches off an old plastic milk jug. These make good storage for smaller items and have a carry handle.

Understand the dangers of storing your chemicals in your shed.,
Store your chemicals properly to stay safe.",How to Organize a Messy Garden Shed3," Perhaps you are storing chemicals in your shed such as weed killer, pesticides, or white spirits.


You might also be storing petrol, diesel, oil or paints: all of these things are toxic.
Some of these items are flammable; others like petrol can give off very noxious fumes, especially in a confined space like a shed.
It’s very important that none of these chemicals are allowed to contaminate the water supply or the ground.

, If you have any of the aforementioned chemicals in your shed, you can take some steps to ensure that they are stored properly. Here’s some basic advice for storage of chemicals in your shed:


Always keep chemicals in the original container.
Store substances such as petrol in containers intended for that purpose. Petrol is corrosive and can wear away at containers not designed for storing petrol, leaking into water and ground and causing a hazard.
Store chemicals out of reach of pets and children, in a cool dry place out of sunlight.
Only buy as much as you need for the year.
Chemicals in powder form should be stored away from, or above, liquids to stop drips and leaks that can cause chemical reactions.
Avoid keeping chemicals past their expiry date.
Dispose of chemicals safely and never down drains or into water.

Compare prices.,
Ask about installation fees.,
Research credible companies.,
Look into renting a water softener.",How to Choose a Water Softener2," Call local companies to get quotes for water softening systems for your home. Make sure to inquire if the quotes prices include taxes or surcharges. Note that whole-house systems generally cost a minimum of $1,000 and upwards. , Professional installation, at an additional cost, is required for water softening systems. If systems are not installed by qualified installers, their warranties may be voided. Be sure to inquire about installation fees, which can add to the total price of a system considerably., When looking for a water softening system, resist any companies that employ a high pressure sales approach. Be sure that the company is reputable, has good reviews (online or from other people in your neighborhood), and uses installers that are certified by the Water Quality Association. In addition, make sure that the company offers a money-back guarantee on their systems., If buying a water softener is too big of a decision for you, contact companies to inquire about the possibility of renting one of their systems. Renting may be a more cost effective solution, at least temporarily, and it will allow you to test a system to see if it is right for you. It will also give you the benefit of soft water and less damage to your appliances, home, and hair and skin."

Buy a salt-free water conditioner.,
Buy a water softening shower head.,
Treat small amounts of water with aluminum sulfate.",How to Choose a Water Softener3," If your municipality does not allow the use of water softening systems, or if you are simply considering other options, buy a salt-free water conditioner, often mistakenly referred to as a water softener. These scale-control devices can reduce scaling in pipes but they are not proven to remove calcium. Salt-free conditioners require much less maintenance than regular water softeners, cost less to run, and often yield a better return on investment., To soften water in your shower directly, buy a water softening shower head online or in hardware stores. These shower heads use replaceable filters to soften water as soon as you install them, and cost very little in comparison to larger water softeners. Read reviews online and be sure to choose a model that comes with a warranty., Aluminum sulfate can cause the minerals in hard water to clump and settle. To prepare soft water to wash with, add one tablespoon (0.5 oz.) of aluminum sulfate to a small bucket of water. Once the minerals have settled to the bottom, skim water off of the top with a small cup or bowl. Use it to wash your face, take a sponge bath, or rinse your hair."

Bring less hardy plants inside.,
Clear away fallen leaves and compost them.,
Tidy up your perennials.,
Remove all dead leaves and produce from the remaining plants.,
Pay attention to your climate.",How to Prepare Your Garden for Winter1," Some of your plants won’t have died yet, but they won’t be strong enough to withstand the winter weather. You’ll want to research the specific plants you have in your garden and find out which ones can be easily moved inside for the winter. You could move them to a greenhouse, your garage, or even inside.If you do this, you’ll need to carefully dig them up and replant them into an appropriate pot.
Most pepper plants can be brought inside and will still grow for a while into winter. Make sure you clean off the plants so no bugs travel inside.
Some other plants that can be brought inside are Aloe, Citrus, Geraniums, Impatiens, and Rosemary.;
, If you have trees anywhere near your garden, you most likely have some leaves that have accumulated. You’ll want to gather these up and save them for composting. A good leaf blower and mulcher saves a lot of time here.


You can begin a temporary compost pile off to the side of your garden as you prepare in the weeks leading up to winter, or you can store compost matter in a trash can or bin until you are ready to use it.

, Perennials are plants that grow for more than two seasons, but they are not active during the winter. They go into a period of dormancy. You can help them grow fresh again in the spring by cutting them down to the level of the soil. The root of the plant will remain and bloom again in spring.You can leave any seeds that are present for birds to eat during the winter.
Common perennials include Lilies, Black-Eyed Susans, Lavender, Ferns, and Primrose.

, Go through your garden section by section, plant by plant, and pull off any leaves that are brown and any fruits or vegetables which are rotten. You can put all of this into a bin to add as compost later on. Dead plant matter can harbor disease or insects that will later kill your plants. Removing all of this from the garden protects it for new growth in the spring. If you notice obvious diseased or infested plant matter, burn this separately and don’t include in your compost.
Some people may feel that it’s easier to leave the old plants to die in the winter, but this can end up causing your garden to be worse off. The effort it takes to clear out the old plants will pay off by preserving your garden’s health.

, The exact work your garden needs, and the state it will be in come spring, will be greatly determined by what your winter is like. If you get heavy snow, you may considered building a cover to keep all that snow off your garden. If you have pretty mild winters, you may not need to do all that much for the garden.


For this and many other garden issues, talking to people around you who garden can be really helpful. If you can find anyone in your area who has been gardening for years, they will know how local winter weather affects gardens.

Leave some vegetables for a winter harvest.,
Plant some vegetables for a winter or early spring harvest.,
Plant bulbs that will bloom in the spring.,
Plant some cover crops.",How to Prepare Your Garden for Winter2," Carrots, garlic, horseradish, leeks, parsnips, radishes, and turnips can be left in the ground into the winter months for late harvesting. You’ll want to mark the spots with a tall stake so you can see it above the snow.These hardy plants can help a little bit as you use up other vegetables that stop growing during the fall.

, As long as you get them into the ground before the first frost, Spinach, Garlic, Rhubarb, and Shallots can be planted late in the fall. Spinach will most likely be ready by late winter, and the rest should be ready when spring hits.This is a good way to have fresh produce for a little bit more time throughout the year.

, Many plants start out as bulbs and when you plant them in the fall, they take root and will bloom early on in the spring. These are good for keeping plants in the soil rather than taking everything out for winter.


Tulip, Daffodil, Crocus, Snowdrop, Bluebell and Iris bulbs are good to plant for an early to late spring bloom.
A helpful tip is to lay some evergreen boughs over spots where you plant bulbs. This will help keep the soil from cracking and moving the bulbs around. Some methods for tulip planting might be useful to apply to other bulb types.

, Cover crops are able to sustain winter weather, can protect your garden from erosion, and add organic matter to your soil. Cereal rye and buckwheat are common cover crops. Generally, you sow these seeds a month before an expected frost. Later you mow them down before they fully seed and blossom.These types of plants help keep the microbes of the soil active while other plants are in dormancy.
These crops are usually tilled over in the spring to mix back into the soil as more compost.

"
"
Test soil and add amendments that will work into the soil before spring.,
Lay down a generous amount of compost.,
Cover the garden with mulch.",How to Prepare Your Garden for Winter3," Once most of your plants are harvested and done growing, it’s good to improve your soil for the next season. Take a soil sample to a garden store or agriculture extension office and have them test it.A soil test can tell you the pH of your soil and relative levels of potassium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur, which are important for healthy growth. A test can also tell you how much organic matter is present and about the lead content.
You can search online or a local business directory to find garden stores near you, and you can call to see what soil testing options they have. At the very least, you can buy pretty simple home testing kits which should give you the basic information you need.
Many county extension offices have departments that you can contact to find out if they are able to test soil.
pH adjusting treatments like lime take a few months to work into the soil, so applying them in the winter helps ensure the soil will be adjusted by spring for planting.

, Shredded leaves and plant matter leftover in your garden are great for putting nutrients back into the soil during winter. Throughout the fall, gather brown and green plant matter into a compost pile or bin and cover your whole garden with it after you have cleaned up all of the plants.


As this stuff decomposes during winter, it keeps some of the moisture in the soil during the dry times of winter. Even though not much is growing, composting during the winter will keep the soil healthier.
If you have enough compost matter, 1-2 inches is a good thickness for a layer of compost. If you don’t have much compost to work with, you can lay it only on the rows where you actually plant crops, leaving walking rows and the edges of the garden without compost.

, Much like compost, mulch helps protect the soil from erosion, temperature changes, and animals. While the compost will nourish the soil during the dormant period, mulch is sort of a way to cover the compost and keep it protected.Common mulch options include peat moss, bark, sawdust, and shredded newspapers.
While you probably can’t avoid the ground freezing if you live somewhere with consistently low winter temperatures, the compost and mulch layers help keep the ground temperature regulated against multiple freezes and thaws.
Mulch and compost serve similar purposes, so if your options are limited, you can go with just mulch. Otherwise, you can lay the mulch down on top of the compost. These can also help attract earthworms, which work to improve your soil.

Divide dormant perennials.,
Prune trees and shrubs.,
Remove weeds and prickles from grass.,
Tidy up camellia plants.",How to Tidy a Temperate Winter Garden," Wintertime brings dormancy for perennials and provides a perfect opportunity to divide them. Division will benefit your garden from production of new plants and the flowers that will be produced in spring and summer will be healthier and more prolific.


Dig up the entire clump of the perennial plant. Use a sharp spade to do this.
Ease the plants apart gently using your hands. Deep-rooted perennials will probably require the use of two forks to separate them.
Remove dead foliage and withered parts by cutting with garden shears or clean scissors.






Replant the healthiest and most robust of the newly divided plants. Plant with the crown at soil level (avoid planting too deeply).;
, There are many trees and shrubs that will benefit from being pruned during winter. The prunings can be replanted to create new plants too.


Replant hardwood cuttings (hardened stem that turns woody when the weather cools).
Select hardwood cutting pieces that are about as thick as a pencil. Cut into pieces 15–20 centimeter (7.9 in) long, ending the cut just below a bud.
Strike in pots or in the garden. When you have a few cuttings, they can be placed into pots for growth. For a large amount of cuttings, dig a trench in the garden to about 15 centimeter (5.9 in) in depth and place coarse sand in the base to 2.5 centimeter (1.0 in) depth.
Dip each cutting into hormone powder and insert into the potting soil or sand, inserting two-thirds of the cutting into the soil.

, Either hand pick or use specific chemical treatments to attack the dormant weeds during winter for a better appearing lawn during the summer period. Always prefer non-toxic, people and environmentally-friendly treatments over harsh chemical treatments.

, Camellias flower during winter and can flower prolifically under the right conditions. While beautiful to behold, if there are too many buds on the branches, the flowers won't open properly because of crowding. Take the opportunity to give your camellia flowers a better chance by removing the majority of buds per cluster, and leaving 1–4 only. Disbudding will ensure that the final display is brilliant.

Purchase a calendar or weekly planner.,
Begin listing all of your gardening chores on scratch paper.,
Fill in the calendar with your gardening chores.,
Make adjustments to the calendar as necessary.,
Save all gardening calendars for future reference.",How to Organize Gardening Chores," This item will be used to record all of your gardening chores ahead of time. Whether you opt for a wall calendar or a weekly planner depends on your preferences. A weekly planner is portable and will give you more space to be specific about chores, while a wall calendar can be hung in a highly visible location and may keep you from forgetting to consult it.;
, Before attempting to fill in the calendar directly, make a list of all your chores. Your list should span an entire year, because it will need to include both regular tasks like weeding and watering as well as seasonal tasks like buying seeds, harvesting, and overwintering your plants.


Begin by filling in the important seasonal tasks and marking approximate dates for them. These gardening tasks might include buying seeds, starting the seeds, sowing them, harvest dates, and rotating areas of your vegetable beds.
If you already maintain a diagram to help you plan your plant rotation schedule, make sure to coordinate the gardening calendar with the diagram. Consider cross-referencing it directly to clarify your calendar entries.
Finish your list by filling in regular tasks such as weeding, watering, fertilizing, and turning your compost pile. These tasks should be listed next to their required frequency, such as ""weekly"" or ""biweekly.""

, After revising and double-checking the list, begin filling in tasks on their specific date. Mark the date of the last frost on your calendar and use it to choose appropriate dates for tasks. Mark down all regular tasks like watering on specific dates too, while keeping in mind that adjustments may need to be made due to changing weather.


Any tasks with longer lead times should be planned ahead accordingly. For example, if you will be buying seeds from a catalog, allow enough time for them to be delivered. If you are starting seeds indoors, plan them ahead so that they can be transplanted outdoors just after the last frost.
Consider using different colored pens for different types of tasks. For example, you might use red ink for major tasks like sowing seeds and blue ink for regular tasks like weeding.

, Your gardening calendar will likely not be perfect the first year. Tasks might be spaced inappropriately, or major tasks might have been forgotten altogether. As you follow the calendar's schedule through the first year, make note of how it could be improved for future use.

, A major benefit to using a gardening calendar is the reference they provide you with in future seasons. For example, if a crop of radishes did very well one year, you can consult with your calendar to see the exact dates they were planted and harvested. These dates can even be cross-referenced with an online almanac that can give the temperatures on those days.

Give your nursery a thorough cleaning before winter.,
Make room to clean.,
Clean from top to bottom.,
Scrub your nursery down.,
Choose your disinfectant.,
Disinfect everything.,
Try to keep your nursery clean throughout the year.",How to Keep Your Plant Nursery Clean1," Keeping the nursery or greenhouse clean works well as a defense against plant diseases and insect infestations. Begin with a thorough cleaning of the entire nursery in the fall. The growing season is over at that time, the weather is beginning to cool and insects are looking for a warm home for the winter.


Disease organisms also survive the winter in greenhouses, only to attack with a vengeance when the temperatures warm back up.;
, Remove the plants from the nursery, if possible, or move them all to one side and clean one side of the nursery at a time.

, Sweep all of the dirt and debris off the walls and on to the floor. This can be done with a broom and dustpan but a good shop vac will make the job much easier and will do a more thorough job of picking up small particles. Work from the top down, getting cob webs and dirt off the walls before cleaning up the floor.


Pay special attention to getting dirt out of the corners and along the edges of the floor. Any dirt left on the walls or floor will reduce the effectiveness of cleaning solutions and disinfectants.

, Scrub the walls, floor and all surface areas with a cleanser designed for greenhouses, such as Strip-It. These cleansers remove dirt and algae which can make surfaces slippery and attract fungus gnats and shore flies. Rinse everything thoroughly using a hose with a spray nozzle attachment or, if possible, use a power washer to rinse the cleanser off the walls, floor and other surfaces.

, Common household bleach is an effective disinfectant. This substance should be mixed with water in a 9:1 ratio in order to thoroughly disinfect your nursery. However, all materials that need to be sterilized should be cleaned before they are placed in the solution because dirt destroys the working potential of the bleach mixture (see the previous step). Bleach should only be used in areas that are well-ventilated because heavy concentrations of the substance can cause illness or even death.


A solution of 1 part hydrogen peroxide to 100 parts water can also be used for sterilization purposes; this is a less toxic alternative to the bleach mixture.
Imported water can be treated with chlorine at a rate of 1 ppm to render it usable for disinfecting your nursery. This treatment reduces the risk of damping off (a disease that can kill seeds before they germinate) and also keeps other harmful water borne substances from infecting nursery stock.

, Disinfect all of the surfaces in the nursery with a disinfectant designed for greenhouse use. The disinfectant should be sprayed on the surfaces and left for at least an hour , but this amount of time varies depending on the disinfectant that you use.


Reusable containers, work surfaces, and tools should be properly sterilized before and after use. This will help prevent the transmission of harmful elements from plant to plant. Waterproof equipment should likewise be soaked for a full day in disinfectant solutions so that the chemicals have plenty of time to work.

, Keeping the greenhouse clean throughout the year will help reduce diseases and insect infestation. It will also make the annual fall clean up that much easier. Leave a broom and dustpan or shop vac in the greenhouse and clean up small messes from repotting or pruning as soon as they occur.


Never leave debris around the plants or on the floor. A good, thorough weekly clean-up of all surfaces and floors should keep your nursery looking neat and tidy.
Do not use more water or fertilizer than is absolutely necessary. Surfaces that are constantly wet provide an excellent breeding area for algae and bacteria.

Build a Shed.,
Store all of your small gardening equipment in a basket.,
Lean all big equipment against a wall.,
Put fertiliser/compost in the shed's corner.,
Store seeds on the shed's shelf.",How to Tidy Your Garden1," This shed will be your garden's storage unit, where you will keep all of your tools, seeds, and other gardening essentials. Fit in a shelf if you can, as this will provide extra storage for smaller items such as shovels or pots.;
, Buy a wicker basket to place in your shed; you can get these relatively cheap from most home-shops. Store all of your small tools in this basket, as this will make it easier to find them when needed.

, You can either do this with the force of balance, or install a rack to be attached to your wall. Both ways work the same. 'Big equipment' includes rakes, string trimmer, etc.

, Any big sacks of gardening essentials should be stored in the corner closest to the entry, so you can easily access them when gardening during lighter months.

, Place any loose packets of seeds or other miscellaneous items on this shelf, as you will be able to keep all of this clutter preserved inside of the shed. Think of the shed as your garden's junk drawer.

Apply herbicides in crop-free areas around the nursery to kill off weeds.,
Move the weeds off-site once they have been killed.,
Consider adding windbreak trees to your property.,
Pick your weeds by hand it you grow your crops in containers.",How to Keep Your Plant Nursery Clean2," Using both pre and post emergent herbicides in crop-free areas near the nursery helps keep these establishments free of weeds. Lawns should also be kept mowed and sprayed periodically with turf maintenance herbicides to keep the weeds out.


Read the directions on any product you plan to use to be sure that you are applying it correctly.

, Once the weeds have been killed, they should be moved offsite so that any mature seeds which weren’t destroyed don’t get loose on the property and begin to grow.

, Windbreaks made from large trees are quite effective at keeping weed seeds out of nurseries. However, the trees can also play host to pests and should be sprayed periodically with herbicides themselves.


Nursery owners need to be careful not to use trees that readily reseed themselves or the windbreak could make existing weed problems worse instead of better.

, In nurseries where crops are grown in containers, post-emergent herbicides should be avoided. Weeds in these areas should be carefully removed by hand instead to avoid any damage being done to your plants.

Cover your nursery floors in concrete or gravel.,
Treat wooden structures for termites.,
Treat any substrates in your nursery.,
Avoid using water that may be contaminated with harmful substances.,
Try to avoid watering your plants from overhead.",How to Keep Your Plant Nursery Clean3," Greenhouse floors should be made of concrete or gravel because many different pathogens can live in dirt for a very long time.

, In nurseries where trees are grown, all wooden parts of the building should be treated to prevent termites. This can be done using chemicals or old engine oil. Keeping the termites out will eliminate the possibility of them infecting nursery-grown plants.


You should also make sure that propagation structures used aren’t made of wood.

, Substrates should be treated using a pasteurization process that involves either steam or sunlight. This keeps any harmful materials from making their way into the nursery from outside sources.


Systematic applications of fungicide and herbicides can also be used to keep harmful elements out.

, Nursery owners should avoid using water from nearby lakes, ponds, and streams unless it has been treated because it may otherwise harbor harmful substances.

, Overhead watering systems encourage the spread of waterborne diseases, such as Phytophthora, and make plants susceptible to other moisture-related ailments like powdery mildew. Therefore, watering your plants from up above should be avoided.

Add landscaping near deciduous trees.,
Decide if you need to collect the leaves.,
Rake pine needles first.,
Decide if you want to rake wet or dry leaves.,
Pick up sticks.",How to Deal with Autumn Leaves1," Make beds with plants that like natural mulch near the trees in your yard that shed leaves. When there are leaves on the ground, run them over once with a mower. Then rake them right into the beds.For your bed, consider shrubs, garlic, roses, and tender perennials.;
, Several inches of leaf layer is natural and even an ecosystem. Wildlife like salamanders, turtles, chipmunks, and other species survive on such mini habitats.Leaf litter also provides an overwintering shelter for beneficial insects and earthworms. However, if thick piles of leaves are smothering your lawn, you may want to break them down, if not collect them.Consider collecting the leaves if they cover over a third of your yard and you can’t see the top of the grass blades.You may need to collect the leaves if you have a Home Owners Association that has specific requirements about autumn cleanup.
If you decide to collect them, don’t try to do a whole season of leaf pickup in a single day. Plan leaf cleanup for several days in the autumn season., You may want to separate pine shedding from deciduous leaves. Pine needles are acidic, and there are certain plants that like acidic soil – and others that don’t. Therefore it’s beneficial to separate the pine needles to use as their own separate mulch.Rake the needles as soon as you notice them on the ground, since they usually fall before leaves do.
Pack the pine needles in garbage bags and store them in a dry place. Use them when you need acidic mulch.

, Wet leaves will form a more stable pile, but they are also heavier to rake.Choose dry weather if you want to use a leaf vacuum, as wet leaves can clog the vacuum.Don’t rake wet leaves if you have allergies, as mold and mildew in wet leaves can upset your sinuses.

, You can choose to do this before or during leaf cleanup. Gather up the sticks in your yard and put them aside in a pile. Consider keeping the brush pile there as a shelter for birds, chipmunks and other wildlife. You can also set sticks aside for use as fire kindling.Use a wheelbarrow or yard waste bin if you want to move the stick pile somewhere else in your yard.

, Whenever you see any leaves blow into your garden, use your rake to gather them all to one area, and then either use your leaf-blower to blow them out of your garden, or continue raking them into a bin liner.

, This task will drastically improve your garden if done on a daily basis. Try making grass designs by turning your lawn mower around each time you do a different row. The grass gets cut differently on every row, therefore making a 'stripy lawn'.

, Slugs are your garden's enemy and can ruin it by nibbling on your growth. Be sure to use environmental-friendly ones, though, as some of the chemicals in ordinary pellets can damage your plants.

, Weeds give your garden a horrible, untidy look, so be sure to get rid of them as soon as you've found them, to avoid further growth.

Choose between vinegar and detergent.,
Create your cleaning solution.,
Wipe down your fence.,
Rinse your fence.,
Use a specialized solvent.,
Spray a bleach solution on your fence.,
Try high pressure water.,
Use different methods and repeat as necessary.,
Rinse down the area.,
Read the directions of chemical products.,
Avoid letting animals or small children play around the area.",How to Clean a Vinyl Fence," There are a wide variety of cleaning products you can use to help clean your vinyl fence. Two of the easiest to use, though, are vinegar and household dish detergent. Both are effective, cheap, and safe to use.


Vinegar is a great natural product that you may already have at home.
Mild dish detergents, like Dawn, will help cut through mildew, dirt, and more.;
, After you’ve decided which cleaning agent you want to use, you’ll need to mix it with water to create your cleaning solution.


If you choose vinegar, take 1 cup (240 ml) of vinegar and add it to 2 gallons (3.78 l) of water.
If you choose dish detergent, take several tablespoons of detergent (depending on the brand) and add it to 2 gallons (7.57) of water., Take a rag or other cloth and soak it in your solution. Use it to wipe down your fence. Make sure you wipe down your fence good and get as much dirt and grime off as possible.


Go back and forth or in a swirl-like fashion to make sure you properly clean every portion of the fence.
Make sure you have enough clean rags, so you can switch dirty ones out for clean ones as you need.
You may want to use a bristled brush to scrub extra dirty sections of the fence.
Consider using an extra bucket full of water to rinse your rag after you wipe down a section of the fence., Use a hose with a sprayer nozzle to rinse your fence. Start at the top and move horizontally across and allow the water to wash debris downward. Slowly move down the fence, continuing to move in a horizontal direction.


Without rinsing your fence, your cleaning solution and other dirt will set and your fence won’t appear clean.

, If you’ve cleaned your fence with vinegar or detergent and it still appears dirty, you may need to try a specialized cleaning solvent. Some solvents are formulated to help remove dirt and grime from vinyl fences.


Visit your local home improvement store and look for products specially formulated to clean vinyl siding and vinyl fences.
Specialized solvents may come in their own spray bottles or you may need to pour them into a garden sprayer or similar device., If you’ve used another method and still have trouble cleaning your vinyl fence, you may want to consider a bleach solution. Mix 1/3 cup (80 ml) of laundry detergent, 1 quart (.94 l) of bleach, and 1 gallon (3.78 l) of water. Pour the solution into a garden sprayer and spray down your fence.


Avoid using this mixture on non-white vinyl., If other methods have failed, you may want to consider using a pressure washer to clean your vinyl fence. High pressure water will help dislodge gunk, debris, or stains.


Rent or purchase a pressure cleaner at a local home improvement box store or hardware store.
Try using high pressure water without chemicals first.
If you need to use chemicals, the pressure cleaner may have a small tank where you can pour a chemical solution. The pressure cleaner will automatically mix the chemical with the water as you spray it., If you’ve tried one method to clean your vinyl and it still appears dirty, you may need to repeat or try another method of cleaning. Ultimately, vinyl fences exposed to the elements will collect a lot of dirt and may require substantial time to clean.


Don’t be afraid to try several methods.
You may need to use one method a couple of times to get the desired effect., Rinse the area until there is no chemical smell. In addition, spray the area until you don’t see any visible indications of chemicals, such as suds.


If you use a well or are in area with a shallow aquifer, you should avoid using petrochemical cleaners., Before using any chemical product, you need to read the directions carefully. This is important, as different products will require you to take different safety precautions.


Different products will require you to dilute them to a certain level.
Follow directions about specialized safety equipment. For example, if a product recommends you use safety goggles, you should do so., This is important, as animals or small children may unwittingly expose themselves to toxic cleaning agents.


Keep dogs or other animals in the house or in a part of your yard that is separated from the fence for several hours.
Don’t allow small children to play near the fence until the ground has dried."

Rake the leaves.,
Move the leaves with a tarp or bag.,
Mow your lawn and the leaves.,
Use a leaf blower and/or vacuum.,
Hire professionals.",How to Deal with Autumn Leaves2," Raking is ideal for small lawns and gardens.Use quality rakes, preferably with soft grips. Rakes 36” or wider require more force, so choose a rake that is of standard width (24”). You can opt for ergonomic rakes, which have specially curved handles.Don’t retrace your steps. Work from one side of the lawn to the other in a zigzag.With each line you rake, move the leaves into the area where there are leaves you haven’t raked yet. Every time you create a ridge of leaves, push it a few feet into the unraked area. Repeat this until your pile is two feet tall (0.6096 meters) or is getting hard to move.
You can purchase ergonomic handles separately and attach them to your rakes. Attach handles by screwing them into your rakes. By doing this with two rakes, you can rake leaves with both arms and without bending over., Use a sheet, a tarp, or a tablecloth to move large piles of leaves. Put the four corners of the tarp together and move the bundle by dragging it. You can use this method in addition to or instead of using leaf bags.Eight feet by eight feet (2.44 meters) is a good-sized tarp for this purpose.
You can purchase fun, seasonal leaf bags like large bags with jack-o-lantern faces to decorate your yard and move leaves out of the way at the same time!

, This is a good option for large lawns. Use a grass catcher on the mower to collect the chopped leaves.Raise your mower deck to the second-highest setting before mowing your lawn.If the leaves are wet, use the side-discharging mode of your mower for the first pass in order to loosen and lift the leaves. Then switch to either mulching or bagging mode and mow over the leaves again.

, Consider using a leaf blower, especially if you have a big yard with many trees.Leaf blowing is particularly useful if you have woods up against your property, as you can blow the leaves back onto the forest floor.You can use a vacuum attachment for your leaf blower or use a leaf vacuum by itself. Handheld leaf vacuums are handy for small yards or areas.If you’re purchasing a leaf blower or vacuum, look for one that has a shredding function. Consider the ratio of reduction; for example, if the product offers a 10:1 reduction ratio, it will convert ten bags of unchopped leaves into one bag.
Keep in mind that leaf blowers are loud. Also, the most effective ones are gas-powered, which use fossil fuels that contribute to air pollution., If you decide to hire a professional to do your leaf cleanup, you can expect to pay for each job, several times per season.If you don’t have the time to do the leaf cleanup, this may be the option for you. Alternatively, you can rent a wheeled leaf blower like the pros use for about $50 a day.Most homeowners pay between $174 and $491, but it will depend on the size of your lawn. You can expect to pay anywhere between $75 and $900.Try contacting a professional and have your yard measurements ready as well as how many trees are in your yard. Ask if they can give you quote for leaf cleanup.

Mulch them into the lawn.,
Make mulch for gardens or flower beds.,
Compost them.,
Dig them in with a tiller.,
Ask your locality.,
Offer them to a neighbor.,
Burn the leaves.,
Make crafts.",How to Deal with Autumn Leaves3," Optionally, you can aerate your lawn first to provide nutrients deeper into the soil.Mulch the leaves into small pieces with your mower, about dime-sized. You may have to mow over them a few times if the leaves are large or the layer is deep.When you cleanup a yard like this, you will leave the small pieces on the lawn to work their way into the soil. Leaf mulch suppresses weeds and fertilizes the ground. Mulched leaves will enrich your soil in the spring.You should be able to see about half of the grass through the chopped leaves if you want them to decompose quickly.

, One you have collected the leaves, you can shred them for use in compost or mulch. Put the leaves into a large trash can. Then break them down with a weed whacker.You could use a leaf shredder instead.Leaves make great natural mulch. They don’t transfer black spores onto houses and buildings the way wood mulch does, which can damage siding and harm plants., Turn your leaves into “black gold!” Compost is excellent natural fertilizer for your lawn and garden. You may want to break the leaves down into mulch before putting them into the compost pile if you want them to decompose faster. You can use the decomposed leaves to fertilize your garden in the spring.You can leave your leaf pile to weather and add it to your compost pile in the springtime., Shred the leaves first. Then you can till the chopped leaves into the soil with a tiller. This will provide organic matter and nutrients to feed your lawn in the spring., Contact your local township, city or county and ask about an autumn cleanup policy. If they don’t have one, find out how to dispose of leaves and other backyard waste. Some county and city officials have specific regulations for you to follow when you cleanup a yard.Try asking, “Do you have a community recycling program for autumn leaves? Is there a municipal composting system with curbside pickup?” If there is no municipal program in place for autumn cleanup, ask how to dispose of general yard waste.
In some towns you simply bag your leaves and put the bags at the curb so a designated party can pick them up on a specific day of the week. Other areas rake leaves into the street gutter and leaf collectors drive down each side of the road to collect them.

, Your trees should seem healthy with no known fungal or other diseases. Bag your leaves and offer them to neighbors who may want mulch or compost. This can be especially helpful for neighbors with gardens or flower beds., You may choose to burn the leaves if you live in an area that permits this. You may need a fire permit to dispose of leaves in this way. Some states and towns require a member of the fire department to be present for the duration of the fire, while others require you to notify the fire department in advance.


Check with your locality by contacting them or searching their website for keywords like “burning” and “fire.”

, You can use fall leaves as fun craft projects. There are various ways you can preserve leaves. You can then use them to make bookmarks, coasters, wall art, candle holders, and many other crafts for kids or adults."

Shy away from rugs and curtains.",How to Decorate a Studio Apartment," The main room of a studio functions as three spaces in one: a bedroom, living room, and kitchen. You can create the feeling of three separate rooms by using the furniture to section off areas.

Couches, armchairs, or loveseats can box off a ""living room"" area. Your bed can similarly separate your sleeping area.
Rugs, coffee tables, or shelves can anchor your apartment furniture and make your apartment sub-rooms feel more organized.;
, Your bed should be placed either parallel or perpendicular to a wall. If you place your bed in the center of the room, your studio will feel cramped and cluttered. Consider investing in a day bed or pull-out bed if you are short on space.

For additional space, choose a low-rise bed without a frame. This will prevent your bed from obstructing windows or blocking up extra space., Incorporating dividers can help you separate your studio apartment into separate areas. When guests are over, you can divide off your sleeping area for a sense of privacy. Folding screen or ceiling-mounted drapes can take up minimal space in your studio when they're not being used.

Try to section off the room into aesthetically-pleasing ratios. Room sections look most pleasing to the eye if they are divided up into 1/3 or 2/3 proportions., To get the most out of your shelves, choose ones that are tall and thin. You will be able to utilize more space for your belongings without choosing a massive storage system. A large bookshelf or wardrobe can serve as a great separator between your sleeping area and living area.Placing high shelves above doorways or windows can also draw the eye upward (again giving the impression of a larger space) and give you more space in your studio.

, The furniture you choose can help with the illusion of space. Couches or chairs with visible legs (as opposed to legs draped over with cloth) create a feeling of light and airiness. The space between the floor and your furniture will help with an open floor plan., Avoid setting your furniture in the middle of the room, where it can block your space from one end to the other. Pushing most of your furniture to the edges will maximize open space and avoid a claustrophobic atmosphere. Assess this by walking from one end of the studio to the other. If you can do so without much hassle, you have a clear pathway., When arranging furniture in studio apartments, pick quality over quantity: too many chairs or sofas in a small space can leave you feeling trapped. When making the choice between two small couches or one large one, always opt for the latter., Choosing to live in a studio apartment means doing without unnecessary items. Go through your belongings and only keep your must-haves. Get rid of worn-out clothes, books you no longer read, and furniture that only gets in the way.Donate your old belongings to a charity to put them towards a good use. Contact your local thrift store, Salvation Army, or Goodwill.
If you struggle with de-cluttering, hire a professional organizer to help., Every inch of floor in your apartment needs to be used effectively. Investing in some sturdy, dual-purpose furniture can help you make the most of your studio apartment. Consider buying a trundle bed that folds into a sofa or coffee tables that double as benches.Buy furniture from companies that specialize in minimalist decor or micro-living. They will likely have dual-purpose furniture options fitting for studio apartments.

, Once you have set up a basic layout for your furniture and belongings, look for areas in the apartment that are not being used. Look for large patches of blank walls or empty corners. Brainstorm ways you could repurpose those empty areas in a way that best serves your needs.

For example, if the right hand corner of your studio is empty, you could place a beanbag there. You can then repurpose into a reading or relaxing area.
Don't go overboard and cram every area of your apartment with stuff. Some empty space is good and contributes to the balance of an apartment. Just make sure that each area has a purpose.

, A well-placed mirror can make your apartment feel twice as big as it is. Placing mirrors across from a window reflects natural light and makes the room feel more spacious. You could also place a mirror across from a large end table or shelf to make it look like an entire space is tucked into the mirror., If you can paint the walls, stick with neutral colors like beige or light pastels: neutrals have an expanding effect and can make an apartment look larger than it is. They also create a sense of warmth and balance., Too many colors will become over-stimulating in small spaces. You will have to be creative when giving diversity to your decorations. Having a singular color theme and mixing up different textures is the ideal way to add vibrancy. You could buy furniture with intricate carvings and decorate them with plush, fluffy pillows., Avoid large, glaring items when decorating your studio apartment. According to the ""cantaloupe rule,"" any accents larger than a cantaloupe crowd small rooms. Pick a few choice items that are larger, but aim for most decorations to be compact.For example, instead of a large lamp that takes up a lot of space, you could opt for a small desk lamp. This will give you enough light to read or work when dark without using much space.

, For studio apartments, shy away from landscapes or classical paintings. Instead, pick bold designs with lots of action. Modern art, especially pop art, is an excellent choice for studio apartments.

Again, shy away from pieces with too much variance in color.
The cantaloupe rule does not necessarily apply to artwork. Instead of two or three smaller art pieces, choose one bold canvas that makes a statement. With art in small spaces, too much hanging on the walls can become overwhelming.

, Although rugs can make a good accent in living rooms, keep them out of studio apartments. Rugs are blocky and leave less room for furniture, making the room more cramped. Same with curtains: by eliminating natural light, curtains make studios stuffier.

If you need privacy, use shutters or cloth blinds instead.

Themes don't have to be different for every room, but the more different themes you use, the more items will become viable potential purchases. On the flip side, you don't need to choose clashing themes just to maximize your chances. Themes should always reflect your tastes first.
Although there are plenty of contemporary items available at thrift shops, you might have better luck going for a more vintage or retro theme. Try mid-century modern, with its soft geometric designs and warm color palette, for a timeless look; consider a maritime theme with dark woods, brass and glass accents, and maps or paintings of tall-masted ships for a study or den. Other easy themes to find pieces for include Art Deco, French country cottage, and late Victorian.;
, Come up with two routes for your thrift store shopping. One route should contain the three or four closest thrift stores to where you live; the other should contain all the thrift stores in your area that you think you can handle in one shopping day. (including the stores on the first route). You'll use the first route when you only have an hour or two to spare, and reserve the longer route for weekend afternoons and the like. List stores in your area, then use Google Maps to enter each address and come up with a route that allows you to hit them without wasting time or gas.


You can visit thrift store directories such as The Thrift Shopper to get a list of many stores in your area by zip code (you might be surprised how many there are). Make a note of each store that sounds even a little bit promising; plan to at least drop in at each one you add to your list, and then pare it down based on what you learn.
Not every thrift shop is on The Thrift Shopper or its sister sites. Feel free to supplement your list with a Google search or a look at the Yellow Pages listings for thrift shops in your area.

, For a long trip especially, it helps to have a container of drinking water close at hand. If you plan to visit bin-type thrift stores where you'll have to dig through unsorted bins, pack a pair of leather-palm gardening gloves to protect your hands. Bring a reusable shopping bag, too, just in case no hand baskets are available and you want to buy more than a couple of items. Items such as baby wipes and hand sanitizer are fine, but not usually necessary unless you plan to eat during your trip.


Don't over-pack. It's nice to be prepared, but this is really just another shopping trip. The goal is to keep yourself comfortable enough that you don't get frustrated, not to plan for a thrift store apocalypse.

, Any items you know you no longer want can be loaded into your vehicle and taken with you to any nonprofit thrift store, such as the ARC (Value Village), Goodwill, or the Salvation Army. They'll take your old items off your hands for free, and even provide a receipt, since such donations are tax-deductible. Don't donate anything that absolutely needs to be replaced the same day, since you might not find a suitable replacement right away. Instead, donate such items after you find their replacements.


You can also hold a garage sale for your old items, but donating them is faster, easier, and generally more efficient at getting them out of your house for good. Consider holding a sale first, and then donating whatever is left.

, Give yourself a daily money or time limit, whichever you prefer, and stick to it. Consider setting a second monetary limit that dictates what the absolute maximum is that you're willing to spend on any single item. That way, if you've picked up $45 of goods on a $60 budget, but you then come across something you absolutely have to have for your home that costs $30, you can extend the budget up to your single-item maximum without feeling guilty.


Buy and grab quickly. It's useful to have a slightly flexible budget in part because good items at thrift stores never stay for very long. If you see something you love that would put you slightly over budget for the day, it's better to buy it than come back tomorrow hoping it'll still be there.
A few thrift stores offer discounts that change from week to week on certain items. Goodwill color codes its tags and sells one color of tag at 50% off each week; Value Village often has one day a week (typically Monday) when all used items are 25% off. Learn which stores offer discounts when, and try to incorporate them into your routine.
At garage sales and some small, mom-and-pop thrift stores, you can haggle for a better price, especially on items a bit more expensive than the average. Don't be afraid to make an offer; the worst the seller can do is refuse.

, You can't usually find specific pieces when you shop for used goods, but if you have a theme in mind, you can often spot items that would be a perfect fit for it. The item doesn't have to be period authentic, but it shouldn't look cheap or inexpertly made, either. Cheap items tend to be overpriced at thrift stores compared to their better-made counterparts, which might cost a few dollars more but which are excellent deals by comparison. Don't forget to shop for furniture as well as accent pieces, pictures, and knickknacks.


Thoroughly inspect every item you find before you buy it, even if that means sitting on the floor and lifting or upending a piece of furniture. Often, a deal that seems too good to be true is the result of damage somewhere on the item that isn't immediately apparent. There's nothing wrong with small flaws that can't normally be seen, but be wary of significant damage.
Imagine possibilities. Often, an item with no apparent decorative value can turn out to be useful by making simple alterations or even just approaching it as though it were a decorative item. Vintage cookie presses, for example, often come in old-fashioned boxes that look great on a kitchen mantel. Scrap fabric with an interesting pattern can be stretched and framed for an unusual piece of wall art. Try imagining how items could fit into one of your themes before you pass them by for being a little unusual.

, Start by making sure the room is clean and free of junk or items on the floor you could trip over. Hang wall items using a level to ensure good, clean angles; heavier items should be hung from studs as well, so invest in a stud finder if you need to (they aren't very expensive). Furniture and lighting can be rearranged as you see fit. Don't be afraid to move items you already own and try new configurations to get the best effect. You might even find some change under the couch!


Don't set items on new shelving or table space until you're completely satisfied with its location. Nothing is more annoying than loading up a new bookshelf with books and then changing your mind about its location 10 minutes later.

Paint the walls to breathe life into a room.,
Add cloth to coordinate easily.,
Repurpose old furniture.",How to Decorate Your Home on a Budget2," Nothing transforms the look and feel of a room like a new coat of paint. Although paint isn't always cheap, it's an investment that lasts for many years; taken over the course of a decade, the average cost of painting a bedroom is around a dollar and some small change per month. Visit a paint store and borrow some chips (paint samples) to take home so you can better visualize what the finished walls will look like. Use light, subtle colors to give rooms an open, airy, peaceful feeling, or go with bold, solid colors to make rooms feel darker and more dramatic.


Typically, a flat finish paint is used on ceilings. Various finishes can be used for walls, ranging from flat through eggshell and satin (a bit more lustrous) to semi-gloss, which is bright but reflects a lot of sunlight. If you have pillars, molding, or other architectural features, use a contrasting color to make them pop.
In addition to paint and primer, you'll need plenty of time, somewhere to move the furniture while you paint, a roller brush, an angle sash brush, some fine sandpaper, and a paint tray. Plan ahead so that you have all the equipment you need before you start painting.
If you can't quite find the perfect color, most paint stores will be happy to lighten, darken, or blend colors for you to create a custom color. Don't be afraid to ask.

, Although huge blackout curtains and heavy drapes are expensive and generally cloying, lighter and smaller options can make a big impact on a room's aesthetic without making a similar impact on your bank account. Kitchen and dining room windows can be framed with an inexpensive valance; sheer sill-length curtains come in a wide variety of patterns and can really pull a bedroom or study together.


If your windows already have mini-blinds, don't worry: just install a curtain rod a bit above the top of the blinds, and let your curtains and/or valances hang over them. An extra layer of cloth between you and the window is a small price to pay for being able to open, half-open, or close curtains to control their shape, size, and light level.

, With very little work, an old dresser can be used as entry storage for shoes or sideboard storage in the dining room. Use an old coffee table for a patio table, or repaint it to give it a new look. A nightstand can be refreshed with a new coat of paint and moved to the side of the couch to make a convenient end table with space for holding magazines. As for the couch itself, if it's still in decent condition, why not buy (or sew) a new cover for it to make it look like a whole different piece of furniture?


Old tools and kitchen gadgets can make interesting wall hangings. Be sure to hang them securely so that they don't fall and injure anybody.
If you have multiple pieces of furniture, you can make almost any boxy or flat item new again by cannibalizing table or chair legs and fastening them to it. Try metal wire V legs for a mid-century look, or wooden legs for a bit of rustic DIY charm.
Salvage wood, available for cheap at specialty stores, can easily bring unique flair to a room with its aged, weathered look. Turn a flat piece into a coffee table by bolting legs to it, or improvise a headboard or wall decoration from a particularly knotted and complex-looking board. Salvaged shelving is a great way to display knickknacks with a bit of extra character.

Set tempered glass over the top surface of a beaten-up piece of salvage wood to revitalize it without hiding its patina.

Sew your own pillows.,
Redesign headboards in bedrooms.,
Add inexpensive, dramatic lighting.,
Tie the room together with a homemade rug.",How to Decorate Your Home on a Budget3," Square throw pillows and covers for them are both very easy to sew, if you have a little bit of experience. Choose a firm batting and sew it into a tightly-stitched, stain-resistant pocket made from two pieces of identical cloth. Sew three sides first, stuff, check for evenness, and then sew up the last side. Slipcovers are a great way to add zest and character to your new pillows. Choose bold, fun fabrics with an eye to the décor of the room as a whole.


More complex slipcovers (such as those with ruffles and textured covers) can be made by following patterns available online or in fabric stores. A crazy-quilt slipcover can add a rustic Americana feel to the room, and is easy to make with fabric scraps and a bit of patience.

, A wooden headboard is essentially just a big palette for your sense of style, if you want it to be. Lightly sand, prime, and repaint it however you want, or stitch together a cloth cover for it to change both its color and its reflectiveness quickly. Use stencils to add shapes in a contrasting color, such as leaves or birds.


Even more whimsical designs are possible, using fancy fabrics and crafting supplies. Try gluing seashells and a bit of craft sand to the board, and then covering the top part with ragged fishing net cloth to make a seaside look, for example.

, Dedicated light fixtures are expensive and time-consuming to install, but portable and temporary solutions can dress up a room just as well. Use stick-on lights to illuminate kitchen cabinets or closets with the touch of your hand, or staple rope lights along the ceiling seam for an elegant and fun lighting option that's perfect for watching movies, having a romantic dinner, or spending time with a loved one in the bedroom. Rope lights are also useful for softly illuminating pantries and coat closets from above the door frame.


Simple Christmas lights can be used for beautiful illuminated garlands that add a touch of class to a living room or front room. Buy small lights all in one color; white is best for its versatility, but other colors may also be acceptable. Go to your local craft store and buy decorative garlands, preferably with a wire core. Wrap the lights in a spiral around the garlands and nail or staple the finished garland to the wall around a door frame or along the ceiling seam.

Change your garland with the seasons. Use a pine bough motif with berries and pine cones for winter, red and orange maple leaves for fall, and so on. Plug it into a wall outlet for an instant, dramatic effect.



, A crochet rug is easy to make, and can combine any colors you want for a homey, personalized look. It's also a great way to recycle old T-shirts or bedsheets. Alternatively, try stenciling a pattern onto a plain area rug with durable fabric paint to make it more dramatic and interesting to look at.


Mats for the bathroom or front door can also be stenciled for a new look. Whenever you stencil a rug or mat, be sure to thin the paint first – it doesn't take much to produce a vibrant effect.

Choose the right equipment


Before decorating, take into consideration what type of workouts will be pursued there.,
Choose the right flooring


A home gym would not be complete without proper flooring.,
Choose the right colors


A bright, happy room full of colors is more encouraging, than a gloomy, colorless room full of gym equipment.,
Personalize your home gym room


Bring in plants, candles, motivational posters or pictures of your family.,
Other Décor Ideas for Your Home Gym

It may be an option to put a mirror on the wall to watch themselves improve as they work out.,
Finished.

",How to Decorate Your Home Gym," Define your fitness or weight loss goals and go from there. Defining your goals will help you to find out what types of equipment do you need. If your main goal is to build or pump your muscles, then you will need some strength training equipment. If you want to lose some weight, then you will need to look for cardio training equipment. If you want to build a fully functional home gym, then you will need both types of equipment. Whatever you decide, please do not forget to check the size of the equipment, as it has to fit in your home gym room.





;
, Vinyl or rubber tiles are best in a home gym. These tiles cushion the impact on the joints during high intensity workouts. If vinyl or rubber tiles are not an option, carpet or laminate flooring works also. However, home gym equipment is heavy, so if you decide to put carpet or laminate, be aware that it can be damaged. Also, some equipment can slide on laminate floors during high intensity workouts, and you have to prevent that. Be sure to either protect the floor, or find something to put underneath the equipment. Home gym mats are a good option for this.

, Colors in a home gym should be energizing, bright and colorful. And think about the size of your home gym. If your home gym is in a small space, dark colors are not recommended. Putting dark colors here makes that space seem like more of a dungeon than a fun home gym. Also, take into consideration what type of exercises are being done in that certain space. For example, if this room is going to mainly be used for weightlifting, consider a blue hue. Tranquil blues send a chemical from the brain to the rest of the body calming or soothing it. Weight Lifters lift more in a blue room. Blue is also known to increase productivity and suppress an appetite.

, Putting up pictures of your family may be something to keep you going. Family can be one of the most inspiring things to a person. Anything that is considered inspiring should be in your home gym. This is to be a place of inspiration and hard work. Find something that inspires you to work harder.

, Write inspirational sayings and put them up on a wall or mirror; somewhere where they will be seen and inspire. Make it personal as well, adding goals on a whiteboard or a piece of paper taped up on a wall. Perhaps add a stereo or television to your home gym. If there is something distracting enough to take one’s mind off a workout, that workout might become easier or might pass by faster causing them to continue. Hydration is another important part of working out, so perhaps adding a small refrigerator stocked with bottled water or sports drinks would be a good idea. Also, adding clock to your home gym can help keep track of workout times.






Do not create a home gym alone. Bringing in family is a great way to get everyone involved and may encourage the rest of the family to get fit, stay active and spend more time together. If small children are part of the equation, then add a set, specifically made space just for them, so then they can work out alongside their family. Friends are another great group to get involved. Working out with friends is a great motivation tool for workouts. Friends encourage each other to push one’s limits. Perhaps even get everyone to join as a team for a competition, such as, an obstacle course, triathlon, or group running. The most important thing to remember is to have fun creating this home gym. It should not be a grueling process; it should be fun and exciting.

Budget, budget, budget!,
Begin bargain hunting.,
Keep in mind the layout of the room.,
Use some cute stuff.",How to Decorate on a Budget," Figure out how much money you have to spend. This creates your decorating budget baseline and it will need to be divided carefully amongst all the different ideas you have in mind. A good way to do this is to draw up columns on a page and go through each room that you want decorated and write down your ideas. Then assess those ideas against the budget you have and determine what is non-negotiable, negotiable so you can save money as much as possible, and who knows you might spend less than your budget and reward yourself while you transform your room into a brilliant place!;
, At this stage, your decorating budget needs to be spent as wisely and carefully as possible so that there might be dollars left over for splurges. There are a range of possible places where you might find your decorating needs but here are some of the key ones for the budget conscious:


Online auctions and trading posts: you will find all the things in the world in an online auction. Don't stick to the one well-known site either - look around for niche auction sites, for local sites, for competitor sites as well. Although shipping and delivery are considerations to keep in mind, it is likely you can find a wealth of incredible things online that will help your decorating endeavors. Also check out trading posts online, classifieds, freecycle, etc.
Store outlets: Outlets can provide you with a huge range of items reduced heavily. You'll need a car, or a friend with a car, and a fair bit of time to browse. Some outlets also have online storefronts.
Box stores: There can be interesting items in box stores at great prices. Be careful though - the cheap price may not be worth the short-term durability and classiness of the items bought.
Flea markets, craft markets, car boot sales (UK), yard sales, etc: You will be amazed what you can unearth in these types of markets. You can decorate solely on the finds from such places if you're clever and patient!
Live auctions: Spend some time looking over goods that interest you in auction houses and watch how the bidding goes. Set your limit and join in up to that amount! You will probably need a car or some form or transportation arranged to take home your items.
Decorate according to a theme. Decorating on a budget doesn't mean creating an eclectic mixture of anything goes unless that's the look you're after! Select a theme that is ideal for you and follow it through the best that you can. Keep this theme in mind whenever purchasing, including color matches, textures, patterns, era, etc.

, Whether it is rectangular in shape,or if it has windows etc.This is important if you rearrange furniture because you should know where you can put it to make it look organised. You also will find this important if you are to change the wallpaper etc.

, Curtains, posters, mobiles, and any stuff that makes your room cool!

Create consistency in your décor by opting for a collection.,
Refrain from buying art that is not priced.,
Select your art from an artist who is independent of a gallery.,
Pick an up and coming artist with a unique style.,
Discuss pricing options with the artist.,
Opt to frame the artwork yourself.",How to Buy Art for Your Home," Learn about the various types of art available, and more specifically, the up-and-coming artists. Determine the type of art you are interested in and where you can purchase it. Compare medium, style and colors. Use the Internet to see what is fashionable in the world of new art. Ideally, you should select art that is in demand or has the potential of being popular.;
, The cost of art can vary tremendously, depending on the reputation of the artist and whether the art is purchased from a gallery or directly from the artist. If you are purchasing artwork for investment purposes, you may have to spend more for a more established artist, unless you decide to take a chance on an emerging artist.

, If you have a contemporary design, then opt for modern art. Balancing art with décor not only enhances both elements individually, but creates an overall style of the design of the home.

, Art from the same artist can be the final touch that brings all the rooms in your home together.

, Doing so allows the seller to inflate the price. If you do like a piece of art that has no price, insist that it be valued before you make a decision. Don't offer a price first.

, Typically, when you purchase art from a gallery the establishment receives a large portion of the cost. If you have a small budget, consider purchasing directly from the artist for a better deal, especially if the artist is not yet established.

, Avoid artists with a style similar to famous artists, such as Van Gogh and Rodin. Art with a unique approach has more of a chance of becoming valuable over time. Should the artist become established, the art will be recognized for its originality.

, If you are interested in purchasing more than 1 piece of art directly from the artist, negotiate a price that you think is fair. If you find an artist whose work falls well within your budget, offer to buy multiple pieces at a reduced price. You may even be able to get negotiated pricing for future purchases of the artist's work.

, You can also check online framing options. Doing so will allow you to select a frame that not only enhances the art itself, but also complements your home.

, Take a trip to the home goods store and pick out paper samples or remnants. Don't worry if the remnants aren't large enough to cover the whole wall - creating a collage of different patterns and colors is part of the fun.

, If your child sleeps in a bunk bed, fabrics can be hung from the sideboards to create a ""tent"". This can make the room feel bigger, and creates a great place for pretend!

, Fill some space in the room by fashioning a ""chandelier"" out of old toys, stuffed animals, or any lightweight objects. Older children might enjoy making mobiles that reflect their hobbies. Baseball cards, old ballet slippers, and sports ribbons are all good materials.

, Also try hanging picture frames (with nails through the fabric) on top of the fabric sheet to have a nice picture collage.

, Thousands are available now, you'll find one that will relate to something important in your child's life - their favorite sport, an animal they love... You can even get them really involved by letting them paint their own knobs!

They are available at many places that sell wallpaper as well as on-line. They will last for a year at least.

Live safely with materials that contain asbestos.,
Consider asbestos removal.",How to Test for Asbestos," Asbestos was widely used between 1920 and 1989, after which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began regulating materials containing asbestos. Asbestos can most commonly be found in buildings, but also in gas heaters, hair dryers, some clothing and automotive brakes.


Walls, flooring, pipes, textured paints, insulation, fireproofing materials, pipes, electric wiring, and even chalkboards constructed between 1920 and 1989 may contain asbestos. If the building was constructed between 1920 and 1989, chances are something in the building was constructed with materials containing asbestos.
Few materials made today are constructed with asbestos. Items that do contain asbestos are now labeled as such.;
, You can't tell whether an item contains asbestos just by looking at it. Instead, look for warning signs that construction materials are degrading. Asbestos isn't dangerous when it's still in good condition, but when it starts to break down and the fibers are released in the air, it becomes toxic. Look for signs of older materials that have become worn out or damaged.


Disintegrating pipes, insulation, walls, tiles, vinyl flooring, stovetop pads, and other older materials that have been present in the building since its construction are signs to look out for.
Look for cracks, dusty areas and spots where the material seems to be in the process of breaking down and falling apart.

, If you don't see signs of construction materials degrading, you might not need to get the area tested, since asbestos is only dangerous when it becomes airborne. However, if you do see signs of degrading materials, or if you simply want to err on the side of safety, you should opt to get the area tested by a professional who has been certified to test for and handle asbestos safely.Another scenario in which you might want to get the area tested is if you plan to do new construction work or replace old materials. Even if the materials are still in good shape, they'll get disturbed during the construction process and may release fibers into the air.
While you could purchase the equipment required to conduct asbestos testing, it is not recommended that you try this on your own. Asbestos testing should be conducted by someone who has gone through training and knows how to handle the material without causing a health hazard for the occupants of the building. If you haven't been trained, you could end up disturbing the asbestos and breathing it in or putting other people at risk of doing so.

, Contact an EPA-approved contractor who is trained and licensed in handling asbestos to analyze the suspected particles, as well as filing the necessary paperwork required by the EPA. If you were to collect the samples yourself, you'd still have to give the samples to an EPA-certified laboratory for analysis, and give them the protective gear you wore during the collection for proper disposal.


The EPA has provided a list of certified contractors by state at http://www2.epa.gov/asbestos/state-asbestos-contacts.
Federal law does not require asbestos testing done in single-family, detached homes to be conducted by an accredited professional, although some individual states require it.If you're interested in completing an asbestos professional training program, contact your state or local health department or regional EPA office for more information.

, Since the act of testing for asbestos can disturb the material and potentially create a hazard, you should take a few precautions to ensure everyone's safety before the certified contractor conducts the test. Prepare the building as follows:


Stop any air conditioning, fans, or ventilation systems that could circulate asbestos in the air.
Plan to close off the area; don't let anyone in or out of the room being sampled during the collection.
If the testing is being done in a home, it might be prudent to have everyone leave the house at the time of the testing.

, When you hire an EPA-certified contractor to come to your house to test for asbestos, a certain protocol will be followed to maximize safety. Anyone in the room at the time of testing should put on protective clothing and gear, including protective gloves, boots, and clothes which can be disposed of after collecting samples, and a face mask including a HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filter. The contractor will probably use the following testing method:


Plastic sheeting will be laid sheeting below the area where samples will be taken and secured with tape.
The area to be tested will be sprayed with water to keep loose fibers from getting in the air.
A tool is used to cut into the substance to be tested to get a sample of fibers.
A small sample of the material which might be or contain asbestos is placed in a sealable container to be sent to a lab for testing.
The area where the sample was taken is patched with plastic sheet, drywall, or tape to prevent suspected fibers from spreading.
Protective gear clothing contaminated by the material is placed in a sealed container to be disposed of properly.

, The material sample should be sent to an asbestos analysis lab accredited by the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) at the National Institute of Standards and technology (NIST). A list of laboratories is available at http://www.nist.gov/. If the sample tests positive for asbestos, you'll need to decide whether to repair the area or remove the materials that contain asbestos from the property.

, Repairs to materials that contain asbestos usually involved either sealing or covering the area to prevent fibers from being released into the air. With such a dangerous carcinogen present, it might seem strange to repair it instead of removing it, but repair is actually the safest option. Removing the materials tends to disturb them more, posing a greater health risk, while repairing the materials to contain the asbestos allows you to live with the materials safely.


Repairs should be conducted by a certified professional to ensure they are done properly. In most cases, a special sealant or covering is applied to the area to keep it from breaking down. Floors containing asbestos might be covered with new flooring to keep fibers from entering the air.
Repairs are less expensive than removal, and usually the best all-around option. However, if the materials are already quite damaged, and they'll eventually need to be removed, it's better to spring for removal right away. Applying a sealant or covering can make it more difficult to remove the materials later., After repairs have been conducted, it's still important to be careful around the materials that contain asbestos. Be cautious around the materials in question so you don't end up disturbing them and releasing the asbestos fibers. Take the following measures to live safely with asbestos:


Keep activities to a minimum in the areas that have asbestos. For example, if the walls in your basement contain asbestos, don't spend more time than necessary there.Don't saw, sand, scrape, drill, or otherwise damage materials that contain asbestos, even after sealant has been applied.
Don't use abrasive cleaning materials on materials that have asbestos.
Don't vacuum or sweep debris on the floor that might contain asbestos.
If further damage occurs, have it repaired by a professional.

, If you'd simply prefer not to have asbestos-containing materials in the building, you can opt for removal instead of repair. Hire a contractor who has been trained by the EPA. The removal process is more dangerous than the repair process, and if done improperly it can pose a serious health risk to individuals using the building."

Remove gum, rubber cement, and general adhesives.,
Soften and break in leather shoes.,
Remove grease stains from your clothing.",How to Use WD‐40 Around the House1," WD-40 will break down most general types of adhesive and clean them off of nearly all surfaces. For example, spray WD-40 on jars to remove the adhesive remnants of the labels or masking tape, or use it to remove the adhesive from stickers on glass or plastic surfaces. WD-40 can also loosen and remove gum and rubber cement from surfaces they have been stuck to. Spray WD-40 directly onto the unwanted adhesive, and use a rag or old toothbrush to remove the substance.WD-40 will even work to clean gum, oil, or dog poop off of the soles of your shoes.In any of these cases, spray WD-40 directly onto the adhesive substance, and then scrub vigorously with an old, unused toothbrush.;
, New or unused leather shoes that have not been worn recently are often inflexible and can be uncomfortable to slide your foot into or wear for a day. You can use WD-40 to soften the leather and make the shoes comfortable to wear. To soften the leather, spray WD-40 generously over the leather material, and rub the material into the shoe with a clean, dry cloth.An application of WD-40 will also soften any other leather items, from dog collars to baseball gloves.
WD-40 can also be used to clean scuff marks off of the tops and sides of shoes. Black scuff marks build up from normal use and wear (including from the shoes bumping together as you walk). To remove scuffs, spray the marked area with WD-40 and buff with a dry cloth., As WD-40 is grease-resistant and can break down stubborn adhesives in general, it can even be used to remove grease stains from clothing. To remove the stain, hold the plastic extension tube only about ½ inch away from the stain, and spray liberally to saturate the area. Then wash the piece of clothing in a regular cycle.Before drying the clothing, make sure that the stain has been removed. Drying—especially on medium or high heat—can set the stain and make it impossible to get out. If the stain has not been removed after an initial application of WD-40, repeat the application and wash again.

Date the material.,
Look at joints.,
Analyze surface patterns.,
Inspect exterior building materials.,
Investigate interior panels.,
Check appliances and finishing materials.,
Assess the location.",How to Recognize Asbestos1," The date of the building or material can tell you a lot about asbestos risk. Buildings made between the 1940s and the 1980s are very likely to have used asbestos materials. Even still, asbestos was phased out in the 1980s, so some buildings built during that time could have still used asbestos materials. If the building was built after 1995, it almost certainly utilized no asbestos materials., On the outside of buildings, asbestos sheets were often joined together with aluminum runners. These runners were held on by small nails with no point at the end. On the inside, asbestos sheets were held together with plastic or wooden runners in the same way. This design could be a sign that the structure was built using asbestos materials. You should also inspect any adhesives used to join two materials together, as they often contain asbestos., Asbestos materials often have a pattern on the surface that looks like small dimples or shallow craters covering the surface. Later materials have a smoother texture. While this is not a foolproof identification, seeing a dimpled pattern on the surface warrants taking asbestos precautions., Asbestos was used to make several exterior materials. Roofing and siding shingles are among the most common materials to contain asbestos, and will readily release fibers into the air if broken. Asbestos was also put into cement used on the exterior of buildings to help insulate the., Floors, walls, and ceilings were often made with asbestos containing materials. Vinyl tiles and decorative wall plasters commonly contain asbestos., Aside from common construction materials, asbestos was used in a number of other manufactured pieces. These materials can be found in any system in your home or building. Some examples include:Insulation
Duct Work
Flues
Cowels
Fireproof Materials (doors, cabinets, etc.)
Eaves
Carpet Underlay

, Asbestos is a very strong, durable material. It is not susceptible to water the way that many materials are. For that reason, asbestos materials were often used in places like bathrooms and basements to avoid dealing with water damages."

Be wary of a deal that's too good to be true.,
Ask for references.,
Have a written agreement.,
Trust your gut instinct.,
Seek another opinion.,
Do your own research.,
Ask people whose advice you value.,
Guard yourself against possible retaliation.",How to Spot a Bad Contractor," Watch out if the contractor in question's bid was far below all of the others. This is a sure sign that the contractor is either unfamiliar with the work in question (and therefore also probably new to the work), or has underbid on purpose because he intends to have cost over-runs later. Another play on this theme is if the contractor offers a great bargain in order to use ""your project"" as an example, such as featuring it on a website or in a brochure.;
, Beware the contractor who has questionable or no references and or no fixed business address. Always ask for references; if the contractor does good work, he will have many, many examples of this through his references. Any contractor that does not have a fixed business address could be a fly-by-night operation. If you are suspicious of any address provided, turn up to see if it exists before you sign up.

, Be very cautious when the contractor does not want to go through the formalities of signing a contract. When you are doing any major work, a contract that spells out what the scope of work is, and what the contractor's responsibilities are, is standard business practice and any person who does not want to follow that is suspect.

, When you get a bad feeling, trust your gut feeling; the guy who seems like a sleazy sales man probably is. High pressure sales tactics such as ""This price is only valid until I walk out of that door, you have to sign this right now..."" are a very bad sign. If you feel hassled, pushed, intimidated or bullied, this isn't the contractor for you.

, Be very cautious of the contractor who uses scary scenarios to get you to buy more expensive options or more extensive work than what you initially wanted. If problems are uncovered during a project, they should be obvious. Like a doctor, you can always get a second opinion.

, Use the internet to learn as much as possible about the product or services that you want for your home or garden. If you are fairly knowledgeable about the product or service, you will be familiar with the lingo, you will be able to ask pertinent questions, and it will be clear to the contractor that you know what you want and this will scare off a bad contractor or can lead them to say things that you know are wrong or poorly informed.

, The best way to find a good contractor is to ask your friends, family or neighbors. More often then not, they have used somebody with a good result. Be extremely wary of the guy who pulls up in front of your house out of the blue and tells you that you need a new roof (or something else). Best to tell that person to be on his way. Additionally, many locations require contractors to have licenses. If you live in one of those locations, it is perfectly reasonable to ask for a copy of the contractors license and insurance certificate. No show, no go.

, If you have fired a contractor who you provided a key to access your home, change your locks as soon as possible. Best to leave temptation at the door rather than let it through.

Loosen rusty garden shears.,
Prevent rust buildup on tools and appliances.,
Apply to moving parts on your bicycle.",How to Use WD‐40 Around the House2," If you haven’t used your garden shears in years, and especially if they’ve developed patches of rust, they may be difficult to open. If this is the case, spray WD-40 directly onto the joint between the two blades of the shears. Slowly work the handles back and forth to allow the WD-40 to soak in.If your garden shears continue to not open—or to open only with difficulty—loosen the screw or bolt at the intersection of the blades, and spray some WD-40 between the sections of metal that rub together to lubricate. Screw the blades back together.

, In addition to loosening moving parts that have stuck together, WD-40 can also prevent rust from building up. If you’re worried about unused tools or metal appliances developing rust, spray with WD-40 to prevent the rust from building up. Hold the tip of the plastic extension tube 2–3 inches from the metal surface you’d like to keep from rusting, and coat the metal with a thin layer of fluid.


This is useful for a number of outdoor gardening and lawn supplies. Apply WD-40 to your shovel, rake, hoe, saws and saw blades, as well as any outdoor appliances that are exposed to wet or humid weather., WD-40 is great at maintaining the motion and smoothness of any moving mechanical parts, including the wheel sprockets, chain, handlebars, and pedal mechanism on your bicycle. WD-40 makes several bicycle-specific products for use on various parts of your bike. These include a general de-greaser, chain lubricant, and frame protectant. When possible, use bicycle-specific WD-40 products on your equipment.These products should be available at your local bike-supply shop, a hardware store, or from various online bicycle-focused retailers.

Clean stains from your toilet, sink, and bathtub.",How to Use WD‐40 Around the House3," WD-40 can remove dust and grime from stainless-steel appliances, including your refrigerator, stovetop, dishwasher, laundry machine, and clothes dryer.Spray the WD-40 onto dirty areas from about 2–3 inches away, and let sit for a couple of minutes before wiping down with a wet rag or a soapy sponge.


Although WD-40 can be used to remove splattered grease around kitchen in general, it’s less effective for this purpose than soap and water, or a general-purpose cleaner like Windex., The lubricating properties of WD-40 make it a useful for loosening dirt and grime in hard-to-reach places, including between kitchen or patio tiles. Hold the tip of the plastic extension tube about 1 inch away from the tiles or sections of grout that you wish to clean, and spray liberally. Let the fluid sit for a few minutes, and then clean up with soapy water.This method will clean a variety of substances off of tile, in addition to general dirt and grime, including: paint, scuff marks, makeup, and nail polish.

, Many porcelain surfaces in the bathroom are stained by mineral buildup from hard water. Other stains build up on these bathroom amenities as well, including some that may be left behind by other cleaning supplies. You can remove these by spraying WD-40 directly onto the stain, and then and then scrub vigorously with your toilet brush (or a sponge).You should not use WD-40 to replace regular toilet cleaner, as WD-40 cannot kill germs and bacteria. Rather, only use WD-40 to remove specific stains that general toilet cleaner can’t remove.
WD-40 can be used to remove stains from other surfaces made of porcelain (or a similar substance). For example, use it in your kitchen or dining room to remove stains made from tea or coffee cups."

Identify the mold.,
Scan for letter codes.,
Find additional codes.",How to Recognize Asbestos2," Asbestos was molded into many different shapes and sizes to fill different needs. For example, sheets of asbestos were used to make up walls, and slats of asbestos were created to serve as roof tiles. Each mold has a different location that may be stamped with manufacturer’s information. This information sometimes discloses whether or not the material contains asbestos., Once you’ve identified the mold, look for any information that the manufacturer stamped or printed. If you find it, look for codes such as AC (contains asbestos) or NT (does not contain asbestos). Note that not all pieces will have this information., Some manufacturers used different codes at different times. If you can find any codes or markings on the material, try to look it up. Sometimes you can find the meaning of the code and determine asbestos content. Other times, information about the code is not made available."

If you need to be sure, bring in a consultant that is uniquely qualified to identify asbestos. This could be an experienced contractor or someone like a building inspector. These contacts can be found on the internet., If you do not want to bring in a contractor, or if they are unsure as well, a lab test is the most definitive process. Lab tests can tell you with certainty whether a material contains asbestos or not. Chip off a small corner of the material in question and place it in a bag., Take your sample to a NATA certified lab. If there is one in your area, you can drive it there. If you have to send it off in the mail, follow any regulatory guidelines for mailing asbestos. The lab will identify the material and report back to you."

Try a paint made just for leather.,
Make your own fabric paint.,
Use spray paint.,
Pick a brush.",How to Paint a Leather Couch1," For the best results, pick a paint that was designed to go on leather. It will have a more polished look at the end, and it will likely have the smoothest surface. Plus, that type of paint will bond best with leather.Try Angelus brand leather paint or ReLuv.;
, Some people make a paint mixture themselves to use on their couch. This option will likely cover your couch and be durable, but it's not going to give you as smooth a finish as leather paint will.Try a ""chalkboard"" paint. The advantage of this paint is that it's highly durable and relatively cheap. Just mix two parts powdered calcium carbonate with one part water and four parts latex paint, then use as normal. You can find calcium carbonate online or at some home improvement stores.
You can also use textile medium. For each quart of latex paint, mix in two 8-ounce bottles of textile medium. You can find textile medium at most craft stores. It makes the paint dry softer and more flexible, and it also helps it bond to the leather.Another option is using a paint mixture of two-thirds store-bought chalkboard paint and one-third water to create a thinner paint that you can use on leather., Spray paint may not be the obvious choice when it comes to painting leather. However, it can work, particularly on something you don't use very much. It will take some patience to use spray paint, so be ready for the time commitment.Pick a paint meant for multiple surfaces.

, The type of brush you choose depends on the texture of your couch. For instance, a typical cheap foam brush will work on a smoother surface. A relatively smooth sponge will also work.If your couch has fine cracks, though, a sturdy paintbrush might work better.If you do choose a standard brush, pick a brush with a fine or synthetic bristle to help cut back on brush lines."

A plate arrangement around an existing or new painting/picture (you might even consider matching the plates and the painting by theme, color, etc.)
Calendar year theme - ideal for the collection of plates that are dated each Christmas; place them in order of receipt either horizontally or vertically on the wall space.

, If you have a small collection, you might add it to the kitchen or eating area. If you have numerous plates, it might be best to place them in different areas of the house, perhaps according to some of the themes suggested above.

, Use a tape measure to ensure that you have the distances between plates even or at least where you'd like the distances to be; mark gently with a pencil. Attach the plate hangers according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer your arrangement from the table onto the wall. Stand back and admire!

Use painters tape to tape off these areas.Keep in mind that you can also do things like pull off the couch skirt to give the couch a different look.Repair any major cracks with glue made for leather or a patch.Other people have had luck using E6000 glue. You will need to sand any repair you make so it is smooth for painting.

, One way to help keep the paint supple and smooth is to create thin layers, particularly if you're using a paint you made yourself. The thin layers will help keep the paint from cracking, as well. Of course, that means more work overall, but the end result will be better.Don't gob large amounts of the paint on the couch at a time. Create very thin, quick-drying layers.

, It will take a number of layers to get your couch covered with paint, so be patient. Start with three layers, but you may need as many as six layers to get the couch covered, along with a bit of touch up.Let the sofa dry completely between coats. The paint should be dry to the touch and not have any shiny spots., As you paint the couch, alternate the way you are painting. That is, on one coat, make your strokes go in one direction. On the next coat, make your strokes go perpendicular to the first layer. This process creates a smoother, stronger surface.Some people find a circular motion works better. Test your pattern in an inconspicuous place first before applying it to the whole couch.

, Once you have the paint on how you'd like, just leave it alone. Let it set for at least two days before you try anything else on it. In fact, do not touch it or move the leather around. Just let it be so the paint has a chance to cure., Some paints can leave the top feeling rough, particularly if they're not made for leather. To alleviate this problem, sand down the paint once it has set. Start with rougher sandpaper and work down to finer paper. Use your hand to decide when the paint is the right texture.Wipe or vacuum any dust that collects as you sand.

, In some cases, a finish can be helpful. For most leather paints, a finish is necessary. Choose from high gloss, semi-gloss, or matte, depending on the look you want for your couch. Apply a layer of the gloss at the end of the project.Some people find that using wax over a homemade paint can add durability and shine. However, it's not absolutely necessary."

Tape those areas off thoroughly, as spray paint has a tendency to drift.Glue together any major cracks or use a patch. Sand the area down before painting., Create thin layers of spray paint on the paintable areas. Thin layers are very important when it comes to leather. Hold the spray paint well above the area, moving it around slowly to create an even, light layer. Start in an inconspicuous area to test what it looks like., Spray paint can become tacky and peel if you don't let it dry between layers. Make sure the painted area is completely dry before you add the next layer. You may need as many as twenty layers when painting a couch with spray paint., Once the couch has an appearance you like, stop adding layers. Let it dry completely. Leave it to cure for about at least two days, so you know it's completely dry and cured. Use a soft cloth to rub down the painted area so that you remove any paint that didn't get absorbed."

Take your fitted bed sheet and secure it over the cushions of your sofa.
Use pillowcases to cover the arms of your sofa.
You may need to experiment with different sheet sizes to get the right fit.

, If you are comfortable with a little hand sewing, adding a few stitches on either side of your sofa can help secure the bed sheets and keep them in place. Using a needle and thread, add a few basic stitches wherever the bed sheets end (on the arms and on the edges of cushions). If you would like to remove this bed sheet later, these stitches can easily be removed., Pick up a nice throw blanket and a few colorful throw pillows that fit with the theme of your living room.

You can purchase commercial upholstery cleaning products at most stores, however, you may already have some great products at home. You will also need a vacuum cleaner, and a steam-cleaning vacuum is optional.Baby wipes are ideal for both spot cleaning and wiping down hard surfaces.
White vinegar can help to lift out stains.
Laundry detergent can be mixed with warm water to make an effective cleansing solution. If you don’t have laundry detergent, you can substitute a mild dish soap.

, Use a vacuum to remove dirt, large particles, pet fur, and lint from your sofa. Be sure to remove all pillows and cushions and vacuum underneath. You may want to do several passes to get the couch as clean as possible.You may want to use a bristle brush to help loosen any stuck on particles.

, Using a baby wipe, try to remove any surface stains or dried on substances. Also, be sure to wipe down any hard surfaces, such as legs or wooden frames., Mix 4-6 cups of warm water with ¼ cup laundry detergent and a splash (approximately 1-2 Tbs.) of white vinegar. Then, using a course washcloth or soft-bristle brush, apply small amounts of this detergent mix and scrub your sofa clean. Use the detergent as sparingly as you can, as not to over-saturate the sofa.If you have a steam cleaner, you can use it to suck up dirt and water to create an even deeper clean.
It is always a good idea to do a small “spot test” before applying detergent to your sofa.
If your sofa is leather, avoid using water. Instead, opt for a commercial leather cleaner.

, The final step in cleaning your sofa is simply to allow it to dry. You can use a hair-dryer to accelerate this process, but the best method is really just to leave your sofa alone for 4-6 hours until it is completely dry.If you have a steam cleaner, this will help remove excess moisture and speed up the drying process.

If you’re not choosing pictures that come together in a series, choose a selection of pictures that have a similar color scheme.






The eye is attracted visually to odd numbers, so try to select an odd number of pictures to hang.





;
, There are two general techniques you can use when choosing frames for your pictures: select frames for each image that are all the same, or select a variety of mis-matched frames in a similar color scheme/style. Frames are an important aspect of highlighting the pictures you are hanging, so be sure to choose ones that match both the style of your house and the style of your images.


Try not to use too many large, ornate frames as these can become overwhelming in groups.
If you’re using mis-matched frames, use one or two colorful or detailed frames to make your arrangement pop.

, When you start to arrange your pictures, it can be difficult to see where you want them without hanging them all up in a test-run. To make this easier, cut parchment paper to be the same size as your picture frames. You can then tape these to the walls in test positions, and rearrange them as you please with little work and no extra holes in the walls.

, As it goes, some people have very specific locations in mind for arranging their pictures, whereas others have only a foggy idea of where they might hang their artwork up. Look at all the bare walls in your home, and decide which are begging to be adorned with pictures. The key is filling up enough space to make it look interesting, without adding so much to the walls that they become distracting and disorienting.

, The simplest arrangement of pictures is to line them up all in an even row. Determine the height of your pictures, keeping in mind that anything below the average eye level will seem out of place. Don’t space out your images too much, as more than 6-inches between each frame will remove the appearance of a grouping.


This arrangement works best with portrait-arranged photos.







, This arrangement works particularly well for an odd, narrow wall or to fill up space next to a tall piece of furniture. Arrange your photos by stacking them on top of each other, with a few inches of space in between each frame. Typically, this arrangement will be most appealing when placed closer to the ceiling than to the floor.


This arrangement works best with landscape-arranged photos.







, Best for a small space, you can hang a small group of pictures as if there were a circle around them, giving them shape. If you have a group of three pictures, for instance, you can hang one of the photos on the left, and the other two to the right of it staggered on top of each other.


This works particularly well if you have one picture that is significantly larger than two smaller pictures.
This arrangement will only work with an odd number of pictures.

, Perfect for over a table or couch pushed against a wall, select a group pictures, preferably in the same sizes, to be hung together in a square or rectangle. Arrange the pictures so that they are evenly spaced in the classic square/rectangle shape.

, If you have an even number of pictures greater than 6, you have the opportunity to create a large square/rectangle arrangement. Line up all your frames in even rows/columns to create a symmetrical shape. This looks particularly good with three rows of 3 pictures, to create a large square.

, This works best for photos that are all the same size; lay out your pictures so that you have two long, symmetrical rows. You will have created a long rectangular space that is traditional in appearance. This layout is great for a hallway or another long wall, or above a very wide piece of furniture.

, The sister style to the aforementioned arrangement, if your pictures are all different sizes, create two staggered rows with them. Find a center line that will be the meeting point for the two rows. For the top row, line up the bottoms of all the pictures so that they are just above the center line. On the bottom row, line up the tops of all the pictures so they are just below the center line.Put the largest pictures in the center of the rows, and have the smallest pictures on the ends.







, If you have a very large wall you are trying to fill up, arranging your pictures in a pyramid may be the best option for you. Using either 6 or 10 pictures in the same size and layout, stack them up to create a large triangle on the wall. You can choose to flip the shape upside down so that you have more pictures on the top than on the bottom, if you like. Make sure that there is even spacing between each row of pictures.

, The ultimate in picture arranging, you can create a gallery wall by arranging a large number of pictures in an orderly fashion like puzzle pieces, without using rows or columns. Gallery walls are best when using many images of different sizes and formats. To make yours successful, just be sure that there is an equal amount of space between each picture frame so that it gives the appearance of organization to your pictures., Whether you have floating shelves on your wall or a bookcase with spare room, you can arrange pictures on them to add interest. Keep the number of pictures you use to 5 or less and supplement the design with objects (like vases and figurines) or books. Group pictures on the shelves together so that they overlap slightly; for example, stagger two pictures near each other and a third picture on the opposite end of the shelf.

, The mantle over your fireplace is a prime picture-arranging location. Try hanging a large, framed image over the mantle, and then adding a few smaller framed pictures to the shelf below it. This will instantly add appeal to the wall and fireplace, and show off some more of your photography or artwork.

, Placing pictures on a table, desk, or nightstand can be tricky because it can be easy to overwhelm these spaces. Don’t try to fill up your tabletops with framed pictures, instead choose only 1-3 total (depending on the size of your table) to display standing upright. Stagger/layer these pictures slightly as well, so that the display looks natural rather than a tri-fold poster board presentation."

Invest in alternate hanging options.,
Avoid crookedness.",How to Arrange Pictures on a Wall," Sometimes the images we like the most are not the best ones to hang. If you have lots of images at your disposal, it's usually best to choose the most distinctive and professional ones. Wall pictures will be seen by almost every visitor to your home, many of which won't be able to appreciate the inside jokes behind embarrassing photos or goofy low-brow art. For your hall and living room, it's best to stick to standard family photos (professionally-shot is a plus) or traditional art - save your roadside velvet paintings for the basement and your naked baby photos for the photo album.;
, If you plan to hang more than one picture in a certain wall space, that's great - by playing with the precise spacing and arrangement of the pictures, you can create striking visual impressions. Before you hang multiple pictures together, though, make a ""blueprint"" for your group of pictures - if you're confident you can erase it, lightly trace the pictures' outlines with a pencil, otherwise, lay your pictures down on a roll of paper and cut squares around them. Tape these squares to the wall to give you an idea of how your arrangement will look when the pictures are actually hung on the wall. It's much easier to adjust paper squares than to re-hang your pictures.

, Big pictures, especially ones you're especially proud of, deserve a prominent position in the room. Hang them at eye-level or higher on a wall where they'll be noticed. Give them priority positioning - a great picture can double as a room's centerpiece. Don't put them too close to any of the room's corners - you'll inadvertently give your art a ""squished in"" look. A foot or two of room should suffice.


Provided your picture doesn't absolutely dwarf other, smaller pictures, you use it as part of a multi-picture arrangement. If you're not sure how to arrange your big picture sensibly as part of a group, a good idea is to put it in one of the lower corners of the arrangement, with the second-largest picture in the upper corner opposite it. Line smaller pictures up in the two unoccupied sections of the imaginary rectangle containing both big pictures.

, You don't need to center rooms around massive landscape paintings or stuffy portraits. When grouped together in visually-pleasing patterns, a cluster of smaller pictures can make for an eye-catching arrangement. Adjust your arrangement to suit the needs of the room you're in. Tight, straight vertical or horizontal rows can make the most of limited wall space, while large cloud-like arrangements incorporating pictures of different sizes can give a room a modern feel.


The most important thing to remember while making picture clusters is to make sure that the edges of every frame are at precise ninety-degree angles to each other (use a level to get your pictures perfectly straight.) Also make sure the distance between pictures is uniform throughout your arrangement.
An added benefit of smaller pictures is that they're much more versatile than larger pictures. Stick a short row of small pictures in a crowded bedroom for a big difference or slip a few old family photos on a stairway for a visual timeline of your family's history.

, Generally, when grouping framed pictures, like frames should go with like. This doesn't necessarily mean that every picture in a group needs to have identical frames (though that's certainly a valid option.) Rather, it means there should be an overarching theme for all the frames in a certain cluster. For instance, a cluster of pictures where every picture has a black frame will look better than a cluster of pictures with some metal frames, some bamboo frames, etc.


Experiment with patterns - alternating blue and white frames in a checkered pattern, for instance. Patterns count as an ""overarching theme"" - more important than having an identical frame for every picture is to give the impression that the pictures were arranged according to some logical goal.
When in doubt, remember - white and black go with almost anything.

, This seems like a no-brainer, but it's easy to forget - different pictures will create different visual impressions in a given room. Unless you're going for an avant-garde, dissonant clash between your picture and the room it's hung in, try to match the picture to the purpose for the room. Classical landscape style paintings and portraits are great for living rooms, while smaller family photos are great for halls, staircases, bedrooms and bathrooms. Impressionistic paintings of fruit or cookware are an appetizing addition to kitchens. Use common sense - you know the impression you want your room to give visitors, so use pictures and paintings that help you achieve that impression.


Abstract paintings can be incredibly vivid additions to a room - however, if you plan to hang a painting that's nothing more than an assortment of shapes and colors, you might want to make sure the colors match the rest of the room's décor (see: How to Match Colors.)

, One of any room's biggest assets is its sense of space. A high ceiling can make you feel like you're in a chapel. Large windows can guide your sight toward the horizon. Don't let your pictures obstruct a room's natural sense of space! Too many pictures can give a wall a cluttered "" police evidence board"" feel.


Pictures on a wall should never compete for space - if you have to move old pictures around to make room for a new one, you may want to consider a new home for your pictures.
Many walls are best-suited by only one or two pictures. Or no images at all. If you've got great wallpaper, a killer rug, or an amazing centerpiece, don't be too hasty to distract attention with imposing collections of pictures.

, A large picture can make a cramped room seem larger. Similarly, pictures hung high on the wall will improve a room's dimensions by distracting attention from the imposing wall surfaces at the viewer's eye-level. For instance, a gorgeous print high on the wall of a cramped bathroom will lend the stuffy room a sense of dignity.


Use big pictures, if possible, but don't take up the entire wall space. Covering one of a cramped room's entire walls with one picture will have an overpowering effect.

, Big, spacious rooms present problems of their own. High, plain walls with widely-spaced pictures look like they belong in a modern art museum, not a family home. Balance the arrangement of your pictures so as not to leave any huge barren patches on your wall. Furniture can be a huge help here - tall bookcases and wardrobes take up lots of wall space.


If you've got an interesting wallpaper or even a monochrome painted wall, you can get away with more unused space when hanging your pictures. Plain, un-decorated walls commit the cardinal sin of making a room seem boxlike and cold.

, Furniture and wall art work together to form a room's sense of space. Coordinate them intelligently to make to the most of your living space. Try to place pictures places people will naturally look without interfering with the normal functions of the room. Small pictures are great for slim stretches of wall in a kitchen, but not if you can't open cabinets because the picture's frame is in the way. Pictures are great above corner chairs and tables fo a stately yet-lived in feel, but not at heights where people are likely to bang their heads on them. Use common sense - make note of your daily routine to get a sense of where your eyes spend most of their time.


Follow the two thirds rule - art placed above a piece of furniture should be at least two thirds as wide as the furniture itself.For instance, a ten foot wide sofa should have at least about six and a half feet of art above it. This rule applies to individual pictures as well as clusters of smaller pictures.

, For instance, many living rooms contain sets of couches facing each other so people can sit and talk. In this case, give your guests something to look at by placing pictures behind each couch (one designer recommends hanging pictures one palm width above the top of the couch.). In the kitchen, a few small photos in the corner above a breakfast nook table can liven up meals and serve as great conversation pieces when you're having guests over.

, A great picture or piece of artwork can be a source of pride, but it can also be a source of headaches if it simply won't stay put on the wall. Save yourself the hair-pulling that comes from constantly re-adjusting and re-hanging problem pictures by installing your picture right the first time. If you do, you'll also feel the savings in your wallet - when a picture falls out of the wall, the wall or picture can easily be damaged. For a detailed guide to picture-hanging, see our guide on hanging pictures professionally.


When hanging anything on your wall, it's best to place the nail in the stud - the sturdy piece of wood supporting the wall. For heavier pictures or pieces of art, this can be a necessity. However, because studs are only an inch or two thick and fairly spaced-out, they're often not exactly where you want to hang a picture. For dainty and medium-weight pictures, you can get away with hanging in the space between studs.
Whether you're hanging pictures off a stud or the drywall in between studs, drive the nail into the wall at a steep angle - 45 degrees or more.Doing this provides a much sturdier hold than a nail that's perpendicular to the wall - the are of contact between the nail and the wall is greater and the lever action of the picture on the nail is reduced.

, For many pictures, a single nail will suffice. However, there is more than one way to hang a picture. A variety of hooks, anchors, and other products exist for the express purpose of mounting art on your wall. Some items you might consider are:


Drywall hooks - small metal hooks designed to easily punch through drywall, providing a firm hold without a stud.
Heavy-duty wall anchors - a small plastic sheath is installed into the stud using a drill, then a screw (supporting your art) is driven into the sheath. For heavier items.
Toggle bolts - special screws with metal ""wings"" that open when they're driven into a wall, providing extra grip and hold.
Adhesive hanging strips - sticky adhesive patches that attach to the back of your picture so you can stick it directly to the wall. No nails required.

, If you hang a beautiful picture of your family on your wall, but you don't hang it so its edges are straight, guests won't notice your kids' adorable smiles - unfortunately, they'll notice the picture's two-and-a-half degree lean instead. Use a ruler to measure the picture's horizontal center, trying to align this spot with your nail as you loop the nail through the frame's hanging wire (you can make a tiny erasable mark with a pencil on the front of the picture to help you remember where its center is.) Once your picture is hung, use a level to make minor adjustments to find the picture's exact balance.


Modern high-tech tools offer new options for hanging your pictures with exact straightness. Try searching your hardware store for a laser level - they'll paint a perfectly-straight horizontal line on the wall with a laser that you can use to line your pictures up perfectly.

Choose the appropriate method to hang your artwork based on its size.,
Select your aesthetic style.,
Determine how it will affect the look of furniture in your space.",How to Arrange Artwork at Home1," Methods to display your art at home include hanging it, leaning it against the wall, or placing your artwork on top of a shelf. Determine how you want to display your art at home and utilize a venue that works with the quality and size of the art. For instance, larger and heavier pieces of art could be leaned against the wall, while lighter pieces of artwork can be matted or hung on the wall.


It's best to lean large, heavy pieces of art against the wall or your art may be knocked over or stepped on.
Use photo frames that can be propped up if you're placing your art on a shelf. You can also lean your art against the wall for medium sized pieces, but they may fall and break.
More expensive pieces of art should be framed and hung on the wall.
If you're prone to accidents, have small children or own a pet, hanging your art on the wall is not the best idea to keep it safe.Black and white photographs of family and friends can be placed on top of a shelf.
Prints or posters can be matted and then attached to the wall.;
, The easiest way to determine your preferred aesthetic is to simply choose art that you like. Think of how the art that you choose reflects your personality as well as the effect that the art will have the on space. Choose bright and expressive art to lighten up a dark room, or darker colored art to show your maturity and refinement.

Black and white photography can add a sense of refinement to your space.

, Objects like desks, tables, and couches can affect the way that you should arrange your art depending on where they are located.

Finish up.",How to Dry Mount a Print," There are many different brands of dry mounting paper available on the market today. The paper can be purchased in pre-cut packages or in rolls, depending on the size you are going for. The primary thing to consider when choosing a paper though, is whether or not it is acid-free and archival. Traditionally, dry mounting paper can cause bubbling and damage to prints. For a bit more money though, you can purchase specialty paper that won’t ruin your prints over time. Most dry mounting is also permanent, although there are some options that are removable.


Fotoflat is dry mounting paper that is removable with low heat after application. On the downside, if your print is exposed to sunlight or heat, it may remove itself from the backing on its own.
MT5 is a permanent dry mounting paper that requires high temperatures in order to adhere to the print. The con of this paper is that the necessary high temperatures may damage or burn the print.
ColorMount is a permanent dry mounting paper used specifically on resin-coated papers, but it has a very small range of adhesive temperatures. Too high will cause bubbles to form, while too low won’t make the paper stick.
Fusion 4000 is a permanent dry mounting plastic often considered superior to the other mounting papers, but when melted can become runny. As a result, some of the paper may transfer onto the front of the print, or the print may shift.;
, You can mount a print using dry mount paper to nearly any backing, although there are some made specifically for this purpose. Because dry mounting is permanent in nearly all cases, you need to be certain that you like the appearance of the backing you select. Visit a local art supply store to see the types of backing that are available, or make your own with thin sheets of wood or plastic.


If you plan to have the edges of the backing act as a frame, be sure that they are painted in a color you like prior to mounting the print.
Some dry mounting paper can be purchased in package-deals along with the backing board for your print.

, Decide if you are going to have your print bleed-mounted or border-mounted. Bleed-mounted is when the backing and print are exactly the same size, so there is no visible border created by the backing. Border-mounting is when the backing is slightly larger than the print, so as to create a border around the edge. Cut off all excess paper from your print in either case.

, Your dry mounting paper should be the exact same size, if not only slightly smaller, than the size of your print. If you need to adjust the size of the sheet or roll of dry mounting paper, layer your print over the top and outline it.


If you’re worried about getting the dry mounting paper the exact same size, measure it to be ⅛ inch short on every side. This way there won’t be any overlap and possible smearing of the heated paper.

, Although you can use a dry mounting press to dry mount your prints, they tend to be very expensive and not incredibly easy to get your hands on. If you’d rather take the frugal route, a regular clothing iron will work perfectly. Use one that doesn’t have a steam attachment or that allows you to turn the steam off, as any moisture used on the dry mounting paper and print will ruin it.


It is best to have a separate iron to use for dry mounting from your regular clothing iron, as one that you use on a regular basis is likely to be dirty or have scratches that could ruin your print.
Instead of purchasing a brand new clothing iron, look for one at a local thrift store and pay half the price. Just make sure the platen is clean and scratch-free so that you don’t damage your prints.

, Follow the package directions on your dry mounting paper to see what temperature is needed for the mounting process. Typically, this should range between 160–200 °F (71–93 °C). Turn on your iron and allow it to preheat while you begin getting your print prepared for mounting.

, Layer your print over your dry mounting paper and your chosen backing so that everything is centered. Make sure that none of the dry mounting paper is sticking out from under the print, as this could damage the front side of your print when heated.

, You will start heating the center of your print to dry mount it before you get to the edges, so keep your print in place by taping the edges with painters tape or masking tape. Make sure the print, paper, and backing are all secure before you begin dry mounting, because you won’t be able to move them back into place once you start.

, Although your print should withstand heat without damage, direct heat from the platen of the iron could scorch or bubble the ink or paper. Lay a piece of blotting paper over the top of the taped-in-place print, in order to act as a shield against damage., The heat from the iron will glue the three layers together, keeping them in place for the rest of the mounting process. Let the iron set (without moving it) on the center of the print for 3-5 minutes. When the print is firmly attached to the backing, you can move onto the next section.

, Follow the same practice as above by moving the iron to each of the corners and edges of the print, and allowing it to sit and heat the dry-mounting paper for 3-5 minutes. Moving the iron around or back-and-forth during this process will make it take longer for the dry-mounting process to complete, so just watch the paper to make sure it isn’t too hot without moving it.


Each time you are ready to move to a new corner, set the iron in the center and slide it out to the corner. This will remove any bubbles that might have formed under the print from the dry mounting paper.
Un-tape the sides of the print when you are ready to dry-mount that area. Be careful not to pull the print away from the freshly-mounted backing when you remove the tape.

, When your print is securely attached to the backing on all sides, then the dry mounting process is complete. Allow it to cool for several minutes, and then remove the paper. At this point, you are finished! Follow up with a picture frame for a truly completed look.

Arrange your artwork on top of a piece of butcher paper.,
Cut out the butcher paper around your photos.,
Tape your butcher paper to the wall.,
Evaluate your layout and rearrange it.,
Hang your art.",How to Arrange Artwork at Home2," Before you hang your artwork and create unnecessary screw or nail holes, you can lay it out on the ground to get a feeling for how it will look when finally hung. Lay down a large piece of disposable paper and lay your artwork over it. Configure your art by starting with the largest pieces and then arranging your smaller pieces around it. Envision how it will look on your wall and choose a configuration that you find aesthetically pleasing.


Rectangle, square, and diamond frames typically look best when hanging art.
Smaller pieces of art look best when grouped 1 to 2 inch (2.5 - 5 cm) apart from one another while larger pieces of art typically look best with a 3 inch (7.6 cm) border around them., Use a marker to make an outline around your artwork onto the paper. Remove your artwork once you are done and cut out the outlines you drew. You'll use these pieces of paper to act as a visualization of how your artwork will look on the wall.If you rearrange your artwork on the floor next to your sheet of paper, you can save your design so you don't forget where your pieces of art should go.

, Once you've finished cutting out all of your pieces, you can now hang it on the wall with scotch tape. It's possible that your layout will look very differently on the wall than it did on the floor. The centerpiece of your art arrangement should be about 5 feet (1.5 meters) tall, so it's eye level with most people. If you have high ceilings, you can opt to hang the art higher than usual.

, Take a couple of steps back and assess how your arrangement looks on your wall. If you're unsure, taking a break may allow your brain the rest it needs to evaluate the layout objectively.If you don't like something about it, move your pieces of paper around until the layout looks perfect.


Arranging the layout perfectly in this step will help you avoid drilling unnecessary holes when you hang your art.
If your floors are uneven, using a level may help you line up your artwork.

, Replace your pieces of paper with the artwork that you intend on hanging. Mark where you want the art to hang with a pencil. Hang your art on your wall using a nail or other mounting method.


Popular mounting methods include using a wall anchor, a nail, or a hanging hook.
When hanging larger and heavier artwork, you may need to use a drill to drive larger anchors into your wall studs. "

Use the same frames and matting.,
Determine if you want symmetry or asymmetry.,
Create a theme.",How to Arrange Artwork at Home3," Different styles and colors of frames will throw off your arrangements cohesion. Use frames that have a similar style, size, and thickness.If you have a bunch of mismatched frames, a cheap and easy solution is to paint them all the same color.Matting is the material that's used behind the photo, and should also have a uniform tone, though it doesn't always need to be the same color. Your artwork should maintain a uniform color across your different pieces.


If you want to save money you can paint mismatched frames the same color.
Take a look at the dominant colors in your artwork and choose a mat that shares the same colors. Typically artwork has a focal point and your mat should be the same color as the focal point of the artwork.
Use high-contrast mat colors to add drama to a set of artwork., Hung art can either be symmetrical or asymmetrical but should be consistent wherever you are arranging it. Symmetry is when your art corresponds to size, shape, and spacing in relative position to a center line on the x-axis.When you reach symmetry, your arranged artwork will look centered and balanced. If you have various sized frames or art, it may be a better idea to create an asymmetrical look. Asymmetry is also useful when hanging abstract art.To hang your art symmetrically, either imagine or draw a center line horizontally on your wall, parallel with the floor. Hang your pieces centered on that line. This is much easier to achieve when all of your art is the same size.To hang your art asymmetrically, imagine or draw a center line and vary the height and distance of each piece of art about the line.

, The way that you group your hanging artwork is important. Try to group art that shares a similar aesthetic or theme among your collection. For instance, you can arrange family photos together, art that shares a similar style, or black and white only or color only photography. This will give your art arrangement a deeper feeling of cohesion.


Your artwork should be a representation of who you are or what you like. Try to achieve that by using pieces that you feel represent you.

The idea is that by facing the entranceway, you are prepared, and if your back is against a wall, it is covered and supported by a mountain. You also want to make sure that you are not positioned between the door and a window where draught of chi usually exists.;
, Never place your desk in front of a window where you can be distracted by the view and your chi may be drained from the room.

, For this reason, your desk should be in good condition and organized. In essence, it should mirror the success your wish to achieve for your business.

, A chair is your mountain and therefore, should support you, help instill concentration, and soothe your chi. Just like your desk, it needs to be in good condition.

Specific spots in the room and specific objects have best possible energies, and the map helps you determine those spots. There is simple version of the map with just the names of the sections, and a more complicated version which gives examples of what all is represented by that section.Align the bottom portion of the map with the door/entryway to the room. Arrange the things that apply to each section on the map in the proper place in your room. In the lower left, place books which represent wisdom. In the middle right, which is “child” and represents creativity, place a musical instrument you play or a place where you can paint.;
, It will take time and careful consideration, but if you want to apply feng shui properly, you need to give the process the proper time.

, This map is a guide for what parts of the room are best for certain objects. It’s very important that you do your best to include something for every section because feng shui is all about creating balance. So if you load one section of the room, maybe the wealth section with ledgers and your piggy bank, but you neglect another section, you will upset the balance of the room.Maybe you don’t have a specific object, or enough space, to place something in every section. Something you can do instead is write down on a piece of paper something you care about which represents that or something you desire that represents that section. This can be a stand-in for the actual object.
It’s also important to note that sometimes due to room or house layouts, parts of the map may be missing or partial. You can symbolically apply the feng shui to the wall where the missing section would be. Just make your intent for the missing section clear when you place something there.

, If you have broken objects around the house, especially things that you use frequently, they are likely to cause you frustration, which leads to negative energy in your home. To counteract this, it’s highly advised that you fix things as soon as they break to promote calm and good energy., The five elements of life are fire, water, earth, wood, and metal. Good feng shui in any room or home means having a mix of these elements. Most rooms will have a few of these already, depending on the structure of the room and furniture present. Look around your room and see what elements are already present and consider ways to add the remaining. Candles are the easiest way to add fire to any room.Faucets already bring running water, but in rooms without faucets, consider buying a small fountain which can constantly be running water.
Plants are a great way to add earth to a room.
If you can’t easily incorporate something physically made of the element, hanging a picture that represents the element is a good alternative.

, The door to the home is where the energy flows in, so make sure you use the front door as much as you can. If you typically enter through a door besides the main one, consider purposefully using the front door a few times a week to keep good energy flowing in. It’s hard to maintain good energy throughout the house if the door is always closed.

, If you are having trouble understanding the principles of feng shui, or your particular home is not cooperating with your endeavors, consider hiring a professional who can give you advice on how to apply feng shui to your specific living space."

Know who you are.,
Be familiar with your vision.,
Don't do it alone.,
Keep your family unit strong.,
Define your wealth.,
Use helping friends.,
Be sure, you know your next steps.,
Remember that Home is very important source of energy.",How to Feng Shui Your Life," ""Know Thyself"" is very old wisdom, not coming only from old China, but also from Ancient Greece. Step Number One is always the same: know yourself. If you do not know yourself you do not know how to balance your life.


Each person has certain potential and talents. You must know them. Because your life way is using only your strengths - talents. Everything else in your life must be in balance with your talents. That is the must for happy life.
As soon as you know yourself, your talents, your life journey will show up. You will know what is your life mission. You mission is given by using your talents. If your talent is painting, your mission could be: giving joy with nice paintings.;
, Every mission must have its goal - vision. Your vision must be in harmony with your mission. If your mission is giving joy with nice paintings, your goal might be: the most famous painter of joyful paintings

, You cannot be alone on your life journey. Human beings are not born to be alone. Therefore you must select the right partner for your journey. You and your life partner must have the same journey and the same vision. Then your partnership will be in harmony for all your life and your partnership will be happy. Therefore be sure you and your partner have the same journey and vision.

, Another very important harmony is within your family. Your family is very strong and important base for your success. Therefore make sure you have nice and pleasant relationship with all your family members, especially with your parents and kids.

, Wealth is another important part of happy life. You must define your wealth: what it is - is it money in your bank, is it nice house, is it boat, is it collection of paintings, is it nice little garden? You must clearly define it. But be careful. Your wealth must be in harmony with your journey and your life vision.


Also it must be something realistic, something you can really achieve. If you choose something you do not have enough energy for, it will destroy you. So select your wealth clearly and carefully.

, Life journey is not struggle. It must be joy and happiness. And as you do not have talents for everything, you must delegate. You must have people around you to help you with things you do not have talent for. Because if you something you do not have talent for, you waste your energy. Then your health gets worse and you make your life shorter.

, Nest steps are your future. All your next steps must help you go forward on your life journey and towards to your vision. If your next steps are not moving you ahead, then you do not need them. Therefore all new things, people and activities must be in harmony with your journey and your vision.


Remember, you must take care of all new things. E.g. you buy a new dog. You must take care of it. Taking care uses your energy. So make sure, your dog gives the energy back to you. And this energy comes with joy.
When you enjoy being with your dog, you get energy from it. If not, you waste it. So everything new you bring to your life must be joy for you and in balance with your journey and vision.

, It has the same energy as your body. Therefore the quality of your home influences quality of your body, your health. Therefore make sure your home is in harmony not only with you, but again with your journey and vision.


If your home is in harmony, it gives you lots of energy and support. Do not forget: you spend min 8 hours a day at home (just because you sleep there). But most people do not just sleep at home, they eat there, spend time with family, watch TV etc.

So it may very well be, you spend half of your life at home. So imagine how big influence it has. Make sure your home Feng Shui is right and correct.

Get rid of any clutter.",How to Feng Shui Your Bedroom," The best Feng Shui headboards are the ones that are solid and made from wood, or the upholstered ones, as they have a very good combination of solid, but also gentle and supporting Feng Shui energy for you and your bedroom. While you are drifting off to sleep, your body is going into an extra busy energy repair work on many levels. Subconsciously, your head needs good backing, protection and support, just like your back needs it when you are sitting in a chair for extended periods of time.;
, There are a variety of mattresses on the market, choose wisely and invest in the one that will promote best sleep and relaxation. The better you sleep at night, the better your health during the day, this is really simple. Be mindful of good Feng Shui and do not buy used mattresses - you never know what energy they have accumulated from previous owners.

, To allow for a balanced Feng Shui energy flow under the bed, you need to have your bed at a reasonable height above the floor level. Generally, the beds that have built-in storage drawers underneath to help you with storage solutions are considered bad Feng Shui beds. Why? Because the energy needs to circulate around your body when you sleep, which is not possible if the space underneath the bed is blocked.

, Place the bed in the area further from the door or diagonally from the door, but not in line with the door. In other words, you want to be able to see the door while in bed, but not be aligned with the door. Be it the bedroom door, the door to the balcony/patio, the bathroom door or your closet doors, you do not want your bed in line with any of the doors in your bedroom, or too much chi will flow towards the bed. Ideally, the bed can be diagonally positioned from the door, jutting out from the opposite corner. Having your bed positioned too close to the door can lead you to get startled by surprises that may come your way. The further you are from the door, the more prepared you'll be for what may come. This is the same reason why the bedroom should be as far from the door as possible.However, ideally, when you wake up, the door should be in your direct line of vision, or close to it, so you feel that you have control over your life.

, In addition to a good headboard, you always want to have a solid wall behind your bed. When you sleep under the window, your personal energy tends to get weaker in time, as it has neither proper support, nor protection.

, Place two nightstands on either side of the bed to create balance while you sleep. Ideally, you can also place the same lamp on both nightstands, to add some soft lighting to your bedroom. This balance is important for keeping you centered, and especially for maintaining equality in a relationship if you share the bedroom with your partner.


Ideally, the nightstands should be round instead of square to cut the chi energy that may be directed toward you, which can also be thought of as the ""poison arrows.""

, Ideally, you should move your desk and television out of your bedroom, so the bedroom truly becomes a place where you can rest and relax. However, we all have limited space, so if you do have a television or a desk in your room, position it as far from your bed as possible to not get in the way of the bed's positive energy. If you can, drape a light scarf or blanket over the TV or desk, or even cover it up with a Japanese folding closet to create even more space.

, If these mirrors are fixtures that you can't get rid of, then drape some fabric over them. Left exposed, they are thought to disturb your sleep. In general, you should avoid having mirrors in your bedroom, especially if you're sharing it with a romantic partner, because they may open up a space for infidelity. Mirrors are also too energetic for such a restful space.

, A beam may create feelings of pressure that can disrupt your sleep. If you have no other options, cover the beam with fabric or hang 2 bamboo flutes from the beam with the mouthpieces pointed downward. This will help block some of the unwanted energy coming from above the bed. The idea is that you don't want to feel threatened in your sleep.

, Also, don't hang up pictures of water or place an aquarium in your room. These could invite possible financial loss or robbery. Keep your fish tank or paintings of water or rivers out of the bedroom if you want to have the best possible Feng Shui.

, Plants are thought to possess too much yang, which creates too much energy and activity for you to get the rest that you need. If you have no other place to put your plants, try to keep them out of your line of vision when you're on the bed., The Chi can't circulate, which means possible disturbances in your intimate life. If your bed is up against a wall, then one partner will have to sleep on the inside, becoming literally ""trapped"" in the relationship.

, Television creates an unhealthy magnetic field which may disrupt your sleep, strain your relationship with your partner or bring a third party into the bedroom. If you have to keep it in the bedroom, then try to cover it with a scarf when you're not using it. If you're really serious about it, hide the TV in the closet when you're not using it, or place it on a shelf that can lock up, hiding the TV when it's not in use.

, You can keep a few books in your room if you read to put yourself to sleep, but too many books can make you feel overwhelmed in the space. Your bedroom is a place for rest and relaxation, and if you have too many books there, it will be too much like a place for work. Too many books in your resting space can also be overwhelming., Buy a separate bed and put the mattress and pillows on the new bed, then remove the fold-in bed and install shelves on the empty wall.


If your room is small and you must use a fold-in bed, you can attach feet to your bed and block up the empty wall.

, A balanced Feng Shui Fire element in your space will bring a supporting energy in all your career efforts and will help you achieve recognition. It will also help you invite passion and romance into your life and your bedroom. The Feng Shui fire element colors are:

, At the end of the day, the most important thing is that you can feel calm in your own bedroom and to get a good night's sleep. Having light, soft, and pastel colors throughout your bedroom can add to your serenity and peace of mind. Here are some colors you can use:


Light blue
Light pink
Light green
Light purple

, Your bedroom should be your sanctuary. It should be an escape from the stress of your everyday life, whether those include your work, your children, your health, or your friendships. It should not be a place where you throw all of the extra things you have no place for. On the contrary, it should be your oasis in the middle of a desert, a place you can come to when you want to rest -- or just when you need a break., For the best Feng Shui, you should avoid bright, garish lights, or ceiling lights over your bed. Instead, have desk lamps with soft light, and try to get as much natural light as you can from the window. This will make you feel more serene and at ease than harsh lights that are too bright., If you can, try to avoid placing your bed between the window and a door, or you'll be in the middle of the ""draught"" of chi running between these two places. If you can't avoid it, just make sure you have nice, pleasant curtains to block some of the bad energy. You should also avoid sleeping facing the window, if you can, or your sleep won't be as restful.

, Hang up images of calming scenes from nature, or other places that inspire you. Pick some neutral scenery, an image that motivates you to achieve your dreams, or something else that puts you in a calm and peaceful frame of mind. Anything too graphic, gory, disturbing, or just disturbing does not belong in your bedroom. Place the most inspiring image across from your line of sight in the bed, so that it's the first thing you see when you wake up., Try to have equal space on either side of your bed and other furniture. A person should be able to walk around as easily around one side of the room as the other, within reason. Of course, a piece of furniture may add some inequality, but in general, you should avoid letting most of the stuff in the bedroom clutter over to one side, or you'll create discord in your most important room.

, Go through your closet and drawer and remove all of the clothes you haven't worn within the last year. Donate these clothes or pass them on to a friend or relative if they can still be worn. Even though you may not see the old clothes, keeping them in your bedroom may prevent you from embracing new opportunities.

, You can have a few key family photos in your bedroom, but avoid a clutter of photos of people everywhere, or you will feel like you're being watched and will get overwhelmed. The same goes for religious figures., Keep your bedroom as spare and simple as possible. Don't add extra chairs, lamps, or pictures to your bedroom if you're not sure whether or not they are really necessary. The more stuff you have in there, the more difficult it may be to find balance.

, To have optimal Feng Shui in your bedroom, you have to get rid of any extra papers, trash, old trinkets, silly photos, useless gifts, or really just anything you don't really need in there. If you have too much sentimental attachment to some of the items, you can put them in storage or another room, but work on minimizing the stuff you really need in your bedroom. Having a spare and uncluttered bedroom will lead to an uncluttered and fulfilling life.

Use light and lively colors liberally.,
Build contrast.,
Explore your lighting options.,
Choose the right light bulbs.,
Make your basement look more like the rest of your house.,
Open it up.,
Get some plants.",How to Make a Windowless Room Appear Light," Large surfaces in the basement should be light in color to brighten things up. Walls, for example, should be painted white or warm shades such as yellows, light reds and oranges. Select light or brightly-colored rugs or tiles, as well. Even large pieces of furniture can make a difference in how bright the room appears, so go for warm, vibrant patterns on sofas and chairs.;
, Select some darker pieces of furniture (end tables, for example) or dark wall hangings to contrast with the light colors of the large surfaces. Select dark moldings for walls and ceilings. These measures bring out the brightness of the lighter colors and impart a more natural-feeling shadow effect.

, Lighting that hangs down from the ceiling is fine for other rooms, but in a basement it poses two problems. First, many basements have low ceilings, so hanging lights can make it difficult to get around. Second, hanging lights take up space and make the room look smaller. To remedy this, select recessed lighting in the ceiling, and complement that with wall sconces, table lamps and floor lamps--the indirect lighting will light up the ceiling and help get rid of that cave-like atmosphere.

, First, those old fluorescent bulbs are out. Soft white incandescent bulbs will make the lighting seem more natural. An even better option is to use full-spectrum bulbs, which cost a bit more than regular incandescent bulbs, but which mimic the sun's natural light.

, If your basement has exposed concrete walls or wood paneling, install drywall and paint it to give the room a more finished appearance. If you have suspended ceilings and exposed boards cover them up with drywall and paint, as well. Keep in mind that drywall is only usable if your basement is completely dry, year round. If your basement is damp or wet, drywall is a poor choice because it tends to soak up water and support mold growth. You should look for waterproof, mold proof basement wall and ceiling systems that will not absorb moisture and rot overtime. You may not be able to cover all exposed pipes and duct work, but you can paint such fixtures to match the rest of the room, or creatively hide them with furniture, plants or wall hangings.

, If you have unnecessary columns, pillars or walls in your basement, consider tearing them out(Consult a structural engineer if uncertain of load-bearing). The more open the floor plan, the brighter the space will appear.

, Plants can make any room healthier by removing toxins and adding oxygen. They can also give the room a brighter mood. Of course, not all plants can survive in a basement. Visit the related wikiHow on choosing an office plant for some tips.

Maximize the light from existing windows.,
Use white or light colors throughout the room to reflect natural light that comes in.,
Mirrors across from a window will reflect the light into different parts of the room.,
Change a solid exterior door for one with windows.,
Install a new or expanded window.,
Sliding glass doors are a wonderful way to open up a room with light if you have a nice view (yard, scenery, deck or patio) to look out on.,
Consider installing a tubular skylight.",How to Increase the Amount of Natural Light in Your Home," Pull curtains back and shades up during the day. Do not block window light with furniture either in front of the window or close to the sides of the window (especially avoid thick, dark furniture next to a window).;
, White painted trim around the window helps too.

, Experiment with different positions before you install anything permanently. You can mirror tile a whole wall if you don't mind the look - this is especially helpful for small or dark rooms.

, There are many choices at home-building stores, including high security glass doors, that might work for you depending on your budget, security needs and tastes.

, New windows can pay for themselves through heat gain if they are on the south exterior wall of a room. Do some research on the viability of passive solar heating in your area.

, You can replace a regular window with sliding glass doors, or have a hole cut in the wall. These are another possible source of passive solar heat gain, which you should read up on if you are considering this step, or hire a green architect.

, Regular skylights are fairly expensive to put in and frequently create problems with rainwater leakage. Tubular skylights reflect light through a tube via a small opening (18 inches wide) in the roof and only require minor installation costs. There is a product called a ""solar tile"" for clay tile roofs and the budget-minded do it yourself craftsman could install a water bottle skylight as used in Brazil.

Make the most of whites.,
Use blue and gray-blue tones.,
Consider pastels.,
Apply stripes.,
Don't forget the floors.",How to Make a Small Home Look Bigger Using the Right Colors," The best color for opening up a room is bright white, so try painting this on all the walls. Neutral colors such as this give the impression that the walls are further away than they actually are.


If you want the room to be slightly warmer, try adding a few tints of your favorite color.
If so much white really isn't your thing, there are similar alternatives such as beige or light gray, which also work well. You could also try yellow, which is great for creating space due to its ability to reflect light, just like white paint.;
, Blues and gray-blues on the walls allow all the other colors in the room to stand out on the neutral backdrop, handily shifting the focus to the furnishings rather than the room itself. Always try to keep to one or two main colors that flow from room to room, and certainly don't use more than three.

, Pastels, and light natural tones are excellent for creating an airy feeling in small bedrooms, bathrooms, and hallways. You can bring the walls and woodwork together by painting both in colors from the same family, creating a light expanse. Use matte on the walls, and gloss or eggshell on the wood, so that it is not too flat.

, Stripes can completely change the shape of a room. Narrow vertical stripes in white or soft pastel will make a low ceiling seem much higher. You can of course simply paper the walls, or be more adventures and paint the stripes on.


To make the room look longer, simply turn the stripes horizontal, and only use 2 or 3. This works especially well with a light colored backing.

, It's not only the wall colors that affect the sense of space, but the floors too. It is best to use one carpet color throughout the house. Try painting the skirting board in a similar tone to break down the boundary where wall meets floor.


In a small bedroom, use a solid neutral carpet, or be a little more adventurous and use one with horizontal stripes to widen it.

Remove clutter.,
Position your bed with feet toward the door.,
Place a chest or bureau opposite the bed.,
Utilize bedroom windows.",How to Apply Feng Shui to a Room2," Feng shui values simplicity, so reducing the overall amount of stuff in your room is a must to enhance the energy and balance of the room. Energy is able to flow more freely in open space without clutter, so to maximize energy flow in your bedroom you need to reduce the amount of stuff you have there.Carefully go through the room and consider what is there that doesn’t need to be. Do you keep piles of work papers? These will create negative energy. Do you have exercise equipment or multiple storage containers? These reduce the amount of open space in the room.
The best balance will be achieved in a bedroom by having more open space and less unneeded stuff crowding the room.

, The position of the bed is important to create the right energy that promotes peace and restful sleep. Locate your bed diagonally across the room from the door with the foot of the bed toward the door. In this case, diagonally is meant to express that the bed should not be directly in front of the door, rather at an angle from the door whenever possible. Make sure the headboard is against a wall to anchor the bed. You also want to have space to walk on both sides of the bed, so don’t push it up close against a wall.This positioning is one that promotes protection because you are able to easily see what comes through the door. You will be more at ease knowing that nothing can come through the door without you knowing.
If it is possible, place a large rug under the bed to help ground the bed’s energy.
It is also good to have one night stand on each side of the bed to help balance it.

, Since the bed is such a large item, you need to help balance the room out by placing something of comparable size on the opposite wall of the room.This balancing piece of furniture does not need to be the same size. The effect will be achieved as long as it’s somewhat large. If you are going to have a dresser in the room, this is ideal for balancing out the bed.

, Windows are a way that energy can flow into your house through sunlight, but it can’t do this if the windows are always covered. Open curtains during the day, and consider leaving the windows open to allow for the maximum flow of energy.Use soft, ruffled curtains rather than plastic, wooden or metal blinds. If possible, use wood rings to hang curtains with.
Close the curtains at night to keep out the dark which brings negative energy.
Clean your windows fairly often to make sure that energy from outside can flow through easily. Dirty or smeared windows hinder the energy flow.

Fill negative space above cabinets.,
Fix the leaky faucet.,
Clean out cabinets regularly.,
Show love to your stove.",How to Apply Feng Shui to a Room3," Check your kitchen cabinets to see if they go all the way to the ceiling or if there is space above them. Empty space above cabinets causes energy to get stuck there and stagnate. You need to counteract this waste of energy by filling the space with lively positive energy.Bring life with leafy, green potted plants. Don’t crowd the space, but place enough to ensure the space is well balanced.
Install lighting to drive away dark energy.
Place beloved objects on the cabinets that create positive energy.

, It’s a common problem to have a kitchen faucet that leaks, but you may not realize how this negatively affects your house’s feng shui. Water is the symbol for wealth, so a drippy faucet literally means that your wealth is slowly draining away. If you notice that your faucet is leaking, takes steps immediately to get it fixed.Check out this article for DIY faucet fixes.
At the very least, if you can’t get the leak fixed, make sure the water drips into a pitcher or basin so it can still be used rather than going down the drain. You could use this to water the plants on top of the cabinets.

, Because feng shui values open space and minimalism, it is important to sort through your cabinets (and pantries) on occasion to get rid of things that you are not using. Utensils, appliances, and food that are not being used are only collecting energy and wasting it. If you know you don’t use something very often, consider whether it is really necessary or not.Getting rid of old food frequently is important because your kitchen is the source of health in your home and old food does not promote good health.

, If the kitchen represents health in your home, then the stove is the center of that health because it prepares your food. Keeping your stove clean keeps the energy of the food positive, but a dirty and grimy stove reduces the energy of the food which ultimately reduces your own energy.


Use all of the stove's burners regularly to maintain the overall strength of the stove’s energy.
Move your trash can away from the stove to keep the negative energy of the garbage away from the positive energy of the fresh food you prepare on the stove.
When you face the stove, you may be facing away from the entrance to your kitchen. Because of this, it is possible for someone to come up behind you without you knowing it. This is bad energy because it makes you restless and you can’t focus your attention on the food. To counteract this, hang a mirror over the stove to give yourself a view behind you.

Select a color scheme based on a prominent piece in the room.,
Pair complementary colors.",How to Choose Living Room Colors," Ambiance refers to the tone, character, and atmosphere of an environment.Ambiance can strongly affect the mood that a room imbues. Think about the role you want the room to play in your life.Among the most important factors to consider are the following:


What time of day you tend to use the living room?
Are you hoping for the room to energize or relax you?
Do you usually allow sunlight in through the windows?;
, There are certain color combinations meant for supremely sunny spaces. If the living room will be occupied during the day and is particularly well-lit by the sun, color the walls with saturated jewel tones or earthy shades.Bright tones, like a sapphire blue or emerald green look great in the sun.
Similarly, dark earthy shades only work in spaces with a lot of natural light, since the light prevents the living room from looking too dark.
Note that these colors tend to be overpowering in lower light, and should not be used in rooms that are not well lit.

, If, on the other hand, your living room doesn’t get a good amount of sunlight, or you’ll spend more time in your living room during the evening, there are certain colors than can help brighten the space up.


Ivory and buttercup yellow can make a living room that does not receive much light look brighter, especially when these colors are prominently used., A similar, though distinct aspect to consider is a room’s warmth. Deep reds, burnt oranges, and nearly all shades of gold and brown can be used to create a cozy, glowing space that is especially appropriate for a living room.These combinations are great for living rooms that are used both during the day and in the evening, as they emphasize comfort over energy, but aren’t too dark for daytime use.
Avoid using bright shades of red or orange as dominant or secondary colors, though, since these colors tend to carry too much energy and may seem overwhelming in excess.

, On the other hand, blues, cool violets, and grays are especially useful in creating a calm atmosphere capable of soothing you, your family, and your guests.


If your living room tends to have occupants predominantly in the evening, cooling tones may be best, especially if you tend to relax in this space.

, This is another extremely important aspect to consider. One of the most certain ways that color can impact the feel of a room is by manipulating your sense of the room’s size.Light colors open a room up, while darker colors make a space look more enclosed.


If you have a small living room, you can make it appear larger by filling it with lighter hues.
Make the same room look even cozier with a medium to dark shade.

, Regardless of the colors you choose, it’s helpful to plan how much space each color will account for. As a rule of thumb, 60 percent of your living room should be a dominant color, 30 percent should be a secondary color, and 10 percent should be an accent color.


Choose dominant and secondary colors you're especially comfortable with. Know that your dominant color choice will greatly impact the room's feel. Don't choose a dominant or secondary color that you are not absolutely sure of.
Only use bold colors as accent colors. A punch of powerful color can do wonders to the energy and character of a space. Make this sort of impact with your accent color. For a sense of vitality, make your accent color the brightest of your palette.
Ensure that all three colors coordinate well with one another. Group your chosen colors together in a small trial area before committing to painting and decorating the whole room.

, For instance, if you have modern furniture and decorations, you will probably be better off with a modern color scheme of white, black, and gray than you would be with a traditional color scheme filled with rich hues.


If your furnishings share a color scheme, complimenting that color with a secondary or accent color will tie the room together quite well.

, White is the safest bet there is.While some may prefer a more interesting dominant color, there’s no denying that all-white or mostly-white color schemes can create a very clean, crisp living room.

, Contemporary colors include subtle, muted shades of natural colors that can help create a calm atmosphere while still allowing you to inject a bit of personal style into the space.Light browns and soft grays can readily serve as dominant colors, and slightly darker shades of the same colors make great secondary and accent colors.

, One popular approach when updating a living space is to make it feel more modern. Certain colors combinations help facilitate a more modern feel. In general, create a modern living room by using neutral colors.


White acts as the dominant color in most modern living rooms. Black or gray make great secondary colors.You can also add an intense, bright hue as an accent, such as a bright green or fire engine red.

, Traditional living room designs use deep shades of elegant colors to invoke an almost formal classiness in your living room. Use neutral colors for walls and other dominant swaths of space, but weave in secondary and accent hues in rich shades of red, blue, or brown., A transitional color scheme combines the colors commonly found in both contemporary and traditional spaces.Incorporate contemporary shades of tan and vanilla with rich hues like maroon or navy blue.


Taking a transitional approach is a great option, as it imbues a sense of both fun and class.

, In order to know how to balance colors, you should have a general idea of where they are in relation to one another on the wheel. Typically, complementary colors—colors found on polar opposite ends of the wheel—coordinate well with one another., If you feel uncertain about how a prospective color scheme might look, look at paint cards, swatches of fabric, or other color samples side by side. Bring swatches and paint cards home to your living room, and hold them up in the spaces you’re considering using them.


Take advantage of this mini test run before you invest time and money in paint and furnishings.
Paint cards are readily available at both hardware stores and paint suppliers, while fabric swatches can be found at furniture stores. Either can be sent directly to your home by manufacturers.

, Instead of trying to create a living room that looks impressive, create a living room that feels comfortable. It’s your living room after all, and should be decorated according to what you like. Further, the more comfortable you feel in it, the happier you’ll be showing it off.

, If you’re looking for inspiration, look no further than the objects you intend to keep in the room. Prominent pieces of art or furniture can greatly complement (and be complemented by) the color scheme you choose. Planning for what you intend to have in the room will also ensure that your color scheme coordinates with the most noticeable pieces in your living room.


If you have a patterned couch, for instance, snatch colors from that pattern to create your overall color scheme.
If you have a piece of artwork that you want to dominate the space, play to its prominence with the colors you choose. You might match your accent color to a prominent color featured in the piece, for instance.

, Since complementary colors are effectively opposites, they play off of one another in order to make one another ""pop"" or stand out.Examples of complimentary colors include; red and green, orange and blue, or yellow and violet.


Due to the vibrant nature of complementary colors, you may want to consider using muted shades of the colors you favor. Bright shades of complementary colors have a tendency to assault the eyes, but muted shades can add a pleasant buzz of energy to your living room.

Identify the work areas in your kitchen.,
Select the areas that are directly above your work stations.

,
Install lighting fixtures above those areas.",How to Choose the Proper Lighting for a Kitchen1," Task lighting are direct beams of light that illuminate a designated work area. These could include prep stations for making coffee or using the cutting board, sinks, desks or tables.;
,, Some people use halogen bulbs, as they produce a light glow, but they aren't too harsh. Others use fluorescent bulbs in all fixtures because they are energy efficient.


A popular choice for task lighting is under cabinet lights. These can be installed when you get new cabinets, or they can be screwed into place later. If you like this idea and you are getting new cabinetry, make sure it leaves enough room at the bottom to shed light on your work area.






Another choice is pendant lights that hang from the ceiling. Many beautiful modern fixtures hang from a single chord to shed light on an area. You can adjust this lighting to the right height over the sink or stove.






A third option is to recess lights into the ceiling, directly above work stations. They give broad, even lighting to your work. This is best done with a home or kitchen remodel because the electrician must wire them extensively into the walls.

Choose energy efficient bulbs.",How to Choose the Proper Lighting for a Kitchen3," Accent lighting draws the eyes to a certain painting or architectural element in your kitchen. For example, if you have a beautiful collection of china arranged on an open cupboard, you may want to highlight it.


Consider lighting above your cabinets if you have high ceilings. This will give a classy tone to the room and make it look large and warm.







, Many of these can be installed onto the ceiling.

, Accent lighting usually requires more smaller bulbs than the larger task and accent lights, because they have less of an influence on your everyday tasks.

Use lighting and decoration for a first impression.,
Make sure to size the decorative fixture to the space.,
Remember that stairways and halls must have good general lighting for safety.,
Use matching wall sconces to complement the hanging foyer fixture.",How to Choose the Right Lighting for Each Room1," The foyer conveys the first impression of a home's interior. Center a traditional chandelier, contemporary pendant, or transitional close-to-ceiling fixture in your hallway to provide basic illumination and create a welcoming atmosphere.


Make your artwork come to life and illuminate it with halogen light from track or adjustable recessed down-lighting. Mirrors also add a special decorative touch to a foyer.;
, Not all foyers can accommodate a large chandelier, so make sure the size proportions are correct. Likewise, if you have a larger space, you'll need a larger fixture. If you'll be able to view the fixture from above, make sure to select a foyer chandelier or pendant that looks attractive from second story viewing.

, To prevent accidents, stairs should be lit from top to bottom with switches in both places. For safety in hallways, place lighting fixtures every 8 to 10 feet (2.4 to 3.0 m). Tie in the fixtures you choose by matching your foyer chandelier or pendant with close-to-ceiling fixtures for hallways and smaller chain hung fixtures for stairways.

, Always mount a sconce above eye level (approximately 66"" from the center of the fixture to the floor) so that the lamp source is not visible.

",How to Bring More Outside Light Into a House," Do this every single day without fail. It soon becomes a ritual rather than a hassle. If you've gotten used to sitting around in the dark, try to remind yourself that you're no vampire and that humans need light and fresh air streaming in.;
, Dull and dirty windows block a good flow of light. They're also unsightly, so do yourself a favor and wash them. There's no need for expensive window cleaners; vinegar and newspaper will do the trick.

, If your budget stretches a little more, consider renovating. Installing larger windows or French doors can help bring in a lot of light, especially into rooms where there are inadequate windows already. Also think about adding windows to a side of the house that has none; this can make an amazing difference.

, If new windows are not a real possibility or won't make much of a difference, consider whether a skylight might improve the light stream for your home. Skylights come in a wide variety of types, suitable for different roofs, rooms, and budgets. Even places that don't seem like they could ever be lit by natural sun can benefit from clever skylights that force light through twisty pipes.

, Light colored paint can reflect the light and radiate it out through the room more than dark colors. Dark walls tend to soak up light, adding to the sensation of dreariness. Fine for a cozy den but probably not for the family room and kitchen.

, Thick, opaque, square glass bricks can make great designer walls that allow light to brighten an area. Such a wall can be a useful internal divider where you don't want the sense of light to be broken but you'd like a division of some solidity.

, Look for blinds that can be kept down for the sake of privacy but that continue to let light through them. While these blinds are often dark in color, they are amazing in their ability to still let the light through, while you can watch TV unnoticed inside!

, Some places in the world receive more sunlight than others. If you're always suffering from seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a move to a sunnier clime might improve your outlook on life. While this is a big change, it could be the one you need. When purchasing a new home, be sure to check it for its light quality at various times of the day.

A variety of different types of lighting fixtures will work for both your general lighting and accent lighting needs.

, This is preferred because the light source is concealed. Close-to-ceiling fixtures, wall sconces, and interior lamps are also excellent choices and provide ample lighting. These fixtures are not only decorative pieces, but are ideal sources of task lighting for reading or playing games.


While traditional wall fixtures with arms remain the most popular form of wall lighting, more contemporary wall sconces are gaining popularity for accent lighting.

, Interior lamps are also a great choice.


When table space is limited, wall lamps are a good alternative.

Create a focal point with lighting.,
Use a chandelier or pendant for general lighting.,
Add accent lighting to the room, too.",How to Choose the Right Lighting for Each Room3," Your dining table is in place, chairs are pushed in, and the table is set. The only thing remaining to complete the picture is the center piece, your light fixture. This lighting fixture is the focal point of your room, so it needs to express your own personal style, while still satisfying general lighting needs. Whether your dining and entertaining style is casual and laid back, or is generally more formal, choose a fixture that reflects you.

, Both fixtures are excellent sources of lighting and are sure to set the tone of your dining room. Recessed wall washers can also provide additional light while helping to create an illusion of a larger room space.


When hanging a chandelier, make sure that the chandelier is 6"" to 12"" smaller than the narrowest side of the table. The bottom of the pendant or chandelier should be approximately 30"" above your table.
Chandeliers with 200 to 400 overall wattage provide abundant illumination for a dining room.
Consider a chandelier with an integral downlight for additional light on the table.

, Aim adjustable halogen recessed fixtures on the table and chandelier. This will provide additional light on the table, and will also bring out the brilliance of the chandelier. Consider companion sconces on either side of a china cabinet or hutch. Cabinet lighting mounted inside valences and cabinets also adds drama.

Realize that the kitchen is often the busiest part of the house.,
Go with decorative fluorescent fixtures centered over a workspace.,
Use under cabinet lighting to help prevent shadows on the counters, while adding critical light to the workspace.,
Illuminate your special home objects, architectural detail, or food presentation areas with track or recessed lighting.,
Choose fluorescent lights to provide that missing ambient lighting.",How to Choose the Right Lighting for Each Room4," Not only are your meals prepared here, but your family and guests gather here as well. Sufficient and adequate lighting is a must for performing all your culinary needs, helping your kids with their homework, and reading the paper.


Sketch a plan of your kitchen that focuses on activity areas and then decide what kind of light each area will need: general, task, accent, or decorative.
Use higher watt bulbs in task areas.
A glass or plastic pendant will provide ample ""up-lighting"" to cover the entire dinette area with light.

, Kitchens less than 100 square feet require a two lamp fluorescent, up to 250 square feet will require supplemental lighting. Down lights mounted 18"" off the edge of the cabinets, and spaced 3' to 4' on centers is an excellent way to create additional general lighting.

, Fluorescent under cabinet fixtures are also a cost efficient lighting source. In open areas over sinks use recessed downlights mounted directly over the sink.


Mounting mini-pendants 18"" to 24"" above the work surface is an ideal way to light up a breakfast bar or counter dinettes, a pendant on a dimmer, hanging 24"" to 30"" above the table, is ideal for task lighting. Size the fixture to roughly 12"" less than the diameter of the table.

, Use under cabinet lighting in cabinets, valences, and toe spaces and create drama while also supplying additional light to navigate around your kitchen in the evening.

, The ambient light provided by fluorescent fixtures will fill in your kitchen's shadows, reduce contrast, and light vertical surfaces to give the space a brighter feel.

Don't forget about the bathroom.,
Use several recessed down lights or decorative surface-mounted fixtures for areas over 100 square feet.,
Mount one fixture over the mirror to light a bathroom, but realize it can cause shadows on the face.,
Use extra lighting in unexpected areas for both decoration and function.",How to Choose the Right Lighting for Each Room5," Bathroom lighting is probably the last place people want to invest time and money. Mirrors go unlit, and oftentimes one ceiling fixture is used to light up the sink, mirror, and shower. However, as whirlpool tubs become larger and steam showers are added, more and more time is spent relaxing in the bathroom. Since you begin and end your day in the bathroom, why not spend a little extra time considering which fixtures and lights would work best?


Halogen bulbs are generally the standard for bathroom lighting, but the newest compact fluorescent bulbs are also a great option.

, Add companion close-to-ceiling fixtures to supplement bath wall brackets in larger bathrooms. Companion close to ceiling fixtures supplement bath wall brackets in larger bathrooms.

, If using recessed lighting, avoid creating shadows by not mounting them directly over the mirror.


Adding wall brackets to the side of the mirror is one of the best way to eliminate shadows on the face. For mirrors under 48"" wide use, vertically mounted wall brackets and position them 75 to 80 inches (190.5 to 203.2 cm) above the floor.
If the fixture uses exposed lamps, do not use a higher wattage than 40 watts. Fixtures with clear or well diffused glass use nor more than 75 watts. Color corrected fluorescent lamps should be used when fluorescent fixtures are desired. A crisp white light renders skin tones most accurately.

, Try a small recessed light directed at a piece of decorative art work or a beautiful powder basin creates an extra layer of lighting.


In the shower, use recessed lights or a ceiling mounted plastic unit. Angle a recessed shower fixture and highlight nice tile work or make your shower fixtures sparkle.
Don't forget the area over the commode! A recessed unit is always a great addition.

Use functional and fun lighting outside.,
Consider the types of lighting available.,
Use decorative fixtures are used along pathways, on walls and posts, and entrance foyers.,
Be mindful, however, that most lantern-style fixtures are glaring light sources.,
Use hidden lights for functional purposes.,
Include some lighting for security, too.",How to Choose the Right Lighting for Each Room6," Whether your goal is to enhance the beauty of your home, or provide additional security, you have numerous lighting options to light up your home's exterior. Extend the hours you can spend outside, or create a festive environment!

, The selection of lighting fixtures is of two primary types: decorative and functional., The design of these fixtures should complement the look and feel of your house and landscape while providing sufficient lighting for safety, security, and functionality.


When installing a wall lantern, size the fixture to the door and surrounding space. Wall lanterns should be mounted slightly above eye level at about 60"" to 66"" from the center of the fixture to the floor. Post-top lanterns can be selected to match the style of the wall lanterns. Large post top lanterns make a better impression when used in large open space.

, They spill light in all directions and can be a cause of light trespass (onto others' properties) and distracting glare for drivers. Many lighting designers forgo lantern style lights entirely and instead use lights with hoods (that shield the glare) and lights that are positioned within plant material so they are hidden completely.

, They are strategically positioned around the property to selectively illuminate plant material and architecture. A skilled lighting designer positions fixtures so only the effect of the illumination is seen, not the lighting fixtures themselves.

, Add landscape lighting, deck lighting, and step lighting to not only bring out the beauty of the home at night, but also add extra security and safety."

Lean towards rich, deeply saturated paint colors.,
Paint your basement with lighter colors only in spaces that receive abundant light.,
Pick the right sheen.,
Coordinate colors with existing materials.",How to Choose Paint Colors for Your Basement1," It is a common misconception that dark rooms should be painted light colors. In fact, light colors need an abundance of light to realize their potential; otherwise they tend to look drab, dull, and even dirty. The best way to counter the low light levels in a basement is by painting with rich, deep hues.Basement paint colors do not necessarily need to be dark, but they should be richly saturated. So, a highly saturated, medium-toned turquoise will often perform better than a dark-toned gray paint.;
, The more light a room receives, the better the paint will look regardless of color. This gives you more options in brighter rooms. Near windows and in rooms with plenty of electric light, you can use whites and off-whites as well as rich colors or dark tones., Choosing the right sheen is an important part of choosing your basement paint. The type of sheen can determine how light reflects off your painted walls (an especially important consideration for a basement), how visible imperfections in the walls are, and also how easy it will be to keep the space looking clean.If your basement is damp and tends be affected by mold, choose a satin paint finish. These kinds of paints can withstand moisture better than other types.

, How your basement is currently finished will, in some ways, determine what colors you should paint the space. For instance, if you have exposed brick walls, you might want to consider painting the adjacent wall a cool, refreshing color like mint green or pale blue.For rooms with finished drywall walls and carpeted floors, richer colors would be more appropriate.

Paint the ceiling white.,
Limit accent colors.,
Make full use of natural light.,
Replace overhead lights with soft perimeter lights.,
Use diffused lighting.,
Add custom lighting.,
Use brighter bulbs.,
Go with dark and cozy as an alternative.",How to Brighten Up a Dark Room1," If the room's ceiling is painted a dark color, or has dark wooden beams, it is probably casting a pall over the entire room. Buy a can or two of white paint and give the ceiling a fresh coat. The bright white will reflect light instead of absorbing it, and you'll be amazed at what a difference it makes.


If you prefer to use color instead of plain white, try a pale yellow, mint or cream.
Even if you don't paint the walls white, painting the ceiling white will still make a big difference.;
, You might be tempted to paint the room your favorite rich, deep color, but it's best to save bright and bold colors for accent walls or trim. In a dark room, a deep color won't look brilliant - it'll just add to the dark feel of the space. If you absolutely must use dark blue, green, red or another rich color, choose one small wall to paint, and paint the rest in a much lighter color.


Another way to incorporate some color without making the space darker is by adding a stenciled accent trim along the ceiling. Buy or make a stencil in a shape that suits your taste - flowers, leaves, and abstract designs are popular - and use your favorite paint color to make a pretty pattern.
Painting the baseboards and door trim a contrasting color is another way to add a festive touch to the room without making it too dark.

, If you're working with a dark room, chances are you don't have a lot of natural light coming in, but it's important to make the most of what you have. If your windows are covered with dark shades or blinds, you're blocking out your best chance for brightening up the room. Instead of keeping your blinds closed, try the following:


Choose airy, light-colored window coverings that don't completely block out the light. For example, cream-colored linen or canvas curtains will provide privacy while still allowing the sunshine to filter into the room.
If you prefer blinds, look for cloth blinds in a light fabric that isn't completely opaque. Avoid wooden or plastic blinds that block out all of the light.

, Harsh overhead lighting can actually highlight the fact that a room is naturally dark. Instead of flooding the space with fluorescent lighting, choose your artificial lighting carefully so that it looks as natural and pleasant as possible.


Track lighting can really brighten a space without creating a harsh atmosphere.
Use plenty of strategically-placed floor lamps with light-colored shades to diffuse light all over the room.

, If you have a dark corner or a room where there's no ceiling fixture, use multiple lights pointed towards the ceiling and walls. This reflected light provides a soft, overhead glow which minimizes harsh shadows.


Candles shouldn't be overlooked as a pleasant source of extra light. When you want to create an especially bright, cheerful atmosphere, light some candles in addition to using artificial lighting.

, If you frequently perform certain activities in the room, consider adding specific lights to help you work. Some lights mount under cabinets and over counters, and others may be useful on your sewing desk or piano.

, Replace the your bulbs with higher light intensity bulbs such as compact fluorescent bulbs (CFLs) of a lower wattage but higher light output. Higher wattage does not mean a higher light level.


You may also experiment with the subtle coloring of the lights. Bulbs that are classified as ""daylight"" usually put out light with a temperature around that of direct sunlight, and provide a cooler, bluer, more vivid light. ""Soft white"" bulbs have a lower light temperature which provides a warmer, more yellow light.

, If there's just no getting around the fact that the room in question is dark, you could always nix the suggestions for brightening the room and go with the room's natural feel. Paint it a deep color and use rich, heavy decorations to create the feel of an old-fashioned parlor. Colors like charcoal and slate blue are popular choices for rooms that are meant to have a stately feel.

Consider absence of color as another liberating alternative.",How to Bring Color Into Your Home," What are the predominant colors surrounding you? On a piece of paper, note how the colors make you feel as you are viewing them. Note whether they are bright, muted, eclectic, matching, etc., and how these different color effects impact on you.
, Find a color wheel. A color wheel is divided into primary and secondary colors, with the warm color spectrum (red, orange and yellow) on one side and the cool color spectrum (green, blue and violet), on the other side. Which side attracts your attention and emotions most? The colors that please you are a good indicator of what will please you around the home.

, The cool colors are suggestive of water, sky, and trees. They equate to a sense of calm, balance, peace and being soothed. The warm colors, on the other hand, are suggestive of sun, fire, and stars. They equate to a sense of vibrancy, energy, creativity and action.

, Creating color harmony in the home should not be the harmony according to one person. Let all interested family members choose the colors that soothe, energize or please them. You can see whose ideas match and where compromises need to be reached. After all, there are plenty of rooms in the house, so if there are mismatches, compromises can be reached on coloring the rooms according to those inhabitants who spend the most time in them.

, Will you paint or will you simply change the soft furnishings? If you are really serious about ushering in a new era in your home, it is likely you will aim to do both--paint and make changes to curtains, bedspreads, pillows, rugs, etc. See the ""Tips"" for extra ideas of the ways you can bring color into your home.

,


The warm colors are best suited to studying areas and high traffic areas such as a kitchen, where a lot of love and laughter is shared.






The cool colors should be in entrance and exit areas to ensure that on leaving or returning home, a sense of peace and calm descends in both directions. Cool colors are also perfect for bedrooms, movie dens and any area where you would like to encourage calm and balance.






Dining areas can be a mixture--cool for ensuring slower eating and warm for enlivening conversation. A mix can be achieved by painting in one color and then using curtains, tablecloths, serviettes, paintings, etc. in another hue from the opposite spectrum but matching.






Bathrooms are often better on the warmer side as this gives the impression of warmth from shower to dressing and it also brightens the room for other activities such as putting on makeup and shaving.







, Whether you are only fixing one area or room of the house, or the entire house, it is important to draw up a blueprint so that you have a good idea of what you want. Most importantly, this will provide you with an overview of the end result and will guide you through the process of bringing color into your home. Theming color is important because it gives you an idea of which colors you want to remain dominant and which other hues can be successfully blended in without overpowering the main color.

, Whites, creams and beiges can afford a sense of serenity and space. Such a basic color scheme can be dressed up if needed or left as is. It will often suit a room that receives a lot of sunlight and has a good view into a garden or similar relaxing space.

Refresh your paint job.,
Choose light colored paint.,
Consider eggshell blue or other light colors for trim or a single wall.,
Hang reflective wallpaper on a single wall.",How to Brighten Up a Room1," Old white walls and dark colored walls can make any space feel small. Spend plenty of time on the prep work, such as cleaning, patching cracks and bordering the space with painter’s tape.;
, Eggshell, cream and other nearly white colors reflect light and make the space feel larger. If you are painting over a darker color, take extra time to prime or buy a paint that includes primer.


Use matte paint or satin finish on the walls. Glossy finishes will create glare. You want the appearance of a light canvas to brighten up the room. , If you want to draw attention to a fireplace or one area of the room, consider painting it a light color that compliments your decor. Always use the lightest pastels, since it may look darker covering a large space.

, Wallpaper adds style to a room, although it can be difficult to hang properly. Place it on a wall opposite a window to reflect the light. "

Consider the decorative scheme of your family room.,
Evaluate your lighting needs.,
Familiarize yourself with different types of lighting fixtures.",How to Choose the Proper Lighting for a Family Room," Your lighting fixtures should complement your existing décor. Look around you and determine if your style is ornate, rustic, modern, country, minimalist, colonial, whimsical or a combination of aesthetics.;
, For amply lighting a room that has such diverse uses as does the family room, you must account for the room's multiple purposes by integrating more than 1 type of fixture into your lighting plan. Customize your family room's lighting scheme to your specific needs by choosing lighting for the each of the following purposes:


Provide general lighting. Assess how much natural light your room gets during the day, as well as how dark the room gets at night. You will want to flood the room with enough light to make it ""feel"" comfortable.
Accentuate decorative elements. When lighting a room that has wall art and/or architectural features that you want to highlight, it is a good idea to incorporate lighting that draws attention to those decorative elements. For example, emphasize high ceilings by pointing accent lights at the ceiling, and play up paintings by hanging art lights over them.
Create ambiance. A common function of the family room is to serve as a gathering area, where people can come together to spend time enjoying each other's company. For this purpose, bright overhead lights can feel harsh and impersonal, and too much shadow can hinder intimate conversation. Ambient lighting is indirect lighting that creates a mood.
Highlight task areas. If you choose to play chess at the game table, read a book in the lounge chair or knit a blanket from your favorite spot on the couch, you will need fixtures that provide a flood of light exactly where you need it.

,


Both floor lamps and table lamps are ideal for task lighting, as they provide a localized flood of light and can be turned on/off as needed.
Track lighting - a series of fixtures on a track - can be adjusted in location on the track, or can be rotated to shine light at different angles. This type of setup is great for accent lighting and/or for indirect/ambient lighting.
Pendants are singular, hanging light fixtures that provide good task lighting, as they provide a localized ring of light over a fixed work area. For family room lighting, you may choose to use pendants over a desk or a game table.
Recessed lighting is installed in the ceiling so that the housings cannot be seen, and can be used for any type of decorative style. These fixtures may be stationary, or may be set on a movable joint that allows you to adjust their angles, making them a great choice for general, ambient and/or accent lighting.
Wall sconces are decorative fixtures that direct a beam of light either upward, downward or both up and down. Therefore, they are most useful as accent lighting.

Evaluate the amount of light your basement receives.,
Invest in additional lighting.,
Consider changing light.,
Remove light-blocking walls.",How to Choose Paint Colors for Your Basement2," The often overlooked but crucial step in determining how a paint color will look is assessing the lighting. If your basement receives little sunlight and has a generally dim electric light setup, it will actually be very difficult to get light paint colors to look appealing. Instead, they tend to look dingy and dull.Darker rooms need more richly saturated paint colors to prevent them from looking darker and less inviting.

, If your basement is rather dark and you have the time and money and want to make your basement look spectacular, consider investing in additional lighting. Recessed lighting has long been the favored choice for basements, and if you already have recessed lights you can simply add more.Try How to Choose the Proper Lighting for a Basement.

, Remember that the amount of light your space receives will vary depending on the time of day, the season, and the current weather conditions. Of course, there’s no way to change that. But you can keep that in mind when deciding what kind of paint you choose and how much additional lighting you may need.


If your space is darker in the winter months because of the decreased natural light, you might want to consider using richly saturated paint colors combined with additional lighting that you can use when needed.

, If your basement has windows along one or more walls, you can encourage the spread of natural light by removing any walls blocking the windows from other rooms.These partitioned walls can often make a space feel more closed off.
Of course, be careful not to remove any important load-bearing walls. Consult a structural engineer before making any decisions to remove walls.

"
"
Consider your existing furniture.,
Coordinate paint colors with your decorative accents.,
Cater to potential buyers.,
Get creative.",How to Choose Paint Colors for Your Basement3," Of course, you likely aren't willing to discard your existing furniture and décor when painting. This means that choosing colors will be constrained by the colors in your existing pieces.Think about the hues of your furniture pieces and what colors would go well with them. Rich paint colors would blend well with yellowy wood tones.

, In addition to your existing furniture, you’ll need to consider what decorative items you’ll be putting in the basement. You don’t want to have to purchase all new items just to match the paint color you choose.If you’re using neutral paint colors like taupe or beige, a great way to add some excitement and color is through your accents. Throw a brightly colored pillow on the couch or include a colorful piece of artwork on the wall.

, Even if you aren’t planning on moving any time soon, you should try to consider what a potential future buyer might think of your renovation plans. You don’t want to make a change you’ll have to undo in order to sell your home later. Rather, you want to make changes that are both appealing to you and increase the value of your home and attract a wide range of buyers.Try not to paint your basement a wild color that could be off-putting to others (like bubblegum pink or lime green).
If you are selling the home soon, try to work within a limited palette. Being adventurous with paint and décor color schemes can often turn potential buyers off.

, While it is important to consider what potential buyers might be interested in, the basement can also be a place where you let your decorating side go a little crazy – especially if you plan on living in this home for a long time. Not every visitor in your home will see your basement, so this gives you an opportunity to really express yourself through color.Let yourself pick vibrant, exciting colors that will make a statement. But be sure to coordinate with your décor so that you don’t have clashing color combinations.

Assess your decorations and accessories.,
Add mirrors.,
Change up your dark furniture.,
Keep wires tucked away.,
Install wall-mounted shelving.",How to Brighten Up a Dark Room2," Look at your artwork, knicknacks, book collection, and other decorations in the room you're trying to brighten up. Is anything adding to the feeling that the space is overly dim? It might be time to switch out that old black-and-white print for something more lively and bright. If you have stacks of books, a collection of old dolls or a wall of deep green plants, it might be time for those to go, too. If you're committed to brightening up your space, you might have to make some tough decisions about what to keep.


Choose your top 10 or so favorite books and display them artfully, rather than having your entire collection take up a wall in the dark room. The space that was previously covered with books can now be brightened up with something more cheerful.
If you're a plant lover, think about getting rid of big, dark plants and replacing them with plants that are lighter in color. Displaying a few succulents or ferns is an attractive touch, but having racks of plants can make a room feel darker.

, Now that you've cleared away some space, try adding a few mirrors to the room. They'll reflect what light does leak into the room and make it seem at least a little brighter. Choose mirrors with light-colored frames that add to the room's airy feel.Hanging mirrors in a room has the added benefit of making it feel larger.

, Do you have floor-to-ceiling wooden bookshelves that add to your room's dark feel? How about a a dark cherry TV cabinet, or a big wooden bed with rich, dark posts? Heavy furniture can make even the brightest room look a little dreary. If you want to brighten things up, choose furniture with lighter wood.


You can also paint or refinish your existing furniture to give it a room-brightening makeover.
Buy brightly-colored slipcovers for your sofa and chairs.

, If you're like most people, you've got tangles of wires and cables snaking across your floor. Black wires can contribute to a room feeling dark and cluttered. Try keeping them neatly wound and secured with a piece of velcro. You can also tape the wires against the baseboard using light-colored electrical tape to keep them out of the way. You'll find that this seemingly trivial change makes a big difference.

, Another trick for making a room appear brighter is to eliminate the need for a lot of furniture. Instead of having a bunch of bookshelves and tables, try installing wall-mounted shelves that are composed of light-colored wood or painted white. Use them to store your books and a few decorations. Now you've eliminated the shadows cast by extra tables and other furniture.

Brighten up your flooring.,
Replace your door with a glass one.,
See if you can remove extra walls.,
Consider adding windows.,
Install a skylight or solar tube.",How to Brighten Up a Dark Room3," If you have dark-colored floors, the quickest fix is to buy a brightly-colored throw rug to cover them up. However, investing a little more time and money to put in new flooring or refinish what you have might be worth it in the long run. If you really want to brighten up your room, consider the following:If you have painted hardwood floors, refinish the floors to expose the light wood underneath. You might also consider painting the floors a brighter color, like pearl gray.
Concrete floors are sturdy and practical, and they come in many different colors. The finished concrete is polished until it's smooth and gleaming.
Brightly-colored tiles are a good choice for kitchens and bathrooms.

, Both internal and external doors offer opportunities for more light to enter the room in question. If possible, replace your doors with glass french doors. You could also consider getting a door with a large window to let in more light. If these options aren't practical, simply painting your doors a lighter color will help brighten the room.

, Your room might have a closed-off, dark feel if there's an extra wall blocking the light. If possible, consider taking out the extra wall to open things up a bit. This is commonly done where a wall blocks a room from a hallway, for example. If the wall doesn't contain beams that are holding up the ceiling, knocking it out shouldn't be a problem.


You'll want to hire a contractor to take a look at the room before deciding to knock out a wall by yourself. In some cases the wall might be serving a structural purpose. In old houses and apartments, it's also important to make sure the wall doesn't contain lead or asbestos before attempting to knock it down.

, This is the ultimate fix for a dark room, and it might be easier than you think. Before you rule out the possibility as being too much of an undertaking, have a contractor do an assessment of the room to help you better understand your options. If you're living in a place you plan on keeping for some time to come, it might be worthwhile to make it over into the bright, cheerful space you desire. Widening existing windows and doorways can also let in more light.

, Skylights let in natural light, and lots of it. There are skylights that can be installed right between rafters, making it a relatively inexpensive project. Reflective tubes that require little more than a good-sized hole in the sheetrock and the roof are another possibility. Some skylights can even open for ventilation.

Pull up old or dark carpet.,
Cover dark carpets with area rugs.",How to Brighten Up a Room2," Unless you have light, stain repellent carpet already, it may look dingy or dark. Consider replacing the carpet with light colored laminate flooring.


Laminate flooring looks like hardwood flooring but is much less expensive. Many people even install it themselves.







, If you can’t replace dark hard wood or carpet, find some cheap indoor-outdoor or artificial turf floor covering, a large jute or sea grass rug. You can also opt for other textures or a light stain repellant rug.

Consider a window remodel.,
Don’t rely on overhead lighting.,
Add ambient or indirect lighting.,
Hang a chandelier in the center of the room.",How to Brighten Up a Room3," If you are working with a room with no windows or small windows, price up a small remodeling project to increase the size of the windows. An egress window in a basement runs between $3,000 and $6,000 and can turn a small room into a cheery bedroom.


Although this is an investment, putting an egress window and built-in closet in a basement room could increase the value of a home. Talk to a local realtor and contractor to see if this bright change is also a good financial decision.







, If you do, it may be bright during the day, but dark in the evening. Aim the light at the ceiling to make the room feel larger and brighter. , Lights above cabinets or around a focal point will give the room an extra layer of light. Point ambient lights up, not down, if possible.

, Choose a glass or crystal-looking chandelier to reflect more light from the windows.

Place large pieces of furniture, such as chests and bookshelves on walls that are perpendicular to your windows.",How to Brighten Up a Room4," Cream, tan and light blue can add a beachy brightness to any room.

"
Add mirrors.,
Include glass décor.,
Remove excess décor.,
Pick sheer curtains, rather than heavy ones.",How to Brighten Up a Room5," Here are some creative ways to make a room feel larger, brighter and more stylish with mirrors.


Find antique mirrors and hang them close together. It will look like an art installation and reflect light around the room.






Use a long and skinny mirror on a large wall to make a room look wider. Place it across from a large window to reflect more light from the outside into your room.






Take small square mirrors and tile a wall where you wish there was a window. It will give the illusion that you have an extra window. Set up floor length mirrors in hallways or nooks.







, A glass or mirrored coffee table, wall hanging or vase may increase the open feeling of the room while attracting more light. Opt to replace knobs on your furniture with glass knobs., Take the minimalist approach toward decorating, in any room you want to feel airy and light. Remove knick-knacks, bookshelves and collections in favor of 1 or 2 vases and statement pieces.


Consider removing end tables, file cabinets, TV stands and ottomans, if they just end up collecting clutter. You can hang electronics directly on the walls. , If you need extra privacy, put in light cellular blinds behind the curtains. Sheer materials that drape down will allow more light into the room than thick or dark panels.


If you have very few windows in the room, consider keeping them unfurnished to let in more light.

Use a neutral color palette.,
Add punches of bright color.,
Keep things looking smooth and sleek.,
Focus on geometric and angular shapes.,
Keep things light.,
Make ample use of artwork.",How to Decorate a Modern Living Room1," Modern style is fairly minimalist, even down to the color scheme. A base color scheme should consist of neutral colors, including white, beige, and black. This allows the accessories and furnishings to draw the eye more effectively.;
, While the base color scheme should consist of neutral colors, accents of bright color or bold patterns can act as conversation pieces in the modern style living room. Think fire engine red, tangerine orange, and lime green.

, Everything from the floor to the furniture should have a glossy appearance. Concrete, granite, and linoleum are all fair game for flooring material, while chrome, steel, and black lacquered wood are common accents for furnishings.

, Squares and rectangles are shapes frequently found in the modern style living room, as is any shape consisting of straight lines and angular edges. Perfect circles are also common, but rectangles with rounded edges or undefined shapes are not often found.

, Modern living rooms typically have a lot of light flowing in. Large windows that allow sunlight to stream in at an angle are best, but sources of artificial light are just as important. Choose lights that give off a bright, blue-white glow instead of bulbs with a yellow-white glow.

, Modern paintings and statement sculptures quickly become the focal point of an otherwise neutral room. Many modern living rooms include these pieces to serve as points of visual interest or conversation.

Paint the walls white, beige, or cream.,
Put in a linoleum floor.,
Spread out a bright red or orange square rug.,
Look for a glass coffee table.,
Keep your couch and chairs as rectangular as possible.,
Decorate your furniture with throw pillows in bright colors or animal print.,
Set out an ottoman.,
Let light in with thin floor lamps.,
Consider unobtrusive overhead lighting.,
Fill in some empty space with candles and vases.,
Invest in a statement piece of artwork, such as a painting or statue.",How to Decorate a Modern Living Room2," Stark white is the color of choice, but slightly off-white shades also work. The point is to create a ""blank slate"" of sorts. By keeping the walls as neutral as possible, the rest of the room stands out more.

, Glossy linoleum is one of the floor types frequently associated with modern design schemes. Choose a non-obtrusive, plain color, such as white or black. By settling with a neutral color, you allow the other accents in your room to take center stage.

, If you want to add a bright burst of color, find a bold shade that makes a strong statement. Select a square rug that adds straight lines and sharp angles to the room, and opt for one that only covers part of the floor instead of the entire floor. A smaller rug permits your glossy floor to show through.

, Glass is a shiny material that remains relatively low-key, which may work well in many modern living rooms. One with stainless steel or black lacquered legs adds a notably contemporary look. Stick with square or rectangular tables, or look for a perfectly round circle.

, Instead of looking for furniture with rounded corners and soft edges, look for seating that has straight lines and sharp angles. The seating should also be in neutral colors like white, beige, gray, or black. Black furniture adds appropriate contrast against white walls, but white or gray seating may work better if you plan on adding bright splashes of color elsewhere.

, Black-and-white zebra print is especially fitting for modern décor, but a bold red, green, or orange adds just enough visual interest to serve as a fitting focal point. Stick with square and rectangular pillows over rounded ones or those without any well-defined shape.

, A circular or cube ottoman in a color that matches the rest of your seating can accompany your sofa while serving as additional seating when necessary. The simple color and geometric shape allows it to fit in perfectly.

, Skinny floor lamps with a single bright light shining at the top can add a tremendous amount of light while keeping to the minimalist ambiance of a modern living room. Choose a simple design with a black or metal stand.

, Recessed ceiling lights can flood your living room with color, creating sharp, angular shadows that highlight the room's modern theme. These lights are also relatively hidden and do not clash with the look of the room.

, Modern living rooms are sparsely decorated, but they do not need to be completely empty. A few white votive candles or geometric vases filled with orchids can add just enough visual interest to the room to make it look lived in, but do not flood the room with too much unnecessary detail.

, Hang a painting or two on a bare wall to draw the eye or place a statue on an end table or coffee table. The statue can be a modern geometric design, or it can be a statue of something that exists in the real world, such as a horse or cat. Paintings can be colorful, but a statue should be simple, monochromatic, and made from one material.

Determine how the living room will be used.,
Choose a color scheme and style.,
Take measurements.,
Get the essentials.,
Add embellishments.",How to Decorate a Living Room," This will help you decide what furniture to buy and what theme/color scheme to choose. Determine how many people will be using the living room on a regular basis so that you can buy the appropriate sized couch and include the right number of seats, if applicable.


Account for the practical as well as the aesthetic uses of the room. Consider how you will use the room as well as how you want it to look. Keep both in mind as you plan your decorating budget.
Decide whether or not you want to have a television set. If you do, then decide on where the television set will be placed before decorating; avoid placing it in a spot with excessive window glare. You may also need to buy an entertainment system or armoire to hold the television.;
, Having a theme in mind is important when picking out new furniture so that you can achieve your desired aesthetic. You might also want to consider changing the color of your walls to match your preferences. Consider the following ideas for living room themes:



Warm tones. Paint your walls cucumber-green and buy yellow and orange accent pieces, which include arm chairs, throw pillows, and pieces of artwork.This color scheme creates a warm, playful environment that is both colorful and settled.

English country. This includes green, blue, red, or gray toile-patterned wallpaper, chintz-patterned accent pieces, shabby-chic furniture, and elegant china.Offset the splashes of color with neutral tones to avoid a living room that is too busy.

French country. Like English country, this style combines colorful patterns like stripes and checkers with neutral tones. Find vintage neutral-toned French-provincial pieces, and add deep red and blue accents.For a more formal look, add elegant drapes and a glass chandelier.

Modern/contemporary style. Modern design is very minimalist; stick with neutral tones like beige, gray, and dark brown, and choose furniture with straight lines and smooth surfaces (stay away from detailed embroidery or carvings).Try a long, L-shaped couch in beige with dark gray throw-pillows and a dark wooden rectangular coffee table.

, Before buying any furniture, you should measure the length and width of your living room. Determine where you want to position each piece of furniture and the proper measurements for that area.


You should also measure the height of your ceiling if you plan on buying a bookcase or armoire.

, Regardless of what style or color scheme you choose, you will need the following items to complete your living room:


A couch. Consider getting one longer couch (seating 4-5) and one smaller one (seating 2-3). Place them perpendicular to one another.
Coffee table. This will serve as the centerpiece of the room, and can be used for magazines, books, television remotes, etc. The couches should be placed around the coffee table.
Accent chair(s). These add splashes of color and provide additional seating.
Television or fireplace. These serve as points of reference to determine what direction to point your furniture in. If you don't have either of these items, then face your couches and chairs toward one another with a coffee table in the middle.

, Once you have gotten the essentials, you will need to add some smaller, decorative items. Find artwork for the walls, and decorate your mantelpiece with figurines, candles, and picture frames. You might also need one or more lamps to provide additional lighting.


Other items include a bowl of fruit for the coffee table, potted plants, vases with flowers, and various books or magazines.
Consider hanging window drapes or getting blinds for your windows, particularly if windows face out into the street.
If you have wooden floors, consider getting a large rug to cover your floors.

Bring the room together.",How to Convert Your Living Room Into a Beach," If possible, you'll want to choose a place that already has some connection to the outdoors, such as a large patio door. A sun room or enclosed porch would be another great spot for your indoor beach.
, Do you want a traditional living room with beach decorations and colors or do you want the whole thing to evoke a beach?

Keep your budget in mind. Bringing in a few patio chairs you already own and setting up a tabletop fountain is a far different matter than knocking down part of an exterior wall to install a sun room!




  Bring in some beach-inspired colors.

Think about what colors the beach means to you. Is a beach about the muted, natural tones of sand and surf, or would you like some bright, tropical colors in the mix, too?

, What elements would you like to try to recreate?, Do all you can with skylights and windows. Light and spaciousness is a big part of why many people like beaches.

Light the room gently at night. Candles or other low mood lighting will fit well in this theme. Of course, if you use the room for reading or other activities at night, light those areas accordingly.

, You'll find all sorts of furniture for outdoor, poolside, and beach use, so there is no need to go with the molded plastic sort. It may still be less costly and more durable than conventional living room furniture. Instead, go for comfortable, casual pieces that fit your theme.

Don't forget that this is still a living room. Plan for your seats to have cushions of some sort, even if they are not weatherproof to stand up to the elements.
This would be a great place for a couple of wooden deck chairs or Adirondack chairs, since the wood need not stand up to moisture and weather.

, Many tropical and tropical-looking plants thrive indoors and in indirect light. Try a dieffenbachia or other large plant as an anchor and build out from there., Try a bamboo lattice or mat, coarsely woven textiles in an island pattern, and an interesting piece of driftwood as a natural sculpture. Or use natural looking materials, such as tufa planters., Water brings with it sound, texture, and moisture. The exact nature is up to you and your space, but consider an aquarium, a fountain, a water feature, or even a small indoor pond., Make the view through the windows or patio door as tropical and beach-like as your climate allows. Also choose colors and styles for the hard surfaces outdoors. For instance, cover a patio or wall with tile in warm colors or a tropical motif. You may also prefer to put your pond, water feature, or sandbox outdoors., Unless you have a truly separate room with a concrete floor, real sand is probably not a good idea in your house. It will only get tracked around and abrade your other floors. If you like, you can have suggestions of sand, instead. You can buy a tabletop Zen garden or make your own in any size you please. You could obtain or make a sand pendulum, a tray of sand with a long, heavy pendulum hanging just into the surface so that it draws patterns as it swings. You could have a jar or terrarium with colored sand and perhaps seashells in it., A worn-out pail could contain some of those plants. Weathered wood would go just fine. This would be a great place to try distressing paint or fabric, if you can't find something that's already suitably worn., Often, living rooms already have fireplaces. They provide warmth and low light on cool nights that is well suited to a beach theme., Are you trying for an open, airy feel or a cozy beach hut? How will traffic move through the room? Whatever you do to make the room more beach-like, do it consistently, or at least coherently, throughout the room."

, For many people, this can often be interpreted as being less spartan and more homely, with trinkets, photos, special things, stuffed toys and comfortable elements placed everywhere in the room. Before you do anything, ask yourself: ""Am I a minimalist or a maximalist?"" Then you will have a good idea of whether you'd like to add more or less things to the room.

, Not all colors make you feel the same way. If you would like a group of members to like the new wall color, think about what you all collectively like or could be fine with. This color must be one that everyone collectively like and not just are 'okay' with.


Olive green gives a rich feel some feel.
Typically shades of green give energy.
Warmth and brightness brought by reds, oranges, pinks and yellows are often associated with a room that has feeling.
Blue creates a feeling of strength and acceptance. All colors bring a story with it. Certain colors remind you of your personal memory. Hence, you must consider what you like and be willing to carry on with your likes.

, The best way to know how your room will look after it is done is through creative visualization.


You may create a 3D room through computer applications or MS paint to see how exactly or roughly your room will look.

, Upholstery includes the curtains, mats, carpets, or any fabric used in the room. This aspect of a room could be used to change the feel of the room dramatically from dull to stunning. You could do it tastefully in the following ways.


Choose cozy throw rugs, comfortable cushions, billowy pillows, soft rugs and smooth curtains for the room.
Prefer fabrics that are nice to touch. You may choose from linens, cottons, burlap, velvet, satin and other such fabrics are wonderful choices. Organza and other see-through fabrics can make nice wispy statements.

Pick a soft feathery carpet or a royal looking one as per your choice.
Use soft or textured furniture covers and cushions.
Using beautiful, vibrant and colorful curtains.
You may add bells or fancy dangling objects to hang with the curtains.
To spruce up the curtains up a notch you may consider adding a dash of color to the curtain tiebacks.
To make a bold statement you may choose prominent metallic finished ones.
Curtain tiebacks could either go with the rest of the color scheme or create a contrast for a more fun and lively look.



, If you like some colors, even if they're not traditional you may go ahead with it and make your room special in every way. For example, if your favorite color is blue, add blue things to the room, such as a blue armchair, table mat, wall hangings, wind chime etc.

, You can use some statement pieces to add more feelings to your room. Accessories, art pieces, paintings, sculptures, posters, etc which would do it for you. A combination of well-placed decorative items will add much aesthetic value to it and give out lively vibes for everyone to delve in.


If you want to create a rich archaic feel you may buy beautifully designed old styled items to go with your room.
Place paintings on the walls. You don't have to spend a lot on these if you don't want to. You may paint one yourself or ask a friend who is artistically proficient to paint them for you. You may visit a thrift store or a auction house and pick up some fantastic paintings for next-to-nothing.

Choose paintings with lively, fun and interesting subject matter, as well as choosing pictures that have special meaning for you.


Add posters to the walls. These could be of places you'd like to visit or have visited, bands you like listening to, science fiction or science themes, animals, or more.

, Consider the lighting of the room with keen attention. Lighting can change the mood of a room dramatically and can help to make it feel cozier and more lived in.


Choose between lights that give out different effect.
Choose lamps that are very colorful, ornate, both or just plain depending upon what you prefer. You may add extra lamps too.
Consider using some fairy lights or Christmas lights to give a festive feeling.

Don't be afraid to add your own things.",How to Decorate a Japanese Room," Washitsu (和室) means a Japanese-styled-room(s). This is the traditional way of decorating a Japanese room. Most washitsu have tatami floors, and sliding doors (fusuma), rather than hinged doors.;
, This means that the room must remain simple, pure, uncluttered, and clean. To achieve this when preparing your Japanese-style room, stick to the basics, such as:


Using tatami floors
Placing a low table in the room, and sitting on a zabuton, or a low chair
Creating a tokonoma; an alcove for decorative items
Including a kotatsu, which is a particular type of low table that contains a heating element used in the wintertime. This is particularly important, as most Japanese homes do not have central heating.

, Stick to the basic colors (it applies to the paint as much as to any item placed in the room). Suitable colors include:


White
Tan/light tan
Browns
Oranges
Reds.

, Calm colors are essential to ensure simplicity and clarity. Do not paint any color that may come across as vibrant or flashy. Keep it simple and pure.


Look for online and book images that show Japanese style rooms to get an idea of the color schemes used. If using an image engine, search for the term ""Japanese bedrooms"" to find inspiration and ideas.

, Traditional Japanese beds are usually low to the ground. Some are even in or on the ground. Beds are commonly set in the middle of the room, or the middle of the wall.

, When you're picking out your blankets, sheets and duvet covers, remember to choose only calming colors. White is the most commonly used, but tans and oranges (and even calm greens) are a nice touch.

, Futons (which are on the floor) always have that Japanese-y feel. Be aware that they can be a pain to clean though.

, Do you have a closet? You can put a shoji screen over it. This will cover the clutter, keeping it simple, and also looking beautiful.

, This is the fun part! Decoration is your way of expressing yourself and using the Japanese style is a beautiful opportunity to find interesting and calming pieces.

, Simple plants; whether small or large, thick or thin, a few plants are a traditional part of decorating a Japanese-style room.

, Hints of vibrant colors are beautiful and stand out against the calm colors used throughout the room. The only rule is to use these splashes of brighter color wisely. Consider a bright flower, colorful painting, candles, colorful lights (for example, fairy lights), etc.


Remember that black is not a bad color, when used in moderation.

, For lighting, consider candles, lanterns, or a lamp. Don't overwhelm the room with these objects though. Decide where you want to put them, and how to get the best light using as few items as possible.

, Shoji screens are very common and make a beautiful addition to any room. Put them on your windows or sliding doors, or even have them as a room divider.


Add some Japanese writing (Kanji, hiragana, katakana) for a cute touch.

, You can't have both and keep it simple at the same time.

, It is, after all, your room. Just because it's minimalist doesn't mean there's no room for any decoration/

, Bedside tables are a convenience your guests will likely appreciate, but your guests may worry if they leave a water ring from a drink on a wooden surface. If the nightstand has a glass top, the water can be wiped away and will not leave a permanent ring.

, Ceiling lights are great, but the switch is often placed by the door and away from the bed. As a result, your guests may have to stumble back to the bed after switching the light off at night. Placing a bedside lamp in the room eliminates this problem.

, A full-length mirror may make it easier for your guests to get ready in the morning. Even smaller mirrors are useful decorations, however, especially in a smaller room. Mirrors add depth and dimension, creating the illusion of a wider space.

, Vanities have a classic quality to them, which may make the room seem more nostalgic and inviting. They also provide your guests with a place to spread out their toiletries.

, Leave the top few drawers empty so that guests making extended stays can unpack their clothes. Fill the bottom drawers with towels, spare blankets, and other amenities your guests may need during their stay.

, Twin beds are more versatile than full, queen, or king size beds. Guests can sleep separately or push the beds together to form a larger sleeping area.

, If possible, include cotton sheets, a cotton coverlet, and a down comforter on the bed or beds. These layers give your guests more control over how hot or cold they feel at night.

, While they do not serve much practical purpose, throw pillows can make a bed appear even more comfortable. Throw pillows can also be used to introduce an accent color into the room, which can allow you to add a nice splash of color without making the room uncomfortably energetic.

, If you have hardwood floors or other non-carpeted flooring, a plush throw rug creates a warm, comfortable ambiance and protects your guests' feet from getting cold on chilly mornings.

Decide how you're going to partition the space.,
Choose a themeor a basic colour for the playroom.,
Rotate the toys.,
Choose rough totes that can be placed on high shelves,for the collections you want stored away out of circulation.,
Get bins for the toys and have your children pick up the toys every evening before dinner.,
Make sure that you have a ""cuddly"" area, with soft things like bean bag chairs, teddy bears, and soft blankets.,
Buy and hang posters or paintings on one wall.,
Experiment with different areas according to your children's preferences:


School (for instance, science/physics) area: Games are great, but let's not forget about school.,
Buy some plastic or wooden cubes in order to enrich the possibilities of the playroom.",How to Create a Playroom," Do you only want to use some space from your children's room or do you have the flexibility of creating a brand new room?


If you have a separate room at your disposal, you have the ability to shape a small playground with a lot of possibilities, by developing the three dimensions of the space. Exploit the height of walls by leaving the main room free for games and recreation. Make steps (stairs) with big cushions that lead to a platform made of timber or plastic and to a wooden footbridge that leads to a slide.






One good solution for the creation of this type of playroom could be using the garage, a space in which we usually stack unnecessary objects, condemning it to disuse from over packing; instead, this space could be developed and changed into an internal play area with vast possibilities.






If you have part of a room available, you can create a mini playroom, separate and different in aspect from the rest of the room. It's important to place objects in a specific way, so that the entire room can be “separated” into three spaces for basic activities: sleeping, studying and, naturally, game-playing. If you have a bunk-bed, you can have more space for games. Book shelves for books and a desk can transform a corner suitable for reading. In this way, the larger part of the room is left to the enjoyment of your child, who can lay down, roll around, move comfortably, stretch out, and play games.;
, This is easy, as the only thing you need to do is to let yourself be advised by your children! Ask them what they would like to have as a theme, in order to create a pleasing environment for them. Cartoonsor their favourite comic heroes are some typical ideas which children tend to always like. If they haven't got a specific idea in mind, then choose either a feminine, masculine, or neutral color rather than resorting to any fancy colours or patterns.

, Let your goal be dividing toys in half, thirds, or fourths, depending on the overall pile. Then keep one of those smaller collections out at a time, store the rest away and rotate them out as a whole collection. You can make a big deal out of the rotation days; maybe the first of every month, or whatever. All the toys will seem new again. The key is to get as much out of the way as possible, while leaving a good variety out that the kids will really use and appreciate.

, Avoid the temptation lots of children have to climb by choosing non-see-through containers. You can micro-sort smaller items into zipper bags and put the bags in the rough totes.

Keep the collections separated; maybe colour code them. All the same coloured boxes can be taken out at the same time.






For the toys that are in circulation, many can be sorted into dishpans. They fit in perfectly, because they are simple in design, and go with everything. They can be decorated and clearly labelled. They don't have holes in them like baskets do and are cheap as well as being easy to keep clean. They are easy for kids to handle, portable, and can make any shelving system into a drawer system. You can store books in dishpans too, situating them so that the front of the books are showing to let kids choose a book by looking at the cover.







, If they don't pick up, then they can't play in that place tomorrow. If they pick them up every day, then it won't be such a chore. It may take a few tries for this to work but it is worth persevering.

, This provides a safe place to go and a place to put the child when they are tired or upset. Creating a bulletin board with colours and shapes will keep your children on a schedule. Numbers and letters are better used closer to school age, and shapes and colors are more age appropriate for the younger children.

, Posters of Disney or Loony Tunes heroes would be ideal for your children. Kids also love animals. Children also love creating art, so an arts and crafts area is essential! The arts and crafts area should include:


A painting easel, blackboard and whiteboards (using whiteboard markers is an excellent activity with children; markers should be washable, so that if it gets on their clothes, it washes out easily), a variety of art supplies, and child-sized tables and chairs.







, Try making school more fun by adding characteristics that reflect school. In this way, they will even find school more interesting.







Dress up area: All children love a wardrobe with a variety of outfits, either bought ones or homemade, but most importantly have a mirror, so that the children can look at themselves, change appearance, or even create their own games.







, These are decorative, multi-colored, useful – since they can function as spaces of storage. What’s most important, however, is that they can be shaped in different ways. The children can set up the cubes making lodges, chairs, seats and whatever they can invent. Thus, they have the opportunity to develop their imagination and participate in the configuration of their personal space.

Check for any obstructions.,
Measure the height of the door.,
Measure the width of the door.,
Estimate the door measurements.,
Buy a standard-sized storm door.,
Use a z-bar.,
Order a custom storm door.",How to Measure for a Storm Door," Before you take any measurements, you should first have a quick glance around the doorway to check for any potential obstructions that would affect the installation of your storm door.


Look for the placement of door handles, exterior lights, the mailbox and even the doorbell. In some cases these items may interfere with the installation of the storm door or prevent it from closing properly. If this is the case, you may need to relocate them or switch to smaller door handles.
Look at the placement of pillars on the front porch to see if the storm door will have enough room to swing outwards once installed. At this point you may also want to decide which way you want your storm door to open. Do you want the handle on the right and the hinges on the left (left-hinged outswing) or the handle on the left and the hinges on the right (right-hinged outswing)?;
, Measure the height of the door in 3 places from the top of the bottom threshold to the underside of the top piece of trim (also known as the header).


Place the tape measure on top of the threshold (which is usually made of concrete or silver/brass metal) and stretch it to the bottom side of the top piece of exterior trim.
Do this on the left side of the door opening, the center of the opening and on the right side of the opening and make a note of each measurement.
Normally, you will get measurements somewhere between 80"" to 81"" on newer homes and 96"" to 97"" on openings with older, larger doors.
Highlight the smallest of the three measurements, as this is the one you will be working with.

, Measure the width of the door from left to right, from inside of trim to inside of trim (or the inside face of the brick mold).


Do this in three places: at the top of the door opening, in the middle of the door opening (around the handle) and at the bottom of the door opening. Make a note of all three measurements.Highlight the smallest measurement, as this is the one you'll be using.

, Take the smallest measurements from the door width and door height and write them in ""width x height"" format.


For example, if your smallest width measurement was 36 inches (91.4 cm) and your smallest height measurement was 80 inches (203.2 cm), then you would write 36"" x 80"".
This is the measurement you will use when purchasing a storm door. If you want to be completely sure that your measurements are accurate, repeat the process a second time.

, All pre-hung storm doors come in a range of standard sizes, which vary slightly from manufacturer to manufacturer. Therefore, all you need to do is match your personal door measurements to the closest standard size.


Choose a storm door manufacturer (such as Larson, Andersen or EMCO) and consult their doorway opening size guide to match your measurements.
For example, following the Larson size guide, a door opening measuring 35-7/8"" x 80"" would require a 36"" x 81"" standard-size storm door ., Sometimes the width of your door measures more than the standard sized storm doors.


In this situation, it is possible to purchase a z-bar extender kit to fill in the excess space between the door trim and the storm door.
This is a convenient option that saves you the trouble of ordering a custom-sized door. However, it is only possible if the door opening is less than an inch wider than the largest standard door size., If your door has unusual measurements that don't fit within the standard sizes, you may need to order a custom-sized storm door. Once you do this, you're ready to install the storm door yourself. Happy installation!


This may be more expensive than the cost of standard sized doors, but it will be worth it for a properly fitting storm door.
Most of the main storm door manufacturers off a service for ordering custom sized door.

Bump open a tumbler lock.,
Acquire a bump key.,
Fit the bump key into the lock up to the last pin.,
Slam and turn the bump key.",How to Open a Locked Door1," Bumping a lock is a quick, simple lock picking technique that is useful in the case of having to open a door that's been closed for a long time (for example, of an unused home on family property), or if you need to break into an elderly relative's house to make sure they're okay.








Bumping a lock does take some practice, and especially in the case of cheaper locks, it can damage the lock, so don't use it without a good reason.;
, A bump key is a key that will fit the lock you want to bump, but which doesn't unlock it per se. As long as the key will fit in the lock, it can be turned into a bump key by filing every cut down to the lowest acceptable depth.









Most reputable locksmiths won't make a bump key for you, but you can sometimes find them online. To make one yourself, you'll need metalworking tools and some patience.

, Pin and tumbler locks are made of a round segment that turns once the pins inside line up and no longer block its motion. Every soft click you feel as you push a key into a lock is a pin being lifted by a tooth of the lock and then dropping onto the cut below it. Push your bump key in until there's one pin left that hasn't been lifted.








, Use a small rubber mallet or similar object to strike the bump key hard, and turn it immediately thereafter. Since the pins inside the lock are in two sections, this slamming motion transfers force to the lower sections (which rest inside the tumbler), which then transfer it to the upper sections (which keep the tumbler from moving). If all the upper pin sections are lifted in this way, the lock will be able to turn.









It may take a few tries to get the timing right, so keep at it until you're successful.

Determine the type of lock, and understand how it works.,
Obtain a knife to open the door.,
Put the knife blade in the key hole.,
Put the knife between the door and the door jamb’s striker plate.,
Take an unfolded paper clip or hair clip and use it with the knife.,
Try another tool like a credit card or lock picking kit.",How to Open a Door With a Knife," If the door is locked with a bolt in addition to a lock in the door knob, you are going to be out of luck, at least when it comes to using a knife to get it open. However, you should be able to open a typical lock if it uses a spring-loaded latch system or has a button lock.In a spring-loaded system, the latch springs out from a latch pocket that is built into the door jamb and keeps the door shut. But if you turn the knob or handle, you should be able to retract the latch. That is, unless it’s locked.
To unlock this kind of a door, you should be able to take a butter knife or putty knife and manipulate the latch enough to retract it and open the door. The simplest lock to open, though, is the kind with the push button as the locking mechanism. All you will need to do with such a lock is to manipulate the inside of the lock enough to pop the button back out.;
, You may not want to use a very sharp knife or a knife with a very sharp tip to open a door lock. One slip and you could injure yourself with the knife. A simple butter knife or putty knife might work, so considering using that first.


A thin knife with a sharp point may be necessary depending on the size of the keyhole, though. You could use a pocket knife if the lock is very small, such as a bike lock. If the hole in the outside handle is a small circle instead of a slit, you could choose a paperclip or hair clip instead of a knife as it’s safer. If there is a slit on the outside handle, though, a knife should work., Again, you may need a small knife blade to accomplish this. The lock will need to be a pin tumbler lock. Essentially, you will be using the knife as a torque wrench or wiggling it around like a key.Stick the blade into the lock as far as it will go. Put it in the bottom half of the keyhole. Apply pressure, first in one direction, and then in the other direction. Basically, you will want to wiggle the knife around in the keyhole. You may hear a click. If you do, the lock should give a bit. That means you’re in! It can take some time to get the lock open, though., Work it in until you feel the end of the knife bottom out on the door latch. Most people are familiar with how this works. You need to find the spot where the door latches.Pry open the latch by sweeping the end of the knife and moving the latch inward. Take the butter knife, and slide it between the door and the door frame, starting about three inches at the top of the door knob.
Slide the knife until you find the door’s bolt. Push the knife in, working it until you slide the bolt out of the door jamb. , This will increase your chances of success with a knife. Put it above the knife blade, while keeping the knife blade in the key hole.


Apply twisting pressure to the lock with the knife blade at the same time. If using a paper clip, hammer the end of the paper clip to flatten it before trying to put it in the door.You want to rake the pick across the keyhole pins. You want to be careful not to break the lock or the knife so you may need to carefully wriggle the knife for a while until you hear a click.
Insert the tension wrench into the lock opening’s bottom and turn the lock to the side as if you were unlocking the door with a key. Keep holding the tension wrench and apply pressure. Insert the flattened paperclip above the tension wrench, pushing until you meet resistance. Push up on the pin with the paperclip. , The most common tool used to pick a lock is a tension wrench. If you don’t have a tension wrench, you could use a very small hex key. A flat head screwdriver could also work. You could also try a credit card if you’re trying to get through a lever-type doorknob. Just slide the card into the crack in the door, where the lock is, similar to the process with a knife. Be aware you might ruin the card, though.At the same time, put pressure on the door with your free arm so the latch doesn’t spring back out. You may need to make this motion several times before you can get in the door."

Pick a lock with a tension pick set.,
Make your tools.,
Insert the tension wrench.,
Insert the pick above the wrench.",How to Open a Locked Door2," This is a specialized skill that takes a lot of practice and is normally only taught to bona fide locksmiths. The sale of tension pick sets is likewise restricted to people with proper credentials, but with some creativity, you can roughly approximate this tool on your own.








, For weak locks, a pair of paper clips should work; tougher locks might require bobby pins, wire clippers and a pair of pliers. The key is to use metal firm enough for your pick and your tension wrench, the two components of the tool.








Spring steel is the best material to use because it doesn't crack as easily and can be made with a file. You can get these from hacksaw blades. Consider the thickness of the blade because this will restrict the size of the locks that your lock pick will be able to enter.
The tension wrench is made in an “L” shape, and is used to apply tension to the bottom of the lock. You can make this by getting an Allen key and filing it flat.
The pick itself is made with a much shorter leg, like a lowercase “r.” It's used to push pins out of the tumbler so it can rotate.

, Press it in along the bottom of the lock, and apply constant tension on it the whole time as you work with your pick. If you don't it will take longer and you may have to start again.









If you're not entirely certain which direction which way to turn the tension wrench, put it in the lock and turn it one way. Pull out the pick quickly while listening closely to the lock. When you turn in the right direction, you'll actually hear the pins drop.

, Use the leg of the pick to find and push each pin up and out of the tumbler. Once all pins have been moved, the lock should open. As previously noted, this skill takes a lot of practice to master, so have plenty of cheap practice locks on hand if you hope to get good at it.

Open interior doors with a hex wrench.,
Find or purchase a set of hex wrenches.,
Fit the long end of a hex wrench into the hole on the door handle.,
Turn the wrench to open the door.",How to Open a Locked Door3," Most interior locking doors made in the last few decades use a special type of doorknob that allows the door to be opened in the event of it being locked by accident. If your interior door handle has a small, round hole in the center, it is this type of handle.







, Hexagonal or “hex” wrenches, also called “Allen wrenches,” are usually available for less than the cost of a fancy coffee at most hardware and home stores. They are small, L-shaped pieces of metal that come in an array of widths both metric and imperial.








, You may have to try one or two different sizes to find the correct one, but it's usually fairly obvious. You want a fairly snug fit, but you shouldn't have to scrape or jam the wrench in. If you push the wrench in straight while turning it back and forth slightly, you should feel it catch on something.








, Once the wrench is fitted into the handle, a simple turn will unlock it. It shouldn't take a lot of force.

Open a simple lock with a credit card.,
Put the credit card into the side of the door.,
Slowly but firmly pull the card towards you while turning the handle.",How to Open a Locked Door4," This popular trick works less and less on modern doors, but is still a useful way to get into your house with older doors, should you leave without the keys.









Laminated cards tend to work the best. You want a card that is flexible (like a gift card) and one that you don't mind getting damaged. Sometimes you can damage your credit card enough so it won't work any longer.

, Slide the long end of a credit card in between the door frame and the locking side of the door, just above where the lock enters the frame.









Angle the card downward and situate it behind the bolt of the lock. You want to make sure that the card is perpendicular to the door.

, If you're lucky, the credit card will slide in between the beveled interior side of the bolt and the frame, and you'll be able to push the bolt all the way out of the frame by dragging the card towards you. The door will then open, as long as you keep the card in place between the bolt and the hole.









Obviously, this trick will not work if the deadbolt has been set. Deadbolts don't have a beveled side. Fortunately, it's impossible to set your deadbolt from outside without your keys.

Jimmy a car door.,
Unravel and straighten the coat hanger.,
Lift the weather stripping from the bottom of the driver's-side window.,
Scrape the hanger around and feel for a latch.,
Hook and pull the latch.",How to Open a Locked Door5," Although “slim jims” (specialized metal tools for gaining entry to a locked car) are generally illegal, you can approximate the tool with a stiff metal coat hanger. If you've locked your keys in the car and a store or friend with coat hangers is close at hand, this can save you the hassle and waiting of calling a locksmith or roadside assistance service.








, You can leave the hooked top section alone, but unwind it from itself at the “neck” and straighten the rest of the hanger out, giving you a long metal tool with a hooked tip.








, Push the end of the hanger in through the soft rubber weather stripping and the bottom of the window. The hanger is now inside the wall of the door.








, The latch should be no more than a few inches below the window, near where the interior lock is.








, Hook the hanger around the latch and pull it towards the rear of the car. This should unlock any manually locked car door.









If your door has a push-button electric unlocking mechanism, you can also slide the straight end of the hanger down from the top of the window instead, and use it like a finger to poke the button inside.

Break down a door.,
Bust stubborn doors with a battering ram.",How to Open a Locked Door6," In an emergency situation, sometimes your only option is to physically force a door open. Be aware that this will ruin the door frame, the lock, and often the door itself. It's also physically dangerous compared to the other methods, so only use it as a last resort.









Stand in a solid stance. Squarely face the door with your feet roughly shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent. If you can, brace your hands or arms against walls, furniture, or anything else that isn't likely to move when you shove it.
Lift your dominant leg at the knee. Lift your knee straight up and let your lower leg be pulled along with it. Keep your foot facing the door. Don't turn sideways or do anything else fancy.
Kick the lock on the door with the bottom of your foot. This type of kick is sometimes called a “snap kick.” Snap your leg straight out in front of you so that the flat of your foot strikes the door where the locking mechanism is set.
It is safer to kick the door. Your feet are designed to absorb a great deal of force, and your shoes act as additional armor. DO NOT hit the door with your shoulder; you're more likely to dislocate it than you are to open the door.
Continue kicking until the lock breaks from the frame. Given enough time, this will work on nearly any wooden door.
If you don't begin to see results within a few minutes at most, it may be that the door or frame is reinforced. Rest and work in alternating periods so that your kicks don't become weak.

, If for some reason you'd prefer to use a battering ram on a stubborn door rather than simply calling a locksmith, a reasonably effective one can be made from a hand pile driver, the type used to drive posts into the ground.









Purchase your manual pile driver. It should be a few feet long, with longish handles on either side.
Fill the driver all or partway with cement. Be sure to let the cement dry completely before using.
Use a side-tossing motion to drive the ram into the door at the lock mechanism. Swing the ram back across the front of your body with both hands as you stand perpendicular to the door, then lean and strike towards the door with the ram. Most doors should break within a few hits.
Bear in mind that the door will in all likelihood be completely ruined and require a replacement.

Use your fruit as decoration.",How to Add Color to Your Kitchen1," If your kitchen has a relatively neutral color scheme, you can add colorful items of furniture to brighten things up. A chair, stool, or table does not have to be wooden or colored a neutral shade. You can buy furniture in bright colors to lighten up a dim kitchen.For example, add a red table and chairs to an otherwise white kitchen. This will add a nice, bold touch of color.
You can also paint furniture yourself. If you have some old white stools with peeling paint, buy some bright colored paint at a local hardware store and give the chairs a makeover.;
, Do you have dishes in your kitchen you use every day? Why not display them, especially if they would add some color. Instead of placing your pastel coffee mug in the cupboard after your morning cup of coffee, keep it out on a mantel or shadowbox in your kitchen. Place your pastel colored plates on an open kitchen shelf instead of hiding them in a drawer.Make sure to keep breakable items out of reach of children and pets if you're putting them on display.

, There are many items in a kitchen that are generally left out. For example, maybe you always have a coffee pot and a toaster out on your kitchen counter. If it's within your budget, buy brighter versions of these appliances. A bright pink coffee pot and toaster, for example, can add some color to an otherwise dull kitchen., Why store vibrant oranges and bright yellow bananas in the fridge and cupboard? Have a fruit bowl out on your counter where you store such items. Using the naturally bright shades of fruit can add color to your kitchen in a practical way.To add even more color, opt for a brightly colored fruit bowl or basket to display your produce.
Some fruits, like grapes and berries, need to be refrigerated. Refrain from putting those types of fruits in a fruit bowl.

Hold the frame in place.,
Lay the screening material straight on the frame (you need about 1 inch or 3 cm or more oversize around all four sides).,

,
Press aluminum wire screening material into the slots (channels) using the convex end of the spline roller.,
Press the rubber spline into the frame after the aluminum screen is in the slots with help of the concave end of the spline roller.,
Cut the unnecessary screening carefully away with a sharp hobby knife.,
Turn the window screen for the spline to be to the inside.",How to Make a Window Screen," Most aluminum and vinyl frames have a channel for the screen to fit into, so you will need the actual corner to corner dimension inside this channel, minus 4mm or 5mm, about 1/6 in. near 3/16 in. short. Older windows with wooden frames may be trickier, and the corners won't always be square. Ideally, you may be able to use the original screen to obtain dimensions for your new one.


The kind of square cut frame corners that are not mitered have what are called ""external corners"" (vinyl or plastic corner inserts, which can be seen from the outside). These frame pieces must have the size of the corner insert subtracted from the overall length before they are cut to size, to allow for the ""visible square corner pieces"" at each corner. Normally, these inserts are about 3/4 inch (1.9cm) wide, so cutting the frame sides 1 1/2 inches (3.8cm) shorter will give you the;
, You can easily cut a soft metal like aluminum with a hacksaw blade with the right number of teeth per cm or teeth per inch. Find a chart on the packages of hacksaw blades or in a book that will tell you the right number of teeth per cm or teeth per inch for cutting aluminum bars.
If this is the mitered kind, you may just mark 45° using a protractor (or use a ""miter box"" or other mitering saw equipment).
If this is a large screen, it may need a ""cross brace"" cut to width size to fit across half-way of the length to strengthen the frame.

,, Mount the cross brace in the middle into the outer frame if so designed.

, The aluminum framing is soft metal and very flexible and can easily be warped off the straight line (and out of square) as it is screened and splined.


Place the frame in the window to control it. Later you will turn it over to have the spline to the inside. Or...
If you have a floor area where you can work on assembling the screening material, lay a sheet of plywood so you can nail or screw scraps of plywood onto the plywood sheet to make ""guides"" to hold the edges of the frames straight and in square as you roll in the screen and spline.

, With bigger sizes you can span the screen fabric on a few places with small pieces of spline (as retainer) to hold the screen in place until the whole spline can be rolled in.

,, You can use short pieces of spline to hold (retain) the screen in place until the whole screen can be rolled in.

, Roll spline strip in all the way around all four sides. Remove any retainer pieces as you reach their position with the full length spline.


Alternatively, you can roll the spline in (with the concave end of the spline roller) at the same time as the screen is rolled in if you use fiberglass or vinyl screening instead of in two separate steps. (Aluminum screening and the spline would be difficult to roll in together in one step.)

, You can do this with a straight edge to guide the cut and prevent you from slipping and cutting into the screen of the window.

, Position the window for the spring clips upward to fit into the top window slot. Lower the screen frame so that it will be held in place by the lower (retaining) edge, clip or slot.

Increase the tension in the hinges if the door opens and closes too freely.,
Adjust your latch.",How to Level a Door," Measure the “reveal” or top of the door and the head jamb. It should be between one-eighth and three-sixteenth inches (0.3cm to 0.5cm) wide all the way across.;
, If any of them are more than one-quarter inch (0.6cm) out of plumb, or not exactly vertical, you will need to adjust the trim.

,,, The door may be uneven because the floor is uneven. This is a common problem with doors and requires some adjustment in the door installation process.You can adjust the floor level by placing shims below the jambs and across the entryway to square it up. You may need to tear up flooring in order to place the shims underneath.Check with a level again once you install the shims to be sure it is no longer the cause of the problem.

, If the bottom of the door is catching at the carpet, you may need to remove it or hang a slightly smaller door. Remove trim underneath the door or raise the doorjamb by setting it atop scraps of three-eighths to one-half inch trim can put the door at the correct height.

, Use a framing square to see if the trim may be the problem., One possible problem could be that the hinge locations are not parallel.


If you need to adjust the hinge locations, remove the hinges and measure new hinge locations from scratch.
Install shims into the place where the hinge will be. Use wood screws to install the shim. Screw directly into the place where the hinge will go, so that the hinge will hide the screws.
Cut the shims to ensure that they don’t extend past the drywall.

, Fix the jamb by removing it and reinstalling it over shims. When it is level, you will be able to install your hinges.

, Install your hinges.

, Ask a friend to help you lift the door into place to get it onto the hinges. Thread the pins through the door and jamb portions of the hinge.


If your latch hardware is not installed, install the doorknob so that you can test the door.

,, Remove the pins from the door and set your door aside. Place the pin on a hard floor and hit it several times with a hammer.


Rehang the door. The pins will be slightly curved and have more resistance against the hinges., If the door is rattling, bend the prong on the strike plate toward the doorstop. It the door is not catching, bend the prong away from the doorstop.


Then, tighten all the screws.

Have windows professionally inspected.,
Look for cracked or broken panes.,
Examine rubber seals.,
Notice moisture inside window frames.,
Caulk windows.,
Replace weather stripping.,
Invest in storm windows.,
Check locks and latches.,
Insulate during winter.",How to Maintain Windows,"


Hire a home repair or window installation expert to inspect your windows and explain signs of wear or degradation that need maintenance. An expert will be able to point out areas where windows need to be maintained that you might miss and advise you on how to maintain your windows properly.;
,


Broken window panes allow heat to leak out during the winter and could be dangerous, so repair any cracked or broken window panes first.
Consult a professional window or home repair company to repair broken window glass. Do not try to replace broken windows yourself.

,


Rubber window seals hold the window glass into the frame. These seals crack and deteriorate as they age and could need to be replaced. Maintain window seals by inspecting them at least twice a year and having the seals replaced by professionals, as needed.

,


Examine each window for signs of moisture or condensation inside the window or frame. This could include droplets of water or mold. Accumulated moisture is a sign that the window seal is leaking somewhere in the frame and needs to be replaced.

,


Look for gaps between the wall and the window frame or casing. Protect windows by filling in any gaps with window caulk, which will create an airtight seal and prevent damaging moisture from getting into the window.

,


Weather stripping can be found in the groove of the window frame and helps keep heat and energy from escaping and moisture from leaking in. Replace weather stripping if it looks cracked, broken or if there are pieces missing.

,


Storm windows are installed externally and protect your regular windows from damage caused by weather and natural elements. Storm windows are beneficial if your house is old or you live in a climate prone to storms.

,


Window locks keep your house secure and help seal the windows. Replace latches and locks if they are broken and tighten any that are loose.

,


Add extra insulation to windows to protect seals and weather stripping during extreme cold temperatures
Install window treatments with shades and curtains for window protection that is also decorative.
Consider lining windows with insulation during cold months. It will reduce the light coming through the window, but will also help protect the window's seal and frame and keep heat inside.

Add flowers.,
Hang up colorful artwork.,
Lay down a rug.,
Use colorful curtains.,
Hang up a bright tapestry.",How to Add Color to Your Kitchen2," Colorful flowers and plants are a great way to brighten up a kitchen with a more neutral color scheme. Stop by a local greenhouse or department store and select some flowers with a lot of color. You could, for example, hang up a pot of geraniums in the corner of your kitchen or have some bright yellow sunflowers sitting on a kitchen windowsill.Make sure the plants you choose can thrive indoors.
If you don't have the time to care for real plants, fake flowers can also add some color and charm to your kitchen.

, Stop by a local art studio and buy some colorful artwork. A bright impressionist painting hung up over your kitchen counter, or a colorful mobile dangling near a kitchen window, can add a variety of color to an otherwise dull room.If new art work is not within your budget, consider rearranging your home. Transfer a colorful painting from the living room into your kitchen.

, A colorful rug is a great way to spice up a kitchen floor in neutral shade. If the bright white tiles of your kitchen floor bother you, place a colorful rug underneath your dining room table. This can add some color to your kitchen.Pick a rug that's easy to clean. It's inevitable that you'll eventually spill food or drinks on a rug in the kitchen.

, If you have windows in your kitchen, opt for colorful curtains. This is a simple way to incorporate some color into an otherwise dull room. You can, for example, have bright purple curtains hung up near the window by your sink., A tapestry can be a classy item that will brighten up any dull room. You can hang a colorful tapestry up in your kitchen to add a bit of color. Large tapestries can cover almost a whole wall. If you, say, can't stand the off-white paint on your kitchen walls, hang a tapestry up to cover them.You should hang the tapestry away from busier areas in your kitchen, however. You do not want the tapestry to get stained with food as it may be difficult to wash.

An otherwise dull kitchen can really be brightened up with, say, pastel cabinets.If you feel painting the outsides of the cabinets would be too much, you can just paint the insides. You can also simply paint around the edges of the cabinets or the handles.

, Try hiring someone to replace a dull stainless steel or plastic sink with a colorful one. A bright red sink, for example, can brighten up a kitchen that has mostly neutral colors.This can be pricey, however. If you're on a budget, there are many other cheaper ways to brighten up your kitchen.

, If you're able to paint the walls of your kitchen, do not hesitate to go for a bold color. As kitchens are generally smaller rooms, a bolder color will not be overwhelming. Instead of choosing a neutral shade to paint your kitchen, paint it in a bright color you love. You can, for example, paint the walls of your kitchen in a vibrant yellow shade., If you don't want to paint, you can also opt for wallpaper. You can choose a colorful wallpaper pattern to add some color to your kitchen. Wallpaper can be great if you want a particular pattern, such as stripes.If you're renting, you can always purchase temporary wall paper at a department store. This is easily installed with adhesives.

Check the windows before insulating them.,
Wait for a windy day.,
Look at the windows when it rains.,
Perform a light check.,
Do a smoke test.,
Use rubber weather sealing.,
Try rope caulk.,
Apply high-performance sealant.,
Make a draft snake.,
Paint the crack with nail polish.,
Use weather-seal tape.,
Apply window insulation film.,
Stick bubble wrap onto the window.,
Layer shades and curtains.,
Install window insulation panels.",How to Insulate Windows," To save time and money, determine which windows need to be sealed instead of sealing them all.There are multiple ways to check your windows, so choose the option that works best for your current conditions.
If in doubt, you can still insulate a window you aren't sure about. Since many forms of insulation are fairly inexpensive, doing so may ultimately prove more cost-effective than leaving it alone.;
, Feel around the window frame during the next windy day. If you can feel air coming through the seals, you'll need to insulate the window.


To detect small leaks, you may need to moisten your fingertips before running them along the seams. Wet skin is more sensitive to shifts in air current than dry skin.

, Moisture trapped between panels or in the frame indicates a leak.


When moisture builds up in the corner of the window or along one of its edges, the problem likely lies in the seams.
Moisture that builds up in the middle of the window panel may indicate some type of crack or chip in the glass.

, On the next sunny day, look around the edges of the window frame and determine if any light peeks through.


This can be a difficult type of check to perform since the sun needs to shine directly on the window. You'll also need to verify that the light you see is coming from beneath the frame instead of the glass itself.

, To check the window regardless of current weather conditions, light a candle or incense stick and hold it around various places around the frame.


Watch the smoke coming from the candle. If it gets sucked into the frame at any given point, there is a leak at that specific point.

, Trim down self-adhesive weather sealing strips to match the dimensions of your window, then simply stick the strips directly to the inner frame to seal off any spaces along the edges.This options is fairly inexpensive and easy to apply, but you'll need to replace the strips periodically. When you peel them away, they may leave a residue or cause chips in your paint, so be prepared to touch up the area if you don't plan on immediately applying another strip.

, Rope caulk comes in the form of packaged strips. Use a knife to cut the strips down to match the length of each window seam, then press each strip into its respective seam to seal the area.


Manipulate and press the putty in place using your fingers. If you need to remove the caulk, you can peel it away with your fingers, as well.

, For something a little more durable than rope caulk, use high-performance caulk sealant or low-expansion foam. You can squeeze caulk into the gaps along the exterior side of your window seam using a caulk gun or apply expansion foam to the same seams using a shooter foam gun.


Apply an even, continuous bead of caulk along the entire exterior seam. You should be able to use it on most building materials. When cured, the sealant should block drafts and moisture, making it resistant to mildew and other fungi. Cured caulk can also be painted.
When applying expansion foam, test its expanded volume with a small drop placed in the corner of the window. Once you've determined how much it expands, use that knowledge to apply the necessary bead amount around the entire seam.

, Sew a simple fabric tube to match the width of the window. Fill it with dried rice or polyester stuffing, then place it along the bottom of your window inside your home.


You can also purchase draft snakes or draft snake kits online and at some superstores or department stores. Foam-and-fabric draft snake kits will allow you to customize the snake to fit the length of your windowsill; simply cut the enclosed foam tube down to size and insert it into the washable cover.
When making your own draft snake, note that heavier materials (denim, corduroy, etc.) tend to work better than lighter materials (linen, knits, etc.).
Note that this will only insulate the seam along your windowsill. You won't be able to use a draft snake to seal the top and side seams.

, For small cracks in the glass, apply several coats of clear nail polish directly over the damaged area. Wait until each coat dries before applying another.Note that this is only a temporary fix. The polish should seal the crack and prevent it from spreading for several months, but it will eventually wear off. Cracked window glass will need to be replaced.

, Cut a small strip of clear weather-seal tape and place it directly over the crack in the glass. The tape should last for several months and prevent air from flowing through the crack.


As with nail polish, weather-seal tape should only be used as a temporary fix. You'll eventually need to replace the cracked window glass to prevent the crack from getting worse.

, Trim the film down to size, if necessary, then stick it to the inner glass of your window using double-sided tape. You'll also need to shrink the film with a hair dryer for an improved seal.


This is another inexpensive and simple solution, and it's as simple to remove as it is to apply. You may wish to soak the tape in rubbing alcohol before peeling it away, though, to minimize the risk of peeling away any paint or leaving any sticky residue.
The film will create a noticeable haze over your window. Light should still shine through, but it may not be the most aesthetically pleasing option.

, Spray the window with water, then press a sheet of trimmed bubble wrap directly onto the wet glass. It should stick without difficulty and remain in place for several months.Bubble wrap can be even cheaper than window insulation film. Opt for bubble wrap with large bubbles since it tends to insulate better than the smaller bubble type.
Trim the bubble wrap so that it slightly overlaps the seams of your window. When applying it to the window, the bubble-side should face the glass. If desired, you can apply a double layer of bubble wrap for even better insulation.
If the bubble wrap won't stick to your window on its own, you may need to use double-sided tape to help it stay in place.
Bubble wrap will block the view from the window, but it should allow light to come through without difficulty.
To remove the bubble wrap, simply peel it away, moving from one corner to the diagonally opposite corner. The bubble wrap itself usually won't leave any stain, but you may need to clean the window to return the glass to full visibility.

, Install cellular shades over your window, then fit heavy curtains over the shades. Either option on its own should provide considerable insulation, but pairing the two together will help even more.Cellular shades are also known as honeycomb shades due to their unique structure. Folds of fabric create layers of air pockets, and these layer trap more air than standard shades can. These shades allow light to filter in and can be custom-fitted to match the dimensions of your windows, but they can also be fairly expensive.
Heavy curtains have an elegant appearance, but they can also be somewhat expensive, and they'll only insulate your windows when drawn closed. Unlike cellular shades, curtains will block out the light when closed.

, Mount the aluminum frame of the window to the interior side of your window. Each frame has weatherstripping around the the perimeter, and that weatherstripping should seal the existing window.


When you purchase a window panel kit, you should get all the necessary components and specific installation instructions. You won't be able to custom-fit the panel, though, so make sure that the dimensions of the aluminum frame match the dimensions of your window before purchasing the kit.
The panel creates a secondary air pocket in between it and the existing window, and excess air flowing through cracks and leaks should get trapped inside that pocket.

The boards should be as long as the doors and about 1 inch (or 4 cm) wider than the track.;
,,, The tracks should be exactly as long as the section along which you wish the door to slide.


If installing two sliding doors, remember that the tracks should be twice as wide as each door so that you can slide two doors together on one track. If only installing one door, the track need only be as wide as the door, but keep in mind that you will want the track to be about twice the length of the door so that you can open it completely.
They should occur every 6 inches (or 15 cm) or so, and should be located in the middle of the track. If you are attaching the track to softer or weaker material, measure more holes.

Write down the measurements or type them into your phone.
Take photos of the space to reference while you shop.

, Visit your local furniture stores to pick out your pieces. Ask a friend or the person you live with to come along and provide a second opinion. If you pulled out inspiration photos, bring those as well. This will help you know what pieces you’re interested in buying for your space.

Look for sturdy pieces if you use your furniture a lot. For example, if you use your dining table for homework sessions and work as well as for eating all of your meals, then invest in hardy pieces.You can also find items at flea markets, second hand stores, department stores, or on resale websites.
Popular dining room pieces include a dining table and chairs, a hutch, a china cabinet, and a buffet.

, If you don’t have a lot of space in your dining room, then buy fewer pieces that can do more work. For example, look for a hutch that has more built in cabinet space, and choose a dining table that has collapsible or removable table leaves.

A round table works better in a smaller space because it takes up less room., If you have a big dining room, look for larger items like a statement table, a huge painting, or a large mirror. Look for a dining set that comes with additional pieces, such as a hutch or cabinet that matches your dining room table., If you’ve chosen big or expensive pieces, such as a rug, a painting, or a nice dining set, build the rest of the room around those pieces.

Repeat, if required, with a second coat.",How to Paint a Bathroom," Remove electrical outlet and wall switch covers, towel bars, window treatments, and cabinet handles or knobs.;
, Complete toilet removal is not mandatory to paint a bathroom, but it is suggested to make painting the wall behind the toilet easier. In some cases, toilet tanks might be too close to the wall for paint application.

, Tape at least 2 inches (5 centimeters) in width is recommended. Smooth down tape with a putty knife to ensure full adherence and to avoid any paint getting under the tape.

, Make sure the edges of the drop cloths are up against the baseboard to avoid any paint dripping onto exposed areas of the floor.

, Use a brush around the edges where the ceiling meets the walls. Complete the job by using a roller on the end of an extension pole. Allow for required drying time, then apply a second coat of paint to the ceiling.

, If your bathroom is currently dark and you are looking to make it brighter with a light, softer color, you will need to prime the walls. Follow manufacturer instructions for application details and dry time.

, Start in one corner and work in one direction around the entire room.

, As with cutting in, start in one corner and work in one direction around the room. Paint using a vertical motion. Avoid applying too much pressure to the roller.

, Many paint manufacturers recommend applying 2 coats of paint for best results. Be sure to wait the recommended drying time between coats.

Choose a frame.",How to Install Replacement Windows1," This choice should be made based on the styling of your home, as well as your budget. The four common frame types are: wood, vinyl or metal clad wood, and all vinyl or all wood.


Wood Frames: If the exterior of your home features natural wood siding, a wood frame will complement your home nicely. Wood frames are generally more expensive, but they do offer a low heat transfer and can be very energy efficient. If you’re looking for low maintenance, however, they don’t exactly fit the bill. They must be properly primed and painted, as well as repainted every few years to maintain their appeal.
Vinyl/Metal Clad Window Frames: Many replacement window manufacturers offer a wood frame window with a metal or vinyl “wrapping” on the exterior of the window. As long as the “wrapping” is sealed, the window is relatively maintenance free. You can also choose a color that complements the exterior of your home, without having to repaint every few years.

Keep in mind that although the window unit is maintenance free, you will still have to either paint the exterior trim to match the window wrapping or replace the trim with a vinyl product like Azek.


Metal Window Frames: If you’re looking for low maintenance as well as low cost, a metal frame might be a good choice. Metal windows and siding are less stylish than they used to be, but that doesn't mean that you can't make them look good in your home.
Vinyl Frames: Vinyl replacement windows are extremely popular because they are easy to install, cost effective, and energy efficient.

Take the width measurement from inside-to-inside of the window frame.,
Take the height measurement from the bottom of the window frame to the top of the window frame.,
Check the window frame for plumb and level.,
Reduce both the width and height measurements by by 1/4″.",How to Install Replacement Windows2,";
,


Some people take the height measurement from the top of the sill. This leaves room to attach a “header expander” to the top of the new window. Others, though, dislike using header expanders because they decrease effective window size, and complicate the trim process.

, Since the new unit will need to be installed at least close to plumb, adjust your measurements accordingly. This will ensure that you have the largest size window that can be installed plumb, and level in the opening provided.

, This is due to the fact that replacement windows are made to order in increments of 1/4.″

"
"
Use a utility knife to score the paint along the edges of the window stops.,
Tug on the top of the individual window to loosen the stops once they've been removed from the window.",How to Install Replacement Windows3," This will keep the paint from chipping or peeling away from the casing when you remove the stops. This will also make removing the window stops easier; paint is a surprisingly good adhesive.


Use a thin flat-bar or even a putty knife to separate stubborn joints. This will minimize denting or marring other parts of the window trim.

, Using a hinging motion, swing the top of the window into the room until it is horizontal. Then, twist the window into the opening by lifting up one side and pressing down on the other until the window is free.


Every window is different—some might take a little muscle to remove. Don’t worry about scratching the inside of the jambs while removing the window; it’ll get covered anyway.
If the window is cracked or particularly stubborn, wear gloves and eye protection in case it shatters while removing it.

"
"
Use a putty knife or flat-bar to remove any old sealant or paint chunks from the inside of the jambs, the exterior window stops, and the inside edge of the windowsill.,
Clean the surrounding area thoroughly.",How to Install Replacement Windows4," If the original window was an older, weighted window, there may be pulleys at the top of the jamb that need to be removed. Clear any dust from the bottom corners of the frame to ensure a good bond with the sealant.

, If there were weights, remove the pulleys and apply a small amount of caulk to any holes.

"
"
Locate the sill flashing and the four long installation screws after unwrapping the new vinyl window and discarding of that pesky header expander.,
Lay the sill flashing centered on the windowsill.,
Apply a 3/8″ bead of silicone or silicone fortified sealant to the inside surface of the exterior stops.,
Snap the sill flashing onto the bottom, outer rim of the new window unit.

,
Lift the new window into the opening with the top angled into the room.,
Using the four provided screws, fasten the window to the frame at the four pre-drilled locations.,
Tighten the screws until they hold the window firmly in place.",How to Install Replacement Windows5," Sill flashing for a vinyl window is an “L” shaped piece of vinyl that is the same width as the replacement window unit. The vertical part of the “L” shape is slotted, allowing it to clip onto the bottom, outer edge of the window unit and shed water away from the bottom of the window.

, Mark both sides where it hits the exterior window stops. Remove the lower part of the “L” shape on both sides as marked to allow the sill flashing to fit into place. Once trimmed, lay the sill flashing back in place and trace the outside edge with a pencil.

, Make sure you get both sides and the top. Then, apply a 1/4″ bead directly to the wood sill on the inside of your pencil line.

,, The bottom should be angled away and in to the opening. Once the bottom of the unit has cleared the sill and is against the exterior stops, press down on the window and swing the top into the frame.


Press the window firmly and evenly against the stops to ensure a good seal.

, (These are usually located about four inches from the top and bottom on both sides.

, Be sure the window is centered in the window opening. (Keep in mind that vinyl is much softer, and more flexible than wood. Over-tightening the screws can damage the frame of the window.)

"
"
Fully close and lock the window.

,
Fully open the window by lifting the bottom sash.

,
Close the window almost completely.,
Stop adjusting once the gap is even.

",How to Install Replacement Windows6,",, Leave about a 1/4″ gap along the bottom. This gap should be parallel to the windowsill.


If the gap is larger on the right side, loosen the top right screw and tighten the top left screw or loosen the bottom left screw and tighten the bottom right screw.
If the gap is larger on the left side, loosen the top left screw and tighten the top right screw or loosen the bottom right screw and tighten the bottom left screw.

,"
"
Use a rag with water or paint thinner (depending on your choice of sealant) to clean any excess sealant from the frame of the window.

,
Check the perimeter of the window for good contact with the exterior window stops.",How to Install Replacement Windows7,", If necessary, apply a thin bead around the perimeter to eliminate any voids, and leave a smooth, weather-tight seal.

Paint or otherwise decorate the wall as you see fit.,
Install the door trim.",How to Install Pocket Doors," This kit should contain the door, split studs that allow the door to retract into the wall, a track on which the door runs into the wall, and door hardware. Most are under $100.









You may be able to find pocket doors at lumberyards, too. Regardless of where you go, you should easily find kits for doors that are 1 1/8 inches to 1 3/4 inches thick by 6 feet (1.8 m) 8 inches high. If your door is not a standard size, talk to a professional about getting the job done.;
, The last thing you want to do is to tear a hole into your wall only to find that it's not feasible to put a door there. Before you go about drilling and tearing down, check for the following things:

Check if there's enough room in the wall. You need just over twice the width of the door (so it can hide).
Check if the wall is load-bearing or just a partition. If it is load bearing, you'll need a new header and a means of temporary support while the door is being worked on.
Check for wiring or plumbing. A wall with pipes in it is not a good place to put a door. Wiring can be easily detected with a cheap voltage sensor.

, If you're replacing a door with a pocket door, you'll need to get rid of the existing door. Start with removing the molding and, with a reciprocating saw blade, cut the shims. When the nails are cut, you can remove the door frame.

Door jambs aren't nailed against the studs in the wall – they're just spaced with wooden shims.

, Do this slowly to make sure you haven't missed any obstacles within the wall. Remove the drywall a few inches above where the header will be, but don't go all the way to the ceiling – that just means more work later.








, This makes room for the new framing. You may find this step easier if you use a combination of a circular saw and a small hand saw; you do not want to accidentally damage the wall you did not cut away. The goal is to leave large enough holes in the studs to allow the pocket door to pass through.









A standard pocket door is 1.75 inches (4.4 cm) wide. To make this step even easier, look for a pocket door kit that comes with split studs.

, It's possible that your door will require a header of a different height. The height of your header is determined by whether or not you need a new soleplate. If the floor covering above the subfloor is minimal, the split-stud brackets can be secured directly to the floor. To determine the header height for most standard kits, figure the length of the new door, plus 3 1/4"" and the height of the soleplate, if any. Once the appropriate length is determined, install a new stud this length from the existing stud on the opposing side. Nail the new header in place (or screw) and then cut and fit the soleplate to the floor.

To adjust the header, use a reciprocating saw to remove the partition header currently in place. Then, cut away the studs, just like in the above, to make space for the framing.
Cut the nails that are between the studs and the soleplate and then determine the height of your desired header before cutting the stud tops to length. Otherwise, you may end up with a frame that is not to size.

, Your pocket door kit should contain the rails on which the door slides into the wall. Install the slider track using the directions that come with your pocket door kit, screwing the brackets into the studs. If you are also installing pre-split studs, you can install them after you install the slider track.









If you need to cut the track to length, use the mark on it that corresponds to your door size. Most, if not all, kits come with these markers. Use a hacksaw on the channel and a handsaw on the nailers.
Make sure your track is level. If it's not, it won't slide easily in and out of its pocket.

, Make sure that the door is sliding easily and stays level. Mount hangers on the top of the door – this is how the door will slide. Then, slide the wheeled carriages into the track. Hook the hangers onto the carriages. Once it's all set, adjust the assembly until the door hangs plumb and is in place.








, For this part, you'll need panel adhesive and screws. However, don't move onto taping and mudding just yet – there's still a bit more work to be done.








, The pocket door kit should have come with door latch hardware. Some of this will be attached to the door and some will be attached to the wall. Follow the instructions that came with the pocket door kit. Make sure the door is still sliding easily on the track and that the latches line up as needed.




, At this point, you can tape and mud the drywall. Apply plenty of drywall compound, aiming for multiple coats over every seam. Embed tape in it, then get rid of any excess compound. Allow it to dry, sand it, then apply the next layers of compound using the same method as necessary.









When you are finished, sand the drywall to make it finished and smooth.

, The hard part is done – all you have to do now is return the wall to its original (or new and improved) state.









Do this before you install the door trim, unless you want the door trim painted, too. This way if your lines aren't perfectly straight, the trim will cover them right up.

, The trim hardware should have come in your pocket door kit. Install it according to the pocket door kit instructions. Nail or screw it to the jamb and the door studs.









That's it! Your pocket door is officially ready for use and looks like it was installed professionally.

If you use exterior primer before you paint, the paint will last 10 years or more. I painted a building 10 years ago with exterior Behr primer and exterior Behr paint and it still has not peeled. You might have to use a belt sander to get off all the old paint but it is well worth it. Be sure and use a dust mask because old paint has lead and if you breath it, it will give you lead poisoning. I usually wash the windows with a hose to reduce dust but I have someone inside with towels that goes around the window to keep the water from leaking inside.

, Use warm water with a mild soap or detergent to clean off the grime.
Allow the cleaning to dry.
Place masking tape at the edges where the glass meets the putty around the wood frame. This will protect the glass from the sanding and the fresh paintwork.

Work in M-shaped strokes.,
Cover your original strokes with vertical strokes.",How to Emulsion Walls," You'll need a basecoat of white emulsion plus an overcoat in any color you'd prefer. Only the overcoat will be seen when finished.


Emulsion paint comes in three different finishes: vinyl matte, vinyl soft sheen, and vinyl silk. Matte emulsion hides imperfections well, but soft sheen emulsion is more durable. Silk emulsion is the most durable and handles high-moisture areas better than the other two, but its glossiness tends to draw attention to imperfections on the surface of the wall.
The white basecoat should usually be matte emulsion, but the overcoat can be any of the three varieties.;
, Typically, it's best to ""cut in"" the paint around the corners of the wall using a paint brush. The rest of the wall should usually be painted with a roller, however.


A 2-inch (5-cm) paintbrush should work adequately well for cutting in the sides of the wall.
Lambswool, foam, and mohair rollers can all be used with emulsion paint. As a general rule, you should use a roller with a greater amount of nap (more thickness) for rougher or more uneven surfaces.

, Before painting, you should remove as many decorations and as much furniture as possible. Cover the floor with a plastic drop cloth to shield it from any stray emulsion.If there's a radiator on your wall, consider turning it off and removing it while applying the emulsion paint. Allow the radiator to cool and drain before removing it.
Turn off or block all electrical outlets. Cover the edges of light switch plates and outlet plates with painter's tape.
Apply painter's tape over the skirting boards, floor, ceiling, door frame, and window frames immediately adjacent to the wall.

, Scrub the wall down with warm water and mild detergent to remove any oils from the surface. Rinse with clean water and let the surface dry.


You can scrub, rinse, and dry the wall using clean rags.
It's very important to let the wall dry before continuing. Since emulsion is a water-based paint, applying it to water-covered surfaces could prevent it from adhering correctly.

, If the current wall surface is glossy or smooth, rubbing it down with 40-grit sandpaper could help the emulsion adhere more effectively.


Wrap the sandpaper around a cork block and gradually work over the entire surface of the wall.
When finished, use a lily bristle brush to sweep away any dust from the wall.

, Emulsion that sits in storage will usually develop lumps and skin. It might be a good idea to strain these solid portions and mix the paint before use.


Check the manufacturer's recommendations since the best mixing practices can vary by brand and make.
Place tights or cheesecloth over the paint bucket, then pour the paint into a separate bucket through that material. Doing so will generally strain most solid pieces from the paint.
You should also use a wooden paint stirrer to quickly combine the paint before use.

, Using a basecoat will help cover any color or pattern currently on your wall, thereby preventing that original color from showing through your final overcoat of paint.


To prepare a basecoat, combine one part white emulsion with three parts water in a clean, empty bucket. Use a paint stick to thoroughly blend the mixture.
Apply the basecoat using the same technique you'll use for the overcoat emulsion. “Cut in” the seams of the wall using a paintbrush, then apply it to the remaining wall surface using a paint roller.
Allow the basecoat to thoroughly dry before proceeding with the overcoat.

, You should “cut in” the emulsion around the seams of the wall using a paintbrush. After the seams are covered, switch to your paint roller and apply the emulsion to the rest of the wall.


Cutting in should be done around all seams of the wall and in any area the roller won't reach. This includes any area where the wall meets other walls, ceiling, or floor. Additionally, all seams around electrical outlets, light switch plates, doors, and windows should also be cut in.
Any area that can be easily accessed with a roller should generally be painted with a roller. Other tools, including large paint brushes and paint pads, can be used instead of a roller, but for the sake of ease and consistency, paint rollers are generally best.

, You may need to use more than one coat of emulsion, but you should allow each coat to finish drying before applying another one over it.


This also means that you should allow the white basecoat to dry before applying a top coat in your final color.
The necessary number of coats will vary depending on the color you choose and the original color of the wall. Dark colors are difficult to paint over and may require as many as three coats, especially if your new paint is lighter.
For more specific guidelines, check the emulsion manufacturer's recommendations, which can usually be found on the label.

, If any emulsion drops onto the floor or onto another hard surface you don't wish to paint, immediately wipe it away with a damp rag.


Since emulsion paint is water-based, it's usually easier to clean than oil-based paints. Get to the spill before it dries, however.
If the spill does dry, you may need to apply an appropriate paint thinner to the area before wiping it clean.

, Fill a 2.5 qt (2.5 L) paint kettle or bucket halfway with emulsion. Work with the paint in this kettle during the entire cutting in procedure.


Use a 2-inch (5-cm) wide paintbrush for best results.
When dipping the brush into the emulsion, only submerge approximately one-third of the bristle length.

, Hold the brush at a 90-degree angle away from the adjacent surface, then apply the emulsion using straight strokes that run parallel to that same adjacent surface.Apply the first straight stroke within 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the seam.
After completely the first stroke, turn the brush so that the long edge is perpendicular to the seam. Work back over the original stroke, carefully pushing the paint into the seam in the process.
When finished, roughly 2 inches (5 cm) of wall space should be covered by the emulsion. Corners that meet in three dimensions, like the space between two wall corners and a ceiling, may require a slightly wider cutting in area.

, After you finish cutting in the edges, you should immediately begin to emulsion the rest of the wall. Do not wait for the cutting in emulsion to dry.


If the emulsion does dry completely, the areas you cut in may remain visibly separate from the rest of the painted surface.

, Pour the emulsion into a paint tray until the tray is roughly one-third full.


Use a tray specifically designed for use with paint rollers. There should be a sunken well at one end and a ribbed, slanted platform extending up toward the other. Pour the paint directly into the sunken well.

, Quickly dunk the soft sleeve of the paint roller in water. Gently squeeze out any excess water before continuing.


To remove the excess water, pass the roller over clean paper towels or other non-inked absorbent paper material.
The water will not dilute the color of the emulsion. Since emulsion is a water-based paint, however, water can help the roller apply the paint in smoother, more even strokes.

, Dip the paint into the filled well of the roller tray. Spread the paint over the sleeve by passing it up and down the ribbed platform, then lift the roller out of the tray.


You only need to apply a light coat of paint to the roller. If emulsion drips off when you lift it up, there's too much on it. Roll the roller over the platform again to scrape away some of the excess.

, Mentally divide the remaining wall into 1-yard (1-meter) squares. Paint the wall one square at a time until the entire surface is covered.Tackle the square in the top corner first. If one corner is closer to a window than the other, choose that one since the sunlight can make it easier for you to check the application and coverage of the emulsion.

, Place the loaded roller in the center of the square, then roll over the all in diagonal M-shaped strokes.


Start at the bottom of one side and work toward the opposite side.
After the first ""M,"" you'll need to lift the roller and create another ""M"" over the first. This second ""M"" should be perpendicular to the first.
Repeat these diagonal strokes, reloading the paint as needed and changing the angle periodically, until the entire square has been covered.

, After covering the entire square with diagonal M-shaped strokes, roll over the area in parallel vertical strokes.


Overlap the strokes slightly so that the emulsion blends together evenly.
Try to overlap the paint onto the ""cut in"" areas around the seams of the wall.

,, If working indoors, protect surfaces from over spray with canvas tarps or plastic sheets. Be sure that you can access every area of your project without moving it. You need ample space to spray gelcoat in a continuous line without having to stop. Too many stops will allow the gelcoat to begin to set and clog the spray tip.

, Wipe down the surface with a wet rag and allow to dry.

, The surface should be hard enough that there is little impression left when you press your fingernail into it.

,, This may take 3 passes with the spray gun to ensure the 10 mil coating. This layer should be allowed to dry for at least 24 hours or to a hard finish. If the surface seems to resemble orange peel, don't worry. This is normal and will be fixed in the next step.

, Wipe down with a damp cloth and allow to dry.

, This layer of gelcoat will be thinner than the others so watch for runs. Spray a thin layer approximately 5 mils thick, and come back in 5 minutes and spray a second 5 mils layer.

,, Work up in increasingly finer grits to a 1000 grit making sure that there are no scratches from the previous sanding left before switching.

, Buff if necessary to achieve a high-gloss finish.

Clear the room!,

Wipe off the trim edges with a damp cloth to remove any dust so that the tape has a good surface to adhere to.,
Use painters blue tape to mask off all trim.,
Using the 2” tape, mask the ceiling along the walls.,
Run a thin bead of caulk along all the edges you have just taped, using a caulk gun and paintable caulk.,
You can use a paper hand masker, which combines a roll of masking paper and a roll of tape so that you can cover a wider area to protect from paint splatter.,
Let the caulk dry for 20 minutes.,
Brush in the borders of the wall up to the taped edges, using your brush.

,
Carefully paint the walls, using a roller and a roller pan.,
Paint the room and let it dry as per the manufacturer’s instructions.,

Remove the tape by pulling the tape off at least a 90 degree angle from the trim surface.",How to Create Clean Paint Edges on Interior Walls," If that is not an option, move everything to the center of the room. Remove pictures and nails and anything that you do not want painted.;
, Nail holes are obvious after you paint so take the extra time and make the room look good by filling the holes.

, Go around the room and wipe any baseboards, door trim, window trim and crown molding on the edge that butts up to the wall surface.

, Using regular masking tape can cause the trim paint to pull up and you may be stuck repainting trim. Use the 1” tape. The secret here is to tape slowly and carefully, leaving a small gap between the edge of the tape and the wall surface to be painted. A 1/16” to 1/8” gap will suffice. Remember that the walls will be painted to this point so the finished product will only be as good as the prep you put into it. If the tape is not straight, then the final result will be a curvy paint line.

, This gives you forgiveness if you accidentally roll the roller onto the ceiling. It also allows you to make a true straight line at the joint between wall and ceiling instead of trying to feather a straight line with the edge of a brush. Use the same gap as listed in step 4.

, (Note: make sure the caulk being used is paintable.) Using your finger tip, wipe the caulk edge down so that the caulk is a very thin film over the edge of the tape into the corner of the wall and trim. Remove any excess! This is a critical step and separates an alright looking room from a professional job. This stops paint from seeping under the tape edge and gives the room a superior clean edge when the job is done and the tape is removed. The reason for the small gap when masking is to allow an edge for the caulk to remain on the same plane as the tape. If the tape were butted into the corner, the caulk would sit above the tape and when it came time to remove the tape, the caulk would actually be in the way and rip up sections of wall paint. Take your time in doing this and the results are well worth the effort.

, This is totally optional; it just saves clean up time in the long run. As long as you are careful, the 1” tape along the trim and 2” tape along the ceiling will suffice.

, It should be very thin in the first place so it should not even need to be that long. Better to be safe than sorry. While the caulk is drying lay out tarps along the walls you are going to paint.

,, If you roll the roller too quickly paint drops will go flying everywhere. Also be careful when rolling up to the ceiling edge. Depending on the nap (thickness) of the roller you are using you may unintentionally bump part of the ceiling. Take your time and pay attention and this will not be an issue.

, You are not done yet. You need a second coat to get full coverage. So go around the room again and repeat the brush and rolling steps. Don’t race! You are already committed; why not get a good product out of it.

, Yes, overnight. Do not pull the tape off yet. Letting the paint dry completely lessens the elasticity of paint build-up along the edges.

, This allows the point of release to act like a single point rather than over a longer area. The paint edge should be a perfect line with no bleed through. If you are having problems with the tape pulling up and stretching the paint, the fault lies in over application of caulk. Making sure the caulk is thin is a very crucial step. If you find yourself with this difficulty, use a razor blade to get past the build-up. If you follow the instructions carefully you will remove the tape and find a beautiful room with perfect edges. Everyone who sees the room will be amazed at how clean and professional a job you have done.

Galvanized steel should not be painted with oil-based paint. Many paint manufacturers recommend using only latex paint over steel.
Determine if the siding has been previously painted and what kind of paint has been used. If possible, bring a sample to a professional.
Aluminum can be difficult to tell apart from vinyl if brand new. Check for cracks or dings in the siding. If the siding is cracked or broken, it is vinyl. Dings or bumps are an indication of aluminum. Try tapping on the siding because aluminum sounds hollow and lightly metallic. Use a magnet to determine if your siding is steel versus aluminum because magnet will stick to an steel siding but not aluminum. steel will also show red-brown rust. ;
, It’s best to use a power washer, angling the spray in the direction rain would hit the house as washing from the bottom up can cause unnecessary damage to the siding.If you choose to use any chemicals, complete a final rinse to remove remaining materials because residual chemicals can be damaging to your painting process.


If you’ve got stubborn stains, try cleaning with a biodegradable laundry detergent by mixing approximately ¼ cup (60 milliliters) detergent with 4 gallons (16 litres) of water.Rub your hand along the siding when it is dry to check for chalking, which is common. If a powdery substance comes off, don’t be alarmed because this is chalking, which is normal in paint made for aluminum substances. This powdery substance acts as a self-cleaner for the siding. Simply choose a detergent containing TSP (trisodium phosphate) to remove the chalking.Repair any damaged siding by banging out any dents or sags or removing unsalvageable pieces altogether.

, Depending on how big the area is that you want to paint, you may want to use a power sander. Always start with a rough sandpaper and finish with a fine. Make sure to avoid etches and special molding, so that you don’t damage them. Give your siding a sweep afterwards, from the top down, to ensure you’ve removed all the metal filings and any chipped paint.


Use rough sandpaper (80 grit) to start your sanding. Do a rough once over while making sure to keep your motion in the same direction.
Move up to a more fine sandpaper (150 grit) and do a second pass over the siding.
If you want to use a power sander, be cautious when applying pressure to prevent any damage to the siding.
Don’t use less than 80 grit sandpaper as it can cause permanent damage to the metal., Whether you ask your friends or need to rent one, there are cost effective ways to acquire a power washer, especially if you only plan to use it once.


Power washers can be rented inexpensively at a hardware store, so contact your local stores to compare prices and availability.
Pressure is typically measured in water per square inch which generally ranges from 2000psi to 2800psi for a gas powered washer vs 1300psi to 1700psi for an electric one. Higher pressure means higher power but it also means more noise, therefore, be aware of the disturbance you may create for your neighbours.If they don’t come with the rental, don’t forget to use the proper safety tools that coincide with power washer use such as waterproof boots, goggles, gloves and ear protection.

, Look for an oil-based primer. The oil-base will absorb any chalking pigment and acts as an extra layer of protection from the outside elements.You can also use an acrylic primer which will act as a strong base while sticking to metal and not reacting to any possibly-missed oxidation on the siding.Be cautious when using an acrylic primer, which can only be paired with acrylic paint.
Avoid latex primer since it generally contains ammonia, which reacts over time with aluminum to form microscopic gas bubbles and can lead to premature failure of the primer, removing the paint from the surface or the siding.

, Select a paint meant for aluminum that’s acrylic exterior grade paint. This is an all-seasonal paint, which will hold up better, cover better and is less likely to fade. Stay away from high gloss paints which reflect the sun’s glare. Try to select an eggshell or satin finish because it is more flattering for your home as it wears better than a matte finish., Whether you use a brush, roller or sprayer, choose beforehand and know how to use your tool efficiently. Brushes, while most inexpensive, are the most time-intensive way to paint your siding. In contrast, using a spray machine will be the most time-effective way but also the most expensive. The happy medium would be using a roller; not only are they moderately priced, but they can also be used with relative ease.


When working with brushes or rollers, stick with synthetic fibre brushes or a lambswool roller. This will give your siding a smooth finish.
If you’re using a sprayer, use an airless sprayer with a .017 gun tip for a smooth application. While you can rent a professional machine in most areas, it’s best to compare prices and availability.

, Both paint brushes and sprayers will need the added height associated with using a ladder. Straining to get the height and avoiding use of a ladder will leave paint splotchy and uneven.


Splurge and pick up a handle extension for your roller. With ranch-style homes, you’ll be able to forgo a ladder and use the handle extension. If you have a multiple story home, you’ll skip some steps on your ladder when reaching for the top of your siding.

, When priming and painting, weather must be considered. Each product will state acceptable temperature ranges but a good rule of thumb is to not paint in weather colder than 50 F (10 C) or on rainy days. Moisture from dew or rain will ruin a new application of paint.


When priming or painting, begin on a portion that is shaded from the sun as painting in direct sunlight can cause cracks and bubbles from drying too fast.In turn, any bubbles or cracks will have to be sanded out after drying.

, Next, roll backwards in the opposite direction. This is to ensure an even and complete coat has been applied. Applying primer should only take a few seconds per foot applied. Apply at least two coats of primer sparingly to the siding to ensure proper coverage.Don’t worry if you can see the metal or previous paint through the primer. Your coat should be thin enough to dry fast but still visible to the eye.
Always begin priming at one end of the siding. By working left to right, or right to left, rather than starting in the middle, the primer will dry evenly as you work. This is a great way to avoid visible lines dried within your progress.
Allow full drying time between coats. If you don’t wait long enough, peeling or bubbling can occur. Full drying time will vary between brands, however, a four hour drying time is a good rule of thumb.
Since it is to be covered up, primer can be great practice for airbrushing techniques., Paint in long, even strokes, making sure not to overdo it. If your paint is dripping then you have too much.


Work from the top down to eliminate dripping paint from ruining your hard work.
If your siding is horizontal, paint left to right. If vertical, paint up to down. This ensures even coats and will prevent you from missing any spots. As a rule of thumb, paint takes two hours to dry.To test the dryness of your paint, touch the siding with your finger in an inconspicuous area. If the paint no longer feels tacky or sticky, it’s completely dried. This means you’re ready for your second coat.
Plan your breaks. Any siding that is partially painted and left to dry is at risk for lasting, visible lines. This can be avoided by finishing each individual piece of siding as you go.

, If any bumps are present within the first coat, they can be removed by an additional sanding before the second application of paint. Be gentle when removing impurities from the first coat because if you sand too hard you’ll be back at square one. Always check that that the initial paint is dried before continuing on with the second coat.


While a second coat of paint isn’t a necessity, it adds a look of professionalism. The second coat also increases the durability of the paint, overall increasing the value of your new siding.If you’re seeing lines in your first coat, it’s because you’re painting too slow. A line in the color is from the paint drying and being over painted. To eliminate the line, try working in a smaller area while keeping your edges wet and painting your siding in panels without pausing in between strokes.Painting your second coat carefully will allow you to hide any lines from the first coat.

Select a pot of the size and shape of your choice.,
 Place newspaper on your table to cover the work surface.,
Paint the pot with either white or black enamel, coating it completely.,
Select a creative design to be used to help you shape the M-Seal design.,
Ensure that the design will fit the pot.,
Keep this design as a template for shaping the modeling medium shortly.,
Set out a paper plate for mixing the M-Seal together.

,
Unpack the M-Seal.,
Form the design.,
Stick the M-Seal design piece or pieces on the terracotta/mud pot in the exact position you originally determined.,
Allow the added design to dry in place for 1/2 an hour.

,
Cut details into the modelling piece/pieces, if relevant.,
Paint the design with white fabric paint.,
Allow to dry.",How to Create a Raised M‐Seal Design for a Painted Terracotta Pot," The larger the pot, the easier it will be to add a design to the surface but you'll need more modeling and painting materials for larger designs.;
, Place your terracotta/mud pot on the newspaper.

, This provides an initial sealing layer, ensuring that the design will adhere to the pot with ease. Allow this coating to dry for 4 hours, or for as long as directed by the manufacturer.

, You could source the design from a print-out from online, from a stencil, from a stamped design, or any other piece of paper with a lovely, clear and easy to model design on it. The key thing is that the design is simple and can be followed easily with your fingers when molding the M-Seal into this shape. Easy designs might include:


Flowers, a tree, an acorn
A cat, a dog, a rabbit
Squiggly lines, a letter, a smiley face, etc.

, Choose an area on the pot where you'll add the design and place the paper design against it, to check for fit and suitability. Once, you're happy with it, it's good to go.

, Place it flat down on the work surface after checking it fits easily onto the terracotta/mud pot. This will serve as the precise guide to work to when making the design pieces for sticking onto the pot.

,, In one box of M-Seal, you'll find two packs. The contents of each pack will need to be mixed together to make the design medium:


Take an equal amount of M-Seal from both packs and mix well. Keep it on the paper plate.
On the other side of the paper plate, pour some talcum powder.
Start mixing both of the M-Seal mixtures by applying talcum powder on your fingers as you mix them (the talcum powder ensures that your fingers don't get sticky).

, Once you have mixed the M-Seal, start making your desired design from the M-Seal putty mix. Follow the template you cut out in the previous section to make the shapes exact. If, for example, you're making floral design, then shape petals, leaves and a stem from the M-Seal, following your paper design on the work surface.


It is up to you whether you design one whole piece or several pieces to be joined together. Do whatever seems appropriate for the chosen design.

, Use glue to attach the shaped M-Seal design piece or pieces onto the exact position on the pot (the modelling pieces have likely dried a little too much to stick without the addition of extra sealant).


Be sure that the enamel has completely dried before doing this step.

,, If finer details are needed, use the cutter/knife to cut designs, such as making lines or slits on the design, or removing unwanted parts.

, Allow it to dry for 20 minutes. Once the paint has dried, start painting the whole design with fabric paint, in colors of choice.

, Once your painting is completed, allow it to dry for 1 hour. When it is dry, the pot is completed. You can varnish it or seal it, if wished.

Soften the caulk with chemicals or heat.,
Slice through the caulk with a blade.Use a small razor blade to cut through each end bead of caulk, exposing the edge of the line.,
Pull the caulk out by hand.,
Scrape out the remaining caulk.,
Pull caulk out of deep crevices with needle-nose pliers.,
Rake out remaining chunks of caulk.",How to Remove Caulk1," Fresh caulk can usually be removed without softening it, but older caulk that has fully hardened may need to be softened first in order to make it pliable enough to remove. You can usually do this with water, vinegar, chemicals, or heat, depending on the type of caulk.

Commercial caulk remover is the simplest choice and may be your best option for silicone caulk. Apply the caulk remover by squeezing a wide bead along the caulk line, completely covering it from end to end. Let it sit for several hours as directed on the label.If you are dealing with non-acrylic water-based caulk, you can soak the caulk with saturated rags for 72 hours to soften the caulk effectively.






If dealing with water-based acrylic caulks or polyvinyl acetate resins, soak the caulk by dampening it with iso-propyl rubbing alcohol.To use heat on any form of caulk, apply heat from a hair dryer on the lowest setting for 30 to 40 seconds. Work in patches of about 8 inches (20 cm) at a time.;
,


Alternatively, you can slice from end to end, spanning the full length of the caulk and cutting the line completely in half. Doing so can free up more edge and may even cause some of the caulk to fall out on its own.

, Grab the exposed edge of the caulk with your fingers and pull out as much as possible. Pull toward the direction of the remaining line of caulk to lift it out.


If you cut along the full length of the caulk line, peel up the line starting on one end and pull in the direction opposite that end to remove as much as possible.

, Use a glass scraper to scrap out any remaining, visible caulk. Hold the scraper at a shallow angle, keeping it as flat as possible, to avoid scratching the surface.


You could also use a putty knife or similar tool. Keep in mind that the tool you use should have a fairly flat “blade” with a somewhat dull edge. You do not need to cut more of the caulk out with this tool; you only need the tool for the sake of scraping away caulk from underneath.

, If you cannot reach some of the caulk with your scraper, use needle-nose pliers to pick and pull out any visible chunks.


Needle-nose pliers are preferable to other types of pliers since they tend to be narrower and are easier to maneuver in and out of small crevices.

, Use the hook end of a painter's five-in-one tool to scrape out any remaining caulk debris from the crevice.Scrape in one direction, pulling as much of the caulk away and out as possible. Hopefully, you should be able to get rid of the rest of the chunks after completing this step.

"
"
Scrub the surface with an abrasive pad.,
Wash the surface with a non-ammoniated bath cleaner.,
Wash with a diluted bleach solution.,
Rinse and let dry.",How to Remove Caulk2," Soak the abrasive pad in mineral water or mineral spirits before scrubbing with firm, even force along the surface from which the old caulk had been removed.


Rubbing the surface down with mineral spirits strips away any remaining caulk residue. Residue can prevent new caulk from sticking. Moreover, if there is mildew or mold caught in that residue, it poses a health hazard if it is not removed.

, Clean away soap scum by thoroughly scrubbing the surface with a cleaner and sponge.


Do not use ammonia or a cleaner that contains ammonia. You will be using bleach in the next step, and when combined, bleach and ammonia can create toxic fumes.

, Combine 1/3 cup (80 ml) bleach with 1 gallon (4 L) of water until well mixed. Apply this solution to the gap from which the caulk was removed.


Use paintbrush or foam brush too apply the bleach solution.
Let the solution sit on the caulk for about five minutes before disturbing it.
Scrub the bleach away with a toothbrush or firm plastic pad.

, Rinse the area with warm water and pat the surface and the gap with a clean, dry rag.


At this point, you can and should apply new caulk. Make sure that the surface is completely dry before doing so, however, since caulk may not adhere to wet surfaces.

"
"
Rinse the area with mineral water.,
Moisten the stain with a chemical solvent.,
Mix the solvent with a white absorbent material.,
Apply the paste to the stain.,
Let the paste set.,
Dampen the area with mineral water.,
Scrape away the dried paste and caulk.,
Rinse with mineral water.",How to Remove Caulk3," Before applying any chemical solvent to a caulk stain on marble or any other hard surface, rinse the area with mineral water or distilled water to remove any residue.

, Choose a chemical solvent noted for effectiveness against silicone caulk. Dampen the stained area using a clean rag.


Note that you only need to use heavy solvents on silicone caulk stains. Other types of caulk stains, like acrylic and non-acrylic caulks, are less stubborn and can usually be removed with nothing but water and physical scraping.
Common, effective chemicals include Methylene Chloride, Dichloromethane, Methylene Bichloride, and Methylene Dichloride.

, Combine additional solvent with enough white absorbent material to form a thick paste.


Possible absorbent material options include molding plaster, untreated white flour, white tissue, white paper towels, powdered chalk, talc, fullers earth, or laundry whiting.
Note that you'll need about 1 lb (450 g) of paste for every square foot (30.5 square cm).

, Layer the paste on the caulk stain using a plastic or wooden spatula. Make sure that the paste is 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) thick or less.


This paste should cover the entire stain and extend a bit past the edges. If you do not let the paste extend past the stain, the stain could end up being forced onto clean patches of stone.
After applying the paste, make sure that the coating is free of any air pockets.

, Cover the paste with plastic sheeting and seal the edges off with masking tape. Let it set for 48 hours undisturbed.


If using a solvent with other instructions, however, follow the instructions provided on the solvent label.

, Doing so softens the hardened paste enough to help lift it off.

, Use a wooden or plastic spatula to gently scrape away the paste and the loosened caulk.


Do not use anything harder since many hard surfaces, like marble, can get scratched up as a result.

, Rinse the area once more with mineral water or distilled water to remove any residue. Blot dry with clean paper towels.


You might need to apply this treatment multiple times before all the caulk comes up. You can do so once the surface is completely dry.

"
"
Wipe off as much of the caulk as possible.,
Freeze the material, if possible.,
Scrape or peel the hardened caulk off.,
Apply an acetone-based cleaner.If some of the caulk stain still remains, you can apply a small amount of an acetone-based cleaner directly to the stain before dabbing it out.",How to Remove Caulk4," If you catch the stain as soon as the caulk gets onto the material, you might be able to wipe most of it off with a clean, damp rag.


Gently rub at the stain. As you rub, use a slight upward motion to encourage the caulk to come off the material instead of rubbing it further into the fibers.
You could attempt to simply dab at the stain, but this may not be enough force depending on how much the caulk has already begun to set.
Use warm water instead of cold water since warmth encourages the caulk to stay soft.

, If the caulk got on your clothes or some other removable item of fabric, place the stained item in the freezer for 30 to 60 minutes or until well frozen.


You do not, of course, need to do this step or any of the following steps if the caulk came off simply by scrubbing it.
When ready, the fabric should be very stiff and the caulk should be hard to the touch.

, The solidified caulk should be easier to remove. You can scrape at it with a painter's chisel until the strip of caulk begins to peel up, then peel the rest away with your fingers.


It is not recommended for you to chisel or scrape away the entire caulk stain. Doing so could cause the fibers in the material to tear more than necessary.

,

Before using the acetone, test it on a small part of the material hidden along the underside. Acetone can fade and ruin certain fabrics, so testing it is necessary if you do not want to risk further damage.
Apply the cleaner to the fabric using a cotton swab or cotton ball. Let it sit for five minutes or as directed on the label before rinsing out with warm water.
Launder the cloth as usual when done.

Familiarize yourself with local plumbing and building codes.,
Choose a pipe material for your ventilation system.,
Consider size constraints.,
Understand the waste pipes in your building.,
Learn about your building's drain pipes.,
Understand how vent pipes work.,
Understand the general layout of piping.,
Visit a hardware store to get pipe, fittings, and materials for joining and supporting your vent stack.",How to Vent Plumbing1," These will have restrictions about the size and material of your pipes, the distance between certain fixtures and vent pipes, and the placement of ventilation. Some codes also require permits or professional help for certain projects. Make sure you understand your local codes in detail before beginning your project, and consult a local plumber if you have questions or want advice.


Building codes change often to reflect current knowledge about safe and effective materials and building standards. Make sure you use the most recent local codes.;
, Consider which pipe material best fits your needs, budget, and any existing piping. Most ventilation systems use small pipes less than ten inches in diameter, which allows plastic pipes like PVC or ABS pipes. In certain situations these can lack strength or durability, so copper, steel, or cast-iron pipes are also available. In choosing a pipe, consider strength, durability, flexibility, weight, resistance to corrosion, and methods for joining pipe. Both PVC and ABS pipes are non-toxic and resistant to abrasion. ABS pipes are easier to install than PVC, and are tougher and more rigid, but are also more likely to warp or deform in the sun. PVC pipes are flexible but durable. Both kinds of plastic pipe are cheap compared to metal or other pipes.Consider the pressure class of the pipe. If you anticipate a lot of pressure in your pipes, go for a higher pressure class. For most projects, class 160 or 200 PVC is sufficient. The cost difference between the two classes is negligible, so people often choose the heavier duty 200 class pipe., The size of pipe you use both for ventilation and for drain or waste pipes dictates the number of fixtures you can tap into the pipes. It also limits the distance between fixtures and their sewage pipes. Larger pipes will give you more freedom in terms of both distance between fixtures and number of fixtures, but using only large pipes can be unnecessary. Examine local building codes for regulations about vent, drain, and waste pipe size., Waste pipes remove water and waste from a toilet. Your building has a large-diameter, central pipe that is the control center of the wastewater system.From here, waste is carried to your sewer or septic tank.

, Drain pipes carry water from sinks, showers, tubs, and other appliances. They often are equipped with a P-trap, or a bend in the pipe just below the sink or other fixture, in the shape of a P. This traps water in the bottom of the P, blocking the pipe and preventing gases and odors from escaping into your house through the drain pipe. The water in the P-trap is refreshed every time more water runs through the drain pipe.

, Vent pipes run from waste or drain pipes upwards, ending outside the building, usually sticking up through the roof. This allows unpleasant and potentially dangerous odors or fumes to safely leave your plumbing system, escaping harmlessly into the air outside. It lets air into the system, filling the vacuums left by water moving through the pipe. This allows water to flow quickly and smoothly through the pipes.

, Vents and other vertical pipes should be as straight as possible to prevent condensation from building in the pipes. Horizontal pipes should slant down toward fixtures so that gravity can push waste and water through the pipes. These commonly run with a slope of 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) down for each horizontal foot of piping.

, Measure the amount of pipe you'll need before coming in, and ask store employees to help you cut your pipe down to size. Buy fittings to attach pieces of pipe together and accommodate corners, and choose your fittings based on the type of pipe you'll be using.


Employees at hardware stores are often knowledgeable about various projects you might undertake and can answer questions or offer suggestions if you're unsure about anything. They can also refer you to professionals who will be able to help more thoroughly with your project.

Understand dry venting.,
Create a dry vent by attaching a ventilation pipe to a fixture's drain pipe.,
Extend the vent pipe outside the building according to building regulations.,
Repeat the ventilation process with any other fixtures you're installing.,
Vertical ventilation pipes called vent stacks provide air circulation to any part of the plumbing system.",How to Vent Plumbing2," This is a simple system in which each fixture has its own vent pipe. It is simple to plan and implement, because you won't have to worry about placing different fixtures close enough together or using pipes big enough for multiple fixtures. Each vent is a small, isolated pipe that you can work with separately. However, having a different vent pipe for each fixture will mean that you have a lot of vent pipes running up through your building and out your roof. This uses a lot of unnecessary piping, and you'll be doing more work than you need to., Depending on the fixture, the vent pipe can be fairly small but should be positioned within a couple feet of the fixture. Make sure to check your local building codes for specific regulations about sizes and distances for your vent pipe.


A common layout is to have a drain pipe run horizontally away from a sink or other fixture for up to two feet. Then the drain pipe will join with a vertical pipe. Down from the joint, this vertical pipe acts as a drain for the fixture. Up from the joint, it vents the fixture.

, Usually, the vent pipe must extend six inches above the roof or 12 inches (30.5 cm) away from vertical walls, but double check your building codes and requirements to make sure.

, Make sure every fixture has a vent pipe associated with it so that your whole plumbing system will run quickly, smoothly, and safely.

, Vent stacks can run parallel with waste pipes to ensure proper ventilation in tall buildings. Sub-vents may be branched together to exit 1 vent stack, allowing for only 1 hole in the roof for ventilation.

"
"
Understand wet ventilation, where one fixture's vent is another's drain.,
Plan the location and layout of your piping.,
Accommodate regulations in wet venting.",How to Vent Plumbing3," Under this system, you can install several different fixtures in the same system of pipes, attached at different places. Although this system complicates the layout of your plumbing system, it reduces the total amount of piping you need and can save a lot of space and effort.

, Consider asking a professional plumber to help you with this. Consider the size of piping you'll need for each segment, the distance between fixtures, and the plumbing demands of each fixture. Make sure your plans fit within building codes and regulations, which can be more complicated for wet venting than for dry.


An example bathroom layout is as follows. The sink has a drain pipe 1.5"" in diameter, which connects to a vertical vent pipe. The toilet has a 3"" waste pipe which makes a T or a Y with the bottom of the vent pipe, such that the vent pipe goes upwards vertically from the horizontal waste pipe. Between the intersection with the sink's drain pipe and the toilet's waste pipe, the vent pipe is acting as the sink's drain and the toilet's vent, and so must be 2"" in diameter. Above the intersection with the sink, the vent pipe simply acts as a vent for both fixtures and so can be smaller, 1.5"" in diameter., For example, toilets should be installed downstream of all other fixtures, so that nothing else will vent through the waste pipe. A wet venting pipe can't be reduced in size -- the piping should never get smaller as other fixtures tap into it. And all fixtures should be no more than the maximum allowable distance from a vent, even if that means dry venting certain fixtures.


See your local building codes for more detailed regulations, and double check that you accommodate all of them. Run your plans by a professional plumber or someone intimately familiar with these codes if you're unsure about any of the regulations.

Determine if all locations within your home or office have low water pressure.,
Check the faucet if you only have low water pressure in a particular location.,
Look for other sources of low water pressure.",How to Troubleshoot Low Water Pressure1," Check various locations that have faucets. The kitchen, the bathroom, basement and outdoor faucets, and hose hookups are common areas where fixture specific low water pressure can occur.
Run water in all faucets and showers in your home to identify if there is are one or multiple problem problem areas or to determine that all locations have low water pressure.
Run both hot and cold water through all faucets. If your water pressure is low only with hot water, the issue is likely your water heater.;
, Your problem might only affect one or two locations. In this case, the source of the low water pressure is likely a clogged faucet or aerator. Remove the end of the faucet.
Examine your aerator. Check to make sure there are no debris or buildup.
If the aerator needs to be cleaned, soak it in a water-vinegar solution. If that doesn't work, buy a replacement. These are very inexpensive.Turn the water on before you replace the aerator. If the water flow is not restored to normal, the source of low water pressure is likely not the specific faucet but an overall problem.

, If you can't pinpoint the cause of your low water pressure to just one or two faucets in the house, its probably an overall problem.


Check the PRV and water shut off valves in your home. This is often the cause of low water pressure.
Look for water leaks. A leaking toilet or water main can cause low water pressure.
Check your water heater. If you only have low water pressure when you are running hot water, it is likely due to your hot water shut-off valve on your water heater.

"
"
Look at the Pressure Reducing Valve (PRV).,
Check the shut-off valve at the water meter.,
Test your water pressure again using multiple faucets.",How to Troubleshoot Low Water Pressure2," Shaped like a bell, the PRV is usually located on the line where it enters the home or office.


Adjust it to see if it affects your overall water pressure. There will be a screw on the valve. To increase water pressure, tighten it by turning it clockwise. To decrease water pressure, loosen the adjusting screw by turning it counterclockwise. Replacement may be necessary if the valve has failed or broken. These can be purchased at hardware or plumbing supply stores., This valve can influence water pressure, even if it has been turned slightly.Most homes and buildings have a master shut-off valve. This is located near the PRV valve or in a separate box near the water meter.
This valve can shut off water to the entire home, and restrict flow if it is slightly closed.
Turn the valve so it is completely open.

, If the problem is resolved, the source was likely the PRV valve or water shut-off valve


If you are still experiencing water pressure issues, you may have a water leak. Water leaks are a common source of low water pressure in a house.
You should consult a plumber to fix a water leak or mineral buildup in your water lines.

"
"
Check the toilet in each bathroom.,
Check your service meter.,
Check for water spots in the basement and near water fixtures in the home.",How to Troubleshoot Low Water Pressure3," Running or leaking toilets are one of the most common source of water leaks in a home. This can cause very high water bills, so it is a good idea to determine if this is the root cause of a water pressure problem.Start by removing the lid from the tank of the toilet.
Put a few drops of food coloring or a dye tablet into the tank.
Do not flush the toilet for at least one hour.
If color has leaked into the bowl, your toilet has a leak. This can usually be fixed by replacing the toilet flapper or filling mechanism.

, This can help you determine if you have a service line leak.Locate your service meter. Take a reading of the meter and check to see if the indicator gear is turning.
The leak indicator can be a small triangle shaped dial or disk that rotates when water is flowing.
If the leak indicator is turning, you likely have a leak. If it is not turning, it does not mean there isn't a leak. A slow leak may not register on the leak indicator.
Don't run any water for 2 hours and do another service meter reading. If the numbers have changed you are losing water and have a leak
Call your water company or a plumber to help you find the source of a leak and to arrange repairs.

, This can be a clear indication of a water leak.In many cases you can hear a dripping sound in the case of a leaking faucet. Usually this requires a simple home repair.
If there are large areas of water in the basement, there may be a water main leak.
You should also check the ground in the area outside your home where your main meets the local supply. If the weather has been dry and the area around this junction is wet, there could be a leak at this spot. Contact your water company to resolve this issue.

"
"
Inspect the water heater if your low water pressure only affects your hot water.,
Test your water faucets again to see if the problem is resolved.,
Contact your plumber to check your lines into your water heater.",How to Troubleshoot Low Water Pressure4," In this case the water heater shut off valve is the most common source of this problem.Verify the shut-off valve is completely open. For safety, each water heater includes a shut-off valve to use in case of emergencies.
If the valve is shut even slightly, this can affect your water pressure.

, The water pressure issue should be resolved when hot water is run through a faucet.


If the hot water low pressure problem is not resolved, it could be the water lines into the water heater or the appliance itself.
In this case, call a plumber to troubleshoot further.

, Blockages can occur within the lines, and plumbers have efficient ways of checking them.The appliance itself may also be causing a problem. A licensed plumber will need to evaluate it to see if it needs to be replaced.
Working with water heaters can be dangerous, so it is best to leave this job to a professional.

Check the waterproofing.,
Run one fixture at a time.,
Check the pipes.,
Get a plumber.",How to Troubleshoot a Leaking Upstairs Bathroom," The major reason for leaking bathrooms is poor waterproofing prior to tiling. This is especially the case for older homes where waterproofing products weren't as good as they are nowadays. However, it can still be a problem for modern homes if the application was sloppy.;
, Try to find which bathroom appliance might be the source of wet patches or drips (shower, bath, toilet).


Turn on each appliance in turn, checking the drips or the wet space to see if it worsens with any particular appliance.






Leaving water overnight in a shower pan or bathtub can help you to find a leak if one of these appliances is the cause. If there are no leaks, eliminate the bath or shower from the search. Be aware - a hole as small as a pinhole can cause a massive leak beneath!






Check the pipe between the valve and the shower head.







, Usually there is ceiling space between the upstairs bathroom and the lower ceiling.


Cut a hole in the ceiling to enable you to undertake a visual inspection of the pipework to see if the pipes are leaking, or to see if there is direct leaking from under the tiles.







, If you find leaking pipes, get the plumber as soon as possible. Unless you're fully trained in plumbing, leave this one to the professionals to fix. Having a plumber do an inspection will also help you to know whether or not you need to go to the expense and trouble of lifting off all the tiles and waterproofing and re-laying them!

Turn on the tap in the bathroom and let the water run for about 1 minute.,
Do a load of washing in your washing machine.,
Flush the toilet and inspect the water level before and after flushing.,
Check all sinks and bathtubs for drainage speed.,
Listen for gurgling sounds when the basins and sinks are draining.,
Smell for odors around your sinks and showers.",How to Tell if Your Plumbing Has a Clog in the Line,"  While it’s still running, watch the toilet for any signs of a rise in water level or bubbling in the water, these could indicate a blockage.;
, When it gets to the point in the cycle that the water drains from the machine, inspect close by drains for water backing up into things like showers bath and basins

, If it has either risen or lowered, then there could be a blockage stopping the water flowing as freely as it should.

, The water should go down the drain in a swirling motion when the tap is at its fastest water flow speed. If the basin is slowly filling up, then you have some form of blockage.

, This indicates water flow issues, and therefore a blockage.

, Bad odors can indicate that there is debris in your drain rotting and causing a blockage.

"
"
Listen for dripping sounds.,
Look for evidence of a leak along the base board of walls near the location of your plumbing fixtures.,
Look under vanities and sinks for drips or similar evidence noted in the previous step.,
Listen for noises from your commodes/bathrooms, to determine if they are running at unusual intervals, when no one has recently flushed them.,
Check your water meter.",How to Troubleshoot Plumbing Problems1," As simple as this step may seem, it may be overlooked in a busy, noisy home. Even though a dripping faucet may not seem to waste significant amounts of water, over the course of day, each individual drop adds up to thousands and thousands of drops, or gallons and gallons of water. Choose a time when there is little or no activity, such as early in the morning, or late at night, when the house is very quiet.;
, Pipes that contain water under pressure can become corroded, develop loose fittings, or crack because of freezing, allowing a continuous loss of water until repaired. Mildew or mold, darkened surfaces, or even puddles of water may occur below leaks. If the problem is inside the wall cavity, it may be necessary to remove the paneling, plaster, or wallboard to correct it.


Pipes also may sweat when cold water passes through them in warmer interior air-spaces in the home, and this water condensing on the surface of pipes may drip, causing moisture problems to appear where no leak exists.

, Use a flashlight to follow the path of exposed pipes, looking for droplets of water that will accumulate at the lower section before dropping off, and run your fingertips along these pipes to feel for wetness.

, When there is a seal leak in the water closet (toilet), the tank will drain slowly over a period of time, until the water level drops sufficiently for the float valve to open and replenish it. Sticking flush valves and leaking seals in toilets can waste a lot of water, since, like dripping faucets, the flow, although perhaps very small, is continuous.


Check the supply valves on lavatories and commodes if they are leaking. The packing, which seals the valve stem of a typical stop (water valve) seals when compressed just enough to ""pack off"" leak paths, but not so tightly that turning the handle is difficult. Turn the packing nut (top nut surrounding the stem) slightly clockwise (shouldn't require more than 1/8 turn or so) and see if this stops the leak around the stem. #*Supply valves are meant to be fully opened or completely closed. Turn the valve off by turning the handle clockwise until it stops; Open the valve by turning the handle counter-clockwise (anti-clockwise) until it stops. Occasionally, a very slight leak of a stem will stop if the valve was partly opened and is either fully closed or opened fully.

, Municipal water systems use a meter to measure the amount of water used, and by turning off all faucets and appliances that consume water, the flow to your home will cease. Locate your water meter, read the amount displayed, note it, then wait an hour or two, and reread it to see if water has gone through it when none was being used in your home. Very small leaks will not appear to move the meter over a short period of time, so these will be harder to detect using this method.

Identify the problem that is occurring with your drains, specifically, the individual drains which are not functioning correctly.,
Try to determine the extent of your ""slow drain"" problem.,
Determine the route the waste water takes to reach the main drainpipe.,
Flush the drain which is not operating like it should with very hot water.",How to Troubleshoot Plumbing Problems2," Some typical problems are these:


Slow sink or tub drains.
Water backing up in the bathtub, shower, or sink.
Wet areas in walls or along floors in rooms adjacent to walls containing drain pipes.
Wet areas in the lawn near drain piping.
Unusual gurgling or bubbling sounds when water is draining.

, If it is isolated to only one sink or other fixture, it is probably localised to the individual pipe that connects that fixture to the main line. In other words, if only the kitchen sink drains slowly, the problem is in the sink trap or drain line that connects to the larger pipes which additionally carries water from other sinks, the commode, and the bathtub.

, Many times, the individual drain pipes are routed though the wall cavity, interconnecting to other pipes, which then go below the floor and exit the home to either the septic system or sanitary sewer.

, For a bathroom or kitchen sink, this can be done by stopping the drain and filling the sink with hot water from the faucet. Unstop the plug, and the water will drain into the material which is clogging the pipes, and it the material is a residue of grease or grease like waste, the hot water may dissolve it sufficiently to flush enough of it out the pipes to restore your flow.


If necessary, use a drain cleaning product containing chemicals to dislodge or dissolve the material that is causing the stoppage. Drano or Liquid -Plumr are examples of chemical products that may dissolve hair, soap residue, grease, or other materials which can clog a drain line.
Be careful if you choose to use a plumber's snake to open a clogged drain. These can be very messy, and may compact the material that is clogging the pipes, making it even more difficult to remove, if the proper technique is not used.

Obtain a replacement valve.,
Assemble the proper tools.,
Shut off the next valve up the line.,
Drain and verify the water is off.,
Remove the old valve.,
Apply the proper pipe joint compound to the pipe threads.,
Install the new valve.,
Turn the new valve off.,
Turn off any drains.,
Turn the water or gas back on.

,
Check for leaks at the valve.",How to Replace Shut off Valves," The valve you purchase should be an exact match to the old valve in terms of size, thread and type. Remember, compression fittings and iron pipe fittings are not interchangeable. If you are not able to shut everything off and remove the valve to take it with you to the hardware store, then try to take some measurements or photos of it.;
, Supply valves under the sink typically can be removed with a crescent, open-end wrench or channel-lock pliers. Bigger valves will need a pipe wrench, as well as another wrench to hold the pipe and one to turn the valve. Proper tools will prevent you from damaging the fixtures, or causing an injury. Take the time to find them., Locate the valve that is closer to the supply than the one you want to shut off. This might be the hot water heater, the house water shut-off in the house, or the main shut-off at the meter. Gas valves typically have some other shut-off in the proximity of the valve before you get to the main. Twist this valve into the off position. If you've located the right one, this should prevent water or gas from gushing out of the valve you wish to replace.

, If the valve you shut off is located in a basement or first floor of a two-story house, the water above you must drain out. Most systems are not airtight enough to hold back the leftover water. Start draining the system, and wait a few minutes for everything to get out. If the water is still gushing strongly after that, you haven't turned off the valve.


If you have a floor above you, go outside and open an outside faucet if those faucets come directly from the house. Now the water will run outside and not into your cabinet or floor.
If you're replacing a valve on a faucet, open it up. This will help get the water out of the pipes you're working around.

, With the proper wrench, remove the valve that you're going to replace. Watch the pipe you are threading it off of and make sure the pipe doesn't twist. If it does, you need to put another wrench on the pipe.

, This will vary depending on the pipe. Ask for help at your local hardware store if you're unsure. Most valves don't require pipe compound, but you should inspect the o ring if it is a flexible line. If it is a gas flex line, a little pipe compound needs to be applied to the flare part of the fitting, just at the end of the brass fitting, above the threads.

, Tighten with wrench until it is snug and in the proper location for the supply line.

, Make sure it's twisted securely into the off position before proceeding to the next step.

, Go back to the faucets you opened to drain the system and turn them into the off position. You don't want water gushing from them as soon as you turn the water back on.

,, There are different ways to do this depending on whether you're working with a liquid or gas system.

If you're checking for water leaks, wipe the valve completely dry with a towel. Then, turn on the faucet or appliance and let it run for a few minutes. If you see new droplets of water forming on the valve, you have a leak.
For a gas line, apply soapy water to all fittings and look for bubbles. Tighten if needed, and re-check with soapy water. Instead of soapy water, you can use a commercial compound that will check for gas leaks. These are sold at hardware stores.

Rent a storage unit.,
Use an attic or basement.,
Stash smaller items in a closet.,
Make room in the garage.,
Store large pieces vertically.,
Disassemble everything you can.,
Wrap delicate items.,
Line the floor.,
Use furniture covers or drop cloths.,
Keep your storage area at a mild temperature.,
Watch out for moisture.",How to Store Furniture," If you don’t have enough room in your home to keep unneeded furniture, or if you need to get it out of the way in the long term, your best bet will be to secure a dedicated storage unit. Commercial units come in various sizes, allowing you to choose a space that best suits your needs, and usually come equipped with other features like climate-controlled spaces and sometimes even damage insurance.Storage units will be useful for people who want to keep a lot of furniture in one place.
You’ll continue to rack up fees the longer you keep your furniture in storage, so it may benefit you financially to come up with a long-term plan for your pieces.;
, See if there’s enough room for miscellaneous items in the upper or lowermost areas of your home. Attics and basements can be quite convenient, since they tend to be well-insulated, and you won’t have to go far to move the furniture in and out of its new.A handful of odds and ends like an unused dining set or your grandmother’s antique bedside table may not be worth the monthly fees required to rent a storage unit. Keeping them somewhere out of the way around your home is a smart move.
Survey your home’s extra space before you start moving things in and out. Some attics or basements have steep stairs and small entryways, which can make them impractical for storage purposes.

, Closets are another storage option that work best for compact and single pieces of furniture. Take apart a coffee table and slide it into a nearby supply closet or stack chairs or cushions against the back wall. They can remain there until you find a use for them, or decide to sell them off or donate them.An average-sized closet can be used to store light fixtures, stools or boxes of cookware and decorations.
Make sure not to clutter up the closet if its one you use frequently.

, If space permits, set aside a corner of a freestanding garage or work shed to stow hard-wearing furniture, like card tables, folding chairs and metal and plastic outdoor pieces. Extremes in temperature aren’t good for wood and upholstery, but you should have no problem leaving solid synthetic materials in a minimal structure indefinitely.Allow ample space between stored furniture and vehicles, tools and other equipment.
One advantage of storing furniture in a garage or shed is that you’ll have all the tools you need on hand to take things apart and put them back together.

, Turn sofas, mattresses and long, low cabinets on their ends and stand them up around the edge of the storage space. Fit the upright furniture close together to reserve valuable territory for broad, heavy and oddly-shaped pieces on the floor. This is a much more effective use of space, as it frees up more area for storage and allows air to flow between items.Cover wobbly items in bubble wrap or towels and use them to brace one another.
Paintings and mirrors should also be situated vertically, as it’s possible for them to collapse under their own weight over time when laid flat., One common mistake people make when storing furniture is to simply throw it into the storage area as-is, not realizing that they can break them down and strategically arrange their parts to be less obtrusive. Most tables, beds, cabinets and lamps can and should be dismantled whenever possible. In many cases, you can as much as double your storage potential by breaking your furniture down into its smallest form first.Group disassembled items into clusters and keep them close together to avoid losing or confusing any parts.
Keep track of screws, bolts, hinges and other minuscule pieces by placing them in a plastic bag and taping them to the furniture somewhere visible., Whenever you’re moving and packing furniture close together, there’s a chance that it could become damaged. Swaddle less sturdy pieces like lamps, end tables, stools and vases in cushioned materials to keep them from breaking. Padded furniture covers, bubble wrap or plush towels and blankets all work well for this purpose.As much as possible, wrap items individually, rather than in bundles.
Leave some distance between fragile objects and avoid stacking or leaning them together., Drape a few plastic tarps or moving blankets over the floor of the storage area. This will spares delicate pieces a lot of wear-and-tear while at the same time defending domestic floors from scratches. A plastic tarp can also act as a barricade, blocking out moisture and buffering extreme temperatures.If you have items that you’re especially concerned about damaging, use wooden pallets to elevate them off the floor.Track local weather conditions and take precautions against flooding. Standing water can ruin furniture if it’s not dealt with swiftly.

, Covering all major pieces of furniture as soon as you put them into storage can keep them from undergoing drastic changes in temperature and limit the amount of moisture or dryness they’re being exposed to. This will be especially important for wood and other organic items, as well as metals that can rust or tarnish.Furniture covers also prevent dust from settling on items that are in storage for long periods of time.It’s usually best not to completely seal items in plastic, as escaping moisture can become trapped and cause mildew., If you’re already paying for a storage unit, it may be wise to spring for one that’s climate-controlled to ensure that your furniture stays in good shape. If you’re storing furniture in your home or another area, make sure that the space you choose is well-ventilated and doesn’t get too hot or cold. Temperate, airtight surroundings will greatly benefit the lifespan of your furniture.Heat can warp or even melt certain materials, while cold can cause others to dry crack, splinter or dry out.

, Moisture causes almost all fabrics and materials to deteriorate at a much faster rate. It’s also hospitable to bacteria and mold, which can lead to the discoloration of upholstered items and give them an unpleasant smell. Before you store a given item, make sure it’s completely dry and have a way of covering it or otherwise protecting it from moisture, environmental or otherwise.Check for leaks, drafts or any other defects in the storage space that may let harmful moisture in.Even without the risk of mildew, wood furniture can warp, swell or split when it’s exposed to moisture.

Locate the water shut-off valve.,
After you have shut-off the water supply, it is also a good idea to open all sink faucets to drain the water from the pipes to further minimize damage.

,
Then, immediately call a plumber.,
Remove excess water while waiting for the plumber.",How to React in a Plumbing Emergency1," This is located next to your water meter. Once you have located your water meter, the valve next to it will be the water shut-off valve. By turning off the shut-off valve, you will stop all water from entering your home, thus minimizing water damage.;
,, Reputable, professional plumbers can usually send a technician out in a few hours.


Follow any instructions given to you, while you wait for them to arrive.

, It is also a good idea to use a mop, rags or paper towels to remove excess water, to help keeping water damage to a minimum.

"
"
In the case of overflowing toilets, you can shut-off the toilet water supply valve.",How to React in a Plumbing Emergency2," This valve can usually be located between the bathroom floor and the toilet tank, on the water line supplying the toilet.


If this is your plumbing problem, it is not necessary to shut-off the water to the entire home.

Unclog clogged drains.",How to React in a Plumbing Emergency3," Clogged toilets and sink drains can sometimes be opened with a chemical drain opener. If this does not work, a plunger or snake can be tried to remove the clog.


If these methods fail to open the clogged drain, you will need to call a plumber.

"
"
If it is a water heater problem, immediately shut the unit off.",How to React in a Plumbing Emergency4," It is a good idea to locate the electrical shut-off switch beforehand. Also, be sure to keep the telephone number of a licensed, professional plumber, with emergency services, handy.

Establish what your piece of furniture is worth in order to set a fair price for it.,
Offer the furniture to consignment shops.,
Ask for offers from furniture dealers.,
Place an advertisement in the newspaper.,
Sell your furniture online.,
Consult an antiques dealer if you have a special piece to sell.",How to Sell High End Used Furniture,"


Give it a standard price, but have an idea of what you will settle for. For example, you might decide your Heywood Wakefield armoire is worth $3,500, but you may need to be willing to sell it for around $2,000.
Look for evidence that your piece of furniture was made by a high end manufacturer or is a collectible antique. Most manufacturers leave marks somewhere on the piece, and you can determine its worth as a collectible by looking it up online or in an antique furniture catalogue.;
, Your city or town should have at least 1 consignment shop that accepts high end furniture in good shape.


Find out how the furniture is sold and paid for. Some shops will pay you for it as soon as you bring it to them. Others will display it in their store, but will not pay you any money until it sells.

, Sometimes, a dealer who buys and sells high end furniture will come to your home and make an offer if he or she wants to buy it.


Make sure the dealer will be willing to transport your furniture from your home to the shop, once the furniture is paid for. Otherwise, you will have to find a truck or something large enough to move the furniture.

, Most local papers have a classified section where you can advertise your furniture and the price you are asking.


List your phone number or email address in addition to a description of your furniture so potential buyers will know how to contact you.

, You will want to sell to local buyers only, because the cost of shipping or transporting your furniture can be expensive.


Try placing an ad on Craigslist. You may not find too many high end buyers on this site, but it is free to list an ad, so it might be worth a try.
Use Kijiji (www.kijiji.com). This is a local site owned by online retailing giant eBay. You can post your furniture for sale the same way you would on eBay, but with Kijiji (Swahili for ""village""), you will be able to sell to local buyers only.

, If you inherited an heirloom piece of furniture or you have something too precious to sell the traditional ways, let a professional handle it.

Clean off your furniture.,
Remove any hardware.,
Fill in gouges and deep scratches when needed.,
Sand down wood furniture.,
Choose a chalk paint color.,
Mark off areas with painter’s tape.,
Test a small patch.,
Start painting from the bottom to the top.,
Apply two to three additional coats.,
Add a coat of wax.,
Apply a final coat of wax.,
Reinstall your hardware.",How to Use Chalk Paint on Furniture," Start wiping down your furniture to remove any dirt and debris. Try wiping down the piece with a clean, slightly damp rag first. Then take a cleaning wipe like Lysol or Clorox and go back over it. You don’t want any dust or grit to get stuck under your coats of paint., Before you start painting, be sure to remove any handles, buttons, or decorative items that you don’t want to paint over. As you remove them, pay attention to where they went and how they were installed. This will make it easier when you have to put everything back on. Place each piece into a ziploc bag so they don’t get lost after you start painting.

, If you are painting an older piece or one you purchased from a thrift store, be sure to check it for any marks. Look over the piece first for large discolorations, indents, or scratches. Then run your hands over the item just to be sure. If you find any, use a filler like Elmer’s Wood Filler and a putty knife to close up the gouges.You can also leave these marks if you would prefer a more dated and worn look.

, Take a fine grit sandpaper like Pro Grade Precision 220 and use a sponge or sanding block for consistent pressure. This will keep your sanding even. Work from the top downward. Make sure to sand with the grain as sanding against it can deeply damage the wood.Vacuum off and wipe down the furniture again once you’ve finished.

, Chalk paint comes in a variety of colors from white and black to baby blue and light green. You can choose any color you’d like, however, keep in mind that depending on the color of the item you’re painting, you may have to put on additional coats. For example, if you are working with darker colored furniture like a deep mahogany or black metal, you may need to apply three to four coats of a lighter paint.However, chalk paint goes on thick and dries quickly, so even multiple coats won’t take long. A four ounce container should also be more than enough.
The most popular chalk paint comes from Annie Sloan, but you can also make your own with just latex paint, water, and baking powder., If there are any areas on your furniture that you’d prefer to leave unpainted, make sure to mark them with painter’s tape. For example, if you are working with a dresser or items with drawers, you can add painter’s tape to the side of each to keep them clear. Of course, if you want to paint the entire piece, then painter’s tape is unnecessary.

, Pick a small out of the way area on your furniture. This can be on the back of the piece, inside a drawer, or an inconspicuous corner. Apply one coat of paint and let it dry. Then add another layer and allow that to dry as well. Check for any bleed through of the color beneath the paint. If you don’t see any, feel free to continue.


Woods like cherry and mahogany are prone to bleeding through paint and may need to be coated in shellac first. Try a spray shellac like Bull’s Eye and apply two to three coats before painting. The shellac should only take an hour to dry., The top of the piece usually requires the most attention and coats. So it’s best to start from the bottom of the piece and work upwards. Just as you did with sanding, make sure to paint with the grain. This will make applying the paint easier. It should also makes your strokes smoother.


Once you get to the top of the piece, make sure to paint side to side without stopping.

, After you apply the first coat of paint the piece will look rough and unfinished. Don't worry! It is normal for the first coat to look a bit unappealing. Wait for this coat to dry and then apply another immediately after. Each coat should take a half hour to an hour to dry., After your paint has dried, begin applying your wax. You can use a product like Annie Sloan’s Clear Soft Wax or Minwax Paste Finishing Wax, which will bond to the paint to create a lasting and durable finish. Use a wax brush or soft cloth to apply the wax. Work in small sections and rub the wax into the surface in circular motions.

, Once you’ve covered the entire piece, wait 10-15 minutes and apply another, final coat. Use a brand new cloth and work in the same manner as before, rubbing the wax into the piece in small sections. Use a separate rag to remove any excess wax as you go along. When you are finished, swipe a finger across the surface to make sure there are no streaks. If you see one, simply run a clean cloth over the area to remove the extra wax.It takes wax 21 days to cure completely, so be careful with your furniture until then.

, Once the wax dries, reinstall any hardware you removed before you painted. Be careful of the wax that is still curing when you put each item back on. This is also a good time to clean older hardware or to replace the previous pieces with brand new handles, knobs, or decorative items.

Remove any feet or other fragile pieces from the furniture.,
Surround the furniture in Styrofoam sheets.,
Build the sides of the box.,
Make lids for the top and bottom of the box.,
Strap the entire box together.",How to Ship Large Furniture1," If a piece of furniture with feet is packed right-side-up in a box, the feet will likely be broken in transit as the box can be handled quite roughly. If the furniture's feet, doors, or any other small or delicate parts can be removed and wrapped in bubble wrap, do so.;
, Rigid Styrofoam sheets can be purchased at shipping or office supply stores, and are ideal for protecting large furniture. Cut the sheets to fit around all of the furniture's surfaces, taping the sheets together using packing tape.

, The 4 sides of the shipping box can be built from large sheets of corrugated cardboard, often available in a 30-inch x 40-inch (75 x 100 cm) size. Cut the sheets to fit tightly around the Styrofoam sheets. Avoid seaming the cardboard together at the corners. Instead, bend the cardboard sheets to form the corners and tape them together where the ends meet.

, Lids for the open top and bottom of your box can be made by cutting a sheet of cardboard a few inches wider than the opening on all sides. Fold each side down, cutting away the excess in the corners. Tape the corners together so that each lid looks like the lid of a shoebox.

, When you're ready to ship, use polypropylene strapping in both directions to secure the lids to the box. This strapping can be purchased at shipping supply stores or online through a specialty retailer.

Measure the package in all directions.,
Check the dimension restrictions for several carriers.,
Open an account with a freight carrier if necessary.,
Look for other shipping options.",How to Ship Large Furniture2," Measuring the package is important because it will determine whether or not you can ship the box through a private carrier such as UPS, DHL, or FedEx.

, Companies like UPS and FedEx list their dimension restrictions online. They often have an oversized package fee that is charged for packages over a certain size, and there may be a certain size or weight beyond which they cannot ship. Scheduling a pickup with these carriers can be done online.

, For packages that are too large for regular package carriers, you can ship the furniture through a freight company like Old Dominion. These companies usually require you to have a standing account before shipping, which can often be opened through their website.

, Some transit services also offer low-cost options for shipping large furniture. In the United States, Greyhound offers inexpensive shipping aboard its bus lines, but your recipient will have to pick up the furniture at a Greyhound station.

Install the die: Choose a die according to the size of the pipe that you wish to bend.,
Install the follower block: The size of the follower block has to correspond with the die.,
Prepare the pipe: Take a pipe with a size corresponding to that of the die and the follower block.,
Insert the pipe: The follower block is kept loose so as to adjust the height when inserting the tube.,
Install the U-strap: The U-strap holds the pipe in place with the lug.,
Fix up the drive pin: The drive pin locks the pivot arms to the die, thus facilitating the bending process.,
Align the pipe: Adjust the pipe so that the random mark that was previously made lines up with the leading edge of the die.,
Create tension in the pivot arms: The pivot arms are usually loose.,
Install the degree pointer: Take the pointer and place it on the end of the lug.,
Engage the drive rack: Engage the first notch of the drive rack into the sleeve at the end of the pivot arm.,
Start the bending process: Pull on the handle and the pivot arms will begin to open.,
Reset the bender: Once you have reached the last notch in the drive rack, you need to reset the bender.,
Remove the pipe: Once you have got the bends you need, it is time to remove the pipe.",How to Use a Pipe Bender," Remove the die pivot pin. Insert the die into the die slot and insert the pin into the die to secure it.
, Place the block near the die with sufficient space for the tube. Then take the follower block pin and insert it into the main bender arm and the follower block., Using a pen or marker, make a random mark at the point where you want to start the bend., Hold the pipe in between the follower block and the die. Vertically align the block to the pipe, and then insert the pipe into the machine. The die will rotate outwards as you insert the pipe. Once the pipe is in place, rotate the die back into the correct position., It consists of a pin that corresponds to the size of the pipe and the follower block. Remove the strap pin. Slip the strap over the pipe and reinsert the pin., Take the pin and drop it into the gap between the arms and the die., You can accomplish this by looking through one of the drive pin holes until the mark is visible., Place a little tension on the pivot arms by pulling on them., The pointer consists of a thumbscrew. Use it to anchor the pointer to the lug. Ensure that the pointer is resting on the degree ring and is aligned to zero degrees. At this point, you need to tighten the tensioner bolt, which is located next to the die.,, The die will rotate and bend the pipe. At the same time, the pointer will begin to indicate the curvature measurement. As you bend the pipe, engage the subsequent teeth of the drive rack and work your way down to the last notch., Complete the last half turn of the handle and hold it in the closed position. Keep a little pressure on the handle and detach the release lever of the anti spring back kit. Then release the drive pin, allowing the pivot arm to become loose. Put a little pressure on the release lever and reset the pivot arms. Place the drive pin in the next drive hole while keeping the arms in their reset position. Then you can continue the bending process., Keep a little tension on the handle and detach the spring back kit. Swing the drive rack and the handle out of your way. Remove the drive pin and close the pivot arms. Loosen the tensioner bolt, remove the U-strap pin, and take out the pipe from the machine."

Go through your house to check for leaky water pipes.,
Know what type of pipe material you will be wrapping.,
Find the length and diameter of each pipe you will wrap.,
Visit your local building supplies store.,
Follow any specific directions from the product's manufacturer to wrap the pipes.,
Encase pipes and their heat tape in a pipe sleeve, jacket, or other insulation.,
Plug in your heat tape's plug to an outlet.",How to Wrap Pipes for Cold Weather1," Check bathroom and kitchen cabinets, the attic, basement, crawl spaces, and garage. Look for pipes running along outside walls of your house or through your foundation as well.


Use tools or have a professional licensed plumber repair any leaking pipes or pipe joints before wrapping them.;
, The pipe's material can determine what kind of insulation product you use. Check hot and cold water supply pipes since both kinds of pipes can freeze.


Plastic pipes should only be wrapped with automatic heat tape. This kind of tape is insulated with heavy rubber around its wires.

, Count the number of faucets or valves along each pipe. These figures can help you determine how much insulation product you will need to buy.


Consult your pipe manufacturer's guidelines to help you decide how much insulation you will need.

, Purchase enough pipe insulation product, such as heat tape or cable, for your pipes.

, Wrap pipes carefully with the insulation product.


Heat tape has a plug at 1 end to heat a pipe electrically. From the plug end, run the tape straight down the length of the pipe if directed to by the manufacturer. You may need to wrap heat tape in a spiral or corkscrew fashion around a pipe instead.
Wrap areas of pipe that go below ground with heat tape until you reach the frost line.
Secure the heat tape to the pipe with bands of electrical tape wrapped around the pipe's diameter. Space the bands of electrical tape according to the heat tape manufacturer's directions.

, Cover the insulation with a waterproof material if it does not have weather protection.

, It should go directly into a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) outlet without using an extension cord.


Look for a GFCI outlet under your home, near where your water supply comes in.

Copper connectors
Copper pipe
Insulated gloves (optional; recommended)
Lead-free plumbing solder
Pipe cutter
Pipe plug (optional; to prevent water trickles)
Plumbing flux paste
Propane torch
Sandpaper or emery cloth
Wire brush;
, Construction materials vary considerably depending on purpose, and using the wrong gauge pipe or fitting can lead to a plumbing fiasco. If you are unsure which to use, check city code to determine your piping needs more exactly, but the following descriptions should help you evaluate whether your pipe is suitable for your job:


Copper pipe has three different classes -Type M, is thin walledType L, is medium walled, and is usually ideal for home useType K, is thick walled
Copper pipe fittings come in three basic types -Category 1, for making bends or turns in your pipeCategory 2, for joining or branching pipeCategory 3, which includes couplings and adapters for your pipe., You'll need your pipe to be at the desired length for your plumbing project before you do anything. To accomplish this goal you should use a pipe cutter, which can be rented or purchased from most home improvement retailers. You may want to consider a pipe cutter that has guides, as these will help you accomplish a clean, straight cut that is free of rough edges.Tighten your pipe cutter, which should be shaped similar to a C-clamp, so that the pipe is firmly held by the cutter.
Turn your cutter so that it scores the pipe as it rotates.
Tighten your cutter again, and then turn it several more times until your pipe is severed. Depending on the thickness of your pipe and quality of your cutter, you may need to tighten the cutter a third time., If you don't have a pipe cutter available, there are a variety of tools you can use in place of it, though using a pipe cutter will often yield the best results. In a pinch, you can also use:


A hacksaw
An abrasive wheel
A portable or stationary band saw, You can smooth burred, sharp, or rough edges with fine grain sandpaper, an emery cloth, or even steel wool.After your pipe is smooth, you should clear any loose metal shavings left over from your pipe cutting with a clean rag.


When working with jagged or burred pipe, you may want to wear work gloves to protect against cuts and slivers.

, You'll want to see if the copper piping and connectors fit together before going to the trouble of by assembling everything or applying flux. Insert the tube end into the fitting cup, and then visually examine it with your other parts to be sure these line up and fit properly.If you plan to work on a functioning copper pipe, be sure to turn off the water main or cut off valve.

, You can achieve this by tipping the pipe, though in some cases this might not be possible. If you cannot tip-drain your pipe, use a dry, clean cloth or some paper towel to absorb all liquid near where you will be sweating the pipe.

, This is necessary to promote the best possible joining between your component parts. Take your wire brush, and clean the pipe until it shines brightly. Give the joint ends the same treatment, until all the ends you will be sweating have a bright sheen.


After cleaning the pipe, wipe away any grit with a clean rag.
Cleaning the pipe removes oxidation buildup from the metal, which can cause a weak bond.
If you are connecting to a valve or other fixture, be sure it is open so you don't melt or warp any internal seals.

, Although flux for potable fixtures is specifically intended to be non-toxic to your drinking water, flux that has yet to be heat treated can be harmful if it gets in your eyes or any open cuts. You should wear gloves when applying flux to your pipe., You shouldn't attempt to solder pipes that have residual water, as even a small amount of water can make your efforts futile. If you notice a trickle of water in your line, push a pipe plug into the line to stop the flow of water. In the event that you don't have a plug on hand, an old trick used a wad of soft, white bread in the place of a plug to briefly halt the water.


This technique does work, but has a minute chance of clogging aerators or valves when the line is turned on and the bread flushed., Copper pipe will not bond with the solder you will later apply to adhere your pipes together unless it is chemically treated with flux. Remember not to apply flux with your bare hands, as contact with your eyes, mouth, or open cuts could expose you to unsafe chemicals.Brush your plumbing flux paste on the outside of your pipe to prepare it for soldering.Flux creates a clean surface for the solder, which will bond your copper components together.
Only a small amount of flux needs to be applied.
Wipe away excess flux with a clean cloth.

, You'll need to use your torch for this purpose. Hold your torch about 2 inches (5.1 cm) away from the fitting and pass it evenly over the part for about 10 to 20 seconds to warm the part and the flux. As the flux melts, it will first get shiny, then the copper should darken, and finally the flux should begin to sizzle and smoke slightly. This indicates that the pipe is ready for soldering.If you are inexperienced with working with a torch, especially to heat metal, you should wear insulated gloves to protect from accidental burns.
Be careful to avoid burning your forearm, or any other part of your body, on the heated pipe, which will be hot to the touch.
Focused or extreme heat is not necessary to melt your flux; the paste will melt at a relatively low temperature., Again, taking care not to burn yourself on a heated part, you should insert the tube end into the fitting cup firmly until you feel the tube come to rest against the base of the cup. Twist your pipe slightly to spread the flux evenly inside the joint., Now that your pieces are joined, you'll want to heat these again to prepare for the application of solder. Pass your torch evenly over the copper of the fitting. Unevenly heated copper could cause uneven melting of your solder and compromise your watertight seal.

, You do not want to overheat your pipe and you should avoid applying your torch directly to your flux or solder as well. You can test to see if your pipe is ready for the solder by holding the solder to the pipe. If the solder runs, your pipe is at the right temperature.If your fitting glows or turns blue, you have applied too much heat and will have to wait for it to cool before trying again., Remove the heat and apply lead-free plumbing solder to the parts of your fitting where one part of the copper fits into another. Maneuver your solder so that it runs into the fit, continuing to apply the solder until it completely seals all gaps in the fitting the entire way around the pipe.If the joint forms a t-junction, begin at the base, move up to the top, and then down the other side.
If the joint is vertical, move the solder around the joint, covering it evenly.
If the copper is blackened or the solder beads, appears discolored, or drips out, your pipe may be too hot.

Never use acid core solder for sweating copper pipe., If you are new at sweating a pipe and work slowly, you may have to reheat part of a t-joint or elbow if your copper pipe has lost too much heat from its first torching. To protect any joints you have already soldered, place a thoroughly damp cloth on the parts you have already soldered, then carefully apply your torch to the part yet to be done.

, This can be done simply by brushing a little more flux paste while the copper remains warm. Then you can wipe your newly sweated joint clean with a cloth.


Do not try to cool the pipe rapidly with water or you may damage the joint.Do not tighten the fixture you are soldering or move the joint until it has fully cooled.

, After your copper has fully cooled and you've restored the flow of water to the line, leaks or drips mean you'll have to repeat the process again. Unfortunately, you will not be able to fix the problem by simply adding more solder to the joint, and will have to reheat the pipe, pull the joint apart, clean off previously applied materials, and start from the beginning."

Purchase or rent a manual pipe threader machine from an equipment retailer.,
Inspect the pipe threader before beginning and replace dies or any parts that show signs of wear.,
Mount your pipe firmly in the pipe vise by placing it in the vise and then tightening until it is held tightly.

,
Cut the end of the pipe cleanly and squarely by using a pipe cutter.,
Ream the cut end of the pipe to remove any burrs from the cut using a reamer, which is a cylinder-shaped rotary cutting tool that you run smoothly across the freshly cut edges of the pipe to remove rough edges.

,
Select your die head according to the size and type of pipe you are threading and the thread form you require.,
Place the die head over the pipe on the threader.

,
Press steadily on the front of the die head, while simultaneously pushing the handle down to start the threader.,
Use your weight as leverage to apply pressure on the handle, while holding it firmly.,
Apply threading oil generously while threading.,
Cease threading when the end of the threading die is flat against the end of the pipe.,
Reverse the ratchet mechanism and turn the die head in the opposite direction.,
Stand the pipe on end and gently tap it to remove any particles that may be lodged within.

,
Clean the pipe with a cloth, removing any oil.,
Seal the threading with Teflon tape or a pipe thread compound when attaching the pipe to the connector.

,
Clean the pipe threader machine thoroughly after use so the oils and metal pieces do not damage the machine, which could cause sub-standard threading during your next project.

",How to Thread Pipe,"


A die head will be attached to cut the thread.
Machines now have the ability to thread pipes made of different material, including various types of plastic or resin.
A heavy duty pipe threader can also cut your pipe into workable sections.
The pipe threading machine will be used to thread the end section of your pipe.;
,


Inspection for signs of wear will not be necessary if you purchase a new threader.
Worn or damaged dies can result in poor thread quality.

,,


If you have an industrial pipe threader with cutting capability, use the machine to cut your pipe to length.
Pipe cutters come with and without guides, which provide square alignment. It's better to use a guide, rather than estimating your cut.
The pipe cutter will have a thin cutter wheel, which will slice through the pipe as you guide it in the space.
Be sure to wear goggles and protective gear. Steel may produce sparks.

,,


Die heads come in different shapes and sizes that include different threads for pipes that have different diameters.

,,


Before placing too much pressure on the handle, check to be sure the ratchet pawl is engaged.

,


Be sure to maintain proper footing and balance for maximum control.
Never use a tool or mechanism to hold the handle in place in order to free your hands.
This can be dangerous and could result in injury.

,


Using an oil too thin as a substitute for threading oil can result in sub-standard threading.

,


When the die is even with the pipe, that means the correct threading size has been reached.
If you continue pushing after this point, you will damage the thread.

,


Be careful to maintain control of the threader as the dies are removed.
Threads can become damaged when the die head is being removed if you don't maintain control and move the piece smoothly.

,,


Be careful, the threads will be very sharp.

This will likely include, at minimum, desks and office chairs for each person. From there, your furniture needs will vary widely based on the type of business. For example, a business that will be entertaining clients might need a meeting place with a table and chairs. You might also need storage space or specialized furniture for various purposes.


Consider what you need first if your budget is small. You can add furniture you want as time goes on.;
, Most furniture rental companies charge much more for short term rentals (less than 30 days) than long term rentals. If you can figure out how to get use out of rented furniture for longer than a month, you'll save a great deal of money., Having good furniture is important to maintaining worker productivity and projecting a professional image to clients (if necessary). That said, your specific furniture needs will vary based on your business. An office that is never visited by customers will not need to appear as spotless as one that is, so you can probably get away with used furniture.


However, a modern or technology-focused company will likely want new future.
Used furniture will be cheaper, but consider the downsides before going that route. For one, employees may be less inclined to work if they think management doesn't care about their workspace., You have several options when it comes to acquiring furniture for your office. The simplest is just to buy the furniture you need. However, this can sometimes be cost-prohibitive when a business is starting out. So, your other options are to either rent or lease the furniture. These options allow you to pay a monthly fee to use the furniture.


You might also consider rent-to-own. Ask the company what their options are for rent-to-own pieces of furniture. Sometimes renting-to-own can be a good deal, just make sure you aren't paying the extra price premium of leasing while getting a set of used furniture for your trouble.
If you're that intent on buying, it might just be a better option to finance a purchase instead.

, You will have options when it comes to paying for your furniture. If you have the money, you can avoid a lot of headache by simply using your own money. However, if funds are short, you may also use a bank loan or supplier financing. Most suppliers offer easy financing for a furniture purchase. This will allow you to spread out the cost of buying the furniture over time.If you need a bank loan, you will have to have good enough credit to quality for one.

, For most business owners, the decision will come down to cost. In short, this depends on your goals for the furniture. If you plan to use this furniture long-term, buying will likely be cheaper. However, if you need furniture temporarily, it might make more sense to rent. This is useful for temporary office locations or to accommodate seasonal workers.


In either case, contact various suppliers and get quotes for purchases or rentals of the furniture you need.

, While purchasing office furniture outright is usually cheaper than leasing it, it comes with a large up-front cost. If cash flow is an issue for your business, leasing could be the smarter option for you.For instance, if you financed $10,000 worth of furniture for 36 months at 11.24% interest, you’d end up paying $1,124 more than you would have if you’d purchased the furniture outright (which doesn’t even take into account what you might recoup by reselling your furniture). Nonetheless, if you think you can make more than $1,124 over the next three years with a $10,000 investment today, it would be the smarter option to lease the furniture.

, There are tax advantages that come with buying and leasing, but some advantages are more valuable to some companies than others.For example, many small businesses can deduct up to $500,000 toward the cost of new furniture for the year they bought it (even if they bought it with their own line of credit). Lease payments are also deductible, but since lease payments for a year will typically be less than the whole cost of the lease, there’s a smaller total deduction.
If your business is making a lot of money the year to purchase the furniture, buying might put you in a more advantageous position.

, One important difference between leasing and purchasing office furniture is the impact is has on a company’s overall balance sheet. Owned furniture is always an asset, while leased furniture is a liability.Renting, however, is treated as an expense. Your choice can have important implications for your business's financial health.


For example, if you were planning on applying for a new line of credit or other type of loan, you might want to make your assets appear to be as numerous as possible, which could improve your chances of approval for the loan.

, After considering the costs and various effects on your finances, choose the option that makes the most sense for your business. If you are undecided, you might try to find a short-term rental or lease to try it out before committing to a longer-term one.

, Like a lot of businesses, different furniture rental companies cater to different price points and style sensibilities. If you need to go for higher end furniture, look at companies like CORT and American Furniture Rentals. If you need something more economical, Rent-a-Center is a good option.If you need furniture for a specific event, like a convention or a reception, it's a good idea to search exactly for that type of furniture rental company. Chic Event Furniture is a good example of an event supplier.
Don’t forget about delivery, set-up, and pick up costs. Many furniture rental companies will try to get you to add the charge for delivery, set-up, and pick-up to the lease itself. While this might be right for you, not taking it into account can really distort the actual cost of the lease.Remember, you’re going to be paying interest on everything that’s included in the lease. So the $500 charge for delivery, set-up, and pick-up can cost you far more than the sticker price.
Deposits are another way the cost of furniture rental can be disguised. The deposit amount will vary based on the amount of furniture you rent, but even for one piece of furniture, it could range from $100 to $1000.

, Tap your connections in the community of local business owners to see if there are any local furniture rental places that stand out or come highly recommended. Be sure to ask if there are any companies or promotions to avoid, as well.

, Basically, you need to read the fine print. Be sure to look through the entire lease agreement, ask questions, and do your best to negotiate the best deal.

, Depending on your insurance coverage, a damage waiver can be a perk or a needless charge. That’s because some insurance policies will cover certain types of damage even to a piece of leased furniture.The best way to find out what’s covered and what isn’t is to call your insurer. Be sure to call the insurer before you sit down with the furniture dealer, so you aren’t pressured into accepting coverage you don’t need.

, For example, you might want to look for a lease allowing you to add and subtract pieces as needed. Depending on your creditworthiness and the furniture dealer, you might be able to secure a lease allowing you to add and subtract pieces as needed.These kinds of deals sometimes add a surcharge the month you subtract the piece, and charge an additional amount to your monthly payment when you add a piece.

, Generally, the longer the lease period, the more you’ll end up paying. Furniture companies typically offer leases anywhere from three to sixty months, so this cost of an extended lease can really add up.For example, that same $10,000 in financed furniture will end up costing more over the life of a sixty month lease versus a lease for thirty-six months, even if the monthly payments are more than a third less.
So $10,000 financed over sixty months at a $200 per month payment ends up costing about $700 more than the same $10,000 financed for thirty-six months at $300., Your termination options might include ending the rental or lease or buying the furniture at the end of the contract term. Depending on your contract terms, you may also be able to end the lease early for a fee. Be sure to ask the rental company about these options before signing."

Get copper tubing of appropriate diameter.,
Make sure the tubing is of the proper wall thickness for your project.Most nominally-sized copper tubing is available in four weights, or wall thicknesses, which is color-coded.,
Get the proper connectors and joints for the system you are building.Depending on your project, you'll probably need some combination of the following:


Male/Female adapters, which are used to join a solder pipe to a threaded pipe.,
Select solder.,
Obtain the appropriate solder flux.,
Get a heat source.,
Prepare the pipe.,
Brush the cleaned surfaces with the solder flux as soon as possible after cleaning, and assemble the fitting and tubing.,
Light the torch and adjust it so you have a blue flame.,
Melt solder into the joint.,
Wipe excess liquid solder from the hot surfaces using a clean, dry cotton rag.,
Flush the piping thoroughly.",How to Solder Copper Tubing," Copper tubing used for plumbing piping is available sized nominally, meaning that the outside diameter of the tubing is 1/8"" (0.125 inches) larger than its stated size. In other words, 1"" nominal copper tubing measures 1.125"" inches in diameter.


If you need to cut the pipe for your project, make sure that you use a tube cutter, clamping the pipe firmly and rotating the cutter around the pipe. It should take about 8 turns.;
, Typically, though, residential projects will involve copper tubing of either Type L or M.


Type L tubing is marked with a blue tag and is typically the most commonly used in commercial/residential installations. Type M is marked red and has the lightest wall that can be used for a pressurized system.

,
Reducing adapters, which are used to go from a larger size pipe to a smaller size.
Elbow joints, which are used to turn corners, typically 90 degree bends, but also available in 45 degree bends.
Tees and crosses, which are used to join a branch tubing to the main tubing, using a tee, or two branches in the case of a ""cross.""

, For potable water systems, lead-free solid core solder must be used. It is typically 95/5 (95% tin and 5% antimony), or an alloy of tin and a small amount of copper and/or silver, commonly sold in one pound rolls of 1/8"" diameter wire. Solder with lead must not be used for potable water systems.

, This is typically a jelly with a zinc chloride or rosin cleaning component used to cover the cleaned surfaces of the copper to be soldered before assembly and heating. It is the function of the flux, upon heating, to facilitate further cleaning, exclude atmospheric oxygen, prevent re-oxidation, and to aide in wetting out the solder.

, Typically, a traditional electric soldering iron won't be hot enough to work with copper tubing. You'll need a heat source of sufficient output capacity to heat the assembled fittings and tubing to a temperature above that required to melt the filler solder, typically 400 to 500 °F (204 to 260 °C). For this reason, a propane/air, or acetylene/air torch fitted with a tip of appropriate size is most often used. Clean, dry cotton rags and a spray bottle full of water will complete the necessary soldering materials.

, Remove the copper oxide coating on both the outside of the tubing in the area to be inserted into the fitting, and the inside of the fitting itself. For this, you can use sandpaper, emery cloth, or specialty devices sold in stores for this purpose. All copper oxide must be thoroughly removed from both surfaces until they are both completely clean, with no dirt, grease, oil or other impediment which will interfere with the wetting out of the solder. If you don't, this will result in a leaky joint somewhere down the road.


Any small drips of water through the joint being soldered will prevent the process from working, resulting in a leaky fitting. If the system valves will not stop the drip completely before you start working, stop up the pipe with a piece of white bread, inserted in the tubing as far as possible away from the heated area. This will temporarily dam the water flow and will dissolve easily during the flushing operation suggested at the end of the job.

, Apply flux to the inside and outside of the copper tubing.

, Move the end of the blue flame against the assembled fitting and tubing, moving it all around the components in the area into which solder must be placed. With constant movement at all times, heat slowly and uniformly while testing the melting point of the solder by touching the tip of the solder wire to the joint.


This will take some practice. Try holding the flame in your non-dominant hand and the solder in your writing hand. Remember, you're using the flame essentially to heat up the solder and melt it. You accomplish this by applying the flame to the copper tubing and then touching the solder to the joint. The heated tubing will draw the melted solder into the joint by capillary action. Use the flame sparingly.

, Move the solder and flame to the side opposite the melted solder, continually feeding small amounts of solder and moving the torch until the solder has circled the fitting.


The solder will seem to run toward the heat. The purpose is to allow the solder to completely fill the area between the fitting and the tubing by letting it run into the cracks. On larger fittings, concentrate the heat slightly ahead of the wetted solder to allow this to occur.
Be careful not to overheat the copper. Keep the torch moving constantly to prevent blackening the copper. If the joint is overheated and blackened, you'll need to disassemble it and re-clean the pipe, otherwise you'll risk a leaky fitting.

, Spray a mist of water on the area soldered to freeze the solder and prevent movement of the joint which would create a leak.

, Use fresh potable water to remove any excess flux, dirt, or loose solder beads inside the tubing after all soldered connections are completed. This will also help you check for leaks when the job is done.

Check all pipe anchoring locations.,
Add cushioning to prevent rattling or banging pipes.",How to Quiet Noisy Pipes1," Older pipe anchors come loose over time and may need to be tightened or replaced. Pipes are usually anchored to wood floor joists using metal clamps.


Replace these clamps if they are loose, or add more clamps if the pipes are easily moved. Install anchors every 6 to 8 feet (1.8 to 2.4 m) on horizontal pipes and every 8 to 10 feet (2.4 to 3 m) on vertical pipes.;
,


Wrap a piece of rubber around the pipe and secure the wrapped area to the joist with a metal clip. If you don't have pipe insulating foam, a piece of rubber inner tube or garden hose will work. Do this every 4 feet (1.2 m) along length of the pipe.
Leave room for expansion around the pipe or anchoring mechanism. This is particularly important when insulating plastic pipes.
Avoid galvanized anchors on copper piping. Even small pipe movement can create a lot of noise when metal on metal comes against metal.

,
Drain all the pipes in the home by turning on every faucet in the house.

,
Close the faucets before turning on the main water supply.",How to Quiet Noisy Pipes2," Air chambers are designed to provide a cushion when the water is turned on and off. If the chamber fills with water, you may hear a hammer noise when turning your faucets on and off.

Check the chair seat, also called a seat pan.,
Select a chair that allows you to adjust the height.,
Inspect the chair's lower back support.,
Arrange to test out the chair for at least an hour.,
Scrutinize the recline function of the chair to see if it supports your back.,
Swivel and slide the chair as you would in your daily activities.,
Examine the chair's armrests, which should be wide and contoured.",How to Select an Ergonomic Chair," It should feel comfortable and fit you properly. Look for the following:


Make sure you have at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of room on either side of your hips and thighs when you sit.
The seat should be short enough that it shouldn't hit you on the back of the knees.
The seat should be designed in such a way that your weight is distributed evenly when you sit on it.;
, You should be able to adjust it so that while you are seated, your knees are level with your feet on the floor. You should have an easy time adjusting the lever while seated.

,


Some chairs have cushions that you can adjust to fit your preference; that would be best if the chair will have multiple users.
If you're selecting a chair for yourself, sit with your back flush against the chair back to test if it is comfortable for you. Make sure the back rest is large enough to support both your lower back and your hips. If a chair is too narrow through the hips it can force you to sit forward, leaving your thighs without support.

, Find out if the chair's cushioning adequate; if it is not, it can become deformed. Fatigue can set into the back and hip area if there's not enough cushion support.

, You should be able to move your back into different positions comfortably throughout the day.

, If you find it difficult to perform these tasks in the chair, then keep looking. You haven't found the ergonomic chair for you., An ergonomic chair will have armrests that you can adjust in and out to fit your comfort level.

Remove the lead and oakum in the leaking joint.,
Remove ALL of the material from the joint.,
Once the joint is properly prepared (clean and dry, with no residual 'stuff'), fill it with oakum (a tarry hemp fiber), which is packed into the space between bell and spigot using steel instruments called 'caulking irons.',
Fill the last space.,
Every joint must consist of one inch of lead, all poured at once.",How to Repair Lead Joint Hub Plumbing Pipe," This can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, depending upon the location of the joint, its size and the level of your commitment to the process. There are times when one simply MUST do a caulked joint, and times when the quick, cheap, and easy nature of PVC makes the choice a 'no-brainer'.
, It's pretty much impossible to get a leak-free repair from a partial replacement of the original seal., Old screwdrivers make good improvised caulking irons.

Pack each with several turns of oakum so as to make a relatively solid joint between the pipes. These layers are continually hammered into the joint, around and around, until there's only one inch of space between the top of the oakum and the rim of the hub.

, The remaining one-inch space will be filled with molten lead in one continuous pour, and the surface of the lead hammered around and around the circumference of the joint ensures a solid seal between the iron and the lead. Horizontal joints require the use of a joint runner, which is a non-combustible rope which is clamped around the top of the joint with a space at the top into which the molten lead is poured., Oakum must be hammered so as to compress and seal the gap between pipes. Joint runners permit the pouring of vertical joints in horizontal pipes."

Wrap heater tapes around the pipes.,
Insulate all water pipes from cold moving air.,
Insulate and heat the drain lines.,
Open the tap on cold days without power.,
Use a thermal convection-powered hot water recirculation valve.,
Use a RedyTemp.,
Adjust the thermostat.",How to Prevent Frozen Water Pipes1," Buy UL-endorsed tape with a built-in thermostat. This safety precaution will prevent the tape from overheating You can either wrap the tape around the pipes or run them along the length of the pipes. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions.


While you can lay insulation over some tapes, others might cause the insulation to catch fire. Always read the safety information before installing the tape.
Alternatively, you could use a heated reflector lamp in a dry enclosed space. On cold nights, check the light to see that it is working.;
, Wrap pipes in foam rubber insulation designed for pipes. Make sure that there aren’t any gaps between the pipe and the insulation. Miter any strips of insulation that meet at the corners of pipes. Secure them with duct tape. Keep the foam dry as you insulate.


Insulation alone doesn’t prevent freezing. It only slows down the transfer rate of heat to cold., Apply foam rubber insulation in the same way you insulated the pipes. Pay attention to bathroom and kitchen sinks. Don’t overlook lines in crawl spaces and cold basements. On especially cold days, direct a heat lamp on the drain P-trap.If you’re concerned about a fire hazard, keep the cabinet doors beneath the kitchen and bathroom sinks open to allow warm air to circulate around the pipes., If you lose electric power, let the water run no faster than a slow constant drip. This is cheaper than repairing a burst pipe. First, start a slow drip on the hot side faucet, then a faster drip on the cold side faucet. There is no need to run a lot of water. Bathrooms can be cold, as long as they aren't freezing., This doesn’t require electricity to operate. It bypasses the drain and continuously circulates warm water through the waterlines. Turn the water off at the main source before installing. Remove the valves under the sink with a mini hacksaw. Use the included connecting joints to attach the valve to the copper fitting from the wall. Secure the fittings to the pipes with a wrench. Switch off the valve whenever you don’t want the water to circulate.


This method requires that the valve be installed at a higher level (usually the second or third floor) than the water heater.
Circulating water throughout your system non-stop will also increase your water heating bill., This device uses an internal water contacting temperature probe to monitor the water temperature inside the pipes. Disconnect one end of the existing faucet supply lines. Attach them to the RedyTemp. Connect the two faucet supply lines that come with the device. Plug the unit into a standard wall socket and set the desired temperature set point.


Gauge the effectiveness of your chosen set point by opening cold water faucets upstream and feeling how cool or warm the water is coming out the tap. Adjust the set point accordingly until optimized. You’ll achieve an optimized set point when cool or warm water stays in the cold water pipes or the portion of pipe requiring protection.
If you own a tankless on-demand water heater, you’ll need the TL4000 series model rather than the more common ATC3000. During off seasons when you don’t need circulation, lower the temperature set point., Set the home or structure's thermostat to at least 55 °F (13 °C). This will keep the temperature well above the freezing point of water. It will also allow enough warm air to circulate to the attic and behind walls, where pipes are often located."

Try a plunger.,
Use a wire coat hanger.,
Snake your drain.",How to Unclog a Sink Naturally1," The plunger can unclog your sink just as easily as it can unclog your toilet. Be sure to clean the plunger before using it on the sink, though, or purchase a new plunger for use in the sink.Cover the drain opening completely with the plunger.
Pump the plunger up and down several times to loosen the clog.
Remove the plunger after a minute or so of work to see if water will flow down the sink. If the sink is still clogged, continue to plunge to further loosen the blockage.;
, Bend a wire coat hanger into a straight line, with the curved hook at one end. Slide the wire hook-first down your clogged drain and see if you can hook and remove or otherwise break apart any portions of the blockage.








Push the hanger down until you feel some resistance. Then, wiggle the hanger up and down and side to side to try to get it to latch onto the block.
Once you believe you have hooked the block, pull the hanger up to clear out whatever you have caught.
If you do not feel resistance as you push the hanger down, chances are your clog is lower and you need a specialty tool.

, A drain snake is a long metal cable with a coil or auger on the end that helps manually remove blockages from drains. Purchase a drain snake appropriately sized for your sink at your local hardware or home improvement store to help you clear stubborn blocks.








Feed the snake into the drain and push downward until you feel some resistance from the clog.
Once you’ve hit the clog, turn the cable clockwise for three to four full rotations, then pull up somewhat. If you feel some resistance, you have likely hooked on the clogged matter.
Continue to rotate the drain snake until you have pushed through the entirety of the clog and started to break it into smaller pieces.
When you feel resistance start to lessen, pull the snake out slowly and remove what’s left of the clog from the end of the auger.
Check to make sure your drain is unclogged. If water still won’t flow down it properly, repeat the snake process.

Locate the main water supply.,
Turn off the main water supply.,
Shut off secondary supply valves.,
Inspect the supply lines.,
Treat the sump pump.,
Disconnect watering implements from your outdoor spigot.,
Treat the exterior spigot.,
Call a plumber.",How to Prevent Frozen Water Pipes2," This consists of two parts. You should find one part near the meter on the street side of your house. The location of the second part depends on where you live. If you live in a warm climate, look on an outside wall or in an underground box. If you’re in a colder climate, look in the basement., First, open all faucets in the house. Then, shut down both parts of the valve. Make sure that the water flow coming from the faucets stops after a few minutes. If it doesn’t, re-check both parts of the valve and tighten them as best as you can. Call a plumber if you can’t shut off the valve or if any part of the valve breaks.


If you receive well water, turn off its electrical switch to prevent the well from pumping water inside., Take this step if you have automatic outdoor watering systems that prevent you from shutting off the main water supply. Look for round or oval handles. Turn the handles clockwise (“righty tighty”) to close the valves. Shut off valves to appliances involved in significant drainage. These include:


The dishwasher
The washing machine
The ice maker on the refrigerator

Look for this valve either under the sink or in the basement., Look for leaks, rust, cracks, and other evidence of damage. If any areas are damaged, replace them with hoses coated in braided stainless steel. These are more durable than rubber hoses. Call a plumber if you need assistance., Add a battery backup to the pump in the event of a power failure. Pour water into the pit. It should drain the water by itself. If it doesn’t, make sure the pump is plugged in and the breaker is switched on. If it’s still not working:


Make sure the motor is running normally.
Check the pipe for evidence of freezing or clogging.
Clean the discharge line.
Call a plumber if all else fails., This includes the hose and the sprinkler. Disconnect everything in the winter or before the temperature in your area drops below freezing. The water inside the hose can freeze and back up into the spigot until it reaches your pipes. Any pipe that freezes can burst.


You can also replace your spigot with one that prevents the water inside the house from reaching the cold exterior. These frost-free spigots are level with the connecting pipe., You can protect it from causing problems in one of three ways:


Wrap it in foam rubber insulation.
Open the spigot to drain any excess water from the connecting pipes.
Replace it with a spigot that shuts off the supply of water to pipes in the walls., If you live in an especially cold climate, ask a plumber to inspect your work to make sure you left no loose ends. Have them also drain the water heater. For an added bit of precaution, you could also ask them to empty water left in drains and traps and replace it with non-toxic antifreeze."

Locate the frozen pipe.,
Check the pipe in the area of the freeze.,
Heat the area around the frozen part.",How to Prevent Frozen Water Pipes3," Turn on each faucet one by one. If none of your faucets works, the frozen pipe is close to or right at the main water supply, usually located on the street side of your basement or in an uninsulated crawl space. Run your hands every few feet along the pipe to find a section that feels very cold. This is the frozen section.If water flows from some faucets but not others, the problem might be in a pipe connected to a specific faucet or a pipe on one side of the house. Check pipes in uninsulated walls first.
Keep all frozen taps open until water starts to flow. Then, lower the water to a trickle., Some plastic or copper pipes will split. This will flood the area when thawed. If the pipe looks burst or has a slit in it, call a plumber immediately. Turn off the water supply, as well as the water heater.If there are no splits, begin the thawing process.

, Use an electric space heater, a hair dryer, or a heat lamp in a reflector to prevent a fire. Exercise caution when placing heat-generating devices. Never leave these devices unattended for any amount of time when in use. If you have a problem, call the plumber.


Space heaters, heat lamps and reflective lamps can generate high temperatures, which might cause flammable materials to combust. If you need to place a heat source under the kitchen sink, remove all chemicals first."
"
Find a natural drain cleaner.,
Use the vinegar and baking soda method.,
Make a hydrogen peroxide solution.,
Call a plumber.",How to Unclog a Sink Naturally2," Some green cleaning lines offer enzyme-based drain cleaners that may help you loosen or unclog your drain. These cleaners eat away at so-called biofilm, and thus work best on organic clogs such as hair, soap, and grease.Environmentally-friendly drain cleaners are often cited as working best on minor to moderate blockages, and are unlikely to clear a major block.

, Baking soda and vinegar may help loosen clogs in your drain by dissolving and pushing gas into the clog. Try to avoid using it on metallic pipes, though, as the baking soda may corrode the pipe surface and leach metals from your water into your pipes.








Remove your drain cover and pour half a cup of baking soda directly down your drain. You may want to use a funnel to help get the product down.
Follow the baking soda with half a cup of distilled white vinegar.
Allow the mixture to bubble and fizz in the drain for up to 15 minutes. Once the bubbling has stopped, wash your drain out with your tap water on its hottest setting.

, Make a solution of one cup of hydrogen peroxide for every quart of cold water. Pour this down the drain and allow to sit for 20 to 30 minutes before rinsing out using tap water on its warmest setting.








Be cautious when using hydrogen peroxide, as concentrated versions of it can cause chemical burns to the skin if not monitored properly.
Do not use hydrogen peroxide if you previously tried a baking soda cleaner.

, If your clog persists after you have tried multiple natural unclogging methods, you may need to contact a local plumber to assist with your clog. Let the plumber know what methods you have already tried to unclog your sink so that they can avoid using products that may cause a negative chemical reaction.


Check local listing online or in the phonebook to see if there is a plumber near you that is environmentally-conscious.

Keep food out.,
Install screens.,
Run hot water.",How to Unclog a Sink Naturally3," Even if you have a garbage disposal, it is recommended that you keep food out of your drains as much as possible. Scrape food off into the trash can before rinsing, and use the disposal only for those small pieces that could not make it to the trash.








If you must use your disposal, be sure to put food down small amounts at a time, and run plenty of water while the disposal is running.

, Install screens or use drain catchers over your bathroom and kitchen sinks to help prevent hair, food products, and other debris from going down the drain. Drain catches are often affordable and can generally be found at home goods and home improvement stores.








Drain screens are also advisable for shower and tub drains to help prevent hairs from causing clogs in your pipes.

, Help break apart grease and dirt by running hot water down your drain once a week or after heavy use. Turn your tap water onto it hottest setting, and allow water to flow down your pipes for two to three minutes to help loosen potential clog-causing debris.








Do not heat tap water by boiling or microwaving it, as water that is too hot has the potential to harm your pipes.

Gather your materials.,
Measure out your ingredients.,
Pour the baking soda into the drain.,
Pour in the cup of vinegar.,
Plug the drain with a rag or sink stopper.,
Wait fifteen minutes.,
Pour in the pot of boiling water.",How to Unclog a Slow Running Bathroom Sink Drain1," Instead of relying on drain cleaner products, which are often corrosive and can cause allergic reactions and respiratory problems,you can use household items you likely already have, such as rags, baking soda, vinegar, lemon, and boiling water.;
, Take ¼ cup of baking soda, 1 cup of white vinegar, and 1 large pot of water to boil.Have a rag or sink stopper handy.

, Make sure that most of the baking soda falls directly into the drain rather than around it in the sink.

, You may hear a fizzing noise or see bubbles come up due to the chemical reaction. This is completely normal and should mean that the chemicals are eating away at the blockage in your sink.

, Doing so will stop the bubbles from rising up and will keep the chemical reaction concentrated on the clog.

, Allow the baking soda and vinegar reaction to fully work their magic here! While waiting, you should heat up the pot of water to boiling point.

, This step will push down the baking soda, vinegar, and blockage. Watch as you pour in the water to see if the sink is draining any faster. If it is, but still not at its normal speed, there may still be a bit of a blockage. Try repeating the process once more if this is the case.


Prior to pouring in the boiling water, you can also squeeze in the juice of a lemon, particularly if you notice an unpleasant odor coming from the sink.Bathroom sinks are often clogged by bits of hair which can eventually rot and smell bad. This extra step will neutralize the odor and also further help break down the blockage.

Gather your tools.,
Remove the sink stopper.,
Turn the sink on.,
Create a suction seal.,
Plunge.,
Remove the plunger and check for the blockage.",How to Unclog a Slow Running Bathroom Sink Drain2," For this method, you only need a flashlight and a plunger (you can buy a smaller one specifically made for sinks at any hardware store but a thoroughly cleaned toilet plunger works just as well).

, This step is crucial otherwise you will just be plunging the stopper up and down rather than forcing up the clog.


Use your hands to pull the sink stopper up as far as it will go out of the drain. Then turn it to the left and continue unscrewing until it comes out., You want to fill the sink with some water but just enough to cover the drain. An inch or so of water should be just fine.

, Place the plunger directly over the drain and press down once until you feel rubber bottom tighten into a seal. You may have to stand on a chair to make sure you are positioned directly over the sink., Using the handle of the plunger, plunge vigorously up and down about 10-20 times.Make sure that the plunger is tightly sealed around the drain, creating suction, so that the plunger is actually forcing the blockage through.

, Shine a flashlight into the drain to check for the blockage. If you can see it and can reach with your fingers and pull it out, do so. If not, repeat the steps until the clog comes out.

Get your materials ready.,
Place the bucket underneath your sink.,
Check to see what is holding your P-trap together.,
Remove the P-trap.,
Find the clog.,
Reattach the P-trap.,
Turn on the sink.",How to Unclog a Slow Running Bathroom Sink Drain3," This method is for those stubborn clogs and therefore requires more materials, including a bucket, screwdriver or wrench, and plumber’s snake (also called a drain snake).


If you do not have a plumber’s snake, you can improvise using a straightened wire hanger. Simply take a regular wire coat hanger and straighten it as much as possible, then bend one end over to create a hook., You want to position the bucket underneath the P-trap, that is, the curved part of pipe that leads directly from the drain.

, Some are held together with screws, in which case you need a screwdriver, while others have slip nuts on both ends of the pipe, in which case you will need a wrench.

, Do this step slowly and make sure the bucket is still positioned directly beneath you. Standing water as well as the small pipes inside of the P-trap may spill out and you want the bucket to catch them.


Whether the P-trap is made with screws or slip nuts, in both cases you will turn in a counterclockwise fashion to loosen the parts. When they are well loosened, you can use your fingers to pull them off completely. Be sure to keep the screws or nuts close by as you’ll need them when putting the P-trap back in place!

, First check the P-trap. If you can see the blockage, use your fingers, coat hanger, or the plumber’s snake to force it out.


Build up typically occurs in the P-trap since the curve of the pipe is designed to stop fluids from coming back up into the sink.If there is no visible clog, it is possible that the clog is in the pipe that goes into your wall. In this case, you need a plumber’s snake and it is not recommended that you substitute the wire hanger. Insert the plumber’s snake into the opening of the pipe that leads into the wall until it meets resistance (which is likely the blockage). Then tighten the nut at the base of the snake and begin twisting the snake. You can also use an in and out motion, similar to plunging, with the snake in order to dislodge the clog. Once you no longer feel any resistance at the other end, pull out the snake.

, Use either the screwdriver or wrench and turn the screws or nuts clockwise to tighten them.


Make sure you have replaced the screws or bolts tightly so that water doesn’t leak.

, The water should drain at its normal speed if the clog has been effectively removed.

Plug up any other openings.,
Turn on the shop vac.,
Pulse the shop vac.,
Continue running the shop vac until the clog comes out.,
Put the sink back together.",How to Unclog a Slow Running Bathroom Sink Drain4," You will need rags, a bucket, screwdriver or wrench for undoing the P-trap, and a wet and dry shop vacuum (also known as a shop vac).

, Position the bucket directly underneath the P-trap below the sink.

, This is the curved pipe that is often held together with screws or slip nuts. Make sure that the bucket is directly below to catch any of the standing water left in the pipes.


Depending on what the P-trap is held together with, you will use a screwdriver or wrench to turn the screws or slip nuts in a counterclockwise fashion to loosen them and then use your fingers to pull the loosened parts out completely.

, Every sink has two pipes, a vertical and horizontal one that intersect at an angle. You will be connecting the shop vac to the vertical pipe, also known as a stopper, that runs up into the sink.

, Place the nozzle directly from below in order to create as much of a seal as possible.

, Shop vacs have an option to vacuum wet or dry and in this case you want it to vacuum fluids to catch the clog.

, Doing so will ensure you have the tightest seal possible which will in turn help with the suction.


While maintaining your grip on the shop vac nozzle, seal the sink with a drain stopper and also plug up any open pipes where the P-trap was located by stuffing them with rags.

, If you cannot feel anything moving, you may want to allow a little air through by releasing the sink stopper for a few seconds at a time.

, Turn it on and off for a few seconds at time. Doing this will create more suction and help loosen the buildup, particularly if it is a very compact clog.

, If the shop vac’s suction is strong enough, the clog may directly shoot through the pipe and into the vacuum bag.Otherwise, you may need to use your hands to pull out the clog once it has moved down the pipe into a reachable distance.

, Remove the nozzle of the shop vac and, using either a screwdriver or wrench, put the P-trap back into the piping. Again, make sure to tighten the screws or bolts well to avoid water leaking.

Use tape on NPT and NPTF threads only.",How to Use Teflon Tape," Wipe them with a cloth. Remove dirt, grime, or any other materials that may impede a tight connection. Clean both the male threads of one pipe and the female threads to the other., Most pipes’ threads run in a clockwise direction, but there are exceptions to this rule. Always check which way the grooves run before applying tape. If you can’t tell with a glance, fit the male end of one pipe into the female end of the other. Mark which way you need to turn the male end in order for it to screw into the female., Line up the edge of the tape with the outer edge of the threads perfectly. Make sure no amount of tape projects over the pipe’s edge. If it does, peel the tape off of the threads, trim the used strip from your roll, and try again. Cover the pipe’s edge with one layer of tape, following the direction that the threads run (clockwise or counterclockwise). Once you complete a full circuit, wrap a second layer of tape over the first.Stray bits of tape that stick over the pipe’s edge will end up in the pipeline when the two pipes are connected. They may then block the flow of water or gas, causing clogs and/or weak pressure.
Pull the tape taut as you unroll it to ensure a tight fit. The tape should be drawn in between the threads as you wrap them.

, Follow the direction of the threads as you go. Wind the tape over them so that half of it covers the preceding layer while the other half covers the bare threads. Pull the tape taut as you do so to make sure that both the grooves and ridges are equally covered. Once the threads are totally covered, cut the tape loose from your roll and pull the end tight over the last threads.If you tape the threads counter to their direction, the other pipe’s female threads may dig the tape out of the grooves when you screw the two ends together.

, Make sure that you have covered the entire length of the threads with consistently tight tape. Inspect their grooves and ridges to confirm that their shapes are perfectly visible and unblemished by loose tape. Unwrap the tape and start over with a new strip if the original tape appears loose at any point. Otherwise, screw the two pipes together., Expect the addition of pipe dope to create a more permanent seal. Only add it to your layer of Teflon tape if you are confident that you will never have to separate the pipes in the future. Use Teflon tape by itself in any areas where you are likely to replace and/or alter pipes and fixtures, such as in the shower, bathtub, or sink.Additionally, avoid using pipe dope for lines carrying drinking water. Use Teflon tape by itself to eliminate the risk of contamination by liquid sealants.

, Before using pipe dope, apply Teflon tape just as you would if tape was all that you were using to make your seal. First, wash both the male and female threads to remove dirt. Then tape the male threads, beginning with a double layer around its outer edge before moving inward, following the threads’ direction as you go. Inspect your work to make sure that the tape has conformed to the shape of the threads’ grooves and ridges perfectly. If necessary, remove the original tape and begin again with fresh tape., Many liquid thread sealants will include a brush in their cap, like a medicine bottle’s dropper. If yours doesn’t, dab a fine, thin brush with pipe dope. Apply a thin, even layer directly to the taped male threads. Then screw the two pipes together immediately, before the pipe dope has a chance to dry.Although this is a popular way of reinforcing pipe seals, there is some debate over whether or not the added pipe dope actually makes the tape’s seal any stronger., Shut off the water or gas before disconnecting any lines. Also shut off the electricity in the immediate area to prevent electrical shocks and fires. If you are working on a gas line, be sure to have a functional gas detector on hand and learn how to operate it before starting work. Improper gas seals may lead to poisoning, fire, or other hazards. If you have little to no experience in working with water or gas lines, hire a professional to avoid personal injury and property damage.Additionally, always test the lines after completing your project. Do so before you begin to put everything back in place so you still have quick and easy access to the pipes in the event of a leak., Always use yellow Teflon tape for gas-lines, since this yellow tape is specifically for that purpose. For waterlines, use pink tape for best results. White tape is also acceptable for water lines whose pipes have a ⅜” diameter or less, but favor pink over white in general, since pink tape is of a higher density. For oxygen lines, only use green tape.White tape is cheaper for a reason. Its low density often necessitates using more tape to achieve the same tight seal as a high-density product. It is also more prone to tearing, with stray bits ending up inside the pipe and potentially causing blockage.Pipe dope also comes in water- and gas-specific varieties., Check if the instructions recommend covering the threads with a specific number of layers. The number may vary according to the product’s materials and density. Do not exceed the recommended number, since this may cause a loose seal when the extra tape bunches up during screwing.Few if any tapes require more than three layers, since this is generally too thick for a proper seal., Keep in mind that Teflon tape is only meant to create a smoother surface for threads’ suffering from teeny tiny micro-abrasions. Do not connect pipes with missing or broken threads. Buy a new pipe instead, or have the original re-threaded.

, Expect pipes made of different metals to corrode over time if they are screwed together directly. Do not trust Teflon tape to act as an adequate barrier between the two materials. If you are connecting two different kinds of pipes, purchase a dielectric union to join them without bringing them into direct contact., Recognize a standard National Pipe Thread (NPT) or National Pipe Thread Fuel (NPTF) by their tapered threads. The tapering forces two pipes to pull together as you screw one’s male threads into the other’s female end. Use Teflon tape or other sealants on these to correct the micro-flaws caused by mass production. Do not use tape to seal the following types of threads:AN (Army/Navy)
BSPT (British Standard Taper Pipe Thread)
GHT (Garden Hose Thread)
NPSI (National Straight Intermediate Pipe)
NPSM (National Pipe Straight Mechanical)

Compensate for spring back when measuring.",How to Measure Bends when Bending Pipes," Depending on the length of the bends and the length of the spaces between them, determine the total length of pipe or tubing you require. Ensure that a couple of inches (or centimeters) of margin is available to accommodate any errors in calculation or judgment.;
, From one end of the tube, mark the point for the first bend. Here, you need to carefully mark the beginning and the end of the bend. You also need to measure the distance between the bends., Repeat the previous step, but use the vertex of the first bend as the reference/ starting point instead of the end of the tube or pipe. The vertex is the exact point where the two legs of an angle intersect.

Alternatively, you can use the initial reference point (the end of the tube) to measure the distance for all bends.

, Repeat the previous step for measuring more bends. Always mark the exact spots as you go along., Repeat step 2, but mark the direction of the bend. It is the same process except that the direction of the bend differs. You also need to deduct the gain., All tubes and pipes, irrespective of material, experience some amount of spring back. It is dependent on the material, the angle of the bend, and the radius of the bend. This can be compensated for by using two methods:

With experience and the right methods, you can estimate the amount of spring back and over bend the tube; or
You can wait for the spring back to occur, measure the angle and then bend the tube accordingly.

Prevent hard water stains.",How to Clean a Bubbler Pipe," Before you begin cleaning your smoking pipe, you’ll want to make sure it’s completely empty. Pour the used water down the sink and shake any remaining moisture out of the pipe. Remove the stem and set it aside for now—you’ll be cleaning this separately later.It’s a good idea to always refill your pipe with fresh water after every use.;
, Turn the pipe under the stream as you rinse and let the water run through the top and out the opening for the stem. This will help flush out loose particles and wash away residue that hasn’t yet had time to fully set up on the walls of the pipe.


Hot water will help further loosen gunk and grime.
Glass pipes will be slippery when wet, so be careful not to drop them.

, Pour the alcohol in slowly through the top of the pipe. A good rule of thumb is to fill the pipe to roughly the same level as the water line. Add a couple spoonfuls of a coarse-grained salt like Epsom, kosher or raw sea salt. Aim for about a 2:1 ratio of alcohol to salt.Isopropyl alcohols with a higher purity (between 91-99% is ideal) will work best for cleaning and sanitizing.
Salt that comes in large, coarse pieces won’t dissolve as quickly when immersed in liquid, making it more effective as an abrasive.

, Place your thumbs over the openings of the pipe while you shake. As the solution sloshes through the pipe, the alcohol will kill any bacteria present and sterilize the walls of the inner chamber while the salt flakes scour stains and residue from the glass.You can also use another type of object, such as a cotton ball or cork, as a stopper for the openings.For especially dirty pipes, leave the solution to soak for about half an hour before you begin shaking.

, Shaking the alcohol-salt solution through the pipe should take care of the worst of the buildup and discoloration. If any problem areas remain, you can deal with them directly by inserting a Q-tip through the one of the openings and scrubbing them by hand. By the time you’re finished, your pipe will be spotless.Depending on the size and shape of your pipe, you might also be able to use a pipe cleaner or toothbrush to spot-clean.
Pipe cleaners are especially useful because they can bend around tricky corners and contours.

, Clear away all the dirt and grime dissolved by the alcohol-salt solution. Don’t forget to wipe off the outside of the pipe as well to remove dust and fingerprint smudges. Blot the pipe gently with a microfiber towel, or leave it to air dry for a few hours before refilling it.If your pipe still isn’t clear after the first cleaning and rinsing, repeat the process using fresh solution.

, After you’ve finished cleaning the body of the pipe, grab the stem and run some hot water over it. If need be, give the stem a preliminary scrubbing using a clean paper towel. Pay particular attention to the bowl, where the residue will be thickest and most stubborn.


Since the stem is so small and narrow, it’s easiest to clean it separately. Fortunately, this is even quicker than cleaning the pipe itself.
Scrape the inside of the bowl with a toothpick or paperclip to chip away at thick residue that’s cemented in place.

, Position the stem in the bottom of the bag, leaving the top open wide. The stem won’t hold water the way the pipe does, so it will need to be cleaned in a separate container.You could also use a lidded Tupperware container to hold the stem. Just make sure the material is not hard enough to break any delicate glass pieces.
If the stem you’re using is comprised of multiple parts, disassemble it and clean each component separately to avoid damaging them.

, Again, use about one part salt to two parts alcohol. When you hold up the bag, the stem should be completely submerged in the solution. Carefully squeeze excess air out of the bag and close the top. Double check that the bag is securely shut before you proceed.There should be enough space in the bag for the alcohol-salt solution to move around freely.If any part of the top of the bag remains open, you’ll end up with a big mess on your hands.

, Grip the bag by the top and bottom and shake it from side to side. As you shake, massage the stem lightly with the tips of your fingers. This will create more friction to rub off persistent residue.For bowls that are severely stained or have a lot of buildup, let the stem soak for 15-30 minutes.Be careful not to handle the bag too forcefully, or it might leak or burst open.

, Open the bag and pour out the dirty alcohol-salt solution. Retrieve the stem and wash it under hot water once more. Place the stem alongside the pipe to air dry.


Allow the pipe and stem to dry completely before using them. Lingering moisture can lead to mold growth and unpleasant odors, which can have an affect on the quality and flavor of the smoke., Use a light touch when holding or moving your bubbler to avoid an accident. This is especially important for pipes made from materials like glass and ceramic, which have a tendency to scratch and may shatter completely if dropped or mishandled. Repairing or replacing a pipe can be expensive, so the best way to deal with accidents is by preventing them altogether.Set your pipe on a small pad or coaster when it's not in use so that it doesn't come into contact with hard surfaces.
Store your pipe somewhere where it won't be in danger of falling or getting stepped or sat on.
Consider investing in a protective sheath or hard-shelled storage case if you smoke frequently or plan on doing any traveling with a breakable pipe.

, The inside of your pipe is warm and moist, making it an ideal breeding ground for bacteria. Clean and disinfect your pipe regularly to fight off mold growth. Otherwise, you could be looking at slimy, discolored residue, foul odors and a generally unpleasant smoking experience.Refilling your pipe with fresh water every time you use it will help create a less hospitable environment for bacteria and mold.
There's no good way to remove stuck-on mold other than by scrubbing it, which can be tricky if you have a small or oddly-shaped pipe.

, Over time, ordinary tap water can leave unsightly mineral deposits on the walls of your pipe. These deposits may also contain traces of chemicals like chlorine and fluoride, which you definitely don't want anywhere near your lungs. By using filtered or distilled water, you can eliminate harmful contaminates from your pipe while also enjoying a purer, smoother smoke.For best results, you should also rinse your pipe with purified water after cleaning.
Keep a pitcher of filtered water on hand so that you'll always have a ready supply when it comes time to refill your pipe.

Use a manual pipe bender or a hydraulic bender if you have one.,
Fill the pipe with sand or other material, and secure three layers of window screening, with double hose clamps on the ends.

,
Bend the pipe slowly so that you can watch to make sure it bends evenly and doesn't collapse or deform, and watch for cracks that may occur if the pipe is bent too sharply.

,
Use whatever means you have to bend the pipe.,
Consider building dies to bend your pipe if you have the equipment, you can machine your own bending dies for bending the pipe, or you can rent a manual or hydraulic bender for this purpose.

",How to Bend Aluminum Pipe," You can bend 1 1/4"" aluminum conduit by hand, but a manual pipe bender will make it easier. It doesn't matter what you use to bend the pipe, the main thing is how you keep it from collapsing.;
,,, The pipe will not collapse, but remember that there is a radius to wall thickness / diameter formula that must be observed. A loose rule of thumb is a maximum 3 1/2"" radius to 1"" diameter ratio.

Clamp the pipe into place with a vise.,
Mark your PVC where the cut is required.,
Seat the teeth into the pipe.,
Saw through the pipe firmly.",How to Cut PVC Pipe1," The most basic and most widely used tool in cutting pipe, PVC or otherwise, would be the hacksaw. It's still important to secure the PVC in place using a vise, to avoid letting it slip around and risk cutting yourself with a glancing swipe of the blade. Be extremely careful and take the necessary precautions in clamping the pipe into the place.


You could also use another type of work clamp to just secure the pipe into place on your workbench, rather than using a vise. Use what's available.
Clamp it a few inches away from the cut to give yourself ample clearance. If possible, you can clamp on both sides of your cut, but having one clamp a few inches from intended cut line will make it plenty secure.;
, Use a permanent marker to clearly indicate where on the pipe you're going to cut. Don't worry about whether or not the ink will stay on, you can wipe it off later with some rubbing alcohol if you're feeling cosmetic.








, Place the hacksaw onto the mark and hold the handle firmly, then use your other hand to push down on the top of the saw, seating the teeth into the pipe. You want to start in the right place, and doing this will help to ensure that you don't start off with some raggedy swipes of the saw.








, Start sawing, keeping sure to watch closely as you cut and don’t let the saw drift from the mark that you made originally. Saw fast enough to keep the cut going, but not so fast the teeth jump over the cut your'e making. You should be able to cut through PVC relatively quickly.

"
Get a plastic pipe cutter.,
Place the pipe into the half-moon shaped lower part of the cutter.,
Ratchet the blade down onto the pipe.",How to Cut PVC Pipe2," There are two kinds of PVC pipe cutters: scissor style and ratcheting style. Scissor style pipe cutters are ideal for 1/2” to 1” PVC pipe, but are sometimes too difficult to use even for pipe that big. It's recommended instead that you use a ratcheting plastic pipe cutter, ideal for larger sized pipes and also effective for smaller. It's much safer and more reliable.


The arm strength necessary to use scissor-style cutters is sometimes a little extreme, and it would be easier to just use a saw of some kind. Investing in a ratchet style cutter will make your job a whole lot easier.

, Pipe-cutters have an open rounded edge to seat the pipe into, and a blade that will extend as you squeeze the trigger on the handle. Mark where you want the cut to be made, then seat the pipe in the mouth of the cutter to start cutting.








, Squeeze the hand-grip trigger on the handle of the pipe cutter to extend the blade and cut the pipe in half. Use your other hand to hold the pipe steady as it's cut. You shouldn't have to work very hard.








"
"
Consider using a miter box and saw for more specific cuts.,
Place the PVC pipe under the blade where you need your cut.,
Secure the pipe with a work clamp.",How to Cut PVC Pipe3," A miter saw can be used for PVC projects that require many specific, detailed cuts. Use a tooth-count saw appropriate to the cutting job and the saws available. When in doubt, go with something like a standard 10 Tooth per-inch (TPI) wood blade, which comes with most miter saws. It'll depend on the particular brand and style of saw that you've got, though.








, Miter boxes are the easiest things in the world to use, since you've got the cut-lines pre marked alongside the box for you. You won't be able to miss.








, Start the blade and bring it down at a fairly slow to medium speed. Once cut, the process can be repeated with ease, making additional cuts in the pipe as necessary.

Purchase a tube bender.,
Follow the instructions.,
Select the appropriate-size die for the tubing you need to bend.,
Place the tubing into the bender.,
Measure the correct angle.,
Bend the tube to your desired angle.,
Practice with scrap tubing.",How to Bend Steel Tubing1," Your local hardware store will have a variety of tube benders available at different price points. The major differences may include the amount of hydraulic force the bender can apply to the tube as well as the size and durability of the accompanying die set.


The dies are curved pieces you attach to the bender and into which you place the tubing to form the bend. The different dies will correspond to different diameters of tubing. Additionally, you can find die sets for either round or square tubing.
Ensure that you buy a tube bender and not a pipe bender. Tube and pipe are not synonymous, and the scaling is even different, so the dies in a pipe bending set will not properly fit tube. This usually leads to flattening, buckling, or kinks in tube bent with a pipe bender.;
, As always, specific machinery may have specific steps due to design or other requirements. Thoroughly consult the directions that come with your equipment.

, For instance, if you need to bend 1” tubing, then you would select the 1” die.Using the correct die is very important. If the tubing doesn’t fit snugly into the die, then you can end up with a flattened or kinked finished product.

, Once you attach the die, you will feed the tube into the bender so that the spot where you want to bend is in the center of the die. You will then tighten down the bender, which will have a pneumatic jack, enough to keep the tubing in place.

, You cannot set the bender to a specific degree angle for you and let it do the rest, so this means measuring the exact angle to which you need your tube bent.The easiest solution is to use a digital angle gauge, which you can attach to the level tube before you begin bending. As you incrementally bend the tube, the angle gauge will track the measurement of the angle.

, As you increase the force in the bender, the tube will bend to sharper angles. Once your angle gauge has measured the angle you want, you can release the pressure on the tube and remove it from the machine., Since using too much force can still lead to kinks in a bent tube, practice on scrap tubing before placing a more expensive piece into the bender.


Packing the tube with sand before placing it in the bender can also help it bend evenly without buckling or kinking."

Leave a trickle of water running.",How to Unfreeze Water Pipes," Turn on all faucets to see which ones are working. If water is running through one faucet but not another, the problem is located along the pipes running between the two. Leave all faucets open slightly. A small trickle of running water from working faucets can prevent further freezing and help melt the ice. Leave blocked faucets open as well to reduce pressure on the pipes.


Most American houses have faucets on external walls too, especially on the front and back of the house.;
, If a large area of your house has no water, look in the most likely and accessible areas first before you start tearing apart walls. Use the steps below to focus on these areas, unless you managed to narrow down the search to a smaller portion of your house:


Pipes in or near uninsulated crawlspaces, attics, or basements.
Pipes near cold air vents or cold concrete.
Outdoor valves and spigots.
Outdoor pipes can freeze, but check these last, as most systems are designed to keep standing water out of these pipes.

, Examine the pipes in the affected area carefully. Freezing water can cause pipes to crack from the change in pressure, usually splitting the pipe lengthwise or causing cracks in the joints.


To look at the backs of pipes near walls, and in other difficult to reach areas, use a flashlight and a large dental mirror from a hardware store.
If you find a leak, close the main shut-off valve immediately. Call a plumber to replace the pipe, or fix it yourself if you are up to the task.

, Assuming there are no leaks or cracks, find the section of the pipe with frozen water using one of the following methods.


Feel the temperature of the pipe with your hand, or use an infrared thermometer to locate areas significantly colder than other pipes.
Tap the pipe with a screwdriver handle or other object, listening for a more solid, less ""hollow"" sound.
If you rule out all exposed pipes in the affected area, skip to the section on unfreezing pipes inside walls.

, Open the faucet attached to the frozen pipe, and open nearby working faucets to a trickle. Running water is much less likely to freeze than standing water. If the running water passes through or near a frozen area, it may even help thaw the ice over the course of an hour or two.


If you see any cracks in any pipe, turn off the main water supply to your house immediately, and close all faucets.

, Turn on a hair dryer and run it back and forth along the frozen pipe. Keep it moving and do not place the dryer directly against the pipe, as uneven or sudden heating can rupture the pipe. If your pipes are metal, you can use a more powerful heat gun in the same fashion.


PVC pipes can be damaged at temperatures as low as 140ºF (60ºC). Never use a heat gun or other direct heat stronger than a hair dryer.
Outdoor valves often have fiber washers or other non-heat-safe materials inside them. Heat them slowly and cautiously.

, Purchase electrical heat tape from a hardware store. Wrap the tape in a single layer around the length of the frozen pipe, then plug it into a power source. The tape consists of heating elements that warm up when turned on.


Do not overlap electrical heat tape. Wrap it around the pipe only once or in a spiral pattern.

, Position space heaters, bare incandescent light bulbs, or heat lamps in the room with the frozen pipe, near the pipe but not touching it. Hang up tarps or blankets to trap the heat in a smaller area, but don't let them come into direct contact with the heat source. For large rooms, use several heat sources to ensure safe, even heating of the pipe.

, Salt lowers the melting point of ice, causing it to melt at colder temperatures. Pour a tablespoon (15 mL) of salt down the drain, and give it time to act on the ice.


You can try dissolving the salt in 1/2 cup (120 mL) boiling water first, but this risks bursting the pipe with a sudden temperature change., Put on rubber gloves, and soak towels in hot water. Ring them out, then wrap them securely around the frozen section of pipe. Replace with freshly soaked, hot towels every 5–10 minutes until the pipe thaws.


Do not leave cold wet towels around the pipes.

, If you can find an external vent, put down a fan heater blowing warm air into the vent. Use a cardboard box or tarp to minimize the amount of heat lost to the surrounding air.

, Crank the heat in the house to around 75 to 80ºF (24–27ºC) and wait two to three hours.


Open closet and cabinet doors so the warm air circulates as close to the walls as possible.

, Unfortunately, this is often necessary to reach a frozen pipe before it bursts. Follow the instructions in the locating pipes section to isolate the most likely area of the problem. Use a keyhole saw to cut a hole into this area, then use any of the methods in the section on unfreezing pipes.


If this is a recurring problem, consider installing a cabinet door over the hole instead of fully repairing the wall, for ease of access next time this occurs.

, Keep pipes in cold areas wrapped with ""pipe sponge"" covers, rags, or other insulating material. If an electrical outlet is nearby, you can keep them wrapped with electrical heat tape, unplugged, then plug the tape in whenever cold weather arrives.

, Check your crawlspaces and external walls for holes, and repair them to minimize exposure to cold air. Use wind barriers or faucet covers to protect faucets and valves on the exterior of the house.

, During cold weather, turn on a 60 watt incandescent light bulb near the area of pipe that previously froze, or just below it. If used to warm crawl spaces and other unsupervised areas, make sure there are no flammable materials kept in the same space.

, It is much more difficult for pipes to freeze if water is running through them, since the water will usually travel through the pipe before it has time to freeze. During sub-freezing weather, keep faucets slightly open to allow a trickle of water.


You can adjust the ballast in your toilet tank to keep it running even when the tank is full.

Purchase a blowtorch.,
Place your tubing in a vice.,
Heat the tube where you need to bend.,
Bend the tube slowly and firmly.,
Bend to your desired angle.",How to Bend Steel Tubing2," If you do not already own one, you will likely need an acetylene torch for this method as it requires the application of constant, high heat., Crank down the vice so that the tube cannot move; however, do not apply so much pressure that you crush the tube.


Some vices have specific slots for rounded pipe or tube. This is preferable but not necessary.

, With the acetylene torch, you will need to apply constant, even heat to the area around where you need to bend. Make sure that apply the heat to the entire cylinder (or square) of the tube and not just the side where you need to bend it.The additional malleability will help the tube bend evenly instead of just buckling in one spot.

, Do not yank at the tubing. Instead apply a slow, firm force that increases gradually.You can apply the force with a wrench, a larger piece of tube over one end used as a pry bar, or by hand. However, the tube will be extremely hot, so use thick gloves rated for heat.
This step may require assistance so that one person can apply force to the tube while the other continues heating.
Packing the tubing with a non-combustible material such as sand before applying heat will help the tube bend without buckling or kinking.

, One of the easier ways of measuring your bend with this method is to make a template of the bend and cut it from another material, such as a scrap piece of plywood. As the angle increases, remove heat long enough to hold the template against the bend and increase incrementally and accordingly."

Manually roll the piece through the roller.,
Increase the force on the tube.,
Roll the tube back in the opposite direction.,
Repeat until you reach the desired angle.",How to Bend Steel Tubing3," If you need an even arc over several heat of tubing as opposed to one bend, then a tube roller is going to produce much better results. You can find a tube roller at most hardware stores, and they’re actually going to be cheaper than pneumatic bending devices.


As with tube benders, your tube roller may come with a set of dies, so you can fit the exact size of tube you need to roll without the risk of flattening it.

, A tube roller works by placing increased force on a piece of tubing, then rolling it back and forth over the force to create an even bend. Begin by placing the tube into the roller with the appropriately sized die holding it in place.With a tube roller, you will start at one end rather than in the middle.

, Most tube rollers will have a hex head bit, so you can use a regular wrench to increase the force in the vice., For basic tube roller models, the device will simply have a large wheel attached that your turn to feed the tube through and under the applied force.Turning the wheel will require a bit of strength, especially as you increase the force on the tube in later passes.

, Once you have passed the tube from one end to the other down the roller, you should increase the force in the vice by tightening the rod by approximately another quarter of a turn., The wheel on the roller allows you to turn either direction, so with more pressure on the tube, you’ll roller it back through in the opposite direction., Continue tightening the roller by a quarter turn after each pass through the device and rolling it again. After several passes, you’ll notice the nice, even arc forming on the tube. Continue rolling until you have the angle you need.


If you have a template for the exact angle you need, you can hold it again the angle in the tube after each pass until you’ve achieved your desired result."

Carefully pour the hot sand back into the PVC pipe.,
Slowly bend the pipe into your desired shape.,
Empty the sand out and let the pipe cool.",How to Bend PVC Pipe1," Under too much heat and stress, the PVC may crack or warp without a medium inside to help it hold its shape. The best candidate — sand. Get enough sand to fill up the pipe a few inches past the planned bend.


You may need to use some tape to block one end of the pipe and keep the sand in.






Try not to bend the pipe any closer than 3–5"" away from a joint.;
, You don't need to wait for it to pre-heat completely, but turn it on now to get some heat built up.

, Block off one end of the pipe and measure out how much sand you'll need to fill the pipe with sand. You don't have to fill the entire pipe, just fill it until the sand is a few inches past where you plan to bend the PVC.

,


Let the sand heat up with the oven. After the oven has hit 425 °F (281.3 °C), leave the sand in an extra five to six minutes to get up to the right temperature.






If you have a lot of sand, more than two to three cups, stir it halfway through so that the sand heats up evenly., Make sure you wear protective gloves or oven mitts. Let the sand heat the pipe up for a few minutes, until the PVC feels pliable.

, Once the pipe is soft, it should easily bend by hand. For a rounder, more even bend, use an old can or similar round, heatproof object and bend the pipe around that.

, Leave the pipe undisturbed and let it cool back to room temperature. Do not try and bend the pipe again once you've removed the sand. You can also save the sand to use later, reheating it as many times as you want to bend new pipes."

Shut off the water.,
Plug the sink drain.,
Consider buying a repair kit.,
Move on to the instructions that match your faucet.",How to Repair a Washerless Faucet1," Look under your sink for a water shutoff valve. Turn it to the closed position, and test the faucet to make sure the water is not flowing.


If you are repairing a bath faucet, shut off the house water supply at the main valve. You may also need to remove the spout or handles to reveal the faucet mechanism,.;
, Stuff a rag or other object into the drain to prevent small parts from falling into the pipes.

, Most washerless faucet leaks require a replacement part to fix. If you know your faucet manufacturer, you can order a repair kit that contains all the parts you need. Otherwise, you will need to disassemble your faucet and take the faulty part to a hardware or plumbing store to identify and order.

, There are several types of washerless faucet. The faucet will be easier to identify once you've removed the handle.



Ball faucets have a single handle that rotates over a ball.
One handled faucets on a cylinder may be cartridge or ceramic disk faucets. The cartridge is more likely as it needs repairs more often, so start with those instructions. If they don't match what you see, try the ceramic disk instructions.
Two handled washerless faucets are cartridge faucets.

Remove the handle.,
Repair a leaking handle.,
Consider a full replacement.,
Disassemble the faucet.,
Inspect the ball for wear.,
Carefully remove the valve seats and springs.,
Inspect the O-rings.,
Reassemble the faucet.,
Make final corrections.",How to Repair a Washerless Faucet2," Unscrew the handle and set it aside. You should see a metal cap with a small threaded washer (the adjusting ring) set into it.

, If the water leaks from the handle, you can usually fix the problem quickly:Place a kitchen knife or putty knife into the slots on top of the washer. (If necessary, you can buy a repair kit with a special tool for this purpose.)
Turn the ring a short distance clockwise.
Replace the handle and turn on the water. If the handle still drips, turn off water and tighten further.
Tighten in small movements only. Overtightening can make the handle difficult to turn.

, If the leak comes from the spout, or if adjusting the washer didn't fix the problem, consider buying a new faucet. Ball faucets are difficult to repair and do not have a long lifespan compared to other options.Removing the whole thing and installing a new one is much easier. If you do decide to repair it yourself, continue on to the next step.

, Leaks coming from the spout happen due to corroded or broken parts further down in the faucet. Carefully remove each of the following, noting (or photographing) how the parts fit together:Remove the top metal cap and collar with slip-joint pliers, then lift out the spout.
Lift out the plastic cam and cam washer. If you cannot remove this with pliers, your faucet may require a special tool from a repair kit.Remove the ball.

, If the ball looks pitted or corroded, it needs replacement. You must find a part exactly the same size, but it does not need to be the same material. Plastic balls are cheaper, while brass balls last longer.If the ball looks fine apart from slight mineral buildup, dissolve the mineral with a few drops of distilled white vinegar and scrub with a plastic scouring pad.Even if the ball is corroded, inspect the other parts as described below. More than one part may need replacement.

, The ball sits on top of valves that control the water flow. Carefully remove the two valve seats with needle-nose pliers or a pencil. A spring should pop out as you remove each one.If a valve seat or spring shows signs of wear, you will need to replace that part.

, The final parts that tend to wear down are the O-rings at the base of the faucet body. If these are corroded, cut them off and replace them with new O-rings. Coat the new O-rings in nontoxic, heat-proof plumber's grease before sliding them on., Once all parts are cleaned or replaced, reassemble the parts in the reverse order you removed them. Pay special attention at these points:Line up the slot or mark on the ball with the notch on the faucet body.
Line up the lug on the cam with the same notch.
To reinstall the spout, twist while pushing down hard.

, If the spout still leaks, make sure each part is tight. If the handle leaks, tighten the adjustment ring at the top of the mechanism, as described at the start of this section.

Replace damaged O-rings.,
Reassemble the faucet.",How to Repair a Washerless Faucet3," Pry off the top cap with a screwdriver; the screw will usually be underneath this cap. Unscrew the handle, then pull it back and upward to remove it. Pull away the spout as well.


You may need to lever out the handle with a screwdriver. Take care not to apply too much force, or the handle will break.

, The cartridge inside is a cylinder tapering to a thin stem pointed upward. Depending on your model, you may need to remove one or more of the following before you can get to it:A retaining nut above the cartridge, removable with slip joint pliers.
A horizontal metal clip holding the cartridge down. This may be removable by hand or small pliers.
A tiny plastic retaining clip at the base or side of the cartridge. Use needlenose pliers to pull this out carefully. Note its position so you can reinstall it later.

, Look for identifying features on the cartridge, such as a tab or notch. Make a note of their position compared to the notches on the faucet body underneath it. If you later reinstall the cartridge in a 180º position, you could switch the hot and cold taps., Grip the stem of the cartridge with a pair of pliers. Attempt to twist and lift without using excessive force. Some cartridges require a special tool to remove, ordered from a plumbing parts store.

, There are usually several O-rings along the body of the cartridge, plus a couple more on the faucet body. If any of these show signs of wear, replace them:


Cut away the old O-rings.
Apply nontoxic, heatproof plumber's grease to the new O-rings.
Slide the O-rings over the cartridge or faucet body to the same position.

, Line up the cartridge in the position you noted and push it down to fit into the faucet body. Reassemble the other parts on top of the cartridge.

Consider replacing the ceramic disk assembly.,
Clean the cylinder openings if necessary.,
Reassemble.,
Restore water carefully.",How to Repair a Washerless Faucet4," You may need to tilt the handle back or remove a decorative cap to reveal the screw. Unscrew the handle, remove it, then remove the escutcheon cap underneath.


Some faucets have a locking nut you'll have to remove as well.

, You should see a cylinder with a protruding stem. Loosen the two screws fastening this in place, and lift the whole assembly out. Note the position of the cylinder, as the base has inlet holes which must match the holes underneath it.


If the cylinder does not lift easily, try cleaning its edges with a few drops of distilled white vinegar. If that still doesn't work, you can get a special extraction tool for this purpose from a plumbing store., Two-handled ceramic disk faucets usually have a simple O-ring around the cylinder, plus a seal and spring underneath. One-handled ceramic disk faucets usually have three seals underneath the cylinder.Corroded O-rings can be replaced with a new O-ring after greasing it with nontoxic, heatproof plumber's grease. The seals can be more of a pain to work with, but you can install them in much the same way if they are damaged.


Take the old seals to a hardware store to ask for replacement.s

, The cylinder and the disk inside it are sturdy and rarely need replacement. However, replacements are usually cheap, and just need to be screwed in.If you can't find the source of the problem, or just don't want to deal with the tiny seals, order a replacement with the exact same dimensions and shape.

, If there is mineral buildup on the cylinder, clean the openings with distilled white vinegar and a plastic scouring pad.Rinse thoroughly.

, Insert each component in the reverse order you disassembled them. Make sure all connections are tight.

, A rapid increase in water pressure could fracture the disk inside the cylinder. Move the faucet to the ""on"" position, then turn on the water valve gradually."

Basin wrench
Bucket
Towel
Flashlight
Measuring tape
Plumber’s tape
Sponge or scrubber
Bathroom cleaner or soap
Rag or cloth
New faucet (purchased after you remove the original);
, Remove everything from underneath the sink. Place a towel below the pipes to protect the vanity from water damage. Place a bucket over the towel and under the faucet to catch any water that drips down.


You can also lay a garbage bag down under the towel for even more protection, or in place of the bucket.

, Locate the water shutoff valve for the bathroom sink. It should be under the sink, inside the vanity. Turn the valve to the right (clockwise) to close the valve and shut off the water to the faucet.Depending on your plumbing, you may have a single water valve for the entire faucet, or you may have two separate valves for the hot and cold water.
If you have trouble locating the shutoff valve, you can turn off the water supply to the entire line running to the bathroom sink.

, To remove excess water from the faucet and to relieve pressure before you start working, drain the pipes after you shut off the water. Turn on all the faucets at the sink and keep them running until all the water has drained out.This will protect your sink, vanity, and floors from leaks and water damage, and prevent water from spraying everywhere when you remove the faucet.

, These are the tubes that connect the faucet to the water supply. Use the adjustable wrench to loosen the nuts where the hoses attach to the water supply. Use the basin wrench to loosen the nut attaching the hoses to the faucet. Turn the nuts to the left (counterclockwise) to loosen them.Once you’ve loosened the nuts with the wrenches, you can remove them the rest of the way by hand.

, Most faucets are attached to the sink by locknuts attached to the tailpieces under the sink.Use your hands or an adjustable wrench to loosen the nuts and unthread them from the tailpieces. Turn them to the left (counterclockwise) to loosen them. Remove the nuts and the washers from the tailpieces.


Once you’ve removed the supply lines, nuts, and washers, the faucet will be loose. Hold the faucet in both hands and pull it straight out from the mounting holes. Remove the gasket if there is one and set it aside with the faucet.
Use the flashlight to locate the nuts under the sink if you're having trouble locating them.

, With a sponge or gentle abrasive pad, scrub the mounting holes around the sink where the faucet sits. Use soap and water or your favorite cleaner or detergent. Once the area is clean, rinse it well, pat it dry, and let it air dry completely.


To remove old sealant or silicone, dampen a sponge or rag with mineral spirits and wipe the area clean. Then rinse the area with clean water and pat it dry., Once you’ve removed the old faucet from the mounting holes, you can figure out what hole configuration you're working with and the type of faucet you need. There are three major types of faucets:Single hole, where the sink will only have one hole for the faucet, and the faucet will all be one simple piece with a single handle.
Center-set, where there will be three holes in the sink and the one-piece faucet will have separate handles controlling the hot and cold water.
Widespread or split-set, which work with three-hole basins, but the spout and two handles come in three separate pieces.

, Before you go to the home or hardware store for a new faucet, determine the type of faucet you have, look at your basin hole configuration, and measure the distance between the holes so that you get the right replacement faucet. Write down the number of holes your basin has, the type of faucet that was on there, and the distance between the holes.If you want to replace your old faucet with a new kind, you'll have to replace the basin as well.

, The gasket is a rubber or plastic piece that sits between the faucet and the sink to ensure a proper seal and prevent leaks. Fit the gasket over the bottom of the faucet, matching the holes in the gasket with the tailpipes and valves on the faucet.


If your faucet didn’t come with a gasket, you'll need to apply sealant or plumber’s putty before installing the faucet. Follow the manufacturer’s directions and lay down a thin layer of sealant or putty right before you put in the faucet., Plumber’s tape is designed to lubricate fittings and create a better seal between components. Wrap the end of the faucet tailpipes with a layer of plumber’s tape, making sure the tape doesn’t extend beyond the end of the pipe.The tailpipes are where the water supply hose will attach to the faucet, and the tape will prevent leaks.

, Hold the faucet in both hands and carefully set it into the mounting holes. Match the tailpipes and valves with the proper holes, and place the faucet into position.


Once the faucet is in the mounting holes, insert a washer over each tailpipe, and then twist on the nuts by hand. To tighten the nuts, turn them to the right (clockwise).
When you’ve tightened the nuts by hand, finish tightening them by turning them another quarter turn with the adjustable wrench if necessary.Avoid tightening the nuts any further, or you could damage the sink.

, Start by attaching the hoses to the faucet first. Attach each hose to the tailpipe of the faucet, and then tighten the nut by hand. To finish tightening the nuts, use the basin wrench to turn each nut a quarter turn to the right (clockwise).


Once the hoses are attached to the new faucet, reattach them to the water supply. Turn the nuts by hand to the right (clockwise), then tighten them the rest of the way with the adjustable wrench., When everything is connected and tightened, turn the water back on by turning the shutoff valve to the left (counterclockwise). Then turn on the taps to flush out the new faucet. When the water is running, check for leaks and drips.


To flush the faucet, simply let the hot and cold water run for one to two minutes."

The cutoff valves (there should be 2) should be located beneath the sink. Very rarely they will be located somewhere else, such as in a basement or utility shed.
Usually, turning the valves clockwise shuts them off. You can leave the tap running slightly while you turn the valves if you want to know for sure.
Be very gentle, especially if it's been a long time since the valves have been moved.;
,


This will relieve pressure in the water lines and let you check to be sure that the pipes are turned off.
If the faucet has 2 controls, make sure they are both empty before continuing. This means turning both handles or, if you have an omni-directional handle, turning it to both far sides to fully empty the supply line.

,


Unscrew the nuts that hold the faucet to the sink. These are typically located underneath the sink, directly below where the faucet connects to the sink. These nuts are sometimes recognizable because they do not look quite like normal nuts if the sink is fairly modern (looking instead more like a target or clock).If the nuts are on top of the sink, remove the handles and deck plates. This will allow you to access the nuts.

,


You want to be sure that the new fixture is going down on a clean surface.
Remove any grime and putty, as necessary.
A putty knife is the best tool for this task.
Be extra sure to remove mold and rust, to keep these from creating problems with the new fixture.

,


If your faucet came with a rubber or plastic gasket instead of a putty plate, set it onto the appropriate hole(s) on your sink.
If your faucet did not come with a putty plate or a gasket, place plumber's putty on the underside of the rim of the deck plate.
Put this string of plumber's putty into the groove of the deck plate and lightly press it into place.

,


Make sure that all of the holes are accounted for.
If you are changing the method with which the faucet mounts, you may need to drill a new hole for the mounting hardware (moving from one mounting point to two, for example).
Follow the manufacturer's instructions to prepare your deck plate and faucet to be put in place. This usually means mounting two bolts onto the deck plate.
Sometimes the faucet may need to be added after the deck plate, sometimes it may be necessary to do them both at the same time.

,


Usually this means fastening with a nut and washer at each of the bolts holding the deck plate, as well as a nut and washer holding the faucet itself at the center.
Be sure to follow the faucet manufacturer's instructions.
Use your hands to tighten the nuts.
Verify that the deck plate and faucet are in the appropriate place.
Use a wrench to tighten the nuts the rest of the way. Be careful not to over-tighten them.

,


Remove excess plumber's putty from the surface of the sink and faucet base.
Use a putty knife or a utility knife.
You may want to further seal this area with caulk or a similar sealant later, if the connection isn't strong enough.

,


Use your hands to tighten the supply lines to the faucet's water connections.
Tighten the connections further with a wrench.
If the water supply lines appear old or cracked, replace them as well.

,


Make sure the faucet is in the off position.
Check for leaks in the supply lines and faucet.
Check for leaks again with the faucet on.
If a leak is found, evaluate each step you completed to make sure it was done properly. Some connections might work better with or require plumbers tape.
If there are still leaks, contact the manufacturer of the faucet or a professional plumber for further guidance.
If no leaks are found, you are finished.

Have a small bucket to catch residue water and a plastic drop sheet to keep the bottom of the cabinet dry in case of a leak or spill. Choose a faucet from the hardware store, and follow the manufacturer's instructions. A basin wrench is useful for this, but standard wrenches or pliers will work just fine. You will also need clear silicon caulk or plumber's putty and some plumber's tape.;
, The shut off valves are located below the sink. They are usually oval-shaped and found somewhere below the supply line for the tap. Turn them (very gently) clockwise to shut off the water. If a valve seems excessively tight, it may need to be replaced.


Check the condition of the supply lines for leaks or obvious wear. You may want to replace these at the same time you replace the faucet.
Most new faucets come fully assembled, some even with inlet hoses attached. Check with the clerk at the hardware store to be sure.

, Disconnect the supply lines using a standard wrench. There should be two: one for the hot water and one for the cold.

, Next, remove the mounting nuts from the bottom of the old faucet. These are usually under the sink and directly below where the faucet meets the counter. There should be between 1-3 nuts and they will usually look less like a traditional nut and more like a target or clock.


A basin wrench will make this job much easier.

, Remove any old caulk or putty around the holes in the sink. This is most easily done with a putty knife. Clean the area thoroughly and wipe dry.

, Wrap thread seal tape around the threads of the faucet where they connect to the lines. Apply silicone sealant around the sink holes and where the new deck plate will be.

, Press the faucet down through the sink holes. Align the faucet, using the wall or the back of the sink to keep the faucet straight.


Once this is done, wipe away any excess residue silicone. Ensure the inside of basin cabinet is dry.

, Hand-tighten the mounting nuts with the thicker side up. Use pliers if necessary to stop leaks, but do not over-tighten.


It may be handy to follow the specific instructions from the manufacturer for your new faucet, as where and how many of these nuts need to be placed will vary between faucet styles.

, Plumber's tape can also be handy here. Look for a label on the lines attached to the faucet, since you want to connect the correct temperatures (hot handle to hot water, etc).

, Turn the water on slowly and check for leaks. If you see any water dripping, turn off the valves and tighten slightly. Repeat if necessary. When everything works the way it should, you're done!

, This disc should lift off with a black rubber gasket. This gasket is what keeps the faucet from leaking around the top chrome-dome when the water is turned on.

, Please note the orientation of the ball, cut into one side of the ball is a slot that rides on a stud inside the socket.

, These are the washers that keep the water from leaking when the faucet is off. These can be removed by gently prying them out with a small, flat-tipped screwdriver. Also, be sure to remove the spring.

, The large end of springs go in first and the seats (the rubber things) slip down over the spring. You should press firmly to seat the washer almost flush with the bottom of the socket. Wipe a small amount of silicon grease onto the rubber washer. This will help keep things lubricated through the life of the washer.

,,, These should be removed and replaced with the corresponding washers from the parts kit. Again, apply a small amount of silicon grease to keep things rotating smoothly.

, Be sure to keep the cylinder upright at the beginning, this makes it easier to get it started.

, You shouldn't have to force the ball into the socket.

, Keep in mind that the disc is keyed with a slot on the left side of the upright cylinder.

, This will make it moderately easier to re-install the chrome-dome.

, This should prove to be the most difficult part of the procedure. Remember that all of the washers, gaskets and springs are new and there is a lot less leeway in the fit of things. You may have to press down on the plastic disc with a pair of needle-nosed pliers to get enough room to get the chrome-dome threads started.

, Remember that you can loosen the plastic ring inset if you need to get that last 1/4 turn.

, If you get things too tight you will cause things to wear quicker than normal and you'll need to do this whole procedure again sooner than not.

,,, Start out with the water on cold and on with about half the maximum pressure. If things look OK with the half pressure then turn the cold water on all the way. Again, check for leaks. Once you're sure things are OK, turn on the hot water.

, Use a sink plug if you have one or a rag. Nothing will ruin your day faster than having a screw or a washer go down the drain.

, A compression faucet has two screw handles, one for hot and one for cold, and is the easiest to recognize by sight. The other three types of faucet all have one central, swiveling arm that you can swing from hot to cold as desired.You may have to take your faucet apart before you know which is which, because the internal mechanisms at the base of their arms are all different:


A ball faucet contains a ball bearing.
A cartridge faucet contains a cartridge. The materials of the cartridge will vary, but handle often has a decorative cap.
A ceramic-disk faucet contains a ceramic cylinder.

, Pry off the decorative cap if necessary (usually reading “Hot” or “Cold”), unscrew, and remove the handle.

, Underneath, you will find the stem, which sits on top of the O-ring, which sits on top of a seat washer. The seat washer is usually made of rubber, which can get worn out after a while. If your faucet is dripping, this is mostly likely the culprit., This will expose the O-ring, which will be thinner, and seat washer, which will be thicker.


If the handles are leaky (as opposed to the faucet), replace the O-ring. Take the old one to the hardware store and use it to find a replacement.

, This will be held in place with an upside-down brass screw.

, Since these washers vary in size, you might need to bring the old one in with you to a parts store to find an exact match. Coat the replacement in plumber’s grease before installing it.

, Any minor leaks should now be fixed.

, Ball faucets have several parts that will need to be replaced and some that require special tools. You won't need to replace the entire faucet, just the faucet cam assembly. All of the stuff you'll need, including tools, should be included in this type of kit that runs about $20 and is available in the plumbing section of most home repair shops.

, Lift off the handle and place it aside.

, Also, loosen the faucet cam by using the tool provided in your replacement kit for this purpose. Remove the faucet cam, washer, and ball.


This will look like a ""ball and socket"" joint in your body--a movable (usually white) rubber ball plugs the socket, stopping up the water and releasing it.

, To do this, you will need to reach into the mechanism itself, probably using needle-nose pliers.

, Cut off the old ones and coat the new ones in plumber’s grease before installing.

, These should all be included in your kit, and should be essentially the reverse of the process you completed.

, The leak should now be repaired.

, Pry off the decorative cap if necessary, unscrew, and remove the handle by tilting it backwards.

, This is a circular, threaded piece (usually plastic) that sometimes holds the cartridge in place and can be pulled out with pliers.

, This is the position the cartridge sits in when the water is on full blast.

, Set aside and locate the O-rings.

, Cut off the old ones using a utility knife and coat the new ones in plumber’s grease before installing them.

, The leak should now be repaired.

, After unscrewing and removing the handle, locate the escutcheon, which sits directly beneath the handle and is usually made of metal.

, This will expose several neoprene seals on the underside.

, White vinegar would work well for this purpose, especially if you have hard water. Soak them for several hours to work out the build-up and then assess whether or not they're reusable.

, If they look pitted, frayed, thin, or otherwise worn – or if you simply want to play it safe – bring them into the hardware store to find exact replacements.

, Running the water too forcefully can crack the ceramic disk.

Turn on the water and check for leaks.",How to Install a Bathroom Sink," You can install a new sink with basic tools and new components that match the valves already installed in your plumbing. Make sure you have:


Silicone caulking
Plumbers' wrenches, either pipe wrench or slip-joint pliers
Basin wrench
Set of plumbing sockets;
, Typically located beneath the sink, it's critical that you shut off the water supply to the sink before you remove it. If the valves are not beneath the sink, then you'll have to turn off the main water supply. This is typically located on a lower level or the basement near the water meter.


To test, turn on the hot and cold water on your sink and make sure no water comes out before proceeding.

, If you're replacing a sink, you'll obviously need to remove the sink that's in place before installing the new one. Disconnect the supply and drain lines from the faucet, using locking pliers or a crescent wrench. A small amount of water may leak out when you do this, which is normal. Just use a bucket or a towel to handle the water that leaks out.


Locate the large nut that connects the sink to the drain and disconnect it. This metal or plastic nut will be located either in the wall or the floor. Use your hands or locking pliers to unscrew the nut.
Remove the current sink by sliding the edge of a putty knife around the perimeter of the bathroom sink, loosening any caulk that connects it. Pull it loose.

, All new sinks should come with a template of the mounting opening, marking the location of the faucet holes, including a cutout for the sink. You can use the template to make sure the sink fits in the desired location. If it doesn’t, you may need to do some trimming or, or cut the entire opening if you're installing a sink in a house under construction.


Most new sinks come with clips and screws that are used to hold the sink in place. If you buy a faucet, sometimes it’ll come with the drain and tailpiece for the sink. If it isn’t included, get one before you start. The supply lines for the faucet need to correspond to the faucet and valves under the sink, so make sure they match before you get started.

, Put a thin bead of silicone around the bottom lip of the sink and set it into the hole. Clean up any excess silicone or smooth a line. Depending on the design of the sink and the opening where it connects to the plumbing lines, you may need to caulk in any number of different places.


For undermount sinks, put a bead of silicone under, have someone hold the sink in place, and install the connecting clips included with the sink.
You might have to pre-drill holes with a diamond carbide tip if you’re installing the sink in a granite/stone counter.

, Connective clips are often included with new sinks to help anchor the units into place, in addition to the sealing caulk. The design of this varies, and will depend on the type of sink and the design, but they usually act like a lever to hold the sink in place. Follow the instructions included with the new sink and defer to the manufacturer's guidelines.

, New faucets usually screw onto the faucet assembly in a clockwise direction. Some faucets will have a rubber gasket around the base, and screw on easily, while others will recommend using silicone sealant to secure to the sink or counter. You can anchor the faucet by reaching up underneath and using lock nuts that are included with the installation kit.


Sometimes it may be easier to install the faucet before the sink, depending on the design of the counter and the fixtures. Make sure the space for the faucet matches the location of the sink, using the template to measure before you install anything.

, Drop the tailpiece through the sink and screw on the tailpiece nut from underneath. Some sinks come with gaskets that go between sink and tailpiece. If it doesn’t, use non-hardening plumbers' putty or silicone to create the seal. Install the gasket, the included cardboard washer, and the locknut to secure the tailpiece.

, There are three common sizes: half-inch pipe thread, which is a coarser thread used on single-handle sinks, ½ or 5/8ths compression, and 3/8ths compression, which is a different type of thread commonly used on end valves, and intended to provide leak-free seal over hard copper.


If your sink comes with lines and they don’t match to valves, you can get additional lines that will match. If you put two pipe threads together, splice them with teflon tape.

, Water supply lines should screw into place with the corresponding joints on the new faucet. The specific size of the connectors should be included in the instructions for the specific faucet that you're installing.


You want to get lines that will have the appropriate ends for valve end and faucet end. Lines also need to be long enough so you won’t put stress on the joints. Better to have extra long lines and have them loop. No hard bends or kinks. Make them hand tight, and somewhere around a quarter to half turn with a wrench.
Usually the ""female"" connection piece on both ends will always have rubber gaskets, so you don’t need teflon tape.

, The pop-up is the device that allows you to open and close the sink drain, usually made of a simple metal rod with ball attached to it. Drop stopped into sink from top, slide short end of rod into the opening on the tailpiece, making sure that the opening for the ball is facing toward the lever for the pop-up. Install as per the instructions.


Sometimes you need washers and sometimes you don’t. Slide nut to trap the ball in the tailpiece. Tighten so there’s no wiggle, but not so tight that it’s difficult to raise and lower. Attach thumbscrew to pop-up lever rod while sliding the rod from the ball so they can attach and allow you to screw together.

, Finish with silicon around the top of the sink, anywhere that the basin of the sink meets the wall, filling any gaps with a thin bead of caulk. Let the caulk dry for about 24 hours before turning on the water and going back over your work to check for leaks.

, There’s no way to know if something is going to leak until you turn the water on. If you have small leaks from the rubber connections, try tightening more. The drain itself will also sometimes leak, which can be caused by over-tightening and straining the seal created by the connector gaskets. If that’s leaking, don’t go past hand tight. Try a new washer instead. It's also a good idea to check the gasket that goes under the tailpiece. Try tightening the nut down more or try different washer or silicone.

Clear out the blockage with a bent wire hanger.If you suspect that your sink is clogged with hair or other solid masses, you might be able to fish it out with an old, bent wire hanger.,
Use a plunger to loosen the clog.Use a standard plunger to vigorously suction the blockage out.,
Clean the P-trap.,
Snake the line.,
Flush the sink with boiling water.,
Dissolve the clog with baking soda and vinegar.The baking soda and vinegar solution is highly effective because the fizzy reaction created between the two cleaning products is vigorous and abrasive enough to loosen many stubborn clogs.,
Pour salt and baking soda into the drain.,
Pour caustic soda down the drain.,
Try bleach.,
Use drain cleaner.Commercial drain cleaners can be purchased at most grocery stores, and ther are caustic, acid, and enzymatic cleaners available.",How to Unclog a Sink,"


Straighten out a wire clothes hanger as much as possible. Bend one end slightly to create a small hook capable of fitting into your sink drain.
Slide the wire hanger down, hook-side first, into the drain. Try to keep the wire pressed to the side of the drain rather than pushing it down the center of the pipe. Doing so will minimize the risk of pushing the blockage further down.
Once you feel resistance, twist and maneuver the hanger in an attempt to hook the blockage. Pull the wire back up to remove as much of the blockage as possible.
Run hot tap water from your sink and into the drain for a couple of minutes. Make the water as hot and rapid as possible, but if the sink starts to back up, turn the water off.;
,


If you are working with a sink that has two sink drains, hold a wet cloth tightly over one drain to seal it off.
Place a plunger over the other drain, holding it fairly upright.
Fill the other side of the sink with 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 cm) of water. Doing so helps the plunger seal around the drain.
Roll the head of the plunger into the water, forcing water into the drain. Pump the plunger up and down for a solid 20 seconds using a vigorous, rapid motion, but do not break the seal between the plunger and the drain.
Pop the plunger off the drain on your last vertical upstroke.
You may need to plunge the sink for several minutes in order to loosen the blockage.

, The P-trap often catches debris and other blockages before they make it further into your pipes. This portion of your piping is located directly under your sink and can be removed and cleaned out manually.


Place a large bucket below the trap. This will catch any water or debris that falls from the pipe once you remove the trap.
Use slip joint pliers to loosen the slip nuts on the trap and unscrew the nuts by hand. Slide the nuts away from the connections and carefully slip off the trap.
Use a small wire brush to scrap out any debris from the trap, emptying it into the bucket below. Also clean the trap out by scrubbing with the same wire brush.
Carefully rinse the trap with hot water. You may want to use another sink, since you just removed a portion of the drain pipe for the sink you are currently working on.
Reattach the trap to the rest of the piping. If any slip nut washers show notable signs of wear, replace them.

, If the blockage lies deeper in the sink line, you may need to use a snake to clean it out.


Remove the P-trap and any pipes that connect to the drain stub-out at the wall.
Pull out 6 to 10 inches (15 to 25 cm) of snake cable.
Thread the tip of the snake into the drain stub-out. Tighten the setscrew.
Turn the crank clockwise to feed it into the pipe. Any initial resistance you feel is likely caused by turns and corners the snake must make.
Once you hit a blockage, continue cranking until you feel the tip of the snake cable break through to the other side. The tension in the cable will be reduced dramatically after it breaks through.
Turn the crank counter-clockwise to pull the cable out. Clean the cable as you remove it.
Repeat as needed until you no longer feel any blockage and restore your piping to its usual state.

, Boil at least 4 cups (1 L) of water in a kettle. After the water boils, pour it down the drain in two to three stages, pausing for several seconds in between each stage. Repeat if needed.


If possible, flush the sink out with at least 4 cups (1 L) of water. Use more if your kettle will hold it.
If you do not have a kettle, you can boil the water in a saucepan or electric hot pot.
You could also use the microwave to boil water, but microwave the water only in 20 to 40 second intervals and keep a wooden chopstick in the water as it microwaves. Otherwise, the water could super-heat and present a danger.
Pour the boiling water directly down the drain, rather than pouring it into the sink first and letting it gradually flow to the drain.
Note that this works best on minor clogs and may not prove as effective against heavy clogs. The water must also be boiling as you pour it since the vibration of the water is part of the reason why the remedy is effective at all.

,


Pour 1/2 cup (125 ml) baking soda down the sink drain.
Follow the baking soda with 1/2 cup (125 ml) white distilled vinegar.
Quickly cover the drain opening with a drain stopper. Doing so forces the fizzy reaction down through the pipes, where the blockage is, rather than up and out.
As soon as the fizzing stops, pour another 1/2 cup (125 ml) white distilled vinegar down the drain. Cover again and let sit for 15 to 30 minutes.
Boil 1 gallon (4 L) of water in a kettle or saucepan. Pour the boiling water into the sink to flush out any remaining vinegar and baking soda.

, When combined, salt, baking soda, and water also create a chemical reaction capable of loosening most blockages.


Combine 1/2 cup (125 ml) table salt and 1/2 cup (125 ml) baking soda.
Carefully pour or spoon the combination down the sink drain. Get as much into the drain as possible, and avoid getting too much excess on the basin of the sink. The reaction will only be effective against the blockage if it comes into direct contact with it.
Let the baking soda and salt sit for 10 to 20 minutes.
Boil 1 to 4 quarts (1 to 4 L) of water in a kettle or saucepan. Carefully pour the boiling water into the drain.
Plug up the sink drain as quickly as possible after adding the water to force the reaction down into the pipes rather than up and out.
The chemical reaction produced should be enough to clear most moderately clogged sinks.

, Caustic soda, or sodium hydroxide, is an extremely strong chemical that will dissolve most blockages clogging up your sink.


Caustic soda can be purchased at most hardware stores.
Dilute 3 cups (750 ml) of caustic soda with 3/4 gallon (3 L) of cold water in a large mop bucket. Mix the chemical and the water together with a wooden spoon.
Do not use any container or utensil you plan to use for food later on.
Do not stir the water and caustic soda together with your hands.
The water and caustic soda should begin to ""fizz"" and heat up as you mix the two together.
Carefully pour the solution directly into the clogged sink drain. Let sit for 20 to 30 minutes without touching it.
Boil 1 gallon (4 L) of water on the stove and use it to flush the drain.
Repeat the procedure if necessary.

, If you are connected to a public sewer system and not to a well or septic tank, you can use bleach to both clean and deodorize a clogged sink.


Pour 1 cup (250 ml) of undiluted bleach directly down the sink drain. Let sit for 5 to 10 minutes.
Turn your sink on and let water rush into the drain. Make sure that the water is as hot as possible and as strong or rapid as possible. Let it run up to 5 minutes.
If your sink begins to back up and fill with water, turn the water off and let it drain before attempting to unclog the sink again.
Do not use bleach if you use a septic tank. Bleach kills bacteria living in the tank, but the bacteria it kills eats solid waste, thereby preventing the lines from clogging.

,


Read the label carefully to determine which cleaner is right for your particular type of blockage. For instance, some cleaners might work better in bathroom sinks, while others might work better for kitchen sinks.
Follow the instructions on the label carefully when you use it.
Caustic drain cleaners rely on chemical reactions caused by hydroxide ions.
Acid drain cleaners use a chemical reaction between hydrogen ions and the material clogging the sink. Acid cleaners tend to be harsher than caustic drain cleaners.
Enzymatic cleaners are the least potent and rely on bacterial enzymes to eat away organic blockages.

Place the plunger over the drain. Make sure the rubber head is flush against the sink or bathtub around the drain so that it creates a seal.
Push the plunger so the rubber head inverts. Let it pop back up and push down again. Do this several times until water starts draining from the sink or bathtub.
If the water doesn't drain, put the plunger away and try something else.;
, Many clogs are located in the trap under the sink, and are easily removed if you clean out the trap, the screen that catches hair and other solid objects. Clean the trap by taking the following steps:


Place a bucket under the sink to catch water and other debris that will pour out when you detach the trap.
Remove the clean-out plug from the trap. It's usually located in the base of the bend. Push a wire coat hanger or another long, thin object into the hole and use it to scrape out debris and clean the clog.
If you don't have a clean-out plug, unscrew the trap using a pair of pliers. Clean out the debris and wash out the trap before replacing it.
If the clog is still there after cleaning the trap, move on to the next step.

, You'll need a drain auger or closet auger, a bucket, and rubber cleaning gloves. Have a few old towels around to clean up dirty water.

, If you have a tub screen or a hair trap covering your drain, place it out of the way.

, Rotate the handle clockwise as you push.


Grip the handle with both hands if you have trouble pushing.
As you lower the cable, move your grip down until it's about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the drain opening. This close grip allows you to control your motions and feel for the clog easier.

, At some point you will feel resistance from the obstruction in your pipe.


It might seem as if the cable has hit a wall when you hit the pipe's curve. Keep pushing to snake the pipe past the curve.
You should be able to determine that what you've hit is the clog if you sense the clump giving way slightly as you press downward.

, Continue to turn the cable clockwise, and then pull up slightly to see if you've captured any of the clogged matter. Push and prod the clog so you can begin to break it up.


Work on the clog until you puncture through the other end. Continue turning the handle to break up the clog into smaller pieces.
If the clog won't seem to budge, it may be a solid object that you've hooked.

, Pull the snake out of the drain with care so you don't lose the clog if it's hooked on the snake.


Clean the mess off the snake with a towel as it emerges. Dump the drain matter into a bucket.
Keep pulling up as much of the clog as you can until the snake is free.

, Run the water through the drain. It may take a few second to wash away the remnants of the clog, but it should begin to flow quickly.


If the drain is still obstructed, you will need to try to locate the clog from another angle. Try snaking through the pipes directly under the sink. Unscrew the sink trap and insert the snake into the hole. Snake the pipe using the same technique you used to snake it through the drain opening.
If water still won't run through the drain after you've snaked it from the trap, it may have been pushed further down into your pipes. In this case, it's time to call the plumber.

, Cutting hair over the sink or washing heavy products down the drain can lead to clogs. Throw all solid objects in the trash instead, even if they're seemingly too small to cause clogs.

, Hair traps and drain screens work well to prevent clogs from happening. Make sure you have one in your sink and in the shower, so your hair doesn't get knotted inside the pipe.

Mix salt and vinegar.,
Pour the mixture into the drain.,
Rinse the drain with boiling water.",How to Unclog a Drain with Salt and Vinegar1," In a small bowl, pour 1 cup of salt. Add 1 cup of vinegar. Stir well so the salt soaks up all the vinegar. Continue stirring until the mixture is smooth and even.


Add a 1/2 cup of lemon juice and mix thoroughly to give your paste some extra declogging-power thanks to the juice’s acidity.
If the clog is located deep within the pipe, or if you're leaving the lemon juice out, add more vinegar for a thinner mixture so it travels more easily.;
, First, remove the drain's stopper. Then pour the mixture directly down the drain. Coat the entire drain so the whole clog is sure to absorb the mixture. Allow it to sit for 15 minutes so the clog can absorb as much as possible. For especially stubborn clogs, let the clog soak for 30 minutes.


If you are unable to remove the stopper, add more vinegar to the mixture before pouring so it's thinner.

, Boil 2 cups of water with a kettle or pan. Then pour the water directly into the drain. Pour slowly to avoid splash-back, which may scald you. Also pour slowly so you can aim the water directly into the drain instead of splashing the basin, which may absorb the heat and cool the water on contact before it reaches the clog.


Use boiling water instead of running hot water from the tap, since it may take a while for the hot water to kick in.

Stir until they are evenly mixed. Remove the stopper from the drain if there is one. Then pour the contents down the drain., Heat 1 cup of vinegar in the microwave or on the stovetop. Once it reaches simmering, pour it directly down the drain. Cover the drain immediately with a stopper, plug, or even the bottom of the cup or glass you used for mixing, because the baking soda will cause the vinegar to froth and bubble. Contain the reaction within the drain as much as possible for best results., Wait 15 minutes so the clog can absorb the mixture as much as possible. For tougher clogs, wait 30 minutes. In the meantime, boil 2 cups of water. Once the clog has had time to soak, remove the drain cover and pour the boiling water down the drain to rinse, followed by hot tap water."
"
Pour salt down the drain.,
Rinse the drain with boiling water.,
Repeat.",How to Unclog a Drain with Salt and Vinegar3," Although the acidity from vinegar helps to eat through grease and other clogs, salt alone will scour the inside of the pipe, since it is so coarse and abrasive. Measure a 1/2 cup of salt. Then pour it directly down the drain., Boil 2 liters of water first. Pour this slowly down the drain. Aim the water directly into the drain to avoid scalding yourself with any splash-back. Once the boiled water has gone, run hot water from the tap to further flush the drain., Since you are only using salt, you will probably need to do this a few times to remove the clog. Continue to add salt in 1/2-cup increments, flushing with boiling water each time, before adding more.Avoid dumping too much in at one time.

Pour the remaining boiling water down your drain.",How to Clean a Sink Trap1," If your stopper has a pivot rod, then you will need to remove this to remove the stopper. Look under the sink and locate a locking nut where the pivot rod goes into the drainpipe. Unscrew the nut, pull out the rod, and remove the stopper. Then screw the nut and rod back in place without the stopper.If you are plunging a kitchen sink, make sure to clamp the dishwasher drain hose. Do this by tightening a clamp around the bendable drain line before you begin plunging.;
, Bring five cups (1,182.94 ml) of water to a boil. Pour half of the boiling water down your drain. Reserve the other half for a later use., As your sink is filling, place the plunger over the drain entrance. Fill your sink until the plunger is completely submerged in the water, about three to four inches (76.2 to 101.6 mm) of water. The water will suction your plunger to the sink.If you have a double sink, then you will need to cover the other sink’s drain with a wet rag or another type of cover. This will prevent water from spewing out of the sink’s drain while you plunge the other drain.

, Do this by rapidly moving the plunger up and down for at least 20 seconds. On your final upstroke, make sure to pop the plunger off of your drain to create extra pressure. This will help release the clog in your sink trap., If the water in your sink whirls down your drain easily, then the clog is clear in your sink trap. If not, then you will need to keep plunging. Repeat the plunging process until the water whirls smoothly down your sink., You may need to re-heat the water at this point. Re-heat the water until it is boiling again. Then pour the water down your drain.


The boiling water should clear away any remaining residue in your sink trap.
If your sink is still clogged, then repeat steps two through six, or use a different method.

Mix 1 cup (236.59 ml) of vinegar in 1 cup of hot water.,
Pour the mixture down your sink drain.,
Rinse your drain.",How to Clean a Sink Trap2," Place your pot on the stove and set the heat to high. Bring the water to a rolling boil, about 10 minutes. Pour two cups (473.18 ml) of the boiling water down your sink drain.Reserve the remaining water for a later use.

, Let the baking soda set for 5 to 10 minutes. Depending on how clogged your drain is, you may need to let it set for longer, like 20 to 30 minutes.Make sure to remove your sink stopper before doing this.

, Use the water that you boiled. Mix the vinegar and water together until they are well combined., Then quickly cover your drain with a plug or wet towel to prevent the mixture from bubbling out of your drain. Let the mixture set for 10 to 15 minutes.If your sink trap is very clogged, then you may need to let the mixture set for longer, like 30 minutes.

, Pour the rest of the boiling water down your drain. This will help remove any remaining dirt and grime from your sink trap.If the water has cooled, then heat it to a rolling boil again before pouring it down the drain.
If your sink is still clogged, then you may need to remove your sink trap to clean it properly.

Locate the sink trap.,
Place a bucket underneath the sink trap.,
Unscrew the slip joint nuts.,
Remove the sink trap.,
Rinse the sink trap.,
Scrub the sink trap with a bottle brush.,
Reassemble the trap.",How to Clean a Sink Trap3," Look under your sink and locate a pipe with a J or P-like curve. This is your sink trap. The sink trap is located in between the tail pipe and the waste pipe.The tail pipe is the pipe that connects directly to your sink, and the waste pipe is the pipe that connects to the wall.

, You can use a regular gallon bucket, or any type of water collecting device like a dishpan. The bucket will be used to catch any water, dirt, and grime that comes out as you remove the sink trap., Begin by loosening the slip joint nuts on each end of the sink trap (on each end of the J or P). You can do this either manually, using your hands, or you can use a wrench. Once the joint nuts are loose, continue to untighten them with your hands.If your sink trap has a decorative or metal finish, then use a strap wrench to loosen the slip joints to prevent scratching. You can also place duct tape on the parts of the wrench that come into contact with your pipes to prevent scratching.

, As you remove the sink trap, make sure to locate the O-rings. There should be two; one on each side of the J. Place them somewhere safe. The O-rings are used to seal the connection between the sink trap and the tail and waste pipes.Also make sure to take note of the order the parts are in. This way you can reassemble the sink trap correctly.
Clog the waste pipe with a cloth or rag to prevent sewer gases from entering your home.

, Take the sink trap to a separate sink or outside to rinse. Rinse the trap thoroughly until all the loose dirt and grime are removed., You can also use a dishwashing detergent to remove any dirt and grime as you scrub the sink trap. Scrub the sink trap until all the dirt and grime are removed.At this point, you can use the bottle brush to scrub and remove any dirt and grime from the end of the tail pipe as well.

, Place the slip joint nuts onto the tail and waste pipes first. Slip the O-rings back onto the tail and waste pipes. Then place the sink trap between the tail and waste pipes. Use your hands to tighten the slip joint nuts over the ends of the sink trap.Use your wrench to finish tightening the slip joint nuts. Only tighten the slip joints nuts a quarter turn more. Try not to tighten them too tight. This can cause your pipes to crack and break, especially plastic ones.

Understand what happens with tree roots.,
Be considerate about where you plant trees.,
Know the general rule.,
Find smaller trees if you don't have the space.",How to Site Trees to Avoid Root Problems," The roots of trees keep the tree in place and are like hoses, seeking water for sustaining the tree through absorption. Tree roots are encouraged by:


Leaks in pipes and sewers: Here is an easy source of water to access!
Cracks in pipes: Tree roots aren't capable of cracking pipes. Rather, tree roots seek water and if there is a crack, the root will enter via any crack and start increasing inside the pipe as the crack widens under the pressure, until there is a blockage caused by the roots.
Surface of the soil: Most moisture and nutrients sit at the surface of the soil; hence, tree roots will form at the surface to take advantage of this. If it is a large and vigorous species of tree, this surface growth can crack pavement, pavers, etc.;
, Siting the tree properly from the outset makes good sense. This even includes trying to think about future building on your site should this be something you might want to do down the track. Things to consider include:


Finding out where draining and water lines are and planting trees well away from these.
Avoiding planting trees that you know will grow too large. Ask your local municipality if it can recommend which species of trees to avoid planting. See ""Tips"" for some of the more common problem trees.

, Knowing where to avoid placing trees requires knowing how big the tree's roots will grow. The general rule is that trees produce roots equal to about three-quarters of the tree's mature height. This means a tree 20 meters (65.6 ft) high will have roots of 15 meters (49.2 ft).

, You don't have to miss out on shade and greenery. Instead, prefer smaller tree species. At the same time, ensure that your plumbing is in good order and replace broken and cracked pipes as soon as you are aware of them.

Snake the drain with a hanger.,
Try a wet/dry vacuum on the drain.,
Plunge the drain.",How to Unclog a Drain1," Straighten out a wire coat hanger and use it to fish out hair and dirt from the drain that is clogged.









Try not to push the debris further down into the pipe. The goal is to drag out whatever is causing the clog.;
, Place the vacuum on the wet setting so it is safe to vacuum liquids.









Cover the vacuum vent. If you do not, there could be spray or mess created by whatever comes out of the drain.
Seal the drain. Use a piece of rubber or something like a plunger head that will force the liquid that leaves the drain to go directly into the vacuum.
Turn the vacuum on its highest setting and hold it over the clogged drain. The force of the vacuum will bring the clog up from the drain and into the vacuum.

, Hold a toilet plunger over the clogged drain and press down, allowing the plunger to suction back up.









Remove the plunger from over the drain after you press down on it 4 or 5 times. See if you brought anything up. If you did, clean it away from the drain and if you did not, try plunging again.

Pour the mixture down the clogged drain as soon as it begins to fizz.
Allow the mixture to sit in the drain for at least 1 hour, then flush it with hot water.

, Mixing together salt, baking soda and hot water will create a chemical reaction that should eat away the worst of the clog.









Combine 1/2 cup (4 oz.) regular table salt with 1/2 cup (4 oz.) baking soda. Pour the mixture into the clogged drain.
Leave it alone for 10 to 20 minutes, then flush it with hot water. The drain should clear when you run the water.

Use a chemical drain cleaner.,
Use a natural drain cleaner.,
Unclog your sink with a plunger.,
Clean the P-trap.,
Snake the drain.",How to Unblock a Drain1," Using a chemical drain cleaner is one of the most common ways to unclog a drain. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions when using chemical drain cleaners.Make sure you buy a drain cleaner that is compatible with your system. If you have a septic tank, you will need to find drain cleaner that is suitable for septic systems.Don't mix drain cleaners. If one brand doesn't work, do not try another one immediately after.;
, Many chemical drain cleaners on the market have caustic chemicals in them that could be harmful to the environment. If you don't want to use a chemical drain cleaner, you could try making your own from baking soda and vinegar.Make sure your sink is dry, and pour at least 1 cup of baking soda down the drain.Pour about 2 cups of boiling water down the drain. Wait a few minutes and then pour another cup of baking soda down the drain. Follow the cup of baking soda with 1 cup of white vinegar.Plug the drain with a wet rag or drain stopper. The vinegar and baking soda will start foaming. Keep the drain sealed to push the foam down the drain and release the clog.Once the foaming stops, pour another 2 cups of boiling water down the drain to flush it., You may be able to unclog your drain using a plunger. If you are using your plunger in a kitchen sink, be sure to cover the drain of the adjacent basin.Fill the sink with a few inches of water. You want to force water down the drain, not air. When you put the plunger in the sink, roll the head of the plunger so that it fills with water.Make sure you get a good seal around the drain. If you are having trouble making a seal around the drain, try putting a layer of petroleum jelly around the rim of the plunger.Vigorously work the handle up and down. On your final pull, pop the plunger off the drain to try and break the clog. Wait a few seconds, and then repeat the process. It may take several tries to break the clog.Don't use a plunger immediately after using a chemical drain cleaner. You may get serious burns if the chemicals splash on your skin., Your clog may be stuck in the P-trap for your sink. To find the P-trap, look beneath your sink for a curved pipe attached to the drain.If you have any standing water in the sink, remove it. Use a cup and a bucket to get as much water out of the sink as you can.Place a bucket beneath the P-trap. Dirty water will flow out of the trap when you remove it, so make sure the bucket is beneath both connections.To remove the trap, use a pair of slip-joint pliers to remove the slip nuts connecting the pipes. If your pipes are plastic, be careful not to snap them. If the pipes are metal, the slip nuts may be difficult to remove. Remove the slip nut between the P-trap and the trap arm, the pipe that leads into the wall, first. Then remove the P-trap completely.If your P-trap is dirty, remove any debris. Inspect the pipes for any breaks or thin walls and replace them if you need to. Check the trap arm for any debris, and remove it as well. Rinse the P-trap and reattach it. Check the drain for leaks., If plunging doesn't unclog the drain, you may need to snake the drain. Depending on the type of sink you are unclogging, you may be able to run the snake directly through the drain. If you can't run the snake through the drain, you will have to remove the P-trap and run it through the waste line.Feed the snake into the drain until you feel an obstruction. Continue to push the snake through the obstruction until you feel the tip of the snake push through. The tension in the cable will drop when this happens.Turn the crank on the snake counterclockwise to pull the snake out of the drain. The cable will be filthy so make sure you have rags and a bucket handy to clean the mess.Repeat this process until you no longer feel any obstructions in your pipes. Reattach the drain traps and flush the drain with warm water.You can also flush the drain using baking soda and vinegar to keep your drain smelling fresh and remove any remaining build up. Pour 1/2 cup of baking soda down the drain followed by 1/2 cup of white vinegar. Plug both drains and wait a few minutes before flushing with warm water."

Determine the type of clog you're dealing with.,
Use a plunger.,
Make sure there is enough water in the toilet bowl to keep the plunger covered.,
Snake the drain if the plunger doesn't work.,
Maintain your toilet drain.",How to Unblock a Drain2," If you suspect you have a clogged toilet, don't flush it. Remove the tank lid and look for the flapper valve. You should see a chain coming from the top of the valve. Lift the chain to let a couple cups of water enter the bowl.Observe the water in the bowl. If it takes a few minutes to drain, you have a slow clog. If the water doesn't drain at all, you have a full clog.If you flush a clogged toilet, you run the risk of flooding your floor., Most of the time you can clear a clogged toilet with a plunger. Make sure you buy a plunger that has a flange on the rubber end. The flange fits the drain of a toilet better, and gives you extra plunging power.To plunge your toilet, situate the rubber end of the plunger over the drain in your toilet. Gently push the plunger down into the drain. You want to get rid of all the air in the bell (the rubber part) of the plunger.After the initial plunge, work the plunger up and down. It may take several rounds of plunging to loosen the clog., You want to force water into the drain to remove the clog, as opposed to air, which won't do much., In some rare cases, you may not be able to unclog your toilet using just a plunger. When that happens, you'll need to snake the drain.The drain snake is just a long wire that you feed through the drain to dislodge the clog. A basic drain snake is inexpensive, and should do the job.Feed the snake through the drain until you feel it break through the clog. Once you feel the snake break through the clog, pull it out to remove the debris.If you can't unclog your toilet with a plunger or a drain snake, you may need to call a professional.

, Keep the lid closed when not in use, especially if you have kids. Kids like to flush toys and other objects down the drain, which will result in clogs.Don't try to flush things like caulk, grease, or wax down the toilet. These materials could harden in the drain and cause a nasty clog."

Figure out what type of stopper you have.,
Remove the stopper.,
Pull out the debris.,
Replace your stopper.",How to Unblock a Drain3," Before you can unclog your tub, you need to know what kind of stopper you have. You will have either a drop stopper, a lever stopper, or a push/lock stopper.Drop stoppers are the most common type, and have a knob on the top to allow you to open the drain.If you have a lever stopper, you likely have a mesh screen over your drain. The lever is attached to the overflow plate, and controls the stopper in the drain.A push/lock stopper seals the drain when you push down on the stopper. To release the stopper, simply push it again., Once you've determined the type of stopper you have in your tub, you need to remove it. Removing your stopper is a simple task.To remove a drop stopper, pull up the stopper and look for a screw on the side of the shaft. Use a screw driver to loosen the screw and remove the stopper from the drain.If you have a lever stopper, you may not need to remove the stopper to clean your drain. You may be able to remove the clog by unscrewing the mesh screen that covers your drain. If you do need to remove the stopper, unscrew the overflow plate and pull out the linkage. The linkage is the mechanism that controls the stopper.To remove a push/lock drain, pull the stopper up until you can see the stem. Hold the stem in one hand and unscrew the cap of the stopper to release it from the drain., With your stopper removed, you should be able to access the clog. You may find that the clog is near the top of the drain. If so, just grab the debris and toss it.If you can't see the clog, get a wire hanger and bend a small hook on one end. Feed the hanger through the drain until you feel the hook catch on the debris. Pull the debris out of the drain to release the clog., After you've cleared the drain, replace the stopper. Depending on the type of stopper you have, you may need to make some adjustments to get a good seal.If you have a drop stopper, put the stopper back in the drain, and screw it into the shaft. Run some water in the tub to make sure you have a tight seal.If you have a lever stopper and you removed the entire mechanism, take this opportunity to clean it. Reinstall the linkage by feeding it through the pipes. Screw the overflow plate back to the tub, and screw the mesh screen back on to the drain. Run some water and test the lever to make sure your drain works. If you find that your tub leaks, adjust the mechanism.If you have a push/lock stopper, place the shaft back in the drain, and screw the cap back on. Test the drain by running some water, and make any necessary adjustments."

Realize that when water does not run through your drain, it is because there is a bunch of junk and trash clogged up in one of the pipes.,
Hair clogs.,
Try a plunger.,
Keep at it.,
Seal off secondary openings.,
If the plunger doesn't work, you may have to snake it.,
Buy a ""snake"" (also known as a drain cleaning auger).,
Insert the snake into the drain pipe where you removed the trap (easier than from the drain in the bottom of the sink), and when you meet resistance, rotate the snake clockwise.,
When you retrieve a snake from the pipe, be prepared for it to be covered in the most vile, black, smelly sewer-line sludge (even for kitchen drain lines).,
Sometimes clogs can be more easily approached with a snake from the air vent on the roof.,
If the snake doesn't reach the clog, look for a clean out (unscrew a plug in the drain pipe in the basement) further down the drain where the snake may be inserted.

,
Slow drains.,
Sometimes there can be a problem with the slope of the drain pipes (although plumbing codes are designed to prevent this, not all pipes are up to code).,
Although plungers are a standard way to clear a clogged toilet, they can be messy to clean afterward.,
If this is your kitchen sink, and it has become plugged from running the garbage disposal.",How to Restore Water Flow To a Clogged Kitchen Drain," The clog could be anywhere in the drain pipes, not just limited to your kitchen. Although rare, it can even be in the vent pipe leading to the roof; such blockages usually cause slowly draining pipes rather than completely blocked pipes (just like slowly flowing gasoline from a gas can when the vent is closed).;
, For bathtub, shower and wash basins, an inexpensive barbed plastic dipstick may do the trick (e.g. “Zip-It”). These dipsticks are often limited use as the barbs are easily broken.

, Liquid drain cleaners usually contain lye or other hazardous, caustic chemicals, and sometimes damage older types of pipes, and are toxic to fish. There are, however, a few earth-friendly enzymatic powders available (but they usually take 24 hours or so to work, and often are ineffective on stubborn clogs).

, Plungers can work on the upstroke or the downstroke. Plunging down increases the pressure above the clog and forces it down the drain (while breaking it up), on the upstroke the pressure above the clog becomes lower than the pressure below the clog (which then may break apart and come up into the bottom of the sink, where you may collect it and dispose of it in the trash).

, If working on a double kitchen sink with two slowly moving or clogged drains, either close up one side with a wet rag — or use two plungers at once (perhaps with a friend's help), pushing down and pulling up together. On a bathroom sink with an overflow hole, seal the hole with a wet rag (or just your hand) while plunging the drain. Failure to block any secondary openings results in a significant loss of pressure from the plunger, likely leaving the clog in place, and may cause water to eject from the opening. If you aren’t dislodging the clog with a plunger, and the secondary openings are sealed off, try adding a little water in the sink around the plunger, as this may help to seal the connection to the sink/drain. If the plunger still doesn’t work, the clog may be past the sewer air vent to the roof, and the force of your plunge is simply going up the vent.

, But first put a bucket under the trap below the sink, and remove the trap by unscrewing the connectors. (Hopefully you haven’t used any caustic chemicals on the clog. If you have, be extremely careful and wear protective gloves, goggles & clothing.) Clear the trap of any clogs. If the water drained from the sink when the trap was removed, and the trap wasn't clogged, then the problem is further down the drain. This is almost certainly the case in a double sink where both sides are clogged (since each side usually has its own trap).

, Typical sizes for home use range from 15−50´. 25´ is usually more than enough. Some are manual, some electric, some are hybrids, and others are automatic. Hybrids can be hand cranked, or attached to an electric hand drill. Unless you need to work on drains frequently, it’s probably best to start off with an inexpensive manual snake. In most cases, a drill attachment is over-kill, can get in the way, and becomes one more item which may require cleaning.

, If it begins to move forward easily again, you have likely just hit a turn in the pipe. If not, continue to turn and gently push forward to cut through and clear the clog. Never jam a snake hard as this is unlikely to clear the clog, and may damage the snake.

, Snakes are springy by nature; when the tip of the snake comes out, make sure it doesn’t have an opportunity to whip around, or you and the surroundings will get sprayed with sludge. Cussing will follow.

, Shorter snakes may be unable to reach the clog from the roof, however.

,, A plugged air vent will cause sinks to drain slowly. If the snaking the drain doesn't help (particularly where the sink drains, but very slowly), an air vent obstruction may be the cause. You may need to snake out the air vent from the roof.

, Check the visible portion of the drain pipe (in the basement) for sagging drain pipes. It may help to add pipe hanging straps to ensure that there is a steady downward slope in the direction of desired flow.

, Time and water alone can often clear a clogged toilet. Usually the problem is a combination of feces and toilet paper. Over time, the water logged toilet paper softens and breaks apart. Put about two gallons in a bucket and pour water directly into the bowl. The idea is to pour the water as quickly as possible, but not so forcefully as to cause splash-out. This can sometimes create more force than a flush alone might accomplish. If nothing seems to move much, wait about a half-hour before trying again. Repeat as necessary. This method is almost always effective, in time, but may take several hours to work. Patience is key. If you don’t have the time, a plunger will usually do the trick. Failing that, you may want to buy a special toilet auger, which differs from a standard snake in that it is short, and attached to a 3´ rod.

, If you have already tried a snake (see above) and keep getting food, but you cannot unclog the drain, what I have done, is unhooked the line feeding the ice-maker, or dishwasher, attach a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) hard clear flexible tube on that connection (about a 10 foot piece) then unhook your drain pipe from the wall/floor, and fish the tube as far down the pipe as you can, once it stops going down the pipe, put a catch can under the opening to catch any back flow of water/food. turn on the water, and push the tube back and forth.. If you get the tube down to the food block-up, it should blast the junk out of the way. And the best part is you don't use any chemicals.

Install an over-the-top drain screen.,
Install an underneath drain screen.,
Place a kitchen strainer over the drain.,
Cover the drain with a fabric softener sheet.",How to Prevent Hair Clogs1," This is a piece of metal mesh that can be purchased at a local hardware store and that will fit directly over your current drain opening. It will trap any extra soap scum, hair, or other debris, keeping it from going down the drain. Read the installation directions closely, as you may need to secure the screen on top of the drain with plumber’s putty.Make sure to remove the screen and clean it on a periodic basis to keep the water from backing up into your shower.;
, This type of metal screen hangs in the middle of the pipe below your drain opening and is not easily visible from above. To install it you will first need to loosen and remove any current drain covers by either removing their fastener screws or rotating them until they come free. Then, follow the installation directions on the screen package.Most hang-down screens will require that you apply plumber’s putty to their outer rim and then place them inside the pipe with the open end facing upwards.

, Grab a small metal mesh culinary strainer and position it directly on top of the drain. You may need to hold it in place with a bit of plumber’s putty or even your hand, as it may slide around a bit when water hits it. Remove the strainer and clean after each use to prevent hair accumulation., Place a used fabric softener sheet directly over the drain opening. The sheet is porous and will allow the water to flow through while trapping any hair or debris on the surface. Throw the sheet away after your shower.This method only works if your shower drain is covered enough so that the sheet will not get sucked down into the drain itself. If that happens, it can clog up your pipes.

Brush your hair beforehand.,
Remove any excess dirt from pets before washing.,
Gather any loose hair mid-showering.,
Avoid putting foreign objects in the drain.,
Run the water after finishing.",How to Prevent Hair Clogs2," Standing outside of the shower area, take a hair brush and go through your hair a few times. Gather any loose hairs in your hands and throw them away before stepping into the shower. This will minimize the number of hairs that may fall out and clog your drain., If you wash your dog or cat in the bath, then give them a good brush down elsewhere beforehand. Try to get off the matted areas and any clumps of loose hair before putting them under the water. In addition, if your dog is muddy, try to remove any larger chunks of dirt before bathing.To minimize the strain on your drain, when the weather is warm you might want to bathe your pets outside instead, if possible.

, As you run your hands through your wet hair, place the hair strands that end up on your hands on the wall or the shower ledge. This is better than letting them go on down the drain. When you step out of the shower or bath, wipe up these hairs with your hands or a paper towel and toss them in the trash.Make sure to gather up the hairs after every shower or bath or you could end up creating a hairball that could lodge in your drain.

, Debris, such as make-up pieces or clumps of dirt, can partially block the drain. When combined with hairs, this can then develop into a full clog. Be extra careful when putting on your make-up above the bathroom sink, for example. Placing extra screens on all drains can help to minimize these seemingly random clogs., Always let the water run for an extra minute or so after you step out of the shower or bath. This flushes any debris further down the pipes and helps to prevent a clog close to the drain. It is also a good idea to flush your bathroom sink with water as well since toothpaste and other products can clog the pipes otherwise."

Do a hot water rinse.,
Do a salt water rinse.,
Do a baking soda rinse.,
Do a bleach rinse.,
Add in a drain cleaner.,
Remove a clog by hand.,
Contact a plumber.",How to Prevent Hair Clogs3," On a weekly basis, get one cup of boiling hot water and pour it slowly down the drain. The heat will help to loosen up any grime, smoothing out the interior of your pipes so that they do not gather hairs and create clogs. But be careful to only pour the water into the drain or you could risk damaging the surface finish of your tub or shower.Always be careful when handling boiling water. It may be easier to pour the water directly from a hot kettle into the drain.

, Every month or so, pour one to two tablespoons of table salt directly into the drain. Follow this with ¼ cup white vinegar and allow your drain to sit undisturbed for one hour. Come back and turn the faucet water to hot. Run it for ten minutes. Repeat this process one more time for the best results.For extra difficult clogs, pour ¼ cup Borax into the drain immediately following the salt and continue with the steps above., Once a month, pour one cup of baking soda and one cup of apple cider vinegar into your drain. Let the drain sit for a few minutes. Don’t be surprised if it foams up past the drain cover, as this is normal. Flush out the drain with hot water until the foam is no longer visible. Repeat a second time for maximum cleanliness.If you dislike the smell of vinegar, it can be replaced with lemon juice instead.

, No more than once a month, pour a cup of bleach down your drain and let it sit for one hour. Turn the faucet on hot and run it for a while to flush everything down. Be careful when working with bleach, however, as it can damage your shower or bathe finish on contact., If the at-home methods do not work to your satisfaction, then get a commercial drain cleaner to try. Read and follow all of the directions on the package closely and do not use more than once cleaner at the same time. Also, make sure to flush out your pipes with water after using a commercial cleaner in order to protect your pipes from corrosion., Take off the strainer or stopper by unscrewing the edges or popping it off. Shine a flashlight inside the drain and look inside. You may see a clog right at the surface of the drain. If that is the case, put on some rubber gloves and then reach in and remove it with your hand.

Landscape.",How to Install a Drainage System Around the Foundation of a House," The trench will need to be dug down to the footers of the foundation and be about 4' wide. You will also need to dig a trench away from the foundation to either a percolation trench, dry well or to daylight if the slope of the land allows. (Percolation trench is also called an infiltration trench similar to the trench you have around the foundation. You will then add perforated pipe at the percolation trench. This is the best way to manage the run off. A dry well is either a pit filled with crushed stone or a structural camber. The easiest way is running it to daylight if the building site has a steep enough slope.);
, Along the bottom of the trench, you will unroll the filter fabric, lapping the filter fabric up the sidewalls of the foundation. Smooth the remaining fabric away from the foundation.

, Cover the filter fabric with a 3-4” layer of crushed stone. Now, install the 4” perforated pipe around the whole perimeter of the foundation. Perforated pipe can be installed on level ground. Use a solid 4” PVC tee to connect the ends of the perforated pipe. You will now connect the solid 4”PVC pipe to the tee, which will leads to a percolation trench, dry well or to daylight. Cover the pipe with crushed stone, 8-10” above the footing of the foundation. Then, pull the excess filter fabric over the crushed stone, making sure it laps against the foundation. It is important that the fabric completely cover the crushed stone, this will prevent the soil clogging the pipe.

, Fill with a minimum of 6” of gravel or coarse sand is recommended to prevent soil getting under the fabric and clogging the drainage system. Now back fill the trenches. The soil should slop away from the foundation.

, You have your drainage system almost completed. Lay a layer of filter fabric over the soil. Plant your favorite shrubs and cover filter fabric with bark mulch or pea stone. Not only will you have a dry basement, you will have lovely landscaping.

When the area has been cleared, lay down an old towel to protect the shelf from water damage in case any of the pipes, hoses, fittings, or other components happen to leak.Clearing out the area will give you an easier area to work in, and protect items from water.;
, This should always be the first thing you do before starting any plumbing work, and you won’t be able to replace the hoses unless the water is off.Turn the water shutoff valve to the right (clockwise) to turn off the water.


To find the shutoff valve, simply follow the pipes attaching the faucets to the supply line. Near where they connect, there should be a shutoff valve for the hot and cold water.

, This will prevent water from leaking everywhere when you remove the hoses. To drain out the excess water, simply turn on the taps for the hot, cold, and pullout faucets until the water runs dry.


This will get standing water out of the hoses and pipes and relieve pressure from the line., The supply line hose is the hose that connects the faucet to the main water supply. This could be a plastic hose, a coiled metal hose, or it could even be a solid metal tube. There will be separate hoses for the hot and cold, so make sure you disconnect the one that you need to replace.


It’s common for some water to drip when the hoses are disconnected. Place a pan under the sink to catch drips.
To disconnect the hose, start by loosening the lock nut attaching the hose to the water supply. You'll probably need to loosen it with the adjustable wrench first.To loosen the nut, turn it to the left (counterclockwise).
Once you’ve loosened the nut with the wrench, you can twist it off the rest of the way by hand.
If you're not sure which hose is for which supply, the hot water is typically on the left, and cold on the right.

, Follow the supply hose from the water supply up to where it’s attached to the faucet. When you find the lock nut, use the basin wrench to access the nut and loosen it off.Loosen the nut by turning it to the left (counterclockwise).


When you’ve loosened the nut, you can twist it off the rest of the way by hand.
Once the second nut is disconnected, you'll be able to remove the old hose.
The basin wrench is necessary here because it allows you to access the hard-to-reach nut under the sink. Because the handle of the wrench can pivot, it lets you turn the wrench and loosen the nut from a more comfortable position.

, It’s actually best to purchase a replacement hose after you’ve removed the original one. Take the original hose to the hardware store and buy a replacement that will be a perfect match.You don’t have to buy the same style of hose, but it does have to be the same length as the original, and the diameter of the hose and fittings must also be the same.

, Use the rag to dry off the threaded pipe ends where the supply line hose attaches to the water supply and faucet. When the threads are clean and dry, wrap them with thread sealing tape. Make sure the tape doesn’t extend beyond the end of the pipe.Thread sealing tape lubricates threads and helps to form a stronger seal between joints. This will make your new hose easier to attach, and help prevent leaks.

, Reach up with the hose and attach the faucet end of the hose to the same connection you removed the original from.With your hand, tighten the nut by turning it to the right (clockwise) just until it’s snug.


When you’ve tightened it by hand as much as you can, finish screwing on the nut with the basin wrench by turning it a quarter turn. Do not overtighten, as this can damage the threads.
Make sure you attach the right end, because the diameter of the hose is probably different where it connects to the faucet versus the water supply.

, Once the faucet end has been connected, you can attach the new hose to the water supply. Tighten the nut by hand (turn it to the right), and then finish tightening it with the adjustable wrench.


Do not turn the nut more than a quarter turn with the wrench, as too much tightening can cause damage.

, Turn the water back on by turning the shutoff valves to the left (counterclockwise). When the water is back on, turn on the faucets to run the water. As the water runs, check for leaks or other problems.After turning on the water, it may take a moment for the water to come out the taps, and it may sputter a bit for a minute.

, With the adjustable wrench, turn the nut attaching the hose to the water pipe. To loosen the nut, turn it to the left (counterclockwise). Once you’ve loosened the nut with the wrench, unscrew it by hand the rest of the way.


If there is no nut to loosen, you may have a different type of connection. If there's a gray button where the hose and water supply connect, press the button to release the hose.Otherwise, you may have a collet-style hose. In that case, hold the ring in place, gently push the hose deeper into the connection to release it, and then pull the hose out.

, Every pull-out faucet has a weight attached to the hose that draws the hose back in when you replace the faucet into the holder. Before you can remove the hose, you'll have to remove the weight.


Some weights will slide off the end of the hose. Others will snap in and out of place. For the rest, unscrew the screws holding the two sides together and pull the sides apart to remove them from the hose.

, Once the weight has been removed, you can pull the faucet and the hose out through the holder. Then, you can remove the hose from the faucet head to replace it.


To remove the faucet from the hose, use a wrench to loosen the nut attaching them, and then hold the nut in place as you unscrew the faucet head., To make sure that you get the same style and size of hose, take the old hose with you to the home or hardware store. The three main styles of hose are threaded, which uses a nut to secure the attachment, quick disconnect, which will have a button that clicks to secure it, or collet, which won’t have a nut or a button.If you want to buy the hose in advance but aren't sure what style you have, you can purchase a universal style that will come with multiple attachments and adaptors.

, Use a clean towel or rag to clean and dry the threads and connections on the hose and faucet. Wrap the threads with plumbing tape to lubricate the connection and form a good seal. Insert the hose into the faucet head, hold the nut, and screw the faucet head on. Tighten the nut by turning it to the right (clockwise) by a quarter turn.The threads will be located on the connection that gets inserted into the other end.

, Thread the hose through the hole in the holder. When the hose has been pulled through the hole the entire way, set the faucet head in its position in the holder. Reattach the weight by sliding it onto the new hose.


For weights that screw together, clamp the two sides together over the hose and screw them back together.

, For threaded hoses, butt the connections together and tighten the nut by screwing it to the right (clockwise). Then use a wrench to tighten it a quarter turn.


For quick disconnect hoses, simply insert the male end in until it clicks.
For collet hoses, hold the ring in place and push the hose into the connection., Once the water is on, turn on the faucet to run the water. Look for leaks, and make sure the water is running through the hose and faucet properly."

Diagnose the problem.,
Check your shut-off valves.,
Remove the aerator.,
Soak the aerator in vinegar.,
Screw the aerator back on.,
Check the flow rate of your aerator.",How to Adjust Faucet Water Pressure," Is the faucet's pressure too high or too low? If the pressure is too low, it's possible that your faucet's aerator is clogged. An aerator is a device that fits onto the end of a faucet and restricts water flow by mixing in air with the water. If the pressure is too high, your faucet may not be fitted with an aerator at all.;
, All sinks should have 2 valves on the water lines feeding into them - 1 for hot water and 1 for cold water. These valves will be under your sink, and they are used for shutting off the water supply in case you need to make repairs. Make sure these are all the way open. If they aren't, your water pressure will be lower than it should be.


Don't, however, use these valves to adjust the water pressure by leaving them partially closed. The valves are designed to work in 2 positions - fully shut and fully open. This is not the proper way to fix a water pressure problem.

, If the pressure is too low, the aerator may be clogged. Removing it is straightforward, but not always easy.


Try to remove the aerator with a pair of pliers. Grip the aerator in the pliers and twist. You may want to wrap a rag around the pliers first so that they don't slip on the metal and to protect the metal from scratches.
If you can't remove the aerator with pliers, try soaking it in vinegar. Pour some vinegar in a bag and use rubber bands to tie it onto the faucet. Let it soak for a few hours - this will loosen up any corrosion or debris that might be causing the aerator to stick.
If vinegar does not work, you can spray the entire aerator with WD-40, then use pliers again to try to take it off. Make sure to open a window to allow the fumes to disperse.

, After removing the aerator, inspect it for clogs. You will notice that it has a bunch of very small holes (which your water is forced through), and these holes tend to get clogged over time with mineral deposits and sediment. Give the aerator a quick rinse, and then place it in a dish of vinegar overnight (any kind will do).

, After the vinegar soak, rinse the aerator off and re-attach it by screwing it back into place. Test your water pressure. It should be smooth and even.


If your water pressure is too high, check to see if you have an aerator. Without an aerator fitted, faucets will spew water out at an enormous rate. To see if you have an aerator, just look at the end of the faucet. If you can see a fine wire mesh, you have an aerator.

, Most aerators will have this printed on their side in gallons or liters per minute. In the U.S., all new faucets are required to be fitted with an aerator rated at 2.2 gallons per minute (8.3 liters per minute) - this should be plenty if working properly. If your want to lower the water pressure, you can always buy a lower-flow aerator at a hardware store. Simply unscrew the old one and screw the new one on.

, Make sure that the gasket is in the hose before attaching the hose to the faucet, or you will have a soggy mess on your hands.

, The hose screws onto the faucet adapter. Make sure it is screwed on tightly enough so that it forms a watertight seal.








, Remove the hose and faucet adapter, then screw the faucet tip back on relatively tightly so that it forms a good seal.

You may have to look underneath to be sure. For bathroom faucets, in particular, the two handles may be joined with the spout to become a single unit or they may be spread apart from it. You will need this information to choose the correct replacement.;
, You'll probably be using this faucet for a long time, so it's worth investing in a good-quality faucet.


It's possible to spend anywhere from about $20 to $500 and above on a faucet. Read reviews and decide for yourself how much of what you are paying is for quality and how much is for designer names/styling and fancy features.

, They can range from detailed and helpful to minimal and frustrating. When in doubt, defer to the manufacturer's instructions rather than those you find elsewhere.

, It's a tool designed to reach way up behind your sink and remove the two big nuts on each side of the faucet that hold the faucet tight against the sink. If you can't loosen the nuts by hand or with the tools you have on hand, a basin wrench will make the job easier.

,, Arrange any portable lamp or use a drop light if you have one.

, Under the sink, you will see two supply lines coming out of the wall and going up to your faucet. There should be a valve on each one, one for hot and one for cold. Turn both of these valves off by twisting them clockwise as though they were faucets.

, Water will come out of each tube now as they drain back from the faucet so you'll need a towel to soak up this water.


It's a good idea to replace the supply lines when you replace the faucet, if they are old, especially if they were the flexible sort. If you have solid tubing, it isn't generally necessary unless it doesn't reach the new faucet. If you're not replacing the supply lines, you may only have to disconnect them at the top. A braided, stainless steel reinforced supply line will virtually eliminate the possibility of flooding from the line bursting.

, This is where you'll want to use a basin wrench if you have one. You may have one, two, or even three nuts. Your sink may look different because they may be hard plastic, brass, or silver-colored metal. This may be the hardest part of the job, since the threads are often quite long and they may be corroded so that the nuts are difficult to turn. Hang in there! It gets easier from here.

,, If they are damaged in any way, take one with you to the store where you bought the wrench and buy two, new, gray plastic tubes the same length. They come with new nuts and end fittings.

, You may have to scrape and scour to remove hard water deposits, although depending on the new faucet, some of the area may be covered. Try vinegar or an acid cleaner to help dissolve hard water deposits.

, You need something like this to seal around the base to keep water from getting under it. If not, buy some plumbers' putty. It's gray in color and is something like chewing gum. Stick a bead of it around the base before you mount the new faucet. When you tighten down those two big nuts, it will squeeze a little of this putty out but it's easy to clean up with rubbing alcohol.

,, Sometimes there is a separate flange or plate that slips over the bottom. If you want this flange installed, or if there are any additional hoses to assemble, do so now.

,,,,, Wait for ten minutes and check for leaks again. If everything seems fine, you're done; if not, tighten the fittings a little more and check for leaks again.

Prevent any additional stains and watermarks by removing the mat when it’s not in use., Get into the habit of wiping your sink after each use to prevent yellowing or staining in the first place. Use a small amount of dish soap on a wet, soft rag or sponge and thoroughly wipe your white sink down. Rinse the soap with water and completely dry the sink with a paper towel or other dry cloth., Things like coffee, tea or grease can stain white porcelain or fire clay. Make sure you don’t leave half-filled, dripping coffee cups or dirty frying pans in your sink overnight. The longer dirty plates stay in your sink, the longer stains have to set in.

, Polish and give your sink a protective coating with lemon oil. Add several drops of lemon essential oil to a soft, dry cloth to coat your white sink with. Remember to dry your sink out first before adding shine and repelling residue with lemon oil."

Pour boiling water down the drain.,
Plunge the drain.,
Put baking soda in the drain.,
Add vinegar.,
Snake the drain.",How to Clean a Bathroom Sink Drain2," To remove stubborn buildups, start by boiling about a half gallon (roughly 2 liters) or water and carefully pouring it down the drain. High temperature water will begin to break apart and dislodge the blockage., Encourage the buildup to proceed down the drain by plunging the drain five or six times. While this may not fully remove the buildup, it will help loosen it further. Use a plunger that can create an airtight seal over the opening of the drain., Slowly pour about a cup of baking soda into drain. Allow the baking soda to sit for a few minutes. Not only will the baking soda absorb unpleasant odors, it will help physically break apart the buildup., Pour a cup of distilled white vinegar into the drain after waiting a few minutes. The baking soda and vinegar will react with one another and begin to foam. Cover the drain, as this will encourage the baking soda and vinegar mixture to work it’s way into the clogged portion of the drain and break down the remaining blockage. Allow the mixture to sit in the drain for an hour or so.Vinegar is also a natural deodorizer. Together, this mixture will also help remove any odor the deposit caused.
Cider vinegar or lemon juice will work in lieu of white vinegar.
After allowing the mixture to sit, rinse again with hot water.
Repeat the process to eliminate residual odors.

, Stubborn deposits may require more physical disruption. Get a drain snake from your local hardware store. These are essentially long, thin strips of plastic with hooks on either side. Use it to break up and push or pull away any deposits that have clogged your drain.Follow this with a baking soda and vinegar soak to remove unpleasant odors.

Keep trash out of the sink drain.,
Use less soap and other products.,
Avoid commercial drain cleaners.",How to Clean a Bathroom Sink Drain3," Perhaps the most important part of keeping your drain clean is being mindful of what you put in it. This is especially true for bathroom sink drains, which will inevitably accumulate natural detritus, such as hair. As a rule of thumb, if you’re unsure whether it’s okay to go down the drain, throw it away instead.Avoid washing dishes or disposing of any food products in the bathroom sink.
Don’t dispose of personal care products, such as cotton balls, dental floss, or bits of toilet paper in the sink drain.

, Even soap and other things that you regularly dispose of in your bathroom sink, such as toothpaste and shaving cream, can contribute to build up in your drain. As such, get in the habit of using smaller amounts of these products.A small dollop of toothpaste is plenty, and one pump of hand soap is sufficient to wash your hands.

, There are a lot of reasons not to use commercial drain cleaners that rely on chemicals. They can corrode your pipes and damage other components of your fixtures and plumbing system. They are also toxic, and can work their way into the ground water in your area."

Remove any standing water from the bathtub.,
Pour the required amount of cleaner into the bathtub drain.,
Wait for results.,
Flush the drain with cold water.,
Contact a professional plumber if the drain has not been cleared.",How to Unclog a Bathtub Drain2," Chemical drain cleaners unclog drains with chemicals such as potassium hydroxide or sulfuric acid.When properly used, they will clear most drain clogs. Choose a type of drain cleaner from your local hardware or discount department store.


Make sure the product is intended for your system; on the back of the cleaner, it will say what types of pipes it is suitable for.
Buy a product intended specifically for bathtubs.
If you are confused about where the cleaners are located or which one to buy, ask an employee for help.

, These are the manufacturer’s instructions, and all drain cleaners will have slightly different ones. Some may require you to wear protective goggles, pour in only a certain amount of liquid, and so on. Reading the instructions on the back is crucial to using the chemical drain cleaner safely.

, You may need to use a bucket or large cup to remove any water remaining in your bathtub.

, Drano, for example, requires you to pour half of a bottle (32 oz) down a clogged drain. On the other hand, Crystal Lye Drain Opener requires you to only pour 1 tablespoon. Be careful to not splash the chemical cleaner as you open the bottle and pour the chemicals into the drain.


Clean up any spills immediately.
Wear gloves at all times when handling any chemicals.

, Many cleaners say 15-30 minutes will suffice, so let the chemicals sit in the drain for this amount of time. Set a timer to accurately keep track of time.

, The drain should be working after you have waited 15-30 minutes. Turn on the cold water faucet in the bathtub, and the water should immediately disappear down the drain.

, Mixing different chemicals can be dangerous, so do not try a different chemical cleaner if the first has not cleared the bathtub drain. At this point, you should call a professional plumber for assistance.

Plunge the drain.,
Use a hanger to pull out the clog.,
Use a drain snake.,
Flush the drain with hot water.,
Repeat.,
Use gravity and pressure to flush the drain.",How to Clear a Clogged Drain with Vinegar," If it's really slow-draining, this may take a while, but if you remove the water, you drain-clearing mixture will be able to work on the clog much faster.;
, You have several options for creating a non-commercial drain opener. Most involve vinegar and another substance that create a chemical reaction when combined. See if you have any of these drain-opening agents on hand:


Vinegar (white or apple cider vinegar work) is the acidic base for creating the foaming reaction.
Lemon juice is acidic like vinegar, but smells refreshing. This makes lemon juice a good option for clearing out clogged kitchen sinks.
Baking soda is frequently used as a multipurpose cleanser.
Salt will help eat away at the clog.
Borax is frequently used as a multipurpose cleanser.

, No mixing is needed before pouring down the drain. The mixture will foam up on its own as the chemical reaction occurs.For a vinegar and baking soda combination: use 1/2 cup of baking soda and 1/2 cup of white vinegar.
For a lemon juice and baking soda combination: use 1 cup of baking soda and 1 cup of lemon juice.
For a salt, borax, and vinegar combination: use 1/4 cup of borax, 1/4 cup of salt, and 1/2 cup of vinegar.

, Either use the tub stopper to close the drain or cover it with a steaming hot cloth. Keep the drain closed for 30 minutes. During this time, the foam will be working on wearing down the clog., Use a small, sink size plunger to agitate the clogged-up material. Create a seal and push up and down on the rubber base of the plunger.


Plunging works best if you fill the tub or sink with water. The added pressure from the water will help force open the clog.

, If the drain is clogged with hair, take a metal hanger and twist it till you have a long piece of metal with a small hook at one end. Carefully feed the hook end of the wire down the drain. Twist the wire around and try to snag the clog. Gently pull the wire back out once you've caught the clog.


Take care not to scratch your sink or tub with the exposed metal. Also, use caution when untwisting the hanger. The metal may be sharp.

, A drain snake looks like a long metal rope. You'll need to carefully feed the snake into the drain. When the snake gets stuck, you'll want to turn the cable. This will make it catch onto the clog. When you slowly pull the snake back out, the clog should clear. Flush with water and repeat.Wear work gloves since the metal snake can be sharp. You should also have an old towel and bucket handy to set the clogged material.

, Boil at least 6 cups of hot water or several kettles full of water. Uncover the drain and slowly pour the hot water down.


If you have plastic piping, just use very hot water. Avoid pouring boiling water in the drain., If the water is still draining slowly, repeat the process again until the drain becomes clear.


If the clog still stubbornly resists draining, you may have a hairball stuck. This may require manually removing the clog. Consider calling a plumber, especially if the drain completely stops up.

, This works best on a clogged tub, since you can fill the tub with gallons of water. Fill the tub with hot water. Then, open the drain and let the pressure of all that water help break up the clog."

Understand a bit of what's going on under your sink.,
Push and pull the rod.,
Adjust the nut.,
Make sure the two rods are connected.,
Attach the stopper to the lower rod.,
Adjust the location of the lower rod.,
Adjust the travel of the lower rod.",How to Make a Pop up Drain Stay Closed," When you pull up on the drain rod (1), it pulls up on another rod (3) that's under your sink, behind the drain. This rod passes through a ball joint (5) and hooks into a notch (6) in the bottom of your drain stopper (7).


You can move the rod from below the sink to see the mechanism operate, or ask somebody to move the rod from above while you watch from below if you need to learn which one it is.;
, Notice whether the drain stopper moves. If it does, but it doesn't stay where you put it, tighten the nut. If the drain stopper doesn't move with the rod, or if the motion doesn't seem to be related (you pull the rod and the drain stopper only wiggles), then something is probably disconnected.

, On the back of the drainpipe, there is a nut. It may have tabs for hand-tightening or it may require a wrench. The nut in this picture (shown at 4 in the diagram above) controls how stiff the mechanism is. If the stopper moves as it should but doesn't stay put, all you need to do is tighten the nut (turn it clockwise). If the action is too stiff, loosen the nut a little. Check the action and adjust until it feels about right.

, If the stopper isn't moving or isn't moving much, this is the first thing to check. There's usually a simple screw and nut connection at the joint. If it's missing or disconnected, connect it. Remember that this joint needs to move, though, so connect it loosely enough that the joint will act as a hinge.


Use a clip such as the one shown in the photo to attach the two rods securely together while leaving them free to move.

, Pull up on the stopper with your fingers. It should not come out. If it does, or if it's not moving when the lower rod moves, you'll need to attach it.


Take a look at the stopper. You will see something looking like a hook with a notch in the middle.
Look into the drain. You'll see the lower rod protruding from the back of the drain. Your object is to get the notch hooked onto the lower rod.
Hold the stopper so that the notch is at a right angle to the lower rod. Notice which way you point the hook.
Lower the stopper into the drain. Push it in far enough that the lower part of the hook is just past the rod. Feel your way to this point, and use the rod to move the lower rod to help yourself find it.
Rotate the stopper 90 degrees so that the hook pops around the lower rod and the tip of the rod ends up in the notch. This maneuver may take a few tries, but don't give up.

, If you have trouble getting the hook over the rod so that it's in the notch, or if nothing you do seems to engage the stopper with the lower rod, the rod itself may be in the wrong place. Remove the stopper and look in the drain. The rod should extend between half and three-quarters of the way into the drain pipe.


To adjust the distance the lower rod extends into the drain pipe, loosen the nut. Push the rod in further or carefully pull it out a bit. Try not to pull it all the way out. When it is where you want it, tighten the nut down again until the action is stiff enough.

, You may find that the lower rod goes too far up or down. Move the clip at joint (2) up or down, in or out.


Change how high up the lower rod attaches to the upper rod. You may see a series of holes on the upper rod. Move the lower rod to a higher hole if you'd like the stopper to be lower down in the drain. Move the lower rod to a lower hole if you'd like the stopper higher up.
Change how far back on the lower rod the upper rod is attached. This choice may not be built in, but you can make the overall travel of the stopper greater by attaching the upper rod further away from the ball joint. Conversely, you can lessen the travel of the stopper by attaching the upper rod closer to the ball joint.

Keep a small wastebasket near the desk.,
Place a small white-erase board near your desk for writing down notes, to-do tasks or appointments.",How to Organize a Computer Desk," Sort all the items you use every day into one basket, and all the items you use less frequently into the next basket. Pile any papers scattered on your desk into the third basket for later sorting. Anything you come across that you know you won't actually use--including that extra calculator you've had hanging around, or extra pencils and pens that are just clutter--goes in the fourth box.


Clean out all your desk drawers and cubbies, too. Everything goes into one of the boxes. Any trash you find goes straight to the trash can, of course.;
, Ideally, even day-use items should have a designated drawer, cubby or storage bin, leaving your desktop as clear as possible. Some items you might use every day and want quick access to include pens, pencils, paperclips or binder clips, a stapler, a calculator and a receipt book.


Label a sticky note with the name of each daily-use item, then place the sticky note on the item's home. For example, if you decide to keep your stapler in the upper right-hand drawer, put a sticky note with the word ""STAPLER"" on the front of that drawer. Keeping your desk organized isn't just about designating a home for each item, it's also about training yourself to associate each item with its new home and leave it there at the end of the day. You can use a label maker to make more permanent labels, if you find they help, or remove the sticky notes once you're used to storing the daily-use items in their proper places.

, Sort them into two piles: Items you'll actually use, and those you won't. The latter pile goes into the clutter box.


Be honest with yourself: If you'd forgotten you even owned something, it belongs in the ""clutter"" box instead.

, The less frequently you use an item, the further out of reach it can be comfortably stored. Avoid the temptation to strain your desk's storage capacity to the limit. If it can't hold your less-frequent-use items comfortably, store items you use less than once a week in a small chest, box or basket near the desk.

, You can use three baskets, a three-tier desk organizer, or three file folders in an upright file holder. Label the parts of the system: To Read, Follow-up, and To File.


This is not a storage station; papers should be stored in a filing cabinet or in filing boxes, not on your desk. Incoming papers and mail go directly into the ""To Read"" part of your system. As you have time to read them, you can then sort them into the appropriate ""Follow-up"" or ""To File"" part of the system.

, Don't put any papers in the ""To File"" section; instead, file them away right now. Otherwise you're just reorganizing your clutter.

, Everything should be in its designated place before you leave work for the day. Starting the day with a clean computer desk will give you a natural springboard into productivity.

, If recycling is offered in your area, place a small recycle basket or box nearby as well. Place trash or recycle items in the appropriate receptacle, instead of leaving them on your desk.

, This helps cut down on the clutter of ""self-reminder"" sticky notes and papers that tend to accumulate on a busy person's desk. If you need a place to store hard-copy notes, like index cards, purchase a magnetic white-erase board or a combination bulletin board and white-erase board.

Look for solid wood.,
Expect nine layers or more if you choose plywood.,
Look for veneer.,
Know your woods.",How to Judge the Quality of Wood Furniture1," If a store claims that a piece of furniture is solid wood, that means that it only contains wood. Plywood, on the other hand, is layers of wood and resin or glue. Solid wood tends to be more durable, though it is usually more expensive.If you can see an unfinished edge of the furniture, you should be able to tell if it's plywood or solid wood. Plywood will have visible layers.;
, Plywood can be pretty solid and last a good amount of time, as long as it contains enough layers. Look for nine or more layers when examining plywood furniture. You should be able to count layers on an exposed side.For instance, if you're looking at a dresser, look at where the joints come together (such as in the back), which should have an edge where you can see the plywood layers.

, Veneer is when a cheaper wood is covered with a thin layer of higher quality wood. It's not as good a quality as solid wood, but solid, beautiful pieces can be made out of veneer. In fact, you can even sand and re-stain these pieces, though you don't want to sand too much, as you can wear through the veneer layer.Veneer actually doesn't split as much as hardwood. On the other hand, you may get blistering over time, or the veneer may start to peel up.When choosing veneer, look for a thin veneer layer rather than thick veneer. Thick veneer is more likely to split. You'll be able to to tell on the edges. Thick veneer will be visible., Each type of wood has something different to bring to the table. Some woods are cheap and plentiful, while others will stand the test of time more readily. If you know the type of wood the furniture is made out of, you know a bit more about it's quality. ""Hardwood"" and ""softwood"" more often refer to the type of tree than the durability of the wood, so pay attention to the type of wood instead.For instance, pine is cheap, so it's used fairly often. However, it's relatively soft, so it dents and dings easily.Oak is hard-wearing. It also has a distinctive, visible grain, so you need to appreciate the look.Walnut is also hard-wearing, but it has a variation in color that may or may not be to your taste.Cherry is a more expensive wood, due to its fine grain and beautiful color.Maple is not as expensive, but it is extremely durable. It is also easy to stain any color you'd like. Mahogany is more expensive than maple, and it is also a quality wood."

, When decorating with accessories, it is important to keep within the style constraints of your interior design. For example, to use accessories like a Victorian heirloom and a country craft in a minimalist, contemporary setting would be inappropriate and out of place. Your accessories should support their environment's aesthetic - not work against it.

, You may use accessories anywhere, including shelves, fireplace mantles, couches, tables, couches, floors, countertops, pedestals and window ledges. Creative display options like bowls, shadow boxes, trays and curios are interior design accessories in themselves.

, Small, singular objects may visually disappear in a room. Grouping adds weight and visual significance to diminutive interior design accessories. Adhere to the following guidelines when grouping:


Use symmetry appropriately. Even groupings and symmetry can look overworked, and generally give off a formal feel. When decorating with accessories in a more relaxed or informal setting, group in odd numbers, or asymmetrically.
Choose objects with a common design element. For example, if you choose to hang a group of family photos, then they should all have something in common, such as a sepia hue or identical framing material. Groups of random objects should be associated by either color, theme or size.
Stagger object heights. To create visual interest, group objects with differing heights: high, medium and low.

, Remember that contrasting colors will stand out and provide a visual pop, while monochromatic colors will blend in and create a soothing affect. Consider the overall aesthetic of your room and choose the colors of your interior design accessories accordingly.

, This creates visual interest. For example, group a blue glass sculpture with a blue pottery jug and a blue conch shell, or put a jacquard throw pillow on a silk-upholstered armchair.

, Too-large accessories or groupings will dominate a small space, while too-small accessories may disappear in an expansive space.

, After you place each additional accessory, step back and assess the arrangement for clutter. Regroup/replace items as necessary, until you are satisfied with the placement of your interior design accessories.

Look at the finish.,
Feel for heft.,
Check for stability.,
Notice signs of wear.,
Check the joints.",How to Judge the Quality of Wood Furniture2," The finish should be even across the whole piece, making a nice, uniform color. If it's not, that could indicate the piece has been cheaply done. If the furniture is antique, a few scares are okay, but try to avoid burn marks, which are difficult to repair., A better piece of furniture of wood will be heavier than a similar piece that isn't as good a quality. Weight indicates its made out of a better quality wood, like mahogany, rather than a lesser quality wood, like pine., A good piece of furniture will feel stable. Lean on it or sit on it in several places. Make sure it feels solid. If it wiggles or wobbles, that's likely not good quality.If it's an antique piece, it may have more wiggle, but for the most part, the seller should have fixed that problem., If you're looking for antique furniture, it should have some signs of wear. You should be able to see some dirt in creases, for instance, especially around often used places (such as knobs). If it doesn't have these signs, it's likely been refinished or isn't old.Refinished antique furniture isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it won't be worth as much, most likely.

, The joints can tell you a great deal about quality. Certain joints, such as dovetail joints and mortise-and-tenon joints, are more stable than other types of joints. If you can identify these joints, you likely have a higher quality piece of furniture.A dovetail joint is where two pieces of wood come together with interlocking pieces, secured with glue.Mortise-and-tenon joints join when one side of the joint has a long cavity. The other side of the joint is carved to fit into that cavity, sort of like a letter sliding into an envelope. Sometimes, a peg is used to secure the pieces together, and glue is usually added for stability."

Look for lower-quality joints.,
Skip staples and nails.,
Check for cracks, knots, and other problems with the wood.,
Avoid drawers that have wood slides.",How to Judge the Quality of Wood Furniture3," Lower quality joints include dowel joints (held together with dowels)and butt joints (where the joint is two flat boards against each other, held together with glue, nails, and/or screws). If you see these joints, you have a lower quality piece of furniture., Wood should be put together with screws and glue, not staples or nails. Screws will help the furniture last longer because it has a better grip. Glue gives the furniture stability, but you shouldn't be able to see it., Cracks in the wood is a sign that it's not very good quality and will likely split at some point. Quality furniture is also made without knots. In addition, check to make sure the wood is hard by lightly scratching the surface (in an inconspicuous place). If it's hard, durable wood, it shouldn't scratch easily., Wood slides won't work as well over time. Look for metal slides, which will hold up better and keep you from shouting at your drawers when they don't want to slide properly."

Mount a macrame tapestry.,
Design a unique dreamcatcher.,
Make macrame curtains.,
Put up a room divider.",How to Use Macrame in Home Decor1," A tapestry can add an element of handspun elegance to any room in your home. Use tapestries to make blank, uninteresting sections of wall more eye-catching. You could even hang one above the headboard of your bed or behind the sofa in the living room to tie the room together.Attach the tapestry to a wooden dowel (or a slender tree limb, for more of a natural look) to make it easier to hang and keep it from sagging.Make one-of-a-kind macrame wall art the focal point of your living room wall.;
, The classic dreamcatcher is a staple of many homes, and represents peace, restfulness and positivity. Rather than displaying an ordinary dreamcatcher woven from wire, try out a softer approach with the macrame version. The gentle fabric braids will bring you even more of a sense of comfort when you stop to admire it.Put the finishing touches on your dreamcatcher using beads, feathers and other decorative touches.Dreamcatchers are one of the simpler projects you can start with if you’re just learning how to macrame.

, Replace boring window covers with floor-length macrame drapes. You could choose a dense weave for privacy, or go for a loose fringe to beautify your window space while still admitting a soft glow of light.You could even rig your macrame curtains up to runners so that you can draw and open them as you please.

, Hanging room dividers are typically made with noisy beads, but a macrame version can help create privacy without all that irritating clacking. Rather than keeping the doors in your home shut, simply tack the divider to the door frame to make your living space feel more open and inviting.Tie a couple beads onto the end of each strand to give the cords some weight so that they’ll return to their original position.
Use partitions to cover entryways and create separation between rooms that are close together.
