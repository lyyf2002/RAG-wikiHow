It is strongly advised to have another person hold the mirror steady while you do this, so that it doesn't suddenly come loose.

, Once the cutout wire has sliced through most of the adhesive, you should be able to lift the mirror away from the wall. This process is likely to tear away some of the drywall paper, so expect to have to repair the wall later.

Get a tape measure and write down the height and width of the space you need to fill on your wall.,
Use the moulding width in figuring out what size mirror to order.",How to Measure Your Space for a Large Wall Mirror," Height is the length from top to bottom, and width is the length from side to side. Let’s say your measurement gives a 24” width and a 30” length. It would be considered a 24x30 inch space to fill requirement. We can use that measurement to work backwards and find the perfect size ornate mirror.


Why should we work backwards from this measurement? For large wall mirrors, most all wood constructed frames come in standard sizes, which are derived from the size of the opening of the frame, not the outside dimensions. The opening can either hold a mirror, or a picture that is equal to that size. The standard size 24x30 framed large wall mirror contains a frame moulding that is various inches thick plus, a mirror that is size 24x30. Thus a 24x30 mirror with a 3” thick moulding is actually 24” + 3” (moulding width) + 3” (moulding width) = 30” is the actual outside measurement.






A 24x30 wall mirror with a 4” moulding would be calculated as follows: 24+4+4=32 and 30+4+4=38 So, the outside measurement is actually 32x38, even though it’s called a 24x30 large wall mirror.






Popular standard ornate mirror sizes are 8x10, 11x14, 12x16, 14x18, 16x20, 20x24, 24x36, 30x40 and 36x48. Taking these sizes in to consideration and working backwards will give the ORDER SIZE.





;
, Using the above example, let’s pick a frame that is 3-1/2” thick in moulding width. Earlier, we measured a space requirement of 24x30. We prefer a moulding 3-1/2” wide. Using those figures and working backwards you can find the right ORDER SIZE.


24 minus 3-1/2 minus 3-1/2 = 16” Then, 30 minus 3-1/2 minus 3-1/2 = 23” So 16x23 is the exact dimension you need, but which standard size comes the closest to matching?






Of the standard sizes available, the 16x20 most closely matches these requirements, even though the 20” length is three inches short of the target. You might consider ordering the next size larger, a 20x24, but the 20” width is 4” wider than you need, and the 24” length is 1” longer. Check your space requirements and decide which is best for you.

Adorn the staircase with framed family photos.,
Display an antique city map.,
Hang monochromatic engravings.,
Display oil or acrylic reproductions.,
Decorate with vintage posters.,
Place an antique vase on a fireplace mantle.,
Display a sundial outside.",How to Decorate with Vintage Artwork1," For this idea, you can use a variety of sizes. If you have a wide variety of small and large photos, hang the smaller ones at eye level and the larger ones higher up. This way, the viewer will be able to see each image equally well. Feel free to mix up eras, as well. Place antique black-and-white or sepia photos with color photos from no more than 20 years ago., A black-and-white aerial view of streets and parks will give your home a more vintage feel. Hang an engraving or lithograph in a black frame or opt for an unframed canvas. Display it in your foyer to greet guests or in your dining room as a conversation piece., Black-and-white depictions of everyday life are versatile. You can hang them in multiple rooms. If you desire a change of décor, you can switch them out to different rooms. For example, that country scene hanging in the bedroom might look equally nice in the living room., Don't fret if you can't afford that Impressionist masterpiece in the latest auction catalogue. There are plenty of websites and catalogues that sell framed oil and acrylic reproductions on canvas for reasonable prices. Hang them in the foyer, the living room, the bedroom or along the staircase., The subject matter of posters is often more modern than other forms of vintage art. Examples include old movies, propaganda form each World War, and psychedelic imagery from the 1960s and 70s. Hang them in the living room, bedroom, or dinging room. If you have a room designated for entertainment, classic movie posters would add a great touch., Spice up a white or beige mantle with a brightly colored vase. If your mantle has a bolder paint job, use a white vase for some contrast. Place a bouquet of real or artificial flowers in the vase or leave it empty. Set in the center to offset a rectangular work of wall art., Place it in the front yard to greet guests or add an accent to the back garden. Go for a simple circular dial on a rectangular pedestal or a more ornate armillary sphere. Choose from stone, metal, or a combination of the two. No matter which shapes or materials you choose, your sundial will definitely draw everyone's attention."

Hang antique plates as wall décor.,
Create a “distressed” paint job for wooden antiques.,
Upcycle a vintage window.,
Hang empty frames as art.,
Use old shutters as an interior backdrop.,
Decorate your kitchen with old cookware.",How to Decorate with Vintage Artwork2," First, purchase plate hanging hardware from your local craft store. Then, plan how you want to hang the plates. You could arrange them by alternating sizes, shapes, or colors. Choose from a circular or rectangular arrangement., Remove the original paint if you don't like the color or if you think it might contain lead. For a vintage look, use your index finger to apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly anywhere you don't want the paint to stick. Then, paint the entire surface and let the paint dry for a few hours. After that, run a damp rag over the areas you applied the petroleum jelly. The paint will come right off., Hang a salvaged window of any shape or size from the wall to display as art. Place it on a wall that receives direct sunlight for an interesting play of light. To create a sense of variety, complement curved lines with straight ones. For example, hang a circular window above a chair with a rectangular back.You can also use each quadrant of a divided window as a picture frame. Hang vintage lithographs, such as floral prints. Tack them to the wall with mounting putty or place them in small frames and hang them as you normally would. You can find mounting putty online or in your local craft store., If you bought an interesting antique frame but haven't found a painting or print to fill it, try displaying the frame by itself. You can choose to paint it a new color or keep the original paint job/finish. Consider making it the centerpiece of an arrangement among paintings or prints., With a little imagination, the possibilities with old shutters are endless. Prop three or four behind the couch or chairs to create a sense of texture on an otherwise smooth wall. Fasten them to the walls if you choose not to place furniture in front of them.On the other hand, you can hang one or two shutters horizontally over the kitchen table to organize mail or display postcards., If your kitchen is largely white, hang vintage copper pots and pans to create a rustic feel.On the other hand, if you prefer a more modern approach, hang vintage enamelware. You could also paint metal cookware with bolder colors. Go with colors that are in the same family as your wall color or aim for a more dynamic look by choosing contrasting colors."
"
Group smaller objects together.,
Create a symmetrical arrangement.,
Make a salon-style arrangement.,
Arrange objects on horizontal surfaces.",How to Decorate with Vintage Artwork3," Do this if you don't have any large objects to complement them. Use objects that have something in common—color scheme, pattern, subject matter, etc. Arrange them in a manner that both shows off their variety and unifies them as a single work of art.For example, imagine you have three small vintage posters featuring forms of transportation. One depicts a car; another depicts a train; the final one depicts an airplane. Look at each poster's use of line, shape, and color. If the airplane poster has more vertical lines than the other two, hang that one in the center., Choose this option if you have an even number of objects with similar dimensions. Imagine a vertical line in the center of the arrangement. If you have a laser level or painter's tape, let that be your vertical axis. Then, start arranging your hangings on each side of the line in a mirror-image fashion. Make sure your artworks are evenly spaced.For example, let's say you have two rectangular paintings and two smaller square paintings. You would place the two paintings immediately to either side of the vertical axis. After that, you would hang each square painting on either free side of the rectangular ones.

, Choose this option if you have several objects of different sizes. Use the largest or most prominent object as the center of the arrangement. Position it at eye level. Group the smaller objects around it in some kind of logical fashion.

For example, if you have a mixture of round and rectangular vintage prints, try alternating each shape., Spruce up an nightstand, mantle, or desk with sculptures or two-dimensional art. Lean framed paintings, prints, or photographs against the wall as an eye-catching backdrop. Frame these two-dimensional works with lamps, flower vases, or antique bookends. Place small sculptures, candles, or mantle clocks in front of them."
"
Center large objects at eye level.,
Arrange objects on the floor first.,
Map out your arrangement.,
Hang the objects.",How to Decorate with Vintage Artwork4," Eye level is about 60 to 66 inches (150 to 170 cm) from the floor. If you hang your art too high or too low, you and other viewers can overlook it. Place your artwork at a central point above your couch, table, or other location that will draw people's attention., The last thing you want to do is create more holes in the wall than you need. Lay your intended objects on the floor. Then, take the time to figure out an appealing, eye-catching pattern to hang them in., Cut out pieces of kraft paper in the same sizes and shapes as each object you want to hang. Place them on the wall in the same arrangement you planned on the floor. Make sure you space all of your objects the same distance apart. When each piece of paper is level, secure it with painter's tape., On the craft paper, mark the spot where the nail for each wall hanging must go. Then, drive the nail through the paper template. Add a picture hanger, if desired, and gently tear away the craft paper. Finally, install your wall hanging. Repeat this process until the arrangement is complete."

Put a few books on your stair landing (if there is enough room so that they don’t become a tripping hazard)
Place a few books on a bathroom table or shelf if your bathroom is well-ventilated and the books are not valuable.;
,, Put books of the same color on a bookshelf and accent it with a decorative or unusual bookend. For example, shelve 4 or 5 books with purple bindings upright on your bookshelf and place an amethyst crystal or lavender candle at one end to complement the color of the book binding.

, Tie the books together with Jute string or ribbon and stack them on a table.

, The books will be preserved and protected in a climate-controlled environment.

, Place a vase of fresh flowers next to the books.

,, You can also place books in unusable spaces, such as a high, recessed alcove.

, This is one of the only times you can vacuum all of the floor, so it's a good idea to take some time on it.

, Make sure it's a color that will match your personality now and a couple years from now.

,, If you love football, consider a new football-shaped chair, drapes or curtains with footballs, a bedspread with your favorite team logo, and posters with your favorite players. Remember that these are long-term investments, and will be expensive if you replace weekly.

, For fads and passing phases, choose small, inexpensive items. A new mouse pad, stickers, pillowcases, small pictures or posters, and figurines are cheap and easy to replace if you decide you don't like them anymore.

Change the lighting.,
Replace the flooring.,
Repaint the furniture.",How to Do a House Makeover Without a Professional1," No matter the room, changing the color of paint can give a familiar space new life. Use neutral colors like tan, light gray, and off-white if you’re planning on putting up art. If you favor bare walls, try more sophisticated colors like navy or olive. Kids will love rooms painted in vivid blues or greens.Try to match your paint to your furniture. For instance, if your furniture is mostly brown, paint your wall a light brown or a complimentary color like olive or maroon.
To provide a visual center to a room, paint one wall a different color than the rest. For instance, you might want to paint three walls of your bedroom a light gray and paint the fourth a tangerine shade.;
, Interior lighting comes in many different forms. Certain types of lighting work best in the kitchen, while others work best in the living room. For instance, pendant lights look great over the sink.Run some rope lights beneath the edges of floor-level cabinets in the bathroom and kitchen. Sometimes making over the lighting is as easy as changing a lampshade or a light fixture.

Antique or vintage stores are great places to pick up unique lampshades and lighting fixtures.

, There are multiple options for sprucing up your floor. Install flooring that is flat and smooth in kitchens so that it can be easily cleaned when spills inevitably occur. Tile and natural wooden floors are the best options. Use natural wooden floors in bedrooms, bathrooms, and living rooms.If you want to install carpets or rugs, dark colors will better conceal stains, but lighter colors will make the room feel bigger.
If you already have wooden flooring, consider re-sanding and resealing it.

, Sometimes you can give your old furniture a new lease on life by simply adding a coat of paint. Choose a color that compliments the walls and floor. Alternately, consider stripping the paint off your furniture, sanding it down, and resealing it for a beautiful, natural look.Instead of repainting, wrap your furniture in wallpaper. This allows you to create unique patterned furniture.

Find ways to save.,
Use furniture to conceal ugly fixtures.",How to Do a House Makeover Without a Professional2," Decluttering the space will help make your rooms look bigger, brighter, and more beautiful. The process by which you declutter a particular room will vary depending on the amount of clutter in the room. Start by stepping out of the room and getting a good look at it.Ask yourself questions about the various items in the room like, “Do I still need or want this item?”
Walk through the room and consider each item. Ask yourself if it brings you joy. If it does not bring you joy and does not have a practical use, donate it to a thrift store or a give it to a friend.

For a minimalist look, paint your chairs white or light gray., If you have bare wooden cabinets, consider sanding them down and painting them. If you have painted cabinets, paint them a different color or strip the paint off them for a natural look. Avoid ripping out your cabinets, as it will be far cheaper to simply refurbish your existing cabinets than to install new ones.Use light colors like white to make your kitchen feel bright and open.
Two-tone cabinets can look great if you choose two complimentary colors, but they will take more work, since you’ll have to first paint the old cabinets or install new cabinets, then paint the trim on them with a second color.
The best cabinets are made of solid wood, not pressboard.

, A backsplash is a series of tiles that climb up the wall between the kitchen counter and the bottom of the cabinets. It typically ends along the vertical line that marks the edge of a window or cabinet, whichever is furthest along the wall of your kitchen. Pick out tiles for a backsplash that matches or compliments your cabinets. Plan the layout of your backsplash carefully, then apply the tile adhesive to your wall and press the tiles into place.Some people choose to place a backsplash only above their sink, rather than all the way around their kitchen.

Fold the washcloth into an envelope.,
Secure a rubber band crosswise around the middle.,
Wrap a rubberband lengthwise around the washcloth.,
Shape the wings with your fingers.,
Wrap a pipe cleaner around the visible, crosswise rubber band.,
Decorate the butterfly with stickers or pieces of pipe cleaner, if desired.",How to Fold Towel Butterflies1," Take a square washcloth and fold all four corners in towards the center. The point of each corner should meet in the middle.The washcloth can have sharp or rounded corners; the corners won’t be seen.;
, Bunch up the middle of the folded washcloth with one hand, keeping the folded-in corners together in the middle where you’ve placed them. With your other hand, wrap a rubber band a couple of times around the middle to secure the bunch in place.This should leave you with a bow tie shape.
How many times you wrap the rubber band depends on how big of a rubber band you have. Wrap it until it is no longer loose – but not so tight that it might snap.

, Pinch the outside edges of the “wings” in the middle, and push them inwards towards the first rubber band. Hold the new bunch in place with one hand as you secure a rubber band around it with your other hand., Now you should see butterfly really taking shape. Use your fingers to lightly push and tug the wings to fluff and shape them to your liking., Place the washcloth on top of the middle of the pipe cleaner, so that the butterfly’s antennae will be even. Twist the ends of the pipe cleaner twice at what is now the “head” of the butterfly. Bend each antenna down a bit., If you don’t intend for the washcloth to be used, you can add stickers or decorations with glue. For example, cut off bits of pipe cleaner and glue them onto the wings like polka dots. You can use fabric glue or a hot glue gun.


For example, try gluing jeweled stickers or craft puff balls onto the wings!
If you decorate the butterfly with pieces of pipe cleaner, make sure you turn any sharp ends inwards and downwards before gluing so that they don’t stick out.
Make sure to follow all instructions and safety precautions when using hot glue.

,, First, find a medium rectangular picture in a frame. It could be a family picture, or even a famous painting by Van Gogh or Monet. Whatever image you feel would match the setting of the room, put it in the center. This will add a nice old fashioned, but somewhat modern look to your living room.

, These pictures should be fairly smaller than the center piece, but not tiny. They should also have frames.

, First, start with the left side. Find a candle in a fancy dish or display. Put that in the corner. Right beside the candle, place a small statue or figurine. Remember, this piece does not have to be fragile or expensive. It could be a little knick-knack you picked up at the dollar store. As long as it's pretty with colorful design.

, Do the same thing to the right side as you did to the left side, but this time the things don't have to be exactly the same. For example, instead of a big candle you could use a small candle, and if you put an angel figurine on the left side and you don't have another angel figurine, you could improvise and use a small wooden animal.

, Spray your favorite air freshener, relax in an armchair or sofa, grab the remote, and flip the TV on. Congratulations, you have decorated your mantel and made it look beautiful! You deserve to kick back and relax!

Fold and bunch a bath towel crosswise.,
Roll a washcloth to make the “body.” Roll up a washcloth so that it is tight and pointy on one end, and thick/bunchy on the other.,
Decorate the butterfly.",How to Fold Towel Butterflies2," Place the towel on the bed or other surface where you want it to lay. Bring the two long ends of the bath towel together so that it’s folded crosswise. Then bunch the folded towel together crosswise in the middle. Fluff the “wings” with your hands.Use a colorful bath towel if you want a colorful butterfly! The bath towel will form the wings.

, Tuck the edge of the washcloth into the thick end to form the head. Lay the rolled washcloth on top of the bath towel, in the middle.No binding is necessary, as the towels are stacked loosely on top of each other so they can be readily used.
Due to size, the best place to lay your butterfly towel is on the guest’s bed. However, you may also lay it on a large desk, counter or armchair.

, Use your imagination to decorate the butterfly however you like. For example, take a bit of string and tie a knot on each end. Loop the string through the head of the butterfly (or simply lay it down underneath the head) for antennae. Use eye and mouth stickers, if desired.

Decorate further, if desired.",How to Fold Towel Butterflies3," You can use food coloring or liquid water colors. Use a small bowl for each color, or put a different color in each compartment of an ice cube tray!Spread out old towels or a vinyl tablecloth to protect the work surface.

, Use paint brushes or eyedroppers to apply color to the paper towels. If you want more vivid color (and aren’t worried about cleanup), fold each paper towel (at least twice) into a square. Then dip each corner into a different color. Allow any excess water to drop back into the container.Don’t soak the paper towel too deeply or for very long or it will get overly saturated.
The towels don’t have to be completely colored – some white areas will look great, too!
This is a good time to explain color mixing while children observe and experiment.

, Open each paper towel, if you had them folded. Spread out the towels on a sunny sidewalk or driveway, or nearby a fireplace (not too close!). Let them sit until they are totally dry to the touch.


You may want to flip them over once if they don’t seem to be drying completely.
You can use a hairdryer to help the towels dry.
If it’s a windy day, either dry the paper towels indoors or make sure to weigh the corners down.

, Bunch the middle of the towel together. Wrap a twist tie or pipe cleaner around the middle and wrap it a couple of times. Fluff out the wings gently with your hands.


If you want the wings to have more definition, fold the paper towel accordion-style before bunching it together in the middle. Fold one outer edge to form a thin rectangle. Then flip the towel over and fold the rectangle back onto itself. Flip the towel again and repeat until it’s completely pleated.

, If you wrapped pipe cleaner around the middle, simply bend or curl the ends to make the antennae. Otherwise, you can make them out of bendy straws! Attach two straws to the middle of each butterfly, and secure them with tape or hot glue., Add stickers for eyes, such as googly eye stickers! Use your imagination and add whatever decorations you like – for example, buttons, puff balls, or colorful stickers. Attach your decorations with hot glue or a bit of double-sided tape.

Use 12-inch (30.5 cm) hardboard siding (sometimes called Masonite) ripped down to 6-inch (15 cm) strips in 16-ft. (4.8 meter) lengths.,
Slice off sod with a sod cutter, then dig out the rest of the sidewalk path to a depth of 6 inch (15 cm).,
Start thinking about drainage issues at this point.,
Pound in two stakes about 1 ft. (30.5 cm) from the ends of the form positions.,
Space and level in the opposite form sides using a homemade gauge board—just a 1x4 that’s a few inches longer than the width of the sidewalk.,
Pack the underlying soil with a plate compactor (rent one).,
For a long-lasting sidewalk, plan on a base of gravel under 4 in.,
Steel mesh with expansion strips prevents heaving, cracking and buckling in cold climates.,
Hold the mesh 2 in.",How to Build Forms for a Curving Concrete Sidewalk," (Full-service lumberyards and home centers carry all this forming material.) Flex it to the desired shape of your sidewalk and stake it down. Use marking paint to mark the ground next to the form.;
, Dig out about 3 inch (7.6 cm) wider on both sides of the paint marks to leave room for forms. Set aside some topsoil to fill against the forms and sidewalk later.

, If water tends to collect in the yard in spots, you may want to elevate the walk in those areas, so don’t dig as deeply there. Long, flat areas should have one side of the sidewalk lower so water can drain off the side. In most cases, make the top of the finished walk even with the (freshly cut) top of the grass for easy mowing and a neat, clean appearance. The bottom of the trench will be about 6 inch (15 cm) below grade to allow for 4 in. of gravel below the 4-in. thick slab of concrete.

, Screw the forms to the inside of the stakes with a couple of 1-1/4 inch (2.5 cm - 3.5 cm) drywall screws. Bend the forms to make smooth curves, anchoring them with more stakes every 3 ft. Keep the tops of the forms about 1 inch (2.5cm) above the cut grass height for easy mowing and a nice appearance.

, Screw short blocks onto the bottom spaced the same width as the sidewalk. Use this gauge board to position the forms and stakes to keep a consistent width the entire length of the sidewalk. Rest a 4-ft. (1.22 meters) level on top of the gauge board to keep forms level from side to side. For better drainage in long, level areas, drop this side about 1 in.

, It’s important to uniformly pack the entire base (including the sides near the forms).

, of concrete. If you live in a frost-free climate with a natural sand base with good drainage, you can pour right on top of the sand. But other soil types will expand and contract with weather conditions and can crack overlying concrete. Gravel protects concrete from these shifting conditions. Spread gravel 4 in. deep between the forms. Pack dirt against the outside and gravel against the inside of forms to add support when pouring and to achieve smooth curves. It’s not necessary to compact the gravel.

, Cut off the stakes flush with the tops of the forms. Park a helper on the end of the reinforcing mesh for ballast and unroll the mesh, holding it down with your feet. Cut it to length with a pair of bolt cutters. Flip the mesh over and pull one end toward the other to back-bend it slightly to eliminate the natural curl. Cut the edges of the mesh at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) back from the forms. Overlap mesh layers at least 6 inch (15 cm) and tie them together.

Go Victorian with velvet curtains.,
Try velvet wallpaper.,
Don't go overboard.",How to Decorate Your Home with Velvet1," Curtains are a great way to add velvet to your space. Velvet will block out light well, making it a functional option. In addition, it can also lend a Victorian air to a room, depending on the style and color you go with. If you want something more understated, choose white so the velvet doesn't stand out quite as much., An even bolder choice than curtains is velvet wallpaper. Stick to a solid color if you want the effect to be more subtle. If you want it more bold, try a a velvet wallpaper with an interesting pattern. Your guests won't be able to resist touching it!, Velvet is a rich fabric that can look luxurious and add texture to a room. However, it shouldn't be the only fabric you use, as it can easily be too much. Add other textures and fabrics to every room, as it will give the rooms more depth and interest.Plus, since velvet is expensive, you can be kind to your wallet by not using it everywhere.

Use velvet throw pillows.,
Add it to the dining room.,
Go all-out with a sofa.,
Add an accent chair.",How to Decorate Your Home with Velvet2," Using velvet in throw pillows is a great way to dip into this fabric without going overboard. A few pillows won't break the bank, and you can decide if you like the fabric or not. Plus, you can even do it yourself by making covers out of velvet for pillows you already have.Even just a touch of velvet can make the whole room seem more sophisticated.
Another option is a velvet throw tossed over the arm of a couch.

, Another place to squeeze in a little velvet is in the dining room. Try covering your chair cushions in velvet for a luxurious effect. Alternatively, add velvet pillows to larger chairs, making them more comfy for your guests., If you really love velvet, consider making it the focal point of your living room with a velvet sofa. The fabric feels great when you're lounging around, plus it's able to hide stains fairly easily. All-in-all, it can add a whole lot of glam to your space without you having to give up comfort.Keep in mind, though, that velvet is not a great fabric to have around kids. Because it has a nap, it will hold onto things like peanut butter and other sticky spills., An accent chair in velvet can make a statement without being quite as overwhelming as a full sofa in velvet. Plus, a high-backed armchair in velvet lends a classy air to the room, as it's a truly traditional look. In fact, if you find an old, much-loved armchair, you can have it reupholstered in your favorite color of velvet.If an accent chair is too much, consider just an ottoman or other small piece in velvet.

Add a velvet bed skirt.,
Use a velvet headboard.,
Throw it on top of your bed.",How to Decorate Your Home with Velvet3," One place to add velvet is around the base of your bed. You could add a bed skirt for a more traditional look. Alternatively, cover a box springs or base in velvet for a more contemporary, clean look. Either way, the velvet will add a touch of sophistication.As an added bonus, you may not need a frame if you cover your box springs in velvet. The velvet will give it a clean, finished look.

, A headboard is a great place to use velvet. It's a soft fabric that creates a comfortable, yet luxurious look. Plus, it makes a statement in your bedroom without covering the whole room in velvet, which can be a little overwhelming., You can also add velvet accents on top of your bed. A velvet throw at the foot of the bed can add a pop of color. Alternatively, you can use a few velvet throw pillows to accent your bed or a chair in the room. Both add just enough velvet to the room without drawing too much attention to the fabric."

Learn about the basic design mixes used in concrete production.,
Learn about the characteristics of the concrete you will be using.,
Understand the different colors available in concrete products.,
Look at the many different types of finishes that can be executed on concrete.,
Talk to local professionals for help determining the concrete you will need for your product.,
Read plans and specifications if you are following an engineered construction plan for your project.,
Use the above information to decide the type of concrete mix best suited for your project.",How to Choose Concrete for a Project," There are many different types, strengths, and compositions of concrete, each with characteristics that make them perform better for different applications. Here are a few examples:


Strength is usually determined by compression testing, and is expressed in Pounds per Square Inch (PSI). Normal concrete mixes range from 2500 PSI to 5000 PSI, with engineered design mixes of over 10,000 PSI used in specialized applications. Lower strengths are also available for grouts, but since these are usually used for displacement, block-fill, and filling abandoned utility lines, we won't spend much time on these products. Here are some common uses for different strength concretes. Note that these are not exclusive, as designers and structural engineers may spec different uses in specialized construction projects.

2500PSI concrete may be used in driveways, walkways, and even floor slabs on grade. This concrete is usually the cheapest available from batch plants. Used on solidly compacted fill material (subgrade), this concrete performs satisfactorily for these projects, but many professional concrete workers prefer a higher strength product due to warranty concerns, and some building codes may not allow its use for all of these applications.
3000PSI concrete in many locations is a standard multipurpose mixture for general use in construction. It is durable, has sufficient cement to give it good finishing characteristics, and can be placed fairly wet without sacrificing quality.
3500PSI concrete is used for applications where surface spalling is not acceptable, and significant loading is expected. One example would be paving curbs, where heavy traffic may drive on the surface. Other uses include building footings, bond beams, grade beams, and floor slabs where heavy loads may be moved or stored.
4000PSI concrete is used for heavy traffic pavement, heavy use floor slabs like shops and warehouses, and concrete footings designed to support heavy loads.
5000PSI and higher concrete mixes are usually used for specialized construction projects where high impact resistances, very low wear rates, or extreme conditions are expected.


Special mixes. Concrete can be mixed using different types of aggregates that give it different qualities that may make it more suited for the project. Here are examples:

Pump mixes are especially designed to make placement with a mechanical pump through a high pressure hose possible with a minimal chance of blockages. They can be pumped wetter than other mixes, and may have smaller large aggregates than standard mixes.
Exposed aggregate mixes are designed so that when the finished grout surface is removed by sandblasting or water washing while the concrete is very green (not cured), a uniform layer of similarly sized aggregate is exposed. River rock, smooth gravel, or graded crushed limestone aggregate are mixed in this mixture at a higher than normal ratio.
Entrained air mixtures have air added in the production process, so that tiny air bubbles are created in the finished material. This allows more expansion in the concrete without cracking, making it perform better in projects that are exposed to great differences in temperature.
Flexible concretes are used for large paving projects, and achieve structural strength without large amounts of reinforcing, thereby reducing material and installation costs. These mixes are describe according to their flexible strength, for example, 650, 750, and 850 flex.

;
, There are several different characteristics you need to understand to make sure your concrete is placed and finished correctly. Here are some of them:


Slump. This is a measure of how plastic the concrete condition can be when it is placed. Slump is measured by filling a conical metal mold with the concrete, rodding it in stages to ensure it is consolidated thoroughly in the mold. The mold is then carefully removed by lifting it off, and the distance the concrete slumps is measured. If the concrete falls 4 inches (10.2 cm), it is considered a ""4 inch (10.2 cm) slump"". Design mixes usually have a recommended slump range to yield optimal performance, and adding too much water, while increasing the slump and making the concrete easier to pour, can greatly reduce the strength of the finished concrete.
Fly ash content. Fly ash is an industrial by-product used to supplement the Portland cement in may design mixes. It decreases the production cost of the finished material, and makes repairing spalling and other surface imperfections easier. It also slows the setting speed of the concrete, allowing more time to work the material during the finishing process.

Chemical admixtures. There are many chemical products that can be added to concrete that enhance certain performance characteristics of concrete. Plasticizers make concrete very fluid to allow placing it in tight form confines, or where the reinforcing makes it difficult to get good fill during placing. Water reducing mixtures decrease the amount of water required to improve its workability without effecting strength, and shrinkage reducing admixtures reduce the need for expansion and construction joints where these are undesirable.



, Most people picture concrete as a drab, grey material, but many integrally colored concretes are available, ranging from pure white, to blues, reds, browns, and almost any other color you can imagine. Finished concrete can also be acid-etched, stained, or coated with epoxies or shakes to give unique effects if so desired.

, Plain, smooth finishes are accomplished by floating and troweling the concrete, and by and large, this is the most common method of concrete finishing. Other methods are available, including the following:


Broom finishing is done, as the name implies, with a broom while the cement paste on the surface is still workable. Brooming is a good option for areas like sidewalks and driveways, where traction is needed.
Salt finishing is done by sprinkling rock salt on the still workable cement paste surface. This are then floated or troweled down into the surface before they dissolve, and once they have dissolved they leave a pock-marked surface that when properly done gives a unique, distinctive appearance and good traction.
Exposed aggregate, mentioned earlier, is done by washing or sandblasting the cement paste surface to expose the rock underneath. When done with uniformly colored and size aggregate, this can be a very attractive finish.
Embossed concrete is done with special templated rollers or grids which are stamped or pushed into the cement paste while it is still workable.

, Local Ready Mix concrete suppliers should have sales people or product representatives who can recommend the best material to use for the project you are planning. This is especially useful since specific conditions may make products used in one region completely unsuited for another region.

, A structural engineer with experience in concrete design often produces specifications on the exact design mix needed for good performance.

, To make sure the concrete performs well in its application, you also need to do your homework on three other items of consideration in building with concrete.


Form the concrete correctly, making sure the forms are level or plumb where applicable, and rigidly constructed to avoid deflection or failure. Using strong materials and sufficient bracing is critical to successful concrete placement.
Make sure the reinforcing material is correctly installed. If you are using rebar, tying and supporting it in the correct position is necessary for it to give the desired strength. Rebar that is not completely encased in the concrete can also corrode, causing damage to the concrete structure itself.
For on grade slabs, make sure the subgrade is structurally sufficient to support the weight of the concrete and other elements of your building. You may have to remove unstable material and replace it with structural fill to achieve the desired load-bearing threshold your project requires.

Allow your concrete to cure.",How to Build Concrete Steps," Each step consists of two main parts: a riser, which is the vertical part of step, and the tread, which is the part you step on. Other important terms to know when building your stairs include:


The pitch line, which measures the sharpness of the angle of your steps from the lip of the bottom stair to the lip of the topmost step.
The rise, which is the total height of your stair from its base to the topmost step.
The run of your stairs, which is the depth of your stair measured from the front of your stair to its back.
The stringers of your stairs are the side supports to either side of each step. The measurements for your stringers will be used in the creation of your concrete forms.;
, First you'll need to find the total rise of your stairs, which can be found by measuring the total height from the planned base to the higher level/floor you are building up to. Then:


Measure the run of the steps by finding the distance between the frontmost and backmost part of the stair.
Find the width of your stairs by measuring the distance between the leftmost and rightmost bounds of your planned steps., You can do this by dividing the rise (total height) of your stairs and dividing that number by the riser height (the height of each step). The building code in some states sets the maximum riser height at 8.25"" (21 cm), but you should be sure to check your local building code to prevent building stairs that violate state code or local ordinances.


If this number comes out as a decimal, you must round up to the next whole number.
If your stairs are built so the topmost tread is a step below the level/floor you are building up to, the number of treads you need will be one less than the number of risers.
There are many online sites that offer simple step calculators to simplify this process. You should be able to find these through a general Internet search for a ""stair calculator."" These calculators will help you determine the exact specifications of your steps, including the number of treads, height of each riser, stringer length, pitch line, and so on., The depth of each tread (step) is a little more flexible, but each should be at least 11 inches (27.9 cm) to accommodate both large and small feet. To find the height of each riser you should:


Divide the total rise (height) by the number of risers. Generally, you should round the riser height of your steps to the nearest 1/16"" (1.6 mm), The stringers of your stairs will form the angled, side parts of your form on either side of your stair. To find the length of your stringers multiply your total rise by itself. Then multiply the total run by itself. After that you'll need to:


Add the rise multiplied by itself and the run multiplied by itself together, and then take the square root of that number. Finally, find the angle of your stringers by taking inverse sine (sin-1) of your total rise divided by the length of your stringers.
It may be easiest to use a calculator, phone, or online calculator to find the length and angle of your stringers. The square root symbol will look like a check mark or a check mark with a horizontal top (√)., Now that you know the general dimensions of your steps, you can stake out the area you will be building your steps. Hammer a wooden stake into the ground at each corner of the base of your stairs.









To make sure that your stakes are evenly lined up, run a length of string between the stakes around the perimeter and use the string to verify your stakes are aligned properly.
Not running a line between your stakes to keep alignment can lead to more work on your part. In the worst case scenario, a poorly aligned perimeter can result in a slanted/angled finished product., You'll need to use a shovel to dig 4 - 8"" (10.2 - 20.3 cm) below the ground level of the base of your stair. Dig within the boundary of the string you've set up to prevent digging any more than you have to.


This excavation is intended clear away rocks, trees, grass, shrubs, and anything else that might interfere with your concrete pouring. You'll also have to lay a subbase upon which the concrete will rest.
Since your subbase should be at least 4 - 8"" (10.2 - 20.3 cm) thick, you'll need to dig down at least this far or the rise of your first step will be larger than you plan., Using the dimensions you've taken for your staircase, cut pieces of scrap wood or low-grade lumber so you have a board for the rise for each step and two boards for the stringers (one for each side of your stair form).









Your form should exclude the top and bottom of the entire stair. The ground oriented side of your stringer forms should be cut to meet the pitch line (angle) of your stair, and the top should cut in zigzag fashion to follow the rise and depth of each tread (step).
If you are pouring concrete steps that form a right angle (L-shape), your stringer forms will not need to be cut on an angle. In this case, your stringer will follow the entire run and rise of your stairs.
You should shave a slight angle into the bottom of each rise form board, excluding the bottom riser form board. This way, when you pour your concrete, you'll be able to easily smooth the area in the corners of each step., Use screws and a power drill to attach each riser form board to your stringers. You can do this by laying each stringer form so the even, bottom side of each stringer is flat on the ground and the zigzag side of the stringer is oriented points facing up.









Space your stringers to be approximately the planned width of your stairs apart. Then you can lay the riser form boards along the zigzags of the stringer that matches the upward rise of each step. Now you should be able to easily use your power drill to attach each riser form board to the stringer form boards.
If your stairs form a right angle (L-shape), you should be able to lean them against a sturdy object base down so each stringer form is oriented like a normal stair. You may have to place a board between the stringers to stabilize them until you screw your first riser form board into place.
Be sure there are no gaps in your form and that the boards line up evenly. Any gaps can lead to concrete leaking through your form, and unevenness will result in uneven steps., Your concrete steps will lie upon a subbase of granular fill, like open-grade stone, which will protect your poured concrete steps from shifts in the earth or deterioration. You'll need between 4 - 8"" (10.2 - 20.3 cm) of fill for your subbase.


After placing your subbase, you'll need to tamp it down until it is packed extremely firm, level, and stable. Use a long flat board and a level to check the levelness of your subbase.
Smaller projects can likely be done with a hand tamper, which is essentially a heavy, flat metal plate attached to a wooden handle. Larger projects might require you to use an plate compactor machine.
Failing to lay a sturdy subbase can result in cracking, deterioration, or structural failure in your concrete steps. Your concrete's strength depends on a solid subbase.
You may want to lay a thick gauge wire mesh on top of your subbase to reinforce the concrete you'll be pouring. The idea is, even if your concrete cracks, the mesh will hold it in place so integrity of your stairs is maintained., Fit your stair form into place over the subbase, slotting it into the gap created by the ground level








You may want to give your form a very slight downhill angle. This way, when it rains, the water will run off your steps., Smaller projects, like building a single step, might be possible without special equipment, like a cement mixer. You could mix your concrete by hand in a wheelbarrow, or you could create a mixing box (also called a mortar box) by using scrap/low-grade wood to create a makeshift reservoir where you can mix your concrete., Transfer the concrete into your form with a shovel, wheelbarrow, or (for larger projects) the funnel that came with your cement mixer. If you are using a wheelbarrow, you might construct an earthen ramp so you can wheel your cement up to the lip of the form and tip in the concrete., Lay a screeding tool, like a long trowel or long wooden plank, flat along the top parts of your form and, working from uphill to downhill, work your tool along the form to flatten and smooth the concrete. Once you are finished screeding, your concrete should start looking more like the finished product.


If you use a wooden plank, it should be free of warping and other irregularities. These can leave the surface of your concrete uneven., Floating involves pressing a flat surface along the top of the concrete to cause the ""cream"" (the gravel free part of the concrete) to come to the surface. A bull float tool is ideal for this process, though it might not be necessary for smaller projects.









Smaller projects might only require the use of a handheld magnesium float. These kind of floats are extremely durable, and are designed to slide across the surface of your still-liquid concrete easily.
To use a bull float, push it away from you across the top of the concrete while keeping the back end of the float slightly elevated, then pull the float back towards yourself keeping the front end slightly elevated. Float the entire surface of your concrete thoroughly.
If you have used a bull float, you should use a handheld magnesium float to go over the surface once again when finished. Use long, sweeping motions for best results. At this point, it is not uncommon to see water bleed to the surface of the concrete., Drag a stiff bristled push broom across the surface of your concrete to create fine grooves in the surface. Smooth concrete can be very slippery, which can be especially dangerous for concrete steps.


Use light pressure when doing this; grooves that are too deep will cause water to puddle on the concrete, and could compromise its integrity.
If you notice clumps of cement forming on your broom, this is generally a sign that you are adding traction too soon. Smooth the concrete once more with your handheld magnesium floater, and wait until later to brush your surface., You should always follow the directions the supplies you use, especially since different kinds of concrete will have different specifications. Generally, concrete takes 28 days to fully cure.


You can improve the curing process by applying a concrete sealer after pouring the concrete. Follow the directions on your sealer for best results.
You should be able to remove your forms after a single day. Carefully remove your screws and take apart your form. After a few days, your concrete will be strong enough to walk on, though not fully cured. Enjoy your new concrete steps!

, Form your sidewalk using a rigid, yet flexible piece(s) of material. Thin plywood 1/2"" to 3/4"" is best to use due to its flexibility. Strip plywood into 4"" wide sheets

, The string should also serve as a guide for the form to follow.

, Begin by driving the pin or wood into the ground so the material is not able to easily move. Then nail the face of the form to the pin or wood while at the same time following the string. The top of the form should just touch the string.

, Use a straight blade rake to level out the ground. If possible, compact the ground after fine grading by using a hand tamper or motorized compactor.

, The temperature of the concrete should be between 50°F and 90°F during placement. This can be checked with a standard thermometer.

If you purchase ready-mix concrete, be sure to request an air-entrainment additive. You should look for air-entrainment to be between 4-8%. This will insure that your concrete is able to withstand colder temperatures.

, Use a screed (Straight edge)to remove excess concrete as well as level off the surface. screed in a sliding motion, pulling the screed back and fourth while at the same time moving it along the form.

Concrete likes to crack in squares. Be sure to put score marks or dummy joints in your sidewalk. These should be spaced apart equal to the length. e.g. 4' wide = Dummy Joints should be spaced every 4""/ 5'=5"". Dummy joints should not be spaced more than 6'.
Use a fiberboard expansion material where your concrete meets other structures and every 25' in in your sidewalk.

Lay out the corner positions of the slab using stakes and string lines.,
Measure diagonally on square and rectangular slabs from corner to corner, shifting parallel sides until the diagonal measurements are equal, while the lengths of the sides remain the desired widths.,
Place the form board starting at one corner alongside the string line, staking it down about 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) from the line with sharpened wood stakes.,
Stake 4 inch (10.2 cm) slabs a minimum of 32 inches (81.3 cm) on center, and deep enough to firmly support the form, depending on the stability of the soil beneath the form.,
Pack the soil around the stakes to lean the form in or out if needed to align it with the string line, and if it is necessary, place a gauge block to hold the string clear of the form and gauge the form at frequent intervals to assure the form is straight.

,
Drive another row of stakes behind the form 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) for thicker slabs, and nail a kicker, or 2x4 board from the offset stake to the side of the stake nailed to the form to keep it stable.",How to Build a Straight Form for Concrete," A builder's level is ideal for establishing the grade of the top of concrete, but an inexpensive line level will give decent results on short spans.;
, For simple shapes and small size slabs, this ""working line"" is sufficient, but for complex shapes and large critical layouts, ""batter boards"" should be used so that the established building lines will be available to recheck layout as forming progresses.

, The thickness of the slab will determine the spacing of the stakes, as well as the nominal dimension of the forming lumber. As an example, a 1X4 pine board is usually stiff enough to support a 4 inch (10.2 cm) concrete placement (pour), where an 8 to 12 inch (20.3 to 30.5 cm) slab thickness will require 2 inch (5.1 cm) dimension lumber of a width equal to the height. To insure ease of forming, select straight, flat lumber with minimal knots at the lumberyard.

, For thicker slabs, decrease your stake spacing, a 12 inch (30.5 cm) slab will need to be staked no more than 24 inches (61.0 cm) on center. Nail the forms to the stakes level with and almost touching the string line.

,, When placing the concrete, you may want to restring each side to make sure the weight of the concrete hasn't bowed the form, and these stakes can be wedged out to correct any bows.

, To prepare the existing concrete, clean and roughen the current surface before you begin any other steps. You can use a chemical concrete product that will accomplish both of these goals at the same time.

, Soaking the existing concrete will make it unable to absorb liquid from the new concrete. Failing to follow this step can create a poor bond between the new and existing concrete.

, Make a water concrete mix that is thinner than the package directions. A viscosity similar to paint will work well. Use a stiff brush to apply it to the existing concrete. This step is not a requirement, but it will help create a tighter bond between new and existing concrete. Do not let this slurry coat dry before applying the new concrete.

, Mix the concrete according to package directions. If you are using regular concrete, add a concrete bonding additive to help the old and new concrete join. If you are using a concrete patching product, do not add the bonding additive because it is part of the patching mix.

, Pour your concrete mixture to a level slightly below what you want the final level to be. Do not use a trowel at this point. A rough surface on the first pour will help the final pour to stick better.

, It is available in a pre-mixed form or by buying the separate ingredients in bulk. If you haven't adhered concrete to concrete before, it is a good idea to go with the pre-mixed version, which only requires that you add water.


Buying the raw materials, gravel, Portland cement and sand is considerably cheaper than buying pre-mixed concrete patching. If you are patching a deep hole, you can use 1-inch (2.54-cm) gravel, otherwise, use very fine gravel.
Mix the dry materials in a ratio of 3 parts gravel to 2 parts sand to 1.5 parts cement in a bucket. This is sometimes listed as 3 to 2 to 1. A higher amount of cement will create a stronger material. There will be more of chemical reaction between the cement and water, which will create more crystals and a harder structure.

, You must remove all loose stones, or the bonding agent and cement will not reach the surface of the concrete.

, You can use a blower or a soft brush; wipe away the dirt that is stuck to the surface.

, Sprinkle an even amount of water onto the surface with a hose attachment. Stop adding water before you create standing water on the surface.


This will stop the porous concrete from sucking the moisture out of the bonding agent and concrete bonding material.

, Mix Portland cement, which is available at most hardware stores, with water. Stir the 2 ingredients together until they form the consistency of wet paint.


You can also buy an acrylic bonding agent to use in place of the homemade cement paint. They are made of resin and can be either added to your patching concrete or applied like the cement paint. Follow the instructions on the can or bottle very carefully, as many of the products have different application instructions and drying times.

, Do this right before you plan to pour the new concrete patch onto your old concrete surface.

, Mix it well. Pour the patch into holes and cracks or pour a 3/8-inch (1-cm) layer to flat surfaces.

, Apply it to the surface with a back and forth motion until the pieces of gravel have sunk below the surface. The sand and cement should rise to the surface.

, It will evaporate on its own. For a smoother finish, wait until the concrete is hardening and almost plastic in texture, then apply a smooth back and forth motion with a metal trowel.

Other methods and tools.",How to Bend and Cut Rebar," Rebar can be sharp and is heavy, and can create sparks when being cut. Always wear eye protection, sleeved shirts, long pants, gloves, and sturdy boots when handling rebar.;
, Rebar comes in very long rods (typically 8-20 foot and up to 40 foot in length). Due to it's length, tendency to be covered with mill scale or rust, and overall weight rebar is usually best handled in a large open area with few obstructions. Cutting rebar often creates very hot sparks so make sure the area is clear of flammable materials. The rust and sparks from rebar can ruin clothing so wear something sturdy and old.

, Taking into account the overall length, any overlap (where you might tie it to another piece), and especially the curves can be a bit tricky. You may find that the first few times you bend and cut a piece of rebar it is shorter or longer than you had intended. This is often due to a failure to account for the length of the rebar through the curve. It can be tricky but you'll get the hang of it. Rebar is very easy to mark with wax crayon (if you'd like waterproof marking) or chalk (often handy in art projects where you'd like the marks to wipe off).

, Cutting rebar can be done easily with a metal cutting hacksaw blade. You can also use a reciprocating saw, portable bandsaw, or grinder equipped with a blade suitable for cutting ""mild steel"". Rebar tends to want to roll around when being cut, therefore it is often necessary to step on the bar or have an otherwise steady hold while cutting it. Cut rebar is always hot and/or sharp. Use gloves and caution.

, Now that you have a piece cut to length it is time to bend it. Bending rebar is all about leverage. Place the rebar on the ground. Using a long metal pipe with a large enough internal diameter, place the rebar into the pipe stopping about six inches from the point you'd like to start the bend. Place your foot 6 to 12 inches (15.2 to 30.5 cm) back from where you'd like to bend. Pressing firmly down with your foot, raise the bar off the ground until the bar bends to the angle you'd like. It is often necessary to bend a piece a little at a time if you are trying to get an exact bend

, You can rent simple manual rebar benders at most hardware stores. If you have a lot of cuts to make renting a metal chop saw is often the most efficient way to cut a lot of rebar.

Wax the concrete surface.",How to Acid Stain Concrete," Concrete flooring that has been poured recently (in the last 10 years or so) is more likely to have been smoothed and troweled mechanically. What that means is that even through mechanically troweling the floors creates a nice, smooth top surface, it is too smooth for the acid stain to penetrate through.So, keep that troweling method in mind along with a few other conditions when figuring out if your concrete surface would be a good surface for acid staining:


For concrete surfaces that are older, power-washed, or have been profiled using a machine, the surface of the concrete has to be virtually pristine before adding an acid stain. That means there should be no areas of damage revealing exposed underlying concrete or sand granules. If there are areas that are damaged, those areas are going to absorb the acid stain abnormally, and may cause areas of inconsistent coloring.The concrete slab should be free from waterproofing agents, or muriatic acid. The acid stain reaction cannot occur on surfaces treated with these products.You can usually tell if a concrete surface has a layer of waterproofing by performing a water test. All you do is pour water onto the concrete surface. If the water beads up and does not absorb into the concrete, it’s treated with a waterproofing agent. If the water sinks into the concrete, your concrete should readily absorb acid stain.;
, The current condition of the concrete is one of the biggest factors to consider when acid staining is the current condition of the concrete. An initial questions to ask yourself before staining is, “What’s on the floor now?” Depending on the answer, your concrete surface could be ready for cleaning and a direct acid stain (meaning applying the acid stain directly onto the concrete surface in its current condition), or more floor prep (and possibly a surface modification) before the acid stain application.Some other factors that can affect your acid staining include different flooring material covering the concrete surface, how the concrete surface was troweled, if the concrete has ever been patched or repaired, and if there was carpeting, if the carpet underpad was glued onto the concrete.
The ideal candidates for direct acid staining are usually new construction projects (where nothing has been applied to the concrete floor and it has been kept clean), and exterior projects.
Remodels are harder, as any imperfections left behind from the previous floor covering (tile, linoleum, wood, carpet, laminate, etc.) will show up to some degree in the final acid stained concrete floor.Remodels mostly require more prep work before the acid stain application.

, Sprinkle or spray water in several places on the concrete surface. If the water beads and the color of the concrete doesn’t change in the areas you sprayed, then a barrier (usually a sealer) is present on the concrete surface, and must be removed during the floor prep process.This barrier must be removed because it will prevent the acid stain from even penetrating the concrete surface.


You can remove this barrier by sanding the top layer of the concrete, or applying a micro finish overlay on top of your concrete. These barrier removal steps may also require a combination of chemical cleansers to dissolve any additions made to the concrete's surface.

, Not all concrete surfaces will require this step, but for surfaces that have a chemical barrier on top of the concrete, are too smooth because they were machine troweled, or contain excessive contaminants from previous flooring, may all need some surface modifications. This is when sanding or a micro finish overlay may be required.


Sanding the floor with a high-speed buffer and an 80-grit sanding pad provides a roughened concrete surface that helps ensure maximum adhesion of the acid stain. Sanding also helps to remove superficial contaminants like paint or surfaces stains, while removing the top layer of a sealer. After sanding, the entire floor will feel like sandpaper and the surface debris will all be sanded away.A micro finish overlay is a thin, smooth coat of concrete that resurfaces the floor to cover up defects left behind from previous flooring. This is because any residue from your previous flooring (carpeting glue, nail holes, tile adhesive outlines) can leave a “ghost image” that shows up later in acid staining process.A micro finish overlay is a little more expensive than a direct acid stain, but the resurfacing virtually eliminates all imperfections on the floor, and creates an even, covering over the original concrete that ends up looking a lot like leather.This step could get tricky for someone doing this project by themselves, and may require the professional assistance.

, Once you have made your concrete surface ready for proper acid staining absorption, you need to clean the concrete surface. There are a few different concrete cleaners that can rid your concrete surface of impurities in their own way.


Knowing the differences between these cleaners will allow you to clean your concrete surface with a cleaner best suited for your surface’s deposits.

, A pH cleanser is mild in nature, and are normally used for cleaning indoor concrete surfaces that are already sealed.These pH cleaners can also be used on unsealed exterior or interior concrete that only requires gentle, non-irritating cleaning., These are the most popular types of concrete cleaners. Acidic cleaners are mainly used to get rid of staining, dirt contamination, and other contaminants that can be broken down by its acidic properties.Acidic stains come in ready-to-use applications or more concentrated solutions, and they are applied right onto any area that is affected by contamination. Acidic cleaners sometimes need to be scrubbed into the contaminated areas, and may even require more than one application., Alkaline cleaners are mostly used to get rid of tough stains like oil, grease, or other hard to remove hydrocarbon-based stains.These cleansers are very effective in breaking down oily and greasy contaminates due to the high alkalinity. Alkaline cleansers reap the best results when the cleanser is scrubbed into the concrete stains.A big mistake people make when using this cleanser is not giving it enough time to work its magic and remove the stain. Depending on how bad the oil stain is and how far it has seeped into the concrete, you made need to apply this cleanser many times to fully eradicate the stain. Each application will require a sitting time of approximately 3 hours., Protect your walls from getting acids stain on the bottoms and edges by covering them with masking paper.Cover all exposed walls by pulling the masking paper tightly across the wall (covering the areas closest to the floor), and securing the back of the paper to with wall with double sided tape (a piece of tape taped onto itself, sticky side out, making a loop).


Spread the tape out about every 12 inches to ensure the masking paper is applied evenly.

, For general-purpose cleaning, sweep the floor to pick up any superficial dirt, and then scrub the floor thoroughly with trisodium phosphate (TSP). To scrub the TSP, consider using a machine powered floor scrubber with a heavy duty nylo-grit scrubber designed for aggressive concrete cleaning.Then use an industrial wet vacuum to remove all water and debris.

, Mastic and caulking compounds are incredibly difficult materials to remove from concrete. Use a putty knife or floor scraper to scrape and remove as much of the sticky substances as possible. Then use a chemical concrete chemical stripper to remove whatever leftover residue remains.Apply the cleaning agent to the concrete surface, and allow it to sit for approximately 1 hour, so it has time to soak into the concrete. Then, thoroughly rinse the surface with water, and clean up the water and debris with a wet vacuum.


You can find a concrete chemical stripper at any home improvement store.
Also consider using a poultice to remove mastic substances. To make a poultice, mix a fly ash or hydrated lime with denatured alcohol. This mixture makes a paste that can be added to contaminated areas.After you apply the poultice paste to the areas that have mastic residue, wait for the poultice to dry (close to an hour, maybe more depending on how thick you applied the paste), and then scrape off the now crumbling mastic debris with a putty scraper or stiff brush., It's very important to clean the floor one more time after using all the chemical cleaners, to remove any and all remaining residue. Scrub the concrete surface one more time with TSP, and then follow up once more with a thorough washing and rinsing with clean water.After the final rinsing of the concrete, again, use a wet vacuum to pick up all the remaining water and leftover particles.

, Remember to use goggles, gloves and a ventilation mask while working with concrete acid stain. A activated charcoal respirator may be your best defense against fumes, especially with staining concrete in areas of poor ventilation, like basements.However, even basements should be has well ventilated as possible, using fans and open windows to circulate and draw in fresh air.


Also consider wearing a long sleeve shirt and pants, combined with knee guards, in case you have to get on your hands and knees.

, The acid stain mixture contains strong chemicals and fumes, so be sure to mix the stain somewhere outside, or in an area that has adequate ventilation. Pour the mixed acid stain into a plastic pump. Usually a two-gallon pump is sufficient, but be sure that it is made completely of plastic. It is important that the applicator or spray wand is also made of plastic rather than metal, because hydrochloric acid (one of the key ingredients in the acid stain), corrodes metal very easily.For floors that have been troweled and smoothed out by hand, dilute the acid stain with a 1:4 ratio of 1 part acid stain to 4 parts water.For floors that have been troweled by a machine, (which are mostly industrial or commercial flooring), the acid stain mixture will be more concentrated, with a 1:1 ratio of one part acid stain to one part water.When mixing and diluting the acid stain, you need to pour the acid into the water rather than pouring the water into the acid. This is because acids release a lot of heat when mixed with water. The water is added to the acid so you can start with a very diluted and weak acid mixture instead of adding water to the acid, and starting with a very strong acid mixture., Always apply a test sample of stain to a small, inconspicuous area of the concrete to be treated. Because so many variables can affect the final color, that’s the only way to get an accurate preview of the finished look, and even then, the final outcome might look a bit different.

, Normally, the most effective and efficient way to apply acid stain to concrete is to use a sprayer. A sprayer helps to evenly coat the concrete surface while providing quick and complete coverage. It also helps to avoid creating puddles with the stain by spraying a large area at a time rather than smaller, more concentrated areas.The spraying container you use must to be made out of plastic, and have plastic parts (like the spraying tip). That’s because the hydrochloric acid in the acid stain is highly corrosive to metal, and can cause a dangerous acidic reaction while ruining your sprayer.Start your spraying in a rear corner of the room so you can spray the entire floor and walk out of the area without walking on top the acid. Spray the acid stain with the spraying wand about a foot and a half above the ground. Consider using figure 8 patterns to spray the acid stain randomly but evenly, to thoroughly coat the floor with the stain. When you apply the acid stain, the lime deposits in the concrete are what react with the acid, giving the flooring its different coloring.Let the first coat of acid completely dry (about an hour) before adding a second coat. You can stop applying acid after the second coat, or keep adding coats until you get the coloring you want.
Be very careful when walking around the stained area. Footprints from stepping in acid stain and then walking on unstained concrete can leave “burn” marks in the concrete (basically acid stains of shoe prints).Acid resistant spiked shoes (similar to soccer or golf shoes, and made with acid resistant stainless steel), are really helpful for walking around during the acid staining process, because they leave minimal shoe markings on the floor. The spikes cover less area, making foot prints a lot less visible and easier to blend into the rest of the acid stain.Don't expect color consistency or perfection. Variations are inherent in the staining process.

, Wait until the chemical reaction of the acid stain is complete before you neutralize the staining. It generally takes a minimum of 3 to 4 hours after applying the acid stain for the full chemical reaction to take place. The neutralizing solution is a 4:1 ratio mixture of four parts water and one part ammonia. Spray this neutralizing mixture on the floor using a plastic pump sprayer like you did with the acid stain. After spraying the neutralizing solution, the floor will look like you are washing away the acid stain. Don't be alarmed, this is just the stain residue. The acid will have already reacted with the concrete. To scrub and properly neutralize the floor, use a broom that has stiff bristles (perhaps a broom with medium bristles - not too soft not too hard), or a slow-speed floor scrubber, and work the neutralizing solution across the entire concrete surface.You may need to perform many scrubbings to fully neutralizer the surface, especially if the acid stain used was a darker color.

, Use a clean mop or a big push brush with soft bristles to wash the floor and scrub off any extra water and neutralizing agent. Then, use a shop vacuum to immediately suck up the residue from the floor before it has time to dry. After you vacuum up the water and residue with the shop vacuum, you should have a general idea of how the acid coloring will look on the concrete. Allow the floor to dry completely before you add on your sealer.At this point in the process, there’s not really a way to make touch ups to the floor. You will have an idea of how the finished floor will look, but until you add the sealer, the final product is still unpredictable.


If there is any remaining amount of moisture on the floor before the solvent-based sealer is applied, the concrete will have a cloudy haze covering the entire floor. This haze can only be removed by stripping the sealer and reapplying.One of the easiest ways to check if the floor is moist is to use blue painters tape. Try to stick the tape to the floor. If the tape sticks, the floor is thoroughly dried. If not, the floor is still moist and needs more time to dry., Apply a sealer to seal in the acid stain and add a layer of protection to your concrete flooring. Adding a sealer can also help boost the appearance of the acid stain coloring.For interior acid staining projects, film-forming sealers (sealers that provide a protective top coat on the concrete surface) are the kind most often used. However, there are several different types of these sealers, and each type has its own benefits and restrictions., These sealers include silanes, siloxanes, and silicates. These are mostly used on outdoor concrete surfaces because they provide excellent protection from harsh, outdoor weather conditions. , Acrylic sealers are used on both indoor and outdoor concrete surfaces. These types of sealers help bring out color from stained surfaces, and usually dry within an hour after application. They are available in both solvent-based and water-based formulas, but the solvent-based acrylics generally heighten color appearance better than their water-based counterparts. When acrylic sealers are used on indoor surfaces, they usually need many coats of wax (to act as a barrier), preventing scuffs from shoes and floor traffic.Acrylics normally wear faster than polyurethanes and epoxies.

, Polyurethane sealers are used mostly in places like restaurants or entryways because of their durable resistance to things like shoe markings and stains. These sealers come in a wide variety of shine levels, and have a clear finish once they dry., Epoxies (which normally consist of a mixture of two highly protective compounds) form an extremely defensive coating on concrete surfaces.Since epoxies tend to yellow when exposed to UV rays, they tend to be confined to indoor concrete surfaces.


Epoxies give a long lasting, durable finish while also being extremely water resistant. However, because of their nonporous nature, epoxies can sometimes trap water and moisture within the concrete., Rather than applying one heavy coat of sealer, apply many thin coats.Sealers can be applied with either an applicator sprayer, or paint roller, but using a spray tends to be the easiest application method. If you use a sprayer, avoid spraying too much in one area and creating small pools of sealer. If you used a paint roller, push the sealer on the floor rather than pulling it. Pulling the paint roller will result in streaks across the concrete. Allow adequate drying time (normally about 1 hour) before adding addition coats of sealer. However, a second coat of the sealer must be applied within four hours of applying the first coat. After four hours of sitting time, the first coat of sealer is too hard for the second coat to bond properly.


If you use a sprayer to apply your sealer, consider using a cone-shaped spray tip rather than a fan-shaped spray tip.Allow a minimum of 4 hours before subjecting the surface to foot traffic. Within 3-4 days, the sealer will be fully dried and ready for everyday wear and tear.

, To protect the sealant, it’s best to apply a wax finish on top of the concrete flooring. The easier way to apply wax to the acid stained floor is using a mop and a mop bucket. Pour the wax into a mop bucket, wring out the mop so it's not dripping with wax, and then apply the wax on the concrete in figure 8 patterns.After you apply the first coat of wax and wait about a half hour for it to dry, you can take down all the parchment paper you used to protect the bottoms of the walls.


If the masking paper pieces fall on a concrete floor that has just been sealed, hasn't had time to dry, and hasn't been waxed yet, they can stick to the floor practically like glue. However, if the pieces of parchment paper have the chance to fall on the wax coating, they can be picked up right away.Normally within an hour of applying the final wax coating, you should be able to walk on the concrete surface. However, you should wait at least 24 hours before you move any furniture onto the freshly waxed surface. The longer the wax gets to settle on the floor, the harder and more protective it becomes.Supplementary wax coats are usually applied every three to six months to ensure the finish continues to look its best."

Float your concrete after it is placed and rodded off with a straight-edge or screed board.,
Finish the concrete according to your own requirements or the requirements of the project design.
,
Barricade the area around the concrete to prevent passersby from stepping into it (which could ruin your finished project) and allow it to set and cure.,
The technique to properly cure horizontal poured concrete, so will set over time to maximum strength and integrity, is to prevent the water added and mixed with the concrete in the barrow from evaporating away from the newly poured and troweled slab or other surface.,
An alternative to mixing with a shovel and wheelbarrow is to mix in a standard five gallon bucked using a mixing drill with a ""whip"" attachment.",How to Use Prepackaged Concrete Mix," Multiply the length times the width times the depth of the space you need to fill. This will tell you give a cubic size, or volume, of concrete that you need. Next, divide the volume (in cubic feet, meters, etc.) by the package yield of the material you are using. Typically, premixed concrete comes in 20, 40, and 80 pound bags, with the 80 pound bag yielding about 0.6 cubic foot of concrete.;
, Place any reinforcing steel, and generally speaking, be ready for your concrete., Here are a few examples of different mixtures commonly available:


3000 PSI (pounds per square inch) compressive strength, gravel, sand, and Portland cement mixture. This is a basic, inexpensive concrete suitable for most repairs, as well as for setting posts and poles.
4000 PSI mixture is for repairing or building structural concrete like sidewalks or driveways, where extra strength will increase the durability of the finished surface.
5000 PSI quick-setting concrete is a very strong mixture with a higher ratio of Portland cement to fine and coarse aggregates, typically used where quick-setting is desirable and higher strength may be needed.

Sand mix contains no gravel or stone (coarse aggregate) and is used for grouting or topping, where a smoother surface is desired.
Other mixes include premixed mortars, non-metallic non-shrink grouts and high-strength early (high early) concrete. These are specialty mixes for specific purposes not covered in this article.

, See ""Things You'll Need"" below for a complete list, but these will include your dry concrete mix, clean water, a shovel, and a container for mixing.

, Wheelbarrows (as in the pictures) are ideal for mixing small quantities of concrete. Avoid spilling the dry material on finished surfaces or lawn grasses, and keep upwind if possible to avoid breathing dust from this product.

, This will act as a reservoir for the water you add. Pour one gallon of water for each 60 pounds of dry mix into the depression. Don't worry about overflow or splashing, because all the container's contents must be mixed completely before the concrete is used.

, The Portland cement, the key ingredient in concrete, is introduced to standing water, initiating hydration, not the reverse. Makes mixing with a shovel simpler and easier. Just the action of pouring mix in the water commences the hydration process without lifting a shovel. The trick is how much water per bag to add., The ratio is usually 1 gallon (3.8 L) per 80lb bag. But 1/5th of a 5 gallon (18.9 L). pail is hard to mix with 80lb of Portland cement, aggregate and admixture by hand shovel in a wheelbarrow. In revolving cement mixers, this is easy. With a shovel you end bulldozing through semi-rigid stubborn admixture that doesn't want to move. One way is to start by pouring two gallons in the barrow, dump the first bag in, mix completely into slurry, then add bag number two, assuming physically strong enough to maneuver the resultant weight. If not, pour a half 80lb bag into 1 gallon (3.8 L), mix thoroughly, then add the remainder, mixing thoroughly., Plunging the shovel in the mix atop the water at the barrow's rounded front and paddling backward, scooping cement and carrying it back and dumping in the front to come in contact with water. All the shoveling is to bring the concrete mix in contact with water for the water and cement chemical interaction to do the rest. Repeating the paddling step over and over, as many times as it takes, until every speck of mix contacts water (usually about two to three minutes steady Eddie), as in cannot find any dry mix hiding along the bottom, sides or anywhere. You know it's fully mixed when you can grab a handful that won't keep its form after squeezed into a ball but yet isn't soupy. If forms a ball = too dry. If runs = too much water. The proper mixture for strongest concrete resides between dry and runny and ascertained by experience. The strongest is 0.45 water unit per Portland cement unit., Add additional water until the concrete is as plastic as you want it to be for your project. You should avoid making the concrete too thin, or soupy, as excess water will weaken the finished concrete, and will also allow the aggregates to separate out of the mix.

, Concrete hardens through the process of hydration, so continuing to mix the material will insure the reaction will occur completely.

,, You may want to pat the concrete with your finishing tool to compact the material, removing any voids or air pockets which have formed as you placed it.

,, Clean and put away your tools, clean up the area, and remove the empty bags when you are finished., ., This is best suited for mortar mixes but works with concrete mixes also. Fill a buck just less than 1/3 with water and add an entire 30kg bag of prepackaged concrete and mix.

Dissolve calcium into water prior to mixing with concrete.,
A calcium addition of 2% by volume is a standard calcium amount to increase concrete setting times.,
Mix concrete together as per normal using calcium enriched water.

,
Place and finish concrete quickly after mixing since the set time will be accelerated.",How to Add Calcium to a Concrete Mix," Agitate the water to help the calcium flakes to dissolve.;
, A five gallon bucket full of concrete would require only a small handful of calcium to accelerate the setting dramatically. A medium Tim Hortons coffee cup of calcium would increase the set time of almost 400 pounds of mixed concrete.

,, Direct sunlight or warm ambient temperatures will cause the set time to increase even further. Calcium is most useful for cold weather concrete applications where a high initial set strength is required to resist the potential damage to fresh concrete from freezing.

Remove dirt and grease.,
Choose your acid.,
Follow safety instructions.,
Add acid to water in a plastic bucket or watering can.,
Hose down the entire area.,
Sprinkle on the acid.,
Brush the acid over the concrete.,
Let the acid sit for a few minutes.,
Rinse thoroughly.,
Neutralize the acid.,
Rinse several times.,
Clean up leftover acid.",How to Acid Wash Concrete," Brush or vacuum dirt from the concrete. If there are oil stains, remove them with a concrete degreaser or alkali detergent.Rinse thoroughly with water.


If water beads up on the surface, the acid wash may not work correctly.Degreasing should solve this problem.
Trisodium phosphate (TSP) cleaners are not recommended. Any residue left behind can react violently with the acid to release dangerous gas.;
, Select a cleaning or etching product based on your experience level and project location:Sulfamic acid is the safest to handle, and recommended for non-professionals.
Phosphoric acid creates less fumes. Use it in rooms that contain stainless steel or other acid-vulnerable metals. It's also a good choice if you're just cleaning off mineral deposits.
Muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid) is the most dangerous option and produces strong fumes. Recommended only for professionals working outdoors.

, These acids are some of the most dangerous substances available for home use. Wear acid-resistant gloves, rubber boots, and vapor proof goggles.Protect your lungs with a respirator with an acid-grade filter, and use fans to improve ventilation if necessary.Protect exposed skin with well-fitting clothing at minimum, and ideally with a face shield plus a PVC or Butyl coverall or apron.Keep water nearby to wash spills from skin or clothing. Showers and an eye wash station are ideal.
Keep baking soda or garden lime nearby to neutralize spills on the ground., Unlike metal, all common plastics are resistant to acid damage at these concentrations.To avoid a violent reaction, pour water in the bucket first, then add acid slowly.Follow the recommended ratio printed on the acid container, or stick to these guidelines:


Sulfamic acid: 1 pound powder or crystals per 1 gallon hot water (120 grams per 1 L water).Phosphoric acid: dilute to 20–40%.Muriatic acid: mix 3 to 4 parts water with 1 part acid, or follow label instructions for a 10% concentration (15% for hard, smooth concrete).These solutions are for etching the concrete. If you're just removing mineral deposits (efflorescence), use a much weaker mix (10:1 or 16:1 for muriatic acid)., Spray water on the concrete until damp, but not puddling.Also wet surrounding objects, such as trees, bushes, walls, doors, door frames, cabinetry, and carpets. Remove any furniture in close proximity.


The concrete must stay wet the whole time. Divide large areas into sections or hose periodically to prevent it drying out.
Protect asphalt, drywall, and tarmac with a plastic drop cloth or other physical barrier., Use a plastic watering can to sprinkle acid onto the concrete, pouring low to the ground. Work in small sections, starting with an inconspicuous test area. The plastic may corrode, sometimes within an hour, so have several replacement cans handy.. Read the label instructions to determine how much acid to add, or use these guidelines:


Sulfamic acid: 1 gallon treats 300 ft.2 concrete (1 liter per 28 m2).Phosphoric acid: 1 gallon treats 500–2500 ft.2 (3.8 L per 45–250 m2) when removing mineral deposits.Muriatic acid: 1 gallon treats 45 ft.2 (4.5 L per 5 m2)., Right after sprinkling on the acid, brush with a push broom or long masonry brush to spread the acid into an even layer.For large jobs, one person can use a floor machine while another brushes acid into the corners and walls.Make sure the floor and surrounding objects don't dry out while you're applying acid. You may need to hose them down frequently.

, Wait 5–10 minutes for the acid to etch the concrete.If you're just removing white mineral deposits, wait until you see them lift off the concrete (usually just a couple minutes)., Before the acid dries, scrub off the remaining residue with a long masonry brush while rinsing with plenty of water. Leaving the acid on too long may damage your concrete.

, Mix 1 cup of baking soda, garden lime, or household ammonia in 1 gallon of water (roughly 250 mL in 4 L), or follow label instructions on an acid neutralizing product. Scrub this over the concrete and let sit at least ten minute to ensure that all the acid is neutralized.Pay particular attention to the edges and any low spots in the concrete.


At this point, etched concrete should have a uniform texture like medium-grit sandpaper. If the concrete is smoother than this, or if there are still white mineral deposits, apply the acid a second time.

, Even after the acid is neutralized, liquid left on the surface may leave a white, powdery residue after it dries. Spray the concrete with water, scrub, and repeat several times to prevent this from happening. Pick up the final rinse water with a shop vac or brush it into the gutter.


You can use a pressure washer for the last few rinses, but not for the first one, since it can drive acid deep into the concrete.To be safe, test the final rinse water with a pH test strip. If it is below 6.0, there is too much acid and the floor needs more rinsing. (Less commonly, a result above 9.0 means you've added too much basic neutralizer.), If you have any leftover acid solution, pour it slowly into a large bucket filled partway with the same neutralizing solution you used earlier. Slowly stir in more acid and base as needed until the mixture stops fizzing. Once neutralized, you can pour it down the sink or storm drain.Hose off any equipment or clothing that may have touched the acid.


If you do not have plans for the rest of the pure acid, you may want to dispose of it the same way. Acid left in storage can be a serious hazard due to corrosive fumes and the risk of spills.

Observe the rebar configuration while the concrete is placed.,
Cap or otherwise protect any exposed bars while working near them.",How to Tie Rebar," For structural concrete construction, an engineer and architect will usually do the technical design work and provide specific information regarding the sizes, configuration, and placement of rebar in the associated concrete work. Planning the actual fabrication and placement, as well as the schedule of the work is your first task.;
, For simple projects like typical building foundations and slab reinforcement, you can most likely buy the necessary rebar from a building supply center or home improvement warehouse. For complicated applications such as grade beams, foundation walls, tanks, and other projects, you will need to have specific shapes formed by a rebar fabrication specialist. Here are some examples:



Stirrups - These are shaped rebar that hold the lateral reinforcement in a certain configuration, often called a cage. They create a framework that keeps these larger bars in position, and may be round, square, rectangular, or even complex combinations of shapes.

Dowels - These are usually L shapes, or straight lengths of rebar with a ninety degree bend on one end.

Corner bars - These are also L shapes, with each side of the ell the same length.

Offset bends - These range from a simple Z shape to complex angles, used in reinforcing concrete walkway steps and steps (changes in elevation) in concrete footings.

Hairpins - These are U shaped rebar that are often used to interlock two or more individual mats of rebar to give lateral strength to the concrete casting.

Candy canes - As the name implies, these are straight lengths of rebar with a U shaped bend on one or both ends, again to interlock two or more parallel reinforcing mats.

, If you purchase your rebar from a fabricator, the supplier will usually review your structural engineer's or architect's plans and produce a shop drawing with details and identifying tags for each type of rebar used in the project. For simpler projects, your building plans should provide spacing requirements and bar sizes. Use these documents to determine where and what rebar is needed in individual locations.

, Most times, rebar is tied with annealed steel wire, either bought in four pound bulk rolls, or if using a bag tie spinner, in bundles of precut wire pieces with loops formed on both ends. The latter are easier for novices to use, but somewhat more expensive, the former is often the choice of experience rebar tiers (rodbusters).

, The ground should be graded and compacted after any needed subgrading, excavations, and underground rough ins for plumbing and electrical utilities is finished. Lay out the actual perimeter or form lines for the concrete placement after the grading and compaction and associated testing is done.

, For large footings where heavy rebar is to be used, the formwork usually is done first, for concrete walls and grade beams, one side of the form may be built prior to tying the rebar, but the rebar will need to be tied in place before the formwork is completed so bars can be positioned and tied in place. For concrete slabs, the subgrade (ground underneath the slab) is often pre-treated for termites, and a moisture barrier or dampproofing is installed before the mat is tied.

, This involves removing individual bars, stirrups, and dowels from their respective bundles according to the placement drawing counts. An example would be a slab measuring 12 feet (3.7 m) by 12 feet (3.7 m) with rebars at 8 inch (20.3 cm) centers in one direction, and 12 inch (30.5 cm) centers the other. Determine the size of bars required in each direction, mark two or three bars with the appropriate layout measurements in each direction, and count the marks to determine how many rebar are required for each direction. Often, the placement drawings are specific, such as ""18 (number 5) rebar, 11 foot 6 inches (15.2 cm) long, one half each way"". This gives the following information: You need the given quantity, 18, rebar, size 5 (5/8 inch diameter), with 9 bars laying in each direction, the top rows perpendicular to the bottom ones.

, This is the primary focus of this article. Tying the bars so that they remain in their correct respective positions is critical to achieve the desired strength of the completed concrete structure.

, The layout bars (or mark bars) can be marked with a soapstone marker, a paint pen, a piece of lumber crayon, or with spray paint.

, For the bag ties (Snap Ties, not to be confused with the snap ties described later). For ordinary slab mats, where the force of the concrete interacting with the rebar during its placement is minimal, and movement of the mats is unlikely, using a simple, single twist of wire around each rebar intersection, twisted together tightly, will suffice. This tie is known as a snap tie, and can be made with the snap tie precut ties and a spinner, noted earlier. It can also be done easily with a pair of 9 inch (22.9 cm) lineman's pliers and bulk wire held on the rodbuster's workbelt in a wire reel. For other applications where the force of the concrete placement may displace the rebars, or where more strength is needed to hold bars in the proper configuration, more complicated ties may be used. Here are some of them, with a simplified description of how they are made:



Figure 8 ties - These are made by pulling the wire around the rear (from the rodbuster) bar, diagonally across the front bar, back around the rear bar, diagonally in the opposite direction across the front bar, and then twisting back around the beginning wire. You then cut the wire feeding off the reel, and bend the cut ends back towards the tie so no sharp ends project from the tie. These ties will help hold perpendicular bars tightly together while helping to prevent them from racking, or moving diagonally.

Saddle ties - Similar to the figure 8 tie, you begin by passing the wire feeding from your reel behind the rear bar, then across the front bar staying parallel to the bar. You then pass it behind the rear bar again, back around the front bar on the opposite side. You now twist the ends together, cut the feed wire, and bend the cut ends back. This tie is often used when tying rebar for walls or other vertical application where the rodbuster will actually climb on the rebar framework to access higher portions of the wall. The figure 8 and saddle tie can often be interchanged, however, technically speaking, there are advantages to each one in certain circumstances.
Combinations of figure 8 and saddle ties with additional wraps around vertical rebars can be used to increase the hold of the tie so bars cannot slip downward when weight is applied to them or the plastic concrete is dropped into the form.

, For all the above mentioned ties, you pull the feeding end from the wire reel with your non-dominant (hereafter regarded as left, please reverse for right handed persons) hand. Grip the end of the wire with your pliers in your right hand, and poke, or push it behind the rebar described in the first step of your chosen tie. Bend or angle the end toward the place you will be grabbing the end in the next step of the tie, then reach from that side, grip it again with the pliers, pull it toward the next place you will route it to, pulling enough slack wire to complete the tie. Hold resistance on the wire with your left hand, so the wire bends snugly against the bar you are wrapping in each stage of the tie. Release the wire so that the pliers can be used to grip it, and do so, pulling the end around the bar and twist the two ends of the wire together. Pull or tug the wire with the pliers so the tie is tight.

, Check your plans to make sure each component of the reinforcement is in place. Often, in structural concrete reinforcement, you will find several elements that interface together in addition to the basic rebar mat discussed so far. Here are a few to note:



Block dowels - When placing a concrete foundation which will have concrete masonry units (block) erected on it, you will usually find the plans require installing block dowels, or vertical rebar to reinforce cells at a required spacing to give the subsequent block wall sufficient strength to withstand conditions to which it will be exposed, or to help it support loads it will carry as an overall part of the structure you are building. These bars are tied to the foundation rebar (footing bars) in a location that will place them in the center of individual block cells. For them to be placed correctly, you will need to establish the wall line, then determine the spacing of these cells. If your layout begins at a corner, using 8X16 inch regular block, you can place the first dowel 4 inches (10.2 cm) inside the outside wall line, 4 inches (10.2 cm) from the corner, then space additional bars at their required distances in multiples of 8 inches (20.3 cm). For example, at 16, 24, or 32 inch centers. This is known as blockwork spacing.

Bulkhead dowels - In instances where a footing will not be completed in a single concrete placement, you will need to dowel out of the bulkhead form so the next placement will be structurally tied to the latter one. Make sure the dowels extend far enough that the lateral reinforcement will overlap enough to maintain the strength of the rods used. Typically, rebar lap is calculated in bar diameters. An example would be the number 5 rebar mentioned earlier. It has a diameter of 5/8 of an inch, and the required lap might be 40 bar diameters. Multiplying the diameter 5/8 by 40, you will get 200⁄8 or 25 inches (63.5 or 63.5 cm).
Note that in structural concrete, other types of imbeds and inserts may be required. Place rebar in such a manner as to allow installation of anchor bolts, sleeves, embedded weld plates, inserts, or other items in their respective correct locations without interference. In general terms, these items require more precise positioning, so offsetting one or two rebars may be required.

, Once the mat or cage is assembled, you must hold it in position so the the concrete will cover it completely. Rebar chairs or concrete brick are often used for this purpose. Place these positioners at a spacing that will not allow the rebar to bend or deflect enough to reduce the coverage you wish to obtain with the concrete you place in you forms. For a 12 inch (30.5 cm) thick footing, the rebar mat is usually placed about 4 inches (10.2 cm) from the bottom of the concrete, and side clearances range from 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2 cm).

, If shifting occurs, support the rebars with a handled tool like a shovel wedged so that you can achieve sufficient leverage to hold its position, or alter the direction of flowing concrete so force is applied in the opposite direction.

, Rebar that is sheared, or mechanically cut has very sharp surfaces at the location of these cuts. Construction workers have suffered serious injuries and have also been killed when they have fallen on projecting rebar dowels. Special rod caps made of high impact plastic with a metal plate embedded in them are required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), in the United States.

Close as many doors as possible during the renovation.,
Hang plastic sheets around the work area.,
Force the dust outside by creating a pressure difference.,
Protect the floors of your home using tarps or drop cloths.,
Employ water-cooled and vacuum-equipped tools whenever possible.,
Turn off your home ductwork-based heating and cooling.,
Complete as much of the work as possible outside.",How to Contain Dust During Demolition and Remodeling," This is the quickest and easiest way to help contain construction dust. Any rooms that do not need to be accessed by the construction crew should have closed doors at all times. Rooms such as bathrooms should be closed when not in use. Closing doors in your home will go a long way towards mitigating the spread of dust and debris.;
, One of the most effective solutions for controlling construction dust is to hang plastic drop cloths around the area being renovated. Drop cloths can be found inexpensively in the painting aisle of your hardware store. You can hang them using tape or inconspicuous fasteners like staples. Consider cutting long vertical slits down the middle of the plastic sheets to allow for passage.

, The best way to do this is by opening a window and operating a fan facing the open window. This will force airborne dust outside, and keep it from entering other areas of your home due to the pressure difference.

, One of the things most easily ruined by construction dust is flooring. Hardwood floor finishes can be marred by excess dust, and construction dust can be ground deep into carpets where it is difficult to clean. Avoid this by laying down plastic drop cloths or tarps over all floors that will be exposed to foot traffic during the home renovation.

, Some construction tasks produce a large amount of dust, such as cutting wood or tile or sanding any surface. To reduce dust, many tools can be fitted with either a vacuum dust collection bag or a water cooling system. Tile saws should always be used with the water pump on, which virtually eliminates dust. Mitre saws, circular saws, and handheld sanders should be equipped with dust collection bags that reduce the amount of errant dust.

, If the heating and cooling system in your home uses ductwork to force air movement, turn the system off during the entire remodel if possible. Forced air systems readily churn construction dust up and distribute it through your entire home (bypassing closed doors and plastic sheets in the process). Turn the heating and cooling off, and consider taping plastic or paper over the registers and vents of your ducts.

, Tasks that can be done outdoors should be. This includes cutting wood or tile using a power saw. Performing these tasks outside and then bringing the cut materials inside will drastically reduce the amount of construction dust in your home.

Measure the distance between your basement wall studs.,
Cut 2x4s to fit the space between each stud.,
Secure the firestopping blocks.,
Fill in the gaps with fireproof caulking.,
Wall over the studs.",How to Fireproof a Basement1," Stretch a tape measure across the expanse from one stud to another. You should be measuring between the inner edges of the studs. Write this number down, rounding to the nearest quarter inch (roughly 1.25cm) The firestopping blocks will be cut to fit this space.Before you begin, check to see if your the walls of your basement already have some form of firestopping in place.It will be necessary to fireblock any wall sections that create interior cavities greater than 10 feet (3m) in width.;
, Acquire a set of 2” (48mm) nominal lumber boards. Using the measurements of the stud spacing that you just took, saw the boards straight across width-wise. Take care to make the edges clean and even. The best way to do this is to use a circular saw that allows you to make precise cuts.To install firestops between every stud, you may need to use several boards.
You can also use 2x8s (48mm x 198mm) if a wider space exists between the studs and the foundation wall.Nominal lumber is one of a few firestopping materials approved by the International Residential Code (IRC).

, Position the newly made blocks in the space at the top of the studs where they meet the floor joists or recessed wall frame. Nail the blocks into place, then test them to confirm that they’re firmly fastened.


The firestopping blocks act as a barrier to keep flames and combustible gases from rising to the upper levels of your home. Without them, hollow wall cavities are like chimneys, creating drafts that draw the fire upward.Some homes utilize a double layer of firestopping for added protection. You might consider this approach should your space and materials allow it.

, If there are any spaces remaining between the studs and the firestopping blocks, this will seal them and prevent drafts from forming and accelerating the spread of fire. Simply spray a thin line into whatever cracks and crevices you come across. As it dries, the caulk will expand inside the gaps, blocking them off and neutralizing airflow. To be on the safe side, seal every space surrounding the blocks, including where the studs intersect the joists of the upper floor.

, Once the firestopping blocks have been successfully installed, you can proceed to cover the studs with plywood or drywall. This will create multiple separate compartments inside the wall rather than one large cavity. In the event of an emergency, each individual compartment will help stop or slow the spread of fire.Oxygen will be unable to infiltrate the sealed compartments, effectively stifling the fire.
Patch holes opened by contractors and plumbers with fireproof building materials and sealants.

Insulate your basement with fire-blocking materials.,
Use fireproof caulking and adhesives.,
Invest in fire-safe windows.,
Install a home sprinkler system.,
Have your wiring inspected regularly.",How to Fireproof a Basement2," Insulators like gypsum, mineral wool and particle board are known for their fire-retardant qualities. If you’re in the process of building a new house, you probably won’t have to specify that you want fireproof materials, as these features are now standard. That being said, it never hurts to ask what types of materials are being used in the construction of your home.Replace old and unsafe insulation with fire-rated materials as soon as it’s discovered.Installing fireproof insulation in older homes demands a lot of labor and expense, but it’s worth considering if you’re serious about safeguarding your family and property.

, As mentioned, there are many different types of sealants available that have been approved for firestopping. Use fireproof caulking to seal any visible cracks or spaces between firestopping blocks, wall studs and joists. It only takes a small amount to make problem areas fire-tight.Fireproof sealants are readily available at major home improvement stores.
Finishing your basement with a fireproof sealant is always a good idea, especially if your home has balloon framing or a similarly hollow construction that can create openings for drafts.

, For basements with windows, you’ll want to shop around for styles that meet prescribed safety regulations. You can also pick out windows that are made with fire-rated glass. These types of window glasses are treated with special compounds that reflect and disperse heat, making them less likely to shatter. With the right windows, you’ll be protected from fire whether it originates inside or outside.One popular alternative to conventional windows is glass blocks or panels, which will allow natural light to filter into the basement without becoming a safety hazard.
It’s also critical that your basement present some clear and unobstructed means of escape in case a fire does break out. Your windows will need to be at least 20"" wide by 24"" high and easy to open without any screens, grills or other covers., While not a form of fireproofing in the traditional sense, a sprinkler system can stop flames in their tracks before they grow big enough to wreak havoc. Sprinklers trigger automatically when exposed to heat, meaning you don’t even have to be aware of a fire for them to do their job. This makes them an exceptional first line of defense against fires that start in the sub-levels of your home.Get an estimate to see if it’s feasible to have water routed through a sprinkler system in your home.
If you do decide to put in a sprinkler system, don’t forget to clear your basement of any belongings that are vulnerable to water damage.

, Faulty electrical wiring is one of the leading causes of household fires. Schedule an inspection at least once a year to to ensure that your home’s wiring is safe. In the meantime, be on the lookout for fraying, splitting, shorting and other electrical risks that could potentially lead to a fire.Remember: when it comes to accidents and disasters, prevention is the best solution.
If your home is more than a few decades old, or you experience electrical problems with abnormal frequency, it may be time to have it rewired."

Ask friends and family members for referrals.,
Look for contractors online.,
Ensure that your contractor does not have any past or pending complaints.,
Procure estimates from several different handymen.,
Ensure that your contractor is insured.,
Make sure your handyman is willing to detail the project in a written contract.",How to Choose a Good Handyman," Perhaps the best way to locate a good handyman is by asking those close to you. Many of them who own homes will have already established a relationship with a contractor, and will be able to recommend them or advise you against them. This step will give you access to detailed, honest feedback about the contractor's performance.;
, To augment the recommendations made by friends and family, search for handymen online. Customer review websites like Yelp are helpful for assessing contractors, and specialized sites like Kudzu and Angie's List offer directories of service professionals like handymen. Checking the contractor's own website is helpful, but reading third-party feedback is a better way to assess the quality and value of the contractor's work.

, In the United States, you can check a small business using the Better Business Bureau's website. If any major complaints have been registered against the contractor, you will be able to read the details of those complaints. Check this site before calling a contractor to submit an estimate for your project.

, Once you've found several potential contractors through referrals or online research, get several of them to come to your home and bid on your project. This will allow you to meet them in person, determine whether or not they are punctual, and see how their pricing compares. The lowest bid is of course attractive, but you may be more inclined to work with the contractor who was timeliest and most considerate.

, Handymen are not typically required to be licensed, and bonding is not usually necessary on small home improvement jobs. However, you should make sure your handymen has insurance. Some form of general liability insurance is essential, as is worker's compensation insurance if the handymen employs other workers. These forms of insurance can protect you from liability if there is an accident on your property.

, Even for a small job, you should request a contract if it is your first time dealing with the handyman. A contract will protect you if the contractor fails to perform the work as specified.

Pretreat the fill and subgrade for insects using an approved and labeled termiticide.,
Install the required moisture barrier or waterproof membrane immediately after the termiticide is applied.,
Install the reinforcing wire or rebars required by the architect/engineer or your local building codes.,
Plan the method you are going to use to screed the concrete.,
Determine the method you will use to place the concrete in your forms.,
Check forms for alignment and make sure all braces are tight and well anchored so the weight of the concrete does not cause them to bow or fail during the pour.

,
Calculate the quantity of concrete you will need to complete the slab.,
Order the concrete from a ready mix concrete supplier, and schedule the delivery to coincide with the concrete placement schedule.,
Coordinate concrete testing with a qualified testing laboratory if the construction contract requires it.,
Plan on beginning large slab placements as early as possible to allow time to complete the project successfully.,
Set up all equipment used in the concrete placement on the day of the pour.,
Begin the concrete placement at a corner and continuing placing the concrete along the grade or screed lines as you have established.,
Make sure the reinforcing wire mat or rebars are not forced to the bottom of the concrete while placing.,
Keep placing the concrete and pulling it roughly level with Come Alongs and screeding it off with a straightedge or power screed.,
Have one or two finishers, as the job requires, to bull float the concrete after it has been screeded.,
Give men the job of using hand floats the job of working the edges of the slab.,
Remove pipe screeds or grade stakes as each area is placed and screeded off.,
Continue pouring the concrete until the forms are filled to the finished grade of the slab.,
Allow the concrete to set.,
Have concrete finishers get on knee boards to work areas where a power trowel (troweling machine) cannot be operated.,
Set your troweling machine on the slab when the concrete is hard enough to support the workman without leaving deep footprints in its surface.,
Trowel the concrete with the blades at their flattest setting.,
Sprinkle a light mist of water on areas that do not respond to the troweling machine, particularly to help pull grout up to fill voids and cover any aggregate left exposed during bull floating.

,
Let the concrete continue to set after it has been troweled the first time.,
Run the troweling machines over the concrete until the level of finish you desire is achieved.,
Apply a curing compound or use a curing technique to keep the concrete from drying too quickly, especially in extreme weather conditions resulting in rapid evaporation.

,
Saw any joints required by the construction plans.

,
Remove the forms and clean them for reuse on the next project.",How to Place and Finish a Concrete Floor," Heavy equipment may be used to clear the footprint of the building, plants and unsuitable material should be removed, and the subgrade should be inspected to determine if it will give adequate support for the slab and the structure that will be built on it.


Have the site surveyed or layout the building lines yourself. Batterboards may be used, or corner stakes can be set to allow building lines to be pulled and grades to be established for clearing and grading.
Grub out trees, bushes, and other plants, including their roots so they will not leave voids in the subgrade when they decay.

Remove any mucky or otherwise unsuitable material from the subgrade.
Proof roll or use another method to compact the disturbed subgrade soil material.;
, For monolithic slabs, there may simply be a turn down edge, but for many buildings, a spread footing is poured, then CMU (concrete masonry units, commonly called block) are layed up to finished floor grade.

, Building lines which have been laid out on the outside building line and on grade (at the proper elevation), will allow you to form the edges of the slab straight and level.

, Bathtub drainpipes and commode flanges are often blocked out so the traps can be installed when the fixture is set into position later.

,


Capillary fill is used where moisture may create a problem.
Crushed limestone or other aggregate base materials can be used for slabs with heavy loads like warehouse floors and aircraft hangars.
Cohesive materials like clay are sometimes used where the subgrade cannot be sufficiently stabilized using conventional methods.

, For engineered buildings, testing the density of the fill may be required to meet the architect's specifications. This is usually done by a geo-technical engineering laboratory.

, This is usually done by a bonded and licensed pest control company.

, This will help prevent the chemicals from evaporating, and will prevent the subgrade from drying out and becoming loose.

, Make sure it is supported so that it will be positioned in the correct location after the concrete is placed and has set. Using concrete chairs is an effective method of doing this.

, For wide spans, you will want to set grades or some type of screed guide to allow the screed operators to keep the concrete flat, or at the required slope. Pipe screeds are used in the placement shown in the photographs, but other techniques may be used, including grade stakes, or using a laser level and target to set wet screeds.

, This should be done early in the process so that concrete trucks and other required equipment will be able to get into the area they will need access to during the concrete placement.


Aerial pumps can place concrete to specific areas of the slab via an articulated boom and hose assembly up to 120 feet (36.6 m) from the concrete truck. They are often used for placing concrete on elevated decks or in inaccessible locations.
Line pumps also use pipes and hoses to move the concrete from the truck to the placement location, but require a lot of labor to move the hoses around while in use.
Concrete buckets can be used for placing the concrete in high locations or inaccessible areas using a crane or forklift.
Georgia buckets are self-propelled wagons that can maneuver in tight locations to place concrete.
Chuting or tailgating is discharging the concrete directly from the truck into the form.

,, Measuring the length times the width, then multiplying it by the depth, in feet or a decimal fraction thereof will give you the total cubic feet of material required. To convert this number to cubic yards, divide it by 27. Allow enough extra concrete to fill any monolithic footings, depressed slabs, and low areas in the fill material.

, This means both the date and time of the pour, and the interval of delivery for multiple trucks to arrive on the job site so the concrete crew has time to discharge and tend to each truckload, while not having to wait for the next truck to arrive.

, Testing labs often perform the following tests:


Slump. This test determines the plasticity of the concrete material. A vertical cone shaped mold is filled with concrete and the amount the concrete slumps is measured, to make sure it is not too wet to meet specification for the job.
Temperature. Concrete suffers detrimental effects when it becomes too hot, so the temperature of the product is monitored during placement.
Air entrainment. Chemicals are added to the concrete to ensure air is entrained in the mixture. These tiny voids will allow the concrete to expand and contract more before cracking when concrete is expected to be subjected to large temperature variations over time. A typical air entrainment requirement is 3-5%.
Compressive strength. Concrete strength is measured in PSI (pounds per square inch), and special plastic molds are used to collect samples of the material which are later used in the testing lab's laboratory to determine the concrete's strength.

, Things to consider are these:


Make sure you have sufficient manpower to perform the job.
Check the weather conditions. These factors can contribute to concrete setting times:

Temperature. The higher the temperature, the faster the concrete will set, and very hot conditions will affect the ability of the workers to perform.
Humidity. Very low humidity will allow for the water in the concrete to evaporate more quickly.
Wind. Wind can increase the speed the surface of the concrete will dry.
Cold weather can greatly increase the setting time for concrete. Placing concrete at near freezing temperatures or when freezing conditions are expected during the next 48 hours is not recommended.
Sunshine. Concrete will set more quickly in bright sunny conditions than it will in cloudy conditions.



,


If a concrete pump truck is to be used, have it arrive an hour or so early to allow it to be set up and in position, and to let the pump operator get an idea of the placement plan.
Service troweling machines, including checking the controls, the blades, and making sure they are full of engine oil and gasoline.
Check straight edges, screed boards, power screeds, and bull floats to make sure they are in good condition.
Make sure concrete vibrators are in good condition if the slab requires their use.
Check personal safety equipment, such as gloves, rubber boots, and eye protection.
Clean and check all hand tools so they are in good working condition.

, Concrete can be placed in parallel sections as long as each subsequent section is placed before the prior section has begun to set up, or there will be cold joints between the two.

, If needed, have a worker or two walk with the persons placing the concrete and use hooks to pull the wire up. Keeping the reinforcing in the proper position is critical to the strength of the slab.

, Have finishers work around electrical conduits and plumbing pipes with hand tools to keep the surface level.

, The person who bull floats the concrete may need a laborer to add concrete to any low areas he notices while performing this task.

, This is the process of moving around the edge making sure the perimeter of the slab along the forms is flat and smooth. This is especially important if braces are anchored on top of the form, or if the forms are not flush and level.

, If there is a hole left in the concrete when the screed or stake is removed, shovel additional concrete into it to flush it with the surface of the screeded concrete.

, Once the concrete has been completely screeded, give someone the task of cleaning the tools used for placing the concrete, including the pipe screeds, bull floats, comealongs, and shovels.

, If the edges have been properly floated, and the bull floaters have done a good job with the main areas, you will want to have the crew wait until the concrete gets hard enough to support workers on knee boards before continuing the finishing process. Check the concrete by pushing it with your gloved finger until it is unyielding.

, Working around blocked out areas, pipe stub ups, rebar dowels, and other obstacles will often require considerable effort.

, Waiting too long will mean to concrete is too hard to achieve a very good finish, but starting too early will mean the blades of the machine may dig into the concrete causing rutting, humps, and other problems.

, This gives them more surface area, so they will not tend to sink in as they spin across the surface. Using a combination type blade, rather than a finishing blade is better for this step.

,, If the surface is flat and free of defects, you can allow the concrete to harden until it is ready for the finish troweling. Because the concrete is placed in a continuous operation, the first area that is poured will normally set up first, but be aware that areas exposed to hot sun or wind may get hard earlier than areas that were placed in a shaded, protected location.

, For a hard troweled finish, you will raise the blades up on the machine as the concrete gets progressively harder, which in turn puts more pressure on a smaller area of the blade.

,,, Make sure to remove any nails or screws that may present a hazard to workers handling these materials.

"
Beware of the Log Home Kit.,
Keep in mind that a cabin kit itself makes up only a fraction of the total cost of your building.,
Make sure your site is accessible by tractor trailer, if it is not you can unload at the nearest point accessible by the truck.,
Don't assume that every kit that leaves the factory is done correctly.,
Have the right equipment in place.,
If you are putting a kit together by yourself you really need to have at least some carpentry experience, and it would help if you had some log building experience.",How to Choose a Cabin Building Method1,"


Do you have the time to take a couple of weeks to assemble a cabin kit?
When fully assembled log cabins are very competitively priced with the kit packages you can purchase, and often times priced even better. Did you know the average cost in America to build a Log cabin ranges from a conservative estimate of $100 per square foot to an unbelievable $240 per square foot. The cost per square foot for a fully assembled unit averages out at about $65 per square foot. Take a minute and do a “Google” search for “cost of a log home”, and see for yourself the cost to build a log home.
Many times you don’t have the necessary extra set 3-4 sets of hands necessary to assemble portions of the kit.
If your building site isn’t precisely level, the precut lumber doesn’t fit, or if you place one piece wrong you fight everything the rest of the way, and sometimes a piece will be cut wrong at the factory, a mistake that wasn’t even yours. Couple that with the fact that very few people have ever assembled a kit, and have yet to face the frustrations of doing it themselves or finding someone to do it for them. You've probably assembled things with missing pieces, and had things that just would not go together, and the box always reads easy assembly, but really, is there anything more frustrating?;
, Most kits are only exterior walls, do not include a foundation, floor system, electric, insulation, plumbing, or any finish on the interior. Those supplies will cost you significantly and also add to the overall length of your project. Make sure you know exactly what is coming with your kit, and calculate additional costs you will have in assembling the structure.

, Keep in mind that a driver will not risk running his truck and trailer into a job site that could damage his equipment, or get him stuck.

, Many people think that because the kit was sent from a factory that the kit is correct, and they are doing something wrong, but kit builders make mistakes, only they are not there to help fix them. If you set one piece wrong, or something doesn't go together quite right, you can fight everything the rest of the building and nothing will be smooth, or correct.

, You need to have a forklift onsite to unload the kit from the truck. Many kits require a crane to set pieces of the roof in place. Make sure you get a list of all the tools that you need in order to put you kit together, and find out where you can buy, borrow, or rent them. Kits do not come stained, and that is something you will need to do, or pay to have done. Some kit suppliers will offer you their services in this area, but you will pay dearly for it. Many stains also have toxic fumes which you need to be careful around. You are limited in the custom design. They take a long time to assemble.

, A very small 12X24 kit may take you approx. 6-7 weekends, or 12-14 days, and is a lot of work. If you plan to run electric, you will need to drill through the center of each log the whole way up your wall. These things can take a great deal of time, slow the overall process down. The only time a kit would recommend is if you are looking to put a building in a very remote location that is inaccessible. Keep in mind though that you still need to find a way to get all your pieces back to the site.

Weigh the benefits and costs.,
It can take up to 6 months and sometimes even longer to build your cabin.,
You need to have a road in that grants access for all of your supplies, and crews.

,
You will need to find a way to remove of all of your scrap and trash from your site.,
You can save yourself some money by operating as your own general contractor, but there is a lot of work and headaches in that.",How to Choose a Cabin Building Method2," This option is very expensive, but does allow for the most customization of your cabin. You have the freedom to design the cabin exactly how you want, both on the interior and exterior.

, You can often expect delays that will push back your timeline, and cause your budget to run over. Delays can occur due to weather, waiting for materials, or even simple complications in the building process.

,, Any time you have large work crews coming to a site the property gets torn up, and left a mess. The larger the project the larger the mess left behind. Also note that contractors are often permitted to bury a certain amount of the scrap from a work-site on your property, ask about that up front so you know what you can expect. The more remote your site the more difficult the trash removal is.

, Make sure that you know what you are getting into before taking on that responsibility.

.,
Consider the limitations to this type of building.",How to Choose a Cabin Building Method3," Reconsider the stereotype of modular homes. In recent year modular homes have become more and more popular among home builders. When many people think of modular homes they think of trailer units that are towed to a site and then connected together. However, the modern modular home is something entirely different. The major advantage of modular homes is they can be assembled in the controlled environment of a factory and then delivered in pieces to the site. This saves on building time, overall cost, and the mess left by a traditional stick built home. Modular homes are also said to be built sturdier than traditional homes because they have to withstand the delivery process. This means that you can get a less expensive, sturdier home in less time than a traditional building.

,


You need to make sure that you have clearance for the building to be delivered.
You will need to arrange for your water, electric, and sewer to be run to your building and you will also need to hook it up when building is in place.
For larger double wide buildings, or a building set up off the ground on a foundation a crane rental is necessary.
Buildings are customizable, and it is possible to accommodate any ideas or options that you would like to incorporate. You are limited in the size buildings that can be made because everything is hauled down the road fully assembled, and needs to be careful of height and width restrictions.

Redecorate your home using light colors.,
Leave your windows uncovered.,
Add more light to dark rooms.,
Use mirrors to create the illusion of space.,
Avoid clustering furniture close together or on walls.,
Arrange furniture to create open space and a flow.,
Use furniture with exposed legs.,
Get rid of unnecessary furniture.,
Avoid putting too many things on your walls.,
Limit the items you display.,
Store things in furniture with cabinets.",How to Create More Visual Space in Your Home," Light colors tend to add to the visual space of a place, rather than detract. Consider replacing reds and browns with whites and creams. In the end, the lighter and brighter the colors you use, the more spacious home will feel.

Replace dark paint with light paint.
Replace dark colored furniture.
Remove dark carpets.;
, A great way to open a room – or your whole home – is to leave windows uncovered. You can do this by either by taking down blinds and drapes, or installing blinds and drapes that have less of a presence. In the end, the more natural light you let in and the less stuff crowding your windows and walls, the more open your home will feel.If you do have blinds or other window treatments, keep them open during the day.

, Light tends to open rooms and spaces much more than anything else you can do. To add more light, open your blinds or install more or brighter lights. Ultimately, a brighter space will appear bigger to you and your guests.Try replacing old bulbs with brighter LED or other types of bulbs before you install new lighting.
Opt for cool white or “daylight” light instead of warm yellow or orange light.
Add a table lamp, free standing lamp, or install some recessed lighting to add light to a space.

, Strategically place mirrors around your home to create an airier feel. Mirrors are an easy way to create the appearance of more space in areas that may feel cramped. Look around your home to see where you can put a mirror. Some places might include:Your entryway or parlor
Hallways
Mudrooms
Guest bedrooms
Bathrooms

, Walk through your home and take a good look at how you’ve positioned and spaced your furniture. If you find that you have furniture taking up entire walls or squished together in certain areas, you may need to rearrange your furniture.

Consider allowing 6 inches (15 cm) between end tables and couches, instead of right on top of each other. The same goes for positioning nightstands next to beds – space them apart by 6 inches (15 cm).
Don’t push your couch completely against a wall. Instead, space it 1 to 3 feet (.3 to .9 m) off the wall., Place your furniture so you and your guests can easily walk around and through your home. You want to create the feeling that a person can flow from one living space to another without being slowed by furniture that might be in the way.

When placing furniture in a parlor or sitting area, make sure people can enter through the doorway into the middle of the room before taking a seat.
When placing furniture in a living room or family room, make sure you and your guests can walk into the middle of the room before sitting down. If you have a couch or coffee table blocking people’s walkway, you may have to rearrange it., An easy way to create more visual space is to use furniture that has exposed or raised legs. By purchasing couches, china cabinets, and other pieces of furniture that are raised with legs, you’ll create much more visual space., Perhaps the easiest way to create more visual space is to get rid of unnecessary furniture. If you have items – couches, desks, bookshelves – that you don’t really use or don’t really need, get rid of them. You’ll find that once you downsize your furniture, your home will feel much larger., Walk around your home and take a good look at your walls. Take stock of paintings, photographs, and other artwork you have on your walls. If you find yourself having a difficult time locating open wall space, then you may have a problem. Make sure you have some areas of your wall that are open.There are no universal rules about how much wall space you need to have. However, some decorators suggest leaving two inches between large pictures and an inch and a half (5 to 3.8 cm) between smaller ones.
Large pictures should be about 60 inches (152 centimeters) off the ground.

, Take stock of items you have on top of desks, side tables, bookshelves, and elsewhere in your home. Then, reduce this number. Display only your best pieces of art work or your most memorable keepsakes. Store the others and consider rotating the items you have on display., One of the most common things that ruins the illusion of space in a home are items stacked on pieces of furniture or on bookshelves. Instead of doing this, you should store books and other items inside furniture that has cabinets.If you have a lot of books, buy bookshelves with cabinets. Either the entire bookshelf can have cabinets, or just the lower part.
If you have a lot of dishes displaced in your dining room or kitchen, put them in cabinet. If you want people to see them, consider getting glass cabinets. This will add character but create a neat and open look instead of a crowded look.

Recognize the purpose of something that you DIY.,
Look around for things to improve.,
Write down your ideas.,
Adopt the DIY attitude.",How to DIY1," DIYs aren't only a way to spend your extra time, but also a chance to produce something helpful or useful. Consider what projects you have in your life that needs to be accomplished, and then assess if you might be able to do it on your own. You don’t always need to pay for help and it can be a lot of fun. , For example, maybe you have lots of old canvas and you want to repair it. Start paying attention to the things you need done around your house and you’ll find a ton of inspiration for DIY projects.

, Now you’ll have a whole list of DIY projects to get going on. You’ll also be able to accomplish your work more systematically.

, Being willing to do it yourself means you already have certain state of mind. However, you have to understand that your projects might not come out perfectly - especially if you are a beginner. You'll gain a serious sense of satisfaction by finishing the project on your own but don't expect it to look like the photos on Pinterest. As you get better your final outcome will look better too. Your first few projects are learning experiences, not failures.

"
"
Choose a project that is within your wheelhouse.,
Decide your timeframe.,
Pick a project that you need to do anyway.",How to DIY2," Recognize your skills and abilities but also your limitations. If you already have some carpentry skills then maybe it isn’t so crazy to try to build your own coffee table. However, if you’ve never used a power tool before you might want to start with something more simple. Don’t put yourself in danger. If you're going to be doing your DIY project with kids, make sure to take their skills and ages into account, too. Younger kids will need more supervision and shouldn't handle things that might be dangerous, such as sharp scissors or hot glue.

, If you just want to spend an afternoon doing something productive then you probably shouldn’t try to paint your entire house. Maybe you can repaint one wall in your living room, but the whole house is probably a little aggressive. Choose a project that fits with your timeframe so that you don’t end up with a half finished project that never gets done. A lot of projects will have a designated time frame, but a lot of this depends on your skill level. Be prepared to be flexible.
If you're planning to DIY a gift, make sure you give yourself enough time to fix any mistakes you might make. Projects rarely turn out perfect on the first try.

, There are always going to be a ton of projects that seem fun to do, but a great way to narrow down your options is to figure out what chores are absolutely necessary. Once you’ve figured that out, you can decide if you’re capable of doing the task on your own. Changing your oil is a great example. Everyone needs to change his or her oil on their vehicle, but maybe you can learn how to do it yourself and skip the cost!
DIY holiday or Christmas decorations are a fun thing to try because there's no pressure. A few mistakes just add to the ""homemade"" look!

"
"
Find the right tools.,
Gather the appropriate materials.,
Plan a specific crafting area.,
Look for instructions.",How to DIY3," This will obviously vary dramatically based on what kind of project you choose to do. Look for correct the tools. The most common tools for DIY projects are glue guns, power tools, hammer, wrench, scissors, Sharpies, cutters, pen and stationery.


Make sure you consider how often you're going to use the tools. That way you can decide between buying a tool, renting it, or even borrowing it from a friend or neighbor. You don't need to buy an upholstery stapler if you're only going to re-cover one chair. You can rent big tools from hardware stores, whereas smaller purchases like glue guns and scissors are a cheaper investment.

, It’s always a good idea to have your materials available before you start the project. Once you start having to run out to the home improvement store every twenty minutes you’ll really lose focus on your project. Make a list of the materials that you need and gather them all before you begin. , DIY can make a mess. It's a good idea to have a specific area designated for your project. Large tables or even outdoor patios are good spaces. If you're going to be using paint or glue, or creating sawdust, consider spreading newspaper or trash bags down to collect the waste.

, Websites like Wikihow are filled to the brim with detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to accomplish basically anything. Instructions are considered a given when it comes to DIY projects. There’s no shame in looking up how to do something if you’re lost. It’s just a matter of taking advantage of the resources that are available to you. Use the bar at the top of the Wikihow website to search for your particular project. Here are just a few ideas:

, While not strictly necessary, installation is much easier if your door is on a flat surface.

, Trace the rectangular outline of the mail slot onto the door.

,,, Line up the front of the mail slot with your holes and attach it with the bolts from the mounting kit. Use pliers or a wrench to ensure the bolts are firmly embedded in the lug nuts. You may have to trim some excess length from the bolts using a hacksaw depending on the thickness of your door.

Purchase the necessary materials and tools.,
Pre-caulk the hard to reach areas inside the frame of the door.,
Set the door in place.,
Secure the door into the frame.,
Install the sill pan and drip cap.,
Caulk around the edges to make sure the seal it complete.",How to Install Entry Doors," You must remove everything covering the ""rough frame"" of the doorway.The majority of doors for sale on the market today come pre-hung--that is, they are already mounted on a door jamb. When installed correctly, they provide the tightest possible seal to keep out the elements.
The door jamb is usually held in place with nails, screws, and caulk. The screws shouldn't be difficult to remove, though the caulk can sometimes be a challenge to strip out. Certain silicone-based caulks or sealants can be loosed with specialized chemical applications available at many hardware stores.
Exterior molding may come off only with great difficulty; there is usually no special trick to it, just the application of leverage via a pry bar.
Pry off interior trim carefully, so as not to damage the surrounding wall paint or paper. Along with a pry bar, it may be helpful to use a putty knife to get between the trim and wall with minimal damage.;
, Use a level to measure the sill (bottom), sides, and top of the frame. If it is not as it should be, you may need to add wood around the frame to make it level.The most common cause of difficulties is the sill. If it is exposed to weather, it is the most likely portion to be warped or rotted. In this case, remove the existing materials and replace them with like-sized boards.

, You must measure the height, width, and depth in order to know the precise size you must have for the door you will purchase.


Do not underestimate the importance of measuring the depth. If the distance between the interior and exterior walls is great but the depth of door jamb on the new door you purchase is small, you will have to add jamb extensions. This shouldn't be too much of a problem unless the distance you have to make up is especially large, but it is something to be aware of.

, Aside from the pre-hung door, there are a few other things you will need:


Wooden shims to hold the new door in place as you attach it to the frame.
Screws or nails to secure the door in place. Make sure the nails or screws you select are of an appropriate length for the jamb and frame you will be nailing through.
An electric drill set to pre-drill any holes and drive in the screws that will attach the door.
Caulk or other form of exterior sealant to prevent leaks around the edges of the jamb.
A drip cap and sill pan (optional), to protect the upper and lower portions of any doorway that be exposed directly to the elements.

, After you have the door in place you will no longer have access to these areas. In particular, look for any remaining uneven spots that can be filled in to prevent air leaks or the collection of water. Especially focus on the sill area. The caulk will dry slowly, so it should still be pliable when you fit the new door into place., It is usually easiest to move the bottom of the door to the doorway and then raise the whole door unit into the frame.


Push shims into the spaces along the sides and top of the jamb to make the door fit snugly in place. You may only be able to do this from the interior side of the house as many exterior doors have molding around the exterior side of the jamb that will limit access to any gap.Check to make sure the door is level before you nail or screw the door into its final position.

, Nail or screw through the jamb into the frame at several points to ensure that it is held firmly in place.


Most pre-hung doors will also come with a few long screws that are specifically designed to anchor the door itself into the frame. Remove a few of the short screws that attach the door to the jamb and replace these with the long screws.

, The sill pan will just screw or nail into place over the sill region, and the cap will have to be attached where the exterior molding meets the outside wall.

, You must cover any remaining gaps to prevent air leaks or water damage.

They can give you a more proper estimate.Always measure twice. Getting the right dimensions is crucial.;
, This space will actually be a 1/4” mortar joint on each side of the panel, but you can simply subtract 1/2” for your measurement., Whether you are purchasing from a dealer or having your panels fabricated, you will need to take your measurements down to the company where they will show you several styles to suit your needs.


Since fabrication won’t be a same-day process, it is recommended that you leave the current window installed until your block panels are ready.
If your panels aren’t being delivered directly to your home, you may want to request a band clamp around the windows. This will help you transport them with less risk of snapping any of the blocks off the larger panel., If you break the old window, be extremely careful clearing the shards. Ensure the you sweep up or clear the area with a shop vac and wear gloves.

, Use a circular saw or a hand saw to make the first cut into the current window frame. This will make it easier to pry out the frame.

, The frame’s material will determine how difficult this process is. For many frames you may be able to use a simple pry bar to rip out the frame.If the jambs are set in concrete or mortar, chisel some of it away to ease removal. When dealing with metal frames cast in the concrete, it is usually best to leave these in place. Ask your glass fabricator for suggestions. , You want the space to be as clear and even as possible before installing the block panel, so remove any leftover caulking and clear the space of any debris.

, The shims will help hold the panel in place, and they will ensure an even placement of the panel in the space. The shims should be about 1/2” (1.27cm) wide and long enough to easily remove once the first round of mortar sets.Install the shims at 3” (7.62cm) intervals, moving away from the corners.

, You can mix batches about five or six trowel amounts at a time. It should ideally have a consistency close to bread dough, which will stop the panel from floating in the space as its sets., This should just be a thin layer between the shims to help form a base before placing the window.

, The panel will be heavy, so have assistance on hand to place the panel. Reset any shims that move while setting the panel.

, Assure the window is plumb and square before continuing.

, Use a trowel and pack the gaps around the shims at the bottom of the panel.Allow it to set, hard to the touch, before mortaring the sides. From inside, scrape away any clumps of mortar with your trowel., Assure that the mortar is firmly set before applying pressure to the window.


Slide all of your shims out and finish mortaring the gaps once the mortar has set.
Allow the mortar to set for two hours and then smooth it out with a striking tool.
Clean any excess mortar off the panel with a sponge while it is still wet.

, Applying mortar at the top gap of the window can produce downward pressure as it sets that can compress and crack the glass. Let the mortar set for a full twenty-hour hours, then fill the entire gap with 100% silicone caulking."

,, You may even wish to videotape your deconstruction so that you can precisely recreate the original winding pattern and connections.

, Bend the tabs gently (and as little as possible) and completely remove the wire from the tabs before cutting the coils of the wind.

, The easiest place to cut is at the tops of the coils at the top of the armature and/or stator posts. Count the number of winds in each coil so that you can rebuild the motor to its original configuration.t

, If it’s in good shape, you can put it back in place before beginning your rewind. You can replace burned or damaged insulation with similar material or insulating tape.

, If you’re more experienced, you may wish to upgrade your wire’s quality, substituting a nylon-and-polyurethane-coated wire for the original enamel-coated wire, for instance.

, Take great care to make each coil tight and precise for the best performance.


When beginning your first winding, leave the end of the first winding free but long enough to reach the first tab. The last winding will attach to the same point.
Crimp all the other windings down as you work to hold the wire in place. You do the winding with one long wire, so don’t cut anything as you go.
Before you crimp the wire down behind the tabs, use a sharp knife or sandpaper to remove the insulation from the wire at the point where it makes contact with the tab. Make sure you only remove as much insulation as is necessary to create good contact.

Remove inputs and outputs to determine the source of the failure.",How to Test a Transformer," Overheating, which causes the internal wiring of the transformer to run at elevated temperatures, is a common cause of transformer failure. This often causes a physical deforming of the transformer or the area surrounding it.If the transformer exterior is bulged or shows what appear to be burn marks, don't test the transformer. Instead, replace it.;
, The wiring should be clearly labeled on the transformer. However, it is always best to obtain a schematic of the circuit containing the transformer to determine how it is connected.


The schematic for the circuit will be available in the product information or on the website of the circuit manufacturer., The first electrical circuit will be connected to the primary of the transformer. This is its electrical input. The second circuit receiving power from the transformer is connected to the transformer secondary, or the output.The voltage being supplied to the primary should be labeled both on the transformer and the schematic.
The voltage being generated by the secondary should be labeled in the same fashion as the primary.

, It is common to attach capacitors and diodes to the transformer secondary to convert the AC power from the output to DC power. This information will not be available on the transformer label.Generally, you can find the transformer conversion and output filtering information on the schematic.

, Turn off the power to the circuit. Remove covers and panels as necessary to gain access to the circuits that contain the transformer. Acquire a digital multimeter (DMM) to take the voltage readings. DMMs are available at electrical supply stores, hardware stores, and hobby shops.Generally, you'll need to attach the leads of your DMM to the input lines to verify that the primary of the transformer is not shorted. The same process will be used to check the transformer secondary.

, Apply power to the circuitry. Use the DMM in AC mode to measure the transformer primary. If the measurement is less than 80 percent of the expected voltage, the fault could lie in either the transformer or the circuitry providing the primary with power. In that case:


Separate the transformer from the input circuit. Test the input with your DMM. If the input power climbs to the expected value, the primary of the transformer is bad.
If the input power does not climb to the expected value, then the problem lies not with the transformer, but with the input circuitry., If there is no filtering or shaping being performed by the secondary circuitry, use the AC mode of the DMM to read its output. If there is, use the DC scale of the DMM.


If the expected voltage is not present on the secondary, either the transformer or a filtering or shaping component is bad. Test the filtering and shaping components separately.
If the testing of the filtering and shaping components show no problems, then the transformer is bad., Transformer failure is usually a symptom of a different kind of failure somewhere in the electrical circuit. Transformers generally have long lives, and rarely burn out by themselves., If the problem causing your transformer to short out is coming from elsewhere in your circuit, it's likely the transformer will burn out again. After you've replaced the transformer, observe it to make sure this does not happen. If it does, you'll need to perform additional tests.


An overloaded transformer will often make snapping and crackling noises. If you hear sounds like these, cut power to the transformer to prevent burnout., If your transformer has an internal fuse, you may not have fuses in the line leading up to the transformer. Otherwise, there should be fuses in the power supply line to the transformer. Check to make sure these are in good condition and replace any that aren't working properly.


Blackness, melting, and deforming in fuses are good indications that the fuse has been damaged. Simple remove and replace these.
In some cases, it might be hard to tell if a fuse is in good condition. Attach your DMM to the fuse with one lead on each fuse end. If current runs through the fuse, it's good., In some cases, the secondary of your transformer may be drawing too much current, causing it to short out. If you have a multi-tap transformer and you receive the reading ""OL"" from the secondary, it's likely the secondary is shorted.


Test this by hooking up the secondary to its circuit and using your DMM to test the secondary lines. If the reading is above the amperage rating for the transformer, the circuit is drawing too much power.
Many common transformers have 3 amp fuses. The amperage rating for your transformer fuse may be labeled on the transformer, but will also be available in the circuit schematic., For linear fuses, you'll only have one input and output. In this case, your trouble is either coming from the input circuit or the output circuit. For more complex fuses, remove inputs and outputs to the transformer one by one to determine what component of the entire circuit is causing the short."

This is because shutters rest inside the window casing, their size determined by the size of the window.


If you're making your shutters yourself, you need the measurements. If you're getting shutters from a home improvement shop, you need the measurements. And if you're getting your shutters custom-designed, you need the measurements. Have these in hand when you go to the store.;
, The shutter needs to be 1/4"" (.635 cm) smaller than your window on all sides, nestled in the casing. So if you're going to pick out your shutters, this is the size you're aiming for. Since you know the size of your window, this shouldn't be a problem.


You can, however, use shutters that don't fit if you don't want them to close. There are many shutters that are used for only decorative purposes. They are attached to the exterior walls and are immobile.

, Your shutters should be exactly how you want them before you begin the painting process. Once they're up, they'll be incredibly difficult to change, even if it's just the tiniest bit. Make sure the shutters you have are the shutters you want hanging.


If you're painting your shutters, be sure to paint every side – all six sides that is, not just the front and back. You want the tops, bottoms, and sides, painted, too. In certain positions, every side is visible.

, In this article, we'll be using terms to describe the hardware that you may or may not be familiar with. Here's what you'll need to hang your shutters:



Hinges. This is the piece that allows the shutter to swing. There are four and they are placed in each corner of the shutter and window casing. They may be referred to as a ""strap hinge.""

Pintle. This is the base of the hinge. It is what is attached to the house.

Tiebacks. This is also referred to as a ""shutter dog."" It is attached to the house and keeps the shutters open. There are two, and they are attached at the bottom of each shutter. They are often decorative.

Pull ring. This is attached to the inside of the shutter. It is what you pull to close the shutters. There are two.

Latches. This is attached to the inside and is used to keep the shutters shut. There is usually one or two.

, ""To shim"" means to place a small wedge in between two surfaces to align them. This will help you get that 1/4"" on all sides. To begin shimming, place one shutter in the window, within the casing. Have a friend hold it as you shim it with a 1/4"" wedge on top and bottom. Position the other shutter and repeat.


Once both shutters are in, re-position them so you have a 1/4"" gap on all sides. Do not remove the shutters just yet.
The wider rail of a shutter always goes on bottom. The simpler panels should face out when the shutters are closed on paneled shutters. On louvered shutters, the louver openings should face down when the shutters are closed.

, If you recall from above, the pintle is essentially the base of the hinge, which is attached the the window casing, not the shutter. To begin:


Hook the two parts of the hinge together.
Position them at the top of one shutter on the casing.
Center the strap (the long arm of the hinge) on the top rail of the shutter, keeping the pintle on the casing.
Using a level, check that the pintle is plumb.

, You want to make marks for both the strap (the arm of the hinge) and the pintle on the shutter and casing. You'll need to do this for each hinge to assure it's centered properly and aligned.

, Set aside the strap and your pen and pick up a drill/driver fitted with a drill bit sized for your hardware’s screws. Then, drill pilot holes at the marks for the pintle and the strap hinge. Screw the pintle to the casing. The strap is left alone for now, as it attaches to the shutter itself.


Repeat this step for the other upper pintle. Remember to mark the prospective holes needed for drilling so everything is centered and proportional.

, Using a level, draw a plumb line with a pencil down the window casing from the top pintle to where you want the lower hinge. This will make it to see if both sides are even. The lower hinge should be centered on the bottom rail, in the same manner as above.

, Screw the two lower pintles to the casing. The same method you used for attaching the top hinges should be used here. Again, don't worry about the straps – they'll go on in a bit.


If you don't have strap hinges, check the instructions that came with the manufacturing information for a more detailed and accurate process for you. As the majority of hinges for shutters are strap hinges, they will be the ones focus on here.

, Now that half the hinge is attached to the wall, the other half needs to be attached to the shutter. You'll be drilling holes into the shutter, so make sure you're on a surface where it's okay it may get damaged.

, If you followed the above instructions, you've already made the appropriate marks and know exactly where to drill. Bore pilot holes at your marks through the strap on the top and on the bottom rails.


Then, using the appropriate screws, screw the strap hinges into position. At this point, the shutter is essentially done.

, Before setting up the shutters, position and fasten the pull rings and the bolt for the latch to one of the shutters. Whether the bolt on the left or the right is up to you.


Place both of them just below the middle of the shutter, where you will be able to reach them through the open window. Take into account your height, yes, but also the height of anyone else who may be shutting the window.

, Once all the pieces of hinges are assembled, your shutters are ready. Move them back and forth to make sure they're in the right place, that they swing comfortably, and that they can fully shut.

, This is the hardware that keeps the shutters open; they're attached to the exterior walls of the house. Open the shutters all the way to begin the process. Here's how:


Position each tieback or shutter dog on the siding under the shutter, 4 inches in from the shutter’s outer edge and 1 inch below the bottom edge.
Check that it can indeed hold the shutter open. Do this by holding the bolt up against the house. Then, spin it sideways to check that the shutter can swing close, clearing it.
Once everything's where it should be, mark the bolt’s location and drill a pilot hole on that mark.
Twist the bolt into the siding with a wrench. Repeat this process for the other side.

, This is done on the inside of your house – the outside is done! Close the shutters and move to the inside of the window. This part is easiest to do with a friend. Have them hold the shutters closed, while you do work on the inside. Here's what's left:


Position the other pull ring in line with the one you attached before. Mark the screw holes, drill pilot holes, and attach the pull ring.
Position the latch. It should be in line with the bolt and the pull should be below it. Slide the bolt into the latch to test it – it needs to lock properly when closed. Again, mark the screw holes, drill pilot holes, and attach the latch.

, With a bit of silicone adhesive, squeeze a bead on the underside of the copper capping and slide it over the top edge of the shutter. This will seal the area and keep the surfaces protected.

Check the fan.,
Choose the right motor for the conditions in which it will be run.",How to Check an Electric Motor," If the motor has any of the following issues on the outside, they may be problems that can shorten the life of the motor because of previous overloading, wrong application, or both. Look for:


Broken mounting holes or feet
Darkened paint in the middle of the motor (indicating excessive heat)
Evidence of dirt and other foreign matter having been pulled into the motor windings through openings in the housing;
, The nameplate is a metal or other durable tag or label that is riveted or otherwise affixed to the outside of motor housing called the '""stator"" or ""frame"". Important information about the motor is on the label; without it, it will be difficult to determine its suitability to a task. Typical information found on most motors include (but not limited to):


Manufacturer's Name — the name of the company the made the motor
Model and Serial Number — information that identifies your particular motor
RPM — the number of revolutions the rotor makes in one minute
Horsepower — how much work it can perform
Wiring diagram — how to connect for different voltages, speeds and direction of rotation
Voltage — voltage and phase requirements
Current — amperage requirements
Frame Style — physical dimensions and mounting pattern
Type — describes if frame is open, drip proof, total enclosed fan cooled, etc.

, Many electric motor failures are caused by bearing failures. The bearings allow the shaft or rotor assembly to turn freely and smoothly in the frame. Bearings are located at both ends of the motor which are sometimes called ""bell housings"" or ""end bells"".


There are several types of bearings used. Two popular types are brass sleeve bearings and steel ball bearings. Many have fittings for lubrication while others are permanently lubricated or ""maintenance free"".

, To perform a cursory check of the bearings, place the motor on a solid surface and place one hand on the top of the motor, spin the shaft/rotor with the other hand. Closely watch, feel, and listen for any indication of rubbing, scraping, or unevenness of the spinning rotor. The rotor should spin quietly, freely and evenly.

, A small amount of movement in and out (most household fractional horsepower types should be less than 1/8"" or so) is permitted, but the closer to ""none"" the better. A motor that has bearing-related issues when run will be loud, overheat the bearings, and potentially fail catastrophically.

, Most household appliance motors with a shorted winding will not run and will probably open the fuse or trip the circuit breaker instantly (600 volt systems are ""ungrounded,"" so a 600 volt motor with a shorted winding may run and not trip a fuse or circuit breaker).

, With an ohmmeter set to the Resistance or Ohms test setting, place test probes into the appropriate jacks, usually the ""Common"" and ""Ohms"" jacks. (Check the meter's operation manual if necessary) Choose the highest scale (R X 1000 or similar) and zero the meter by touching both probes against each other. Adjust the needle to 0 if possible. Locate a ground screw (often a green, hex head type) or any metal part of the frame (scrape away paint if needed to make good contact with metal) and press a test probe to this spot and the other test probe to each of the motor leads, one at a time. Ideally, the meter should barely move off the highest resistance indication. Make sure your hands are not touching the metal probe tips, as doing so will cause the reading to be inaccurate.


It may move a fair amount, but the meter should always indicate a resistance value in the millions of ohms (or ""megohms""). Occasionally, values as low as several hundred thousand ohms (500,000 or so), *may* be acceptable, but a higher number is more desirable.
Many digital meters do not offer the ability to zero, so skip the ""zeroing"" information above if yours is a digital meter.

, Many simple ""across the line"" single-phase and 3-phase motors (used in household appliances and industry respectively) can be checked simply by changing the range of the ohm meter to the lowest offered (R X 1), zeroing the meter again, and measuring the resistance between the leads of the motor. In this case, consult the wiring diagram of the motor to be sure that the meter is measuring across each winding.


Expect to see a very low value of resistance in ohms. Low, single digit resistance values are expected. Make sure your hands are not touching the metal probe tips, as doing so will cause the reading to be inaccurate. Values greater than this indicate a potential problem and values significantly greater than this indicate the winding has failed opened. A motor with high resistance will not run - or not run with speed control (as is the case when a 3-phase motor winding opens while running).

, Most capacitors are protected from damage by a metal cover on the exterior of the motor. The cover must be removed to access the capacitor for inspection and testing. A visual inspection might indicate oil leaking from the container, bulges in the container, or any holes in the container, burnt smell or smoke residue — all potential problems.


Electrically checking a capacitor can be done with the ohm meter. Placing the test probes on the capacitor terminals, the resistance should start low, and gradually increase as the small voltage supplied by the meter's battery gradually charges the capacitor. If it stays shorted or does not rise, there is probably an issue with the capacitor and may need to be replaced. The capacitor will have to be allowed 10 or more minutes to discharge before attempting this test again.

, Some motors have centrifugal switches used to switch the start / run capacitor (or other windings) ""in"" and ""out"" of the circuit at a specific RPM. Check the switch contacts are not welded closed or are contaminated with dirt and grease that could prevent a good connection. Use a screwdriver to see if the switch mechanism and any spring can be operated freely.

, A ""TEFC"" type motor is a ""Totally Enclosed, Fan Cooled"" type. The fan blades are behind metal guard on the back of the motor. Make sure it is securely fastened to the frame and is not clogged with dirt and other debris. The openings in the rear metal guard need to have full and free air movement; otherwise, the motor will overheat and eventually fail.

, Check that drip-proof motors are exposed to directed water spray or moisture, and that open motors aren't exposed to any water or moisture at all.


Drip-proof motors can be installed in damp or wet locations, so long as they are installed in such a way that water (and other liquids) can not enter due to gravity and must not be subjected to a stream of water (or other liquids) directed at or in it.
Open motors are, as the name implies, completely open. The ends of the motor have rather large openings and the windings in the stator windings are plainly visible. These motors should not have these openings blocked or restricted and should not be installed in wet, dirty or dusty areas.
TEFC motors on the other hand, can be used in all the previously mentioned areas but must not be submerged unless designed specifically for the purpose.

If the motor has wires already attached, connect the white wire to the positive end of the battery and the black wire to the negative end.If the motor does not turn, it's possible that your battery is not sufficiently powerful to run the motor. Try a battery with a higher voltage. Similarly, if the motor is turning faster than you want it to, try a lower voltage.
Note that a battery which is too powerful can cause your motor coils to melt.It's a good idea to check the rating on your motor before you start hooking up batteries.

, Disconnect the wires from the battery and reattach them on the opposite ends of the battery (i.e. white to negative, black to positive). Reversing the polarity should cause the motor shaft to turn in the opposite direction.


If the motor does not turn in the opposite direction, it may be that the motor you have selected is not suitable. While most DC motors are easily reversible, some are not.

, In part 2, you'll be installing a double pole, double throw (DPDT) switch that will allow you to change the direction of the motor.These switches can be purchased inexpensively at many electronics or hobby stores. Before proceeding any further, check the rating on your switch to make sure it can handle the power of the battery you'll be using.


A switch which is not rated highly enough may melt as a result of having too much electricity sent through it., To help you remember which wire is supposed to be attached where, it's a good idea to get four different colors of copper wire, and write down which color of wire you'll be using for each connection.


You'll need one color for the positive terminal of the battery, one for the negative battery terminal, one for the positive terminal of the motor, and one for the negative terminal., Position the switch so that, looking down at it, you have two vertical rows of three terminals each (i.e. so that the switch could be moved up and down, not left to right). Then, using a soldering iron, attach a long piece of wire to the top-left terminal of the switch. This wire will eventually connect to the positive terminal of your battery.


After firmly attaching the first wire, take a small piece of wire of the same color (e.g. white), and run it from the top-left terminal, where you've just attached your battery wire, to the bottom-right terminal of the switch. Attach with solder., Take a long piece of wire of another color (e.g. black), and solder it to the bottom-left terminal of the switch. This wire will eventually connect to the negative terminal of your battery.


Then, take small piece of wire of the same color, and run it from the bottom-left terminal, where you've just attached your battery wire, to the top-right terminal of the switch. Attach with solder., Attach one piece of each of the two remaining colors of wire to the two center terminals with your soldering iron. These wires will run to the positive and negative terminals of the motor itself.


For example, if your remaining wires are yellow and blue, attach a yellow wire to the center-left terminal and a blue wire to the center-right terminal.

, Take the wires attached to the center terminals of the switch and attach them to the motor, using your soldering iron.


The wire attached to the center-left terminal of the switch should be attached to the positive terminal of the motor, the wire attached to the center-right terminal of the switch to the negative.Before proceeding any further, make sure the switch is in the central (off) position. Otherwise you may give yourself a shock or burn when hooking up to the battery.

, Attach the long power wires to the battery, with the one soldered to the top-left terminal of the switch going to the positive end of the battery, and the bottom-left to the negative end.


Depending on your battery, you may be able to wrap the ends around your terminals, or you may have to simply press them against the ends.
Attach the ends of the wires to the battery terminals using electrical tape. Do not leave any of the wiring exposed, as it may become hot while in use.

, Your reversal switch should now be operational. When the switch is in the central position, the motor should be off. The up position should make the motor move forward, and the down position should make it move backward.


If you find that the up down positions of the switch makes the motor move in directions opposite to what you would prefer, simply re-orient the switch, or you can switch the wire connections to either the battery or motor terminals.Don't switch both the motor and battery terminals, or you'll be right back where you started!

Service the generator twice yearly.,
Create a generator maintenance record book.",How to Maintain a Generator1," Even if you're not using the generator, it needs to be serviced. Select dates that fall outside possible severe weather such as heat spells, cold snaps, windy and stormy periods, etc. I generally tell customers to service their generators in the spring and fall times to keep it on a regular schedule (Rae Klepadlo). If you keep pushing off the maintenance, chances are your generator will not work when the time comes. An average service takes about an hour to complete, depending on what you find.;
, Keep this updated with the dates of service and any issues found and fixed.

"
"
Start by checking the overall condition of the generator.,
Fix anything loose, stuck, or fraying.,
Check the distilled water in the battery; top up if needed.,
Change the lubricant oil and filters (super, by-pass, etc.),
Clean the spark plugs.,
Check the bolts.,
Check the fuel.,
Check that the following items are properly calibrated annually or biannually, depending on usage patterns.,
Start up the generator regularly.",How to Maintain a Generator2," Look for corroded elements, loose wires, stuck buttons, etc. Check for any loose connections and frayed wiring. Make sure the area around the generator is clean, and if the generator has sucked in any dirt or leaves make sure to clean out the area. Debris getting into an alternator is the #1 way of destroying a perfectly good generator!

, Seek professional advice if you're not sure what to do. It is best to be safe!

, Also check the battery's voltage. It is generally best to replace your battery every 2-3 years.

, following the manufacturer's instructions. This doesn't need to be done each 6 months; rather this is an annual task whether or not the generator has been operated. Record the yearly change in the record book so that you are reminded each time when it is due. Make sure that the oil level is adequate and top up if needed. Air cooled machines should have their oil replaced every 30-40 hours of run time. Liquid cooled machines should have their oil replaced every 100 hours of run time. MAKE SURE TO USE SYNTHETIC OIL IN AIR COOLED MACHINES!

, For the dollar fifty price tag of a spark plug, it is generally best to just replace the spark plugs annually.

, Note that bolts on the generator will tend to loosen after reasonable usage; this is usual wear and tear caused by the vibrations. Check the gasket head and piston for solid condition; replace if worn or cracked.

, Gasoline that is simply sitting in the generator loses its effectiveness after half a year when not used. You have several alternatives here:


Bleed the fuel and replace it; dispose of properly
Keep regularly used fuel for general farm/household use in fuel suitable containers and top up when needed
Add fuel stabilizer available from gas stations or hardware stores; follow manufacturer's instructions
If you are using a generator as a home standby solution, you should really consider a natural gas or liquid propane generator. These generators do not have any fuel maintenance, other than to make sure your LP tank has fuel in it!

, It is best if a certified generator technician makes these checks:


Fuel pump






Turbocharger






Injectors






Automatic voltage regulator







, If a generator is not used on a regular basis, it is recommended that you fire it up at quarterly intervals to ensure that its workings run smoothly. At the very least, start it after each six monthly maintenance, twice. First check is to see that it is starting OK, second check is to ensure that it will keep starting OK.

"
"
Always clean the generator post-use.,
If there are any signs of corrosion present, treat with an inhibitor product.

,
Store the generator properly.",How to Maintain a Generator3," This means removing grease, mud, organic matter, fuel, etc. Use clean rags to clean it up each time, and a compressed air blower can help to clean out the ventilation fans.

,, A generator should not be subjected to moisture or water. Keep it in a dry space and covered against dust, mud, grime, etc.

Install the switches.",How to Wire a 3 Way Switch," Ensure that the circuit for the room you are working in has been flipped off. This will prevent accidental electrocution and reduce the risk of fire.


Most circuit breakers are located in the garage or basement, but placement will vary from home to home.
When you find the breaker box, locate the breaker that controls the lights for the room you are working on. Flip it to the off position to keep power from traveling down those wires. Most electrical panels label switches for the different rooms in your home.

Use a voltage tester to check that power is no longer flowing to that room.;
, This will affect the way that you perform the installation. You can tell if the power is coming into the switch by removing the light switch panel. If there are two black wires coming into the switch box, then the power is coming into the switch first. If there is only one black wire, then the power is coming into the switch from the light fixture. You can usually use an electrical tester to be sure.

, Before you start installing, take a look at your new three-way switch to identify all of the terminals that you will be connecting wires to.


Traveler wire terminals - These are located on each side of the switch towards the top of the switch.
Ground wire terminal - Older switches may not have this, but all new switches must. This is located on the top or bottom of the switch, mounted to the frame.
Common wire screw - This is located on the left side of the switch, and is a different color than the two traveler terminals.

, You will likely need larger boxes than you already have if you are replacing a regular single-pole switch. Three-way switches involve more cables, so you will need a little more room to work.

, Choose 14-3 or 12-3 NM cable, depending on the breaker. 14 gauge wire needs a 15 amp breaker, while a 12 gauge wire requires a 20 amp breaker. You must use this type of cable to ensure correct voltage and the number of wires.


See this guide for details on running wire through your wall.
The first number specifies the gauge and the second number is the number of wires carrying current. A cable for a 3-way will have three insulated wires: black, red, and white.

, Connect the black wire from the power source to the common terminal of the first switch. Connect the black wire from the new cable to the common terminal on the second switch.

, Connect the white wire at each end of the new cable to the travel terminal on the right side of the switch. Mark this wire with black tape to indicate that it is ""hot"" (white wires usually aren't).

, Connect the red travelers to the left traveler terminals on each switch.

, Use the ground wire from the new cable.

, When you pulled out your old switch, there was a white wire attached. Connect this white wire to the white wire that is connected to the light. Use a wire nut to connect them. Consult your local electrician or hardware store to ensure you’re using the proper size wire nut for your set up.

, This black wire used to be attached to the old switch, and runs directly to the light. Connect this to the black wire in the new cable, on the first switch end. Use a wire nut to connect them.

, Connect the ground wire from the power source, the ground wire to the light, and the ground wire from the new cable to the ground terminal on the first switch. Use a wire nut to connect them all.

, Now that both switches have been wired, you can screw them into the electrical boxes installed in the wall. Turn the breaker back on, and then give the switches a test.

, Since the power comes from the light, you will need to transfer this power to the second switch. Connect the black wire from the light to the black wire on the new cable in the original switch box. Use a wire nut to connect them.

, Connect the white wire from the light to the common terminal on the first switch. Mark the wire with electrical tape to indicate that it is hot. Connect the black wire from the new cable to the common terminal on the second switch.

, Connect the white wire on both ends of the new cable to the left traveler terminals on each switch. Mark them with electrical tape to indicate that they are hot. Connect the red wire on both ends of the new cable to the right traveler terminals on each switch.

, Connect the ground wire from the new cable to the ground terminal on the second switch. Connect the ground wire from the new cable and the power cable from the light with a wire nut. Make sure the nut is fastened securely. Connect these to the ground terminal on the first switch.

, Now that both switches have been wired, you can screw them into the electrical boxes installed in the wall. Turn the breaker back on, and then give the switches a test. Once you’ve determined all is as it should be, put your cover plates back on."

Install LED bulbs in hard-to-reach light fixtures.,
Use LED lighting in your heavily trafficked areas.,
Improve your task lighting using LED bulbs.,
Fit your outdoor flood lights with LED bulbs.,
Accent art or other architectural features with LED lighting.,

Don't necessarily consider LED lighting as just a low cost replacement for incandescent light bulbs.",How to Use LED Lighting in Your Home," One of the chief advantages of LED bulbs is their long life - often in excess of 10 years. This makes them ideal for hard-to-reach fixtures in which bulbs are a pain to replace. This can include recessed lighting on a very high ceiling or high-hanging pendant lamps.;
, Of course, you want to see a reduction in your energy bill to justify the high upfront cost of LED bulbs, so it makes sense to install them primarily in areas that get a lot of use. Replacing only the bulbs in your kitchen or living room, for example, will help you get the most out of the low energy consumption of these bulbs.

, LED bulbs typically provide a clean, bright light that is sometimes criticized against the warm glow of incandescents. However, this clean light makes LED bulbs ideal for task lighting. Consider using LED bulbs to light your desk or kitchen workspace, where they can actually reduce strain on your eyes by providing bright and clear lighting.

, Large halogen bulbs have long been the mainstay of outdoor security lighting, but these bulbs produce an intense amount of heat and burn out very quickly. Instead, try using LED bulbs in your floodlight fixtures. They use less energy, which makes keeping them on all night a more sustainable solution, and they do not have to be replaced as often, which is great for hard-to-reach flood lights.

, Another benefit of LED bulbs is that they are available in incredibly small sizes. This allows them to be unobtrusive, which is great for lighting a piece of artwork or an architectural feature without competing for attention. The clean light of LEDs also allows the artwork to be presented as naturally as possible.

, It opens up all sorts of new possibilities, not least because the bulbs don't give off heat and can therefore be placed in otherwise unusable locations. Bear in mind though that because LEDs tend to be extremely bright they are is often best used indirectly."

Test your work.",How to Replace a Ceiling Light Socket," To replace a light socket in the ceiling, you'll need some basic electrician's tools to complete the job safely. It's good to have:


A razor, to cut around fixture if there’s paint
Lineman’s pliers
Screwdriver
Non-contact voltage tester
Wire strippers
Extra wire nuts;
, Any time you're working with electricity, you need to locate the breaker that corresponds to that particular fixture and shut it off. You can test the power by flipping the light switch and making sure that it doesn't turn on. It's also a good idea to use a non-contact voltage tester to make sure the fixture isn't getting power.

, Decorative fixtures like globes will need to be removed first, gently unscrewing or unfastening the connections and putting the piece aside. You might need to use a screwdriver, but most fixtures will probably just use thumbscrews that you can remove by hand. Remove the lightbulb or bulbs, as well to expose the socket itself for examination.

, You need to figure out how the fixture is attached to the ceiling, before you go unscrewing it. Most fixtures are attached in one of two ways. The first method involves simple screws that go through the fixture into the junction box in the ceiling. The second involves a threaded post that extends through the fixture from behind and attaches with a decorative cap nut, usually a small knob in the center of the fixture.

, There are typically two or three screws holding the fixture itself to the bracket. Lower the fixture down, exposing the wire connections. Once the fixture is down, use your hands or pliers to undo the wire nuts.


Wire nuts are the plastic cone-looking pieces covering the ends of where the wires come together, connecting the black and white wires coming from the fixture to the wires coming from the ceiling. There might also be a ground wire from the fixture attached to the metal of the junction box in the ceiling by a screw.

, The junction box is a round, square or octagonal box, usually made of plastic, in the ceiling under where the fixture used to be. Normally there will be white and black wires.

, Not all fixtures are a simple set of wires coming into the box, especially in large houses. Some fixtures are wired in parallel with others, making the tangle somewhat confusing. The wires from the fixture will the connected to wires of the same color coming from the ceiling. In some countries, different color codes apply to wires, especially in older installations.

, If they are not, carefully remove the rubber covering from the 1/2"" of the ends of the wires using wire strippers.


Some of the wires may be loose, or you may need to use pliers to untwist them. If ends of wires are damaged or bent, you may need to clip them and strip them again.

, The wiring from the fixture should be exposed and ready to be attached. It's sometimes helpful to set the new fixture on something to allow you to work on it without it hanging down, if possible, like the top of a ladder.


The length of the exposed wire should match the manufacturer’s recommendation for the wire nuts, usually around 3/8ths to ½ in of exposed wire.

, The wires should be reattached in the same places as the old fixture, usually white to white, black to black, and ground (bare copper) to the metal junction box. Neutral wire–usually white–should be attached to neutral wire. Twist the wires two or three times together clockwise, or the same direction you turn the wire nuts.


You can use either the old wire nuts or the new ones provided with the fixture. To use the wire nut, place the stripped ends of each wire next to each other, with their points facing the same direction. Then place the wire nut over the ends and twist clockwise until the wires are secured inside the wire nut.

, If there is, either remove the nut, trim the exposed end, and replace the nut, or cover with electrician's tape. Give a quick tug on each wire to make sure they’re not going to come loose.

, Once all connections are made, gently tuck them back into the box as you’re lifting the fixture up. You don’t want to overstuff. Once the majority of your wires are in the box, you can loosely screw in the fixture to the bracket. Once it’s installed but not fully tightened, make sure you won’t pinch any wires and tighten the fixture.

, Once your fixture is installed to the bracket, you’ll install the bulb following manufacturer’s recommendations about the wattage. Then you can flip on the circuit and check your work.


If it doesn’t turn on, most likely culprit is a loose connection. Check to make sure that the wires didn’t come loose while you were tucking them into the box. Also, check that bulb is the proper type or that another switch isn’t interfering with anything.

Pick an incandescent switch for traditional bulbs that gives off light when the filaments heat up.
Opt for an electronic low-voltage switch if the bulbs are small and used for decorative lighting.
Buy a fluorescent switch, a special dimming ballast, for fluorescent lights that contains a gas that lights up when charged.
Select a dimmer switch that is intended for CFLs (Compact Fluorescent Lights) which use less power and last longer.;
,


Locate your circuit breaker box and the circuit breaker specific to the lighting fixture to be wired.
Turn off that circuit breaker.

,


Remove the faceplate from the switch with a screwdriver.
Touch a non-contact voltage detector to each of the 2 screw terminals.
If it lights, electricity is still on, and you are at risk, so return to the circuit breaker to determine if it is off and/or if it is the correct circuit breaker.
If the voltage detector does not light, the electricity is off, and you can proceed.

,,,


Keep the wires separate; they are stiff and likely to stay in place when you bend them.






Strip insulation away to expose 3/8 inch (0.9525 cm) of wire.

,


Use needle-nose pliers to wrap the wire tips around their respective terminals.
Use a screwdriver to tighten the screws at the terminals to secure the wires.

,


Pair each wire from the electric box with the respective wire on the dimmer switch.

Always test the power by flipping the light switch a few times before proceeding.;
, Use a Phillips screwdriver to unscrew the mounting screws, and bring down the light fixture. It is helpful to have someone to hold the fixture as you uncap the wires and remove any electrical tape. Untwist the fixture wires from the house wiring., Houses built before 1985 may have wiring for fixtures rated at 90 degrees and less. Most of the more-recent fixtures require wires that can withstand hotter temperatures.

Look for wires marked NM-B, UF-B, THHN, or THWN-2. These wires are approved for the higher-temperature fixtures.

,

According to the National Electric Code (NEC), a fixture that weighs 50 pounds or more will have to have its own independent electrical box.

, This will save time and arm strain later.

Adjust the length of the rod by aligning the canopy with the crossbar and allowing a little screw thread to extend through the canopy.
Lock the length in place with a lock nut.
Thread the screws into holes on each side of the crossbar. If you're using a rod, thread it into the center hole of the crossbar.

,,, The ground wire is the bare cooper wire and should be connected to the green grounding screw in the crossbar. Wire black to black and white to white.

Have a helper hold the rest of the fixture while you connect the wires.

,, Most light fixtures will have a keyhole-shaped hole. Align the head of the screw into the wider part of the hole, and twist the fixture to the narrower part. Tighten the mounting screws.

Switch the breaker of your fuse-box so the fuse for the circuit supplying electricity to your fixture reads ""Off.""It's always a good idea to double-check the flow of electricity by checking the light itself before moving forward with this project. Flick the light on, and if the circuit has been disabled, the light should stay off.;
, If the light you are wiring is in the ceiling, you should clean any cobwebs and dust before attempting to install your new fixture. The same is true for lights or switches in walls; a clean work area will improve your ease of installation.


If you are using a ladder to reach your light fixture, or are in a less than ideal position, be sure the ground is also clear of debris or anything else that might affect your balance or safety.

, There is usually, but not always, a decorative globe, shield, or some kind of external feature covering your existing light fixture. This could also be something more involved, like ceiling fan blades., There will be a mounting bracket holding your old fixture in place. You will need to unscrew this from mounting bracket, usually with Phillips-head screwdriver, and then pull it from the bracket.


Be sure you support the old fixture with your hand as you unscrew it from the mount. If you do not support the fixture, it could fall to the floor once you loosen the screws holding it in.

, Allow the unscrewed fixture you are supporting with your hand to descend a few inches below its mount. You will likely see three wires attached to your fixture: a hot wire, grounding wire, and neutral wire. You will need to use your free hand to uncouple these wires, twisting the wiring cap to free the wires from each other.


Hot wires are those that run electricity to your fixtures and grounding wires are intended to offer surge electricity a neutral point, like the earth, into which it can dissipate.In some cases, a grounding wire might be attached to the mounting bracket itself, rather than a house wire. This is fairly common in new light fixtures.

, You should see plastic caps, called wiring caps (also called a wire nut), with two wires running into each cap. One wire will come from the light, the other from the main electrical circuit of your house. Disengage the wires by twisting the wiring cap until it comes free.Once you have released the light from its wiring, you can set the existing light fixture aside.

, In most cases, the mounting hardware for your new fixture will fit the bracket that's already installed.You'll need to hold the new light fixture up to the existing mounting bracket and compare fasteners and size to make sure you don't need to install a new mounting bracket.

, Oftentimes, if a light requires a special bracket, this will be included with the light you have bought. If not, you can look up the light information online by doing a general search of the name of the light fixture, which you can find on the box. Listed with its information should be mounting information as well.


Once you know the kind of bracket you need, you can find and purchase it at your local hardware store.
Replacing the old bracket is just a matter of unscrewing it and screwing the new one into place.

, This is especially important if you have an older home, in particular, any home built before 1985. Wiring installed prior to 1985 has weaker insulation than contemporary circuits, meaning the heat generated by your fixture could cause a short, fire, or worse.


Fixtures unsafe to use for older wiring will have a warning label that says, “Use wire rated for at least 90 degrees C.” Fixtures without this warning will still be suitable for your pre-1985 wiring., Depending on your country, the colors that code which wires are live, ground, and neutral may differ. In any case, you should support your new light with one hand and take each like colored wire coming from your wall or ceiling and combine it with its mate coming from the light fixture. Twist the exposed ends of the wire together, and seal it by screwing on a wiring cap. A general guide to electrical wiring color code is as follows:CA:Live - black (single phase), red (with a second hot wire)Neutral - whiteEarth/ground - green, green and yellow, or bare copper

UK:Live - brown, black, or redNeutral - blueEarth/ground - green and yellow

USA:Live - black (single phase), red (with second hot wire)Neutral - whiteEarth/ground - green, green and yellow, or bare copper, If there is a remaining wire that is green, green and yellow, or bare copper, you should screw it into place on the mounting hardware for your light fixture. There will likely be a small screw for this purpose on the fixture, which you can unscrew slightly, slot the wire into the gap between screw and fixture, and then tighten to fasten your ground.Be sure your ground wire feeds to a place it can safely disperse an electrical current. Many metal surfaces can be suitable for this purpose.

, Continuing to support your fixture with your hand, hold it in place so as to line up the screw holes with those of the bracket and screw it into the mount using the hardware that came with the fixture.

, There may be external features or parts, like a light cover or ceiling fan blades, to add to your new light fixture. Take a moment to step back and inspect your fixture for levelness, orientation, and flushness with the surface on which you've installed it. Some light fixtures are permanently angled a certain way, and improper installation can lead to your light shining where it does little good.

, Return to your fuse-box and reset the fuse for the room in which you've been wiring to restore the flow of electricity to the room. Now you can install a light bulb and turn on the new light fixture you have installed to test it out., Sometimes, over the course of installation, a wire might be jostled or damaged in such a way as to compromise its ability to transmit electricity to your new light. Additionally, in some cases, contractors may have used different colored wires for your electrical setup. In both of these cases you should use a circuit tester to ensure you don't make a dangerous mistake with your wiring.


A circuit tester can be purchased at most hardware stores. Turn off the electricity, free the wire you are uncertain about from the old fixture, and then turn the electricity back on, being sure that your free wire is not touching anything dangerous.
Your circuit tester will have two nodes; connect one to the questionable wire and the other to a grounded, metal surface or your ground wire. If the light on your tester turns on, the wire is hot and is supplied with electricity., Some wiring jobs are done haphazardly, with poorly managed wire in the fixture box or wall or ceiling where you are working. After turning off the circuit, hold up your fixture to your mount to approximate how much wire you will need.


Be sure to leave some excess. Wire can become damaged or get brittle over time, in which case, you might want to strip some insulation off the wire to tie a new fixture in to your circuit.

, If you are working with older wire, or if the stripped part of the wire is difficult to work with, after you have cut power to the circuit you are working on, you can strip more wire for greater ease of handling.


It is recommended that you remove about ½"" of wire insulation with a wire stripper or a utility knife. Be sure you exercise care when using a utility knife; you don't want to nick or damage the metal part of your wire., If you have a friend of family member available to assist, it can help a great deal to have this person hold the fixture while you're wiring. If you do not have help available, you can bend a piece of unused scrap wire to hang the light securely from the mount. With the fixture secured, you should be able to use both hands, making the wiring portion a cinch.An assistant is especially helpful when you are wiring a ceiling light. While you are on a ladder or chair, your helper can hold you steady, hand you tools and parts, and take unneeded parts from you as you finish.

Become familiar with cable naming conventions.",How to Wire a 3 Way Light Switch," Head to your fuse box and make sure there is no power coming to the room you're currently working in. Use a voltage detector to ensure that you're not going to shock yourself once you start working.






;
, Before you even start wiring, you want to get the fixtures securely in place so that you can effectively wire everything together. You will need:









Two 3-Way Switches
Two 2-wire non-metallic (NM) cable
One 3-wire NM cables
2 6"" pieces of grounding wire

, Take your power wire, coming from the house, and slide it into the first switch box. Choose a direction that will make it easy for you to then thread the wire towards your second switch box.








, Strip off enough of the rubber coating around your NM wire to expose the wires underneath. Some people prefer to do this before feeding into the switch box, but it doesn't matter.









You want roughly 3"" of wire in the box, and 6"" outside the box.

, Strip 6-9"" on one end to expose the three separate wires, then run the first half into your first switch box. Repeat on the other end and run it into your second switch box. Cut the cable to length if there is extra once you pull through the second box.









This third wire allows power to run to your second switch even if the first one is off.

, Cables must be secured so that, if there is tugging or pulling further down the line, the live wires don't rip out of the box and cause issues. Some boxes have clamps to hold onto the wires. Current electrical codes require any switch box without built-in clamps to have the wires secured within eight inches of the box.









Secure to the center of the stud, in the wall, so that it will not be hit by drywall studs later on if you were to hang anything near the light.

, The only difference is that this 2-wire cable is not a power cable from the wall -- it is a free-hanging cable that you will use to attach the light. Be sure to strip 9"" and pull the wires through into the second switch box.









Be sure to secure all wires within 8"" of the box.

, Strip away 6-9"" of the sheathing and pull your wires in so that they can attach to the light. Again, be sure to use a cable staple to support the wire within 8"" of the box.








, A 2-wire NM cable is actually made up of smaller wires, run together for convenience. You exposed those wires already, but now you need to strip the rubber sheath off of the very end of each of these little wires.








, This will make them easier to attach to the actual switches. You'll hook this around a screw, which you then tighten to clamp down the wire to the light switch.









The should look like little canes.
This is often easiest with needle-nose pliers.

, Twist the two white, neutral wires together in each box and twist on a wire nut. Keep twisting until the wires are secured and the nut stays in place when let go. There are two sets to attach--









The pair in the first switch box
The pair in the second switch box

, Take all three ends and hold them together, then twist on the wire nut so they are all securely fastened together. You should have two wires tracing back through your NM cables, and one hanging ground wire on each set.









This extra grounding wire will be attached to the light switches. It is called a ""pigtail"" in electrical parlance.

, You want to zig-zag them, so they come about a bit like an accordion. You can tuck the wires in the light switch back too -- though they didn't get any work done. Your two switch boxes should each be wired identically, like so:









Two white, neutral wires tied off by a wire nut.
Two grounding wires, plus one pigtail, tied off by a wire nut.
A red wire, with the end stripped and curled.
A black wire, with the end stripped and curled.

, before moving on. By now, the wiring part is actually done. You'll just need to attach the cables appropriately to the switches and light now -- but the fixtures will be uncovered by your wall anyway. Everything ""behind the scenes"" is mostly done.








, Hook the curled end of the wire under the screw, then tighten down the screw to hold the wire firmly in place. This screw is usually in the upper left side of the switch and is painted black, but check the guide that comes with your switch if you're unsure.









Not all switches are made for three-way wiring. Make sure you purchase accordingly.
There should be two black wires in your box -- one from the power source, one leading to the other box. Make sure you use the power wire.

, These screws, often gold, will be on opposite sides of the switch. Hook the red one up to the side with you black power wire, and the black on the identical screw on the other side of the switch.








, There should only be one screw left, and it is for that small, 6"" free cable attached to the grounding wires. Loop it around the screw and fasten it down like any other cable.








, The wiring on the second switch is nearly identical to the first, except for this key difference: the black wire goes to the light, not to the power source."" Once you have this wire screwed down, the rest are identical:











Attach the grouped red and black cables (from 3-wire NM) to the traveler screws
Attach the pigtail wire to the grounding screw.

, You should have a space for a neutral wire (white), a grounding wire, (orange or green) and a power wire (black). They will screw on easily, and your light is set. Replace the covers for the switches, screw them into place, and turn the power back on to be in business.








, If originating from an electric panel or fuse box, #12 copper is the minimum size when connecting to a 20 amp circuit breaker or fuse; #14 copper is the minimum size when connecting to a 15 amp circuit breaker or fuse (aluminum wire on circuits of these capacities has been prohibited for many years).









The size of all the wires in any circuit must be the same size. When obtaining power from a nearby electrical outlet or another circuit device, the new wiring must be the same size as those that supply the outlet.

, The power supply or feed cable should be ""2 wire"" (or conductor) cable plus a ground wire. See below for descriptions and uses of common cable types.








, This is a very important step. Please do not skip it.








, Leave 8–10 inches (20.3–25.4 cm) of wire inside both boxes (source and first switch) before cutting the cable to facilitate easy connection to the switch and power source. Connect the ground wire to the circuit ground wire(s) with a wire nut or other approved connection (see How to Connect Electrical Wire). The ground wire should be connected to the neutral terminal bar. Finally, connect the black wire to the hot supply or the circuit breaker / fuse and the white to the neutral supply or neutral terminal bar in the electrical panel.









If equipped with a separate ground bar, rather than connecting to the neutral terminal bar, the ground wire can connect to the ground terminal bar. However, if all the existing ground wires connect to one bar and all the existing white wires connect to a different bar, maintaining separate ground and neutral connections is required.

Never introduce ground wire(s) to a terminal bar with only white or gray insulated wires connected or vice versa.
If the power source is an electrical panel or fuse box, the cable should be cut at least long enough to reach the furthest termination point (breaker or fuse, ground and neutral bar) without the need of splicing.

, Leave 8–10 inches (20.3–25.4 cm) of wire inside each of the boxes before cutting the cable to facilitate easy splicing and connection to the switch and fixture.









A 3 wire cable has an ""extra"" wire when compared to 2 wire cables, and this wire is nearly always covered in red insulation. This third wire is necessary for 3-way switch installations.

, Leave 8–10 inches (20.3–25.4 cm) of wire inside each box before cutting the cable to facilitate easy splicing and connection to the fixture.








, Provide as shorter lengths (8 inches/20.5 cm) of bare or green insulated wire to this wire-nutted group to allow connection to green ground terminal screws on each device in the box (switches, outlets, fixtures, etc.) - one length of insulated wire per ground terminal screw. If the switch or junction box is metal, it too must be securely grounded with a green ground screw or approved grounding clip. This must be done at each and every box that a cable enters and at each device that provides a termination point for ground.









It is highly recommended that you complete these ground connections first, and then gently fold them into the rear of the box - out of the way - leaving only the shorter ground leads out for easy connection to devices.
No ground connection is made to plastic, fiber or another non-conductive box.

, First, connect all ground wires as previously described. The 2 wire cable feed from the power source enters the bottom of the switch box and the hot (black) wire connects to the common or shunt terminal on the 3-way switch. There is only one such terminal on a 3-way switch, and it is usually identified as the one having a different color terminal screw (often significantly darker) from the other two terminal screws (not counting the green ground screw).









Connect the 3 wire cable's white insulated wire (neutral) directly to the 2 wire 'feed' white insulated (neutral) wire with wire nuts (there is no connection of any white wires to this switch).

, The 3 wire cable enters through the top of the first switch box. The red insulated wire connects to either one of the 2 unused terminal screws (shown in the image above to be on the top left and right sides of both 3-way switches). It does not matter to which terminal screw this wire is connected.









Connect the black insulated wire to the remaining unused terminal screw on the switch.

, Again, connect all ground wires as previously described, if not already completed. In the light fixture's box, there will be two 3 wire cables. One 3 wire cable originates at the first switch box and has its white insulated wire as a neutral. The other 3 wire cable originates at the second switch box and will become the ""switch leg"". Mark both ends of this wire by wrapping it with black electrical tape to alert others working on the circuit later that it is no longer neutral. This is a newer electrical code requirement, but has been a common practice whenever a white or gray wire is / or can become hot.









Connect the two red insulated wires together with a wire nut.
Connect the black wire coming from the first 3-way switch and the white ""switch leg"" wire coming from the second 3-way switch (has black tape wrapped around it) together with a wire nut.

, Connect all ground wires as previously described, if not already completed. Connect the black insulated wire to the shunt or common terminal screw of the switch (once again, the common screw terminal is the different colored screw from the rest of those on the switch).









Connect the red insulated wire to one of the two unused terminal screws (it does not matter which).
Connect the ""switch leg"" (white wire with black tape) to the remaining unused terminal screw on the switch.

, The light fixture's box should have only a black wire, a white wire and a ground wire to supply power to the fixture.








, Check all wire nuts for tightness and exposed neutral and hot conductor surfaces. Fold all wires carefully into the boxes and secure devices and fixture with screws. Install plates and covers. Restore power and test.








, NM (also called ""Romex"") and UF (""underground feeder"") cables both have plastic jacket wrapped around 2 (or more) insulated wires - including one white and one black - and a single uninsulated wire.








NM is used indoors and UF is used outdoors, when subjected to sunlight, or when buried underground.
NM cable is easier to work than other cable types, requires no special tools or preparation, and costs less. For these reasons, it is widely used.

, Armored cable types are very similar with only slight variations. They consist of a metal jacket formed by an interlocking, helically wound band of steel or aluminum around two (or more) insulated wires - including one white, one black, and often one green. Cables lacking a green insulated wire use the outer metal jacket as the ground conductor.









None of these armored cable types can be installed outside or underground.

, There are unique precautions and instructions for each type and special connectors for armored cables. For example, do not use a Romex connector on an armored cable, even though many connectors appear similar.








, Do this by threading a special green, hex-headed grounding machine screw into a pre-tapped hole in the metal box, or use a special green ground clip.








, All of these cables have ""trade names"" which are basically derived from the number of insulated non-ground conductors and construction type. For example, a ""twelve two (12/2) Romex"" cable has two #12 conductors, plus a full sized #12 ground. A ""fourteen three (14/3) BX"" cable has three #14 conductors, plus a full sized #14 ground.

When you receive your portable field light tower, you will find the following components:

Wheeled trailer with a tongue jack and locking pins
An engine and a generator set within the trailer for power
Light mast with lock bar and winches
Junction box connecting flood lights and mast
Flood lamps, which are already attached to the mast
4 jack handles on trailer
Safety and locking pins and outriggers already present within the trailer and the mast

,
Before you begin the assembly of the light tower, it is better to keep the following points in mind:

Choose a location that is free from overhead wires so that there won’t be any tangling with the mast.,
Pull the tongue jack locking pin in an upwards motion and then twist to a 90 degree angle.,Turning the jack handle in a clockwise direction, raise the trailer off from the towing vehicle.,
On the trailer outriggers, snap the spring loaded pins into place by pulling on the locking pins and rotating them at a 90 degree angle

Repeat the previous step for the locking pins on the rear jack handle.

,To level the trailer, turn the jack handle in a clockwise direction.,Repeat the last step with the other 3 jack handles to root the trailer level on the ground,Adjust the lamps to your requirement by loosening the wing bolts on the lamp fixture.,Firmly connect the lamps to the junction box by tightening all hardware,
Remove the locking pin from the mast cradle.,Remove the safety pin out from the lock bar of the mast.,
Use the lower mast winch handle to raise the mast to a vertical position.,Use the upper mast winch to raise the tower to the desired height.,Make sure that all cables and wires are moving smoothly.",How to Set Up a Portable Field Light Tower," Light tower manufacturing and distribution companies completely know the importance of setting up and getting the portable field light tower in working order as quickly as possible. They also understand that not all companies will have the resources to set up a light tower. For this reason, most light tower companies provide a complete manual that not only provides all the parts and specifications, but also a step-by-step setup process.
,,
Set the light tower up at a place with firm and flat earthen ground for better installation and usage
When raising the mast, make sure it is higher than the general lights that may already be present on the ground.
Bring the light tower to the location and make sure it is level
Block the wheels of the trailer to keep it from moving during installation.

, The twisting will snap the spring loaded pins into place.,,,,,,, Check mast cables, electrical cords, and cable pulleys for any damage.,, Secure the mast lock with the safety pin.,,"
"
Watch for an increase in light brightness.,
Listen: A strange squealing will come from the bulb, or a buzz, this signifies vibration that can cause the connection to break and fail.

,
Notice dimming.,
Observe how long it takes for the light to start up.,
Watch for flickering.,
Notice for light fluctuations.",How to Tell if a Lightbulb Is About to Burn Out," This is the most common sign. The light is much,much brighter than it usually is, that means it is within minutes of burning out.;
,, The light is dimmer than usual, or doesn't turn on. It could be that it blown out already, you are too late.

, The light takes a long time to start up. This means either a bad electricity current, or that it is going to burn out immediately.

, The light flickers, this may mean it is badly connected/screwed in, or that the connection is connecting, and splitting, probably already burned out.

, A fluctuating brightness definitely means it is about to blow up. Disconnect or switch off immediately.

Turn off the power source.,
Unscrew the old bulb.,
Inspect the old bulb.,
Screw in a replacement bulb.,
Consider an energy-saving alternative bulb.",How to Screw in a Lightbulb1," If there’s a switch that controls the light, turn the switch off. Similarly, if the light is battery operated, remove the batteries. If the light fixture is plugged into the wall, unplug it.;
, Grasp the bulb, keeping your hand as close to the base as you can. Gently twist the lightbulb counterclockwise. If you feel too much resistance you may need to put on heavy duty work gloves before unscrewing. If the bulb breaks your hand will be protected from the sharp glass shards. Then you can try to remove the base of the bulb by hand.If the bulb breaks and you can’t get the base out with the gloves, dispose of the shards properly and clean the area. Next, use needle nose pliers to grasp the base of the light and turn it.

, Be sure that the lightbulb has really gone out. Usually a bulb goes out because it’s old. However, sometimes there may be problems with the light fixture. To test this, put the bulb in another light fixture and see if it turns on. When in doubt, get a new light bulb.


If the bulb has a black spot, you’re using a bulb with higher wattage than recommended for the light fixture. Buy a lower wattage bulb.
If the lightbulb was flickering or burns out too quickly, the old bulb was screwed in too tightly., Gently screw the new lightbulb into the socket using a clockwise motion. Don’t stop turning until you encounter resistance. If you encounter a lot of resistance and the bulb isn’t completely screwed in yet, double check that you have the right bulb size. The base of the bulb should perfectly match the base of the old bulb.If you bought the wrong size bulb, don’t try to make it work. Go back to the store and get the right bulb.
Once the bulb is in place, test the bulb by turning the light back on. If it doesn’t work, unscrew the bulb, blow on the socket to remove debris, and try again.

, Most standard lightbulbs are incandescent. However, if you’d like to use energy efficient bulbs, you can usually find a Light Emitting Diode (LED) or Compact Fluorescent (CFL) option in your bulb size. These kinds of lightbulbs use less energy and save you money in the long run.A CFL bulb can use up to 75% less energy than an incandescent bulb and can last up to nine years.
An LED bulb can use up to 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb and can last up to twenty years.

Buy the correct size of lightbulb.,
Replace a linear light bulb.,
Remove the dead bulb.,
Put in the new bulb.",How to Screw in a Lightbulb2," There are varying socket sizes for light fixtures. To choose the correct size of bulb, look on the bottom or top of the burnt out lightbulb or around the fixture’s socket. You will see some letters that are occasionally followed by a series of numbers. This is the code for the lightbulb you will need to find at the store. Bring the dead lightbulb with you to the hardware store to find a replacement more easily.Some lightbulbs only have the letter code. If this is the case, you will have to measure the bulb yourself to find the circumference. Multiply this number by 8 to find the code. For example, a 2 1/2” PAR-type lightbulb is a PAR-20. Remember, make sure to buy a bulb with the correct wattage. Otherwise, you risk starting a fire. This information can be found on the dead bulb.

, A linear light bulb is shaped like a tube with metal pins on each end. Most linear light bulbs are fluorescent. However, some bulb supply stores will sell halogen, LED, and CFL linear bulbs as well. First, turn off the light and wait ten minutes for the bulb to cool.Remove any covering over the light fixture and set it aside.


Be careful when removing the light fixture covering. There may be dead bugs or glass debris inside that could fall in your eyes.

, Gently twist the bulb ninety degrees in the direction with the least resistance. The pins on the end will line up with the socket groove. Now you will be able to lower the lightbulb away from the fixture. If you encounter any resistance while lowering the bulb, rotate the bulb more and try again.Be careful when removing a fluorescent light bulb. This kind of bulb is prone to breaking.
Wear safety goggles when removing fluorescent bulbs from a ceiling fixture. Otherwise, it may break get glass in your eye.

, Find the socket grooves on the light fixture. Turn the bulb so that both of the pins can slide easily into the socket opening. Once the pins are in the socket grooves, turn the bulb about ninety degrees in the direction with the least resistance. If you have resistance in both directions, gently push the bulb further into the socket.After replacing the bulb, turn on the light to test the bulb before replacing the fixture covering.
Some handymen prefer to replace all of the bulbs in a fixture at once to save money and time. "

Understand ADA Compliance.,
Learn about Dark Sky Regulated Lights.,
Choose Energy Star labeled light fixtures to lower the cost of lighting in your home by using less electricity.","How to Understand the Differences Between Ada, Energy Star, and Dark Sky Regulations","
In 1991, the United States government enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The law requires the owners of publicly accessible areas to properly accommodate disabled persons. ADA is not specific to lighting, but it does impact fixture design by creating standards for wall sconce projection space and hanging light clearance.
Section 4.4 of the ADA states that ""objects projecting from walls with their leading edges between 27"" and 80"" above the finished floor shall protrude no more than 4"" into walks, halls, corridors, passageways or aisles.""
Lighting manufacturers responded to this law by creating less intrusive fixtures.;
,
Have you looked up at the night sky lately? If it looks different than when you were a kid or you think the stars have lost their intensity, the problem is most likely urban sky glow or ""light pollution.""
Poor or ineffective lighting sources are the source of urban sky glow and the problem is no longer relegated to areas in and around major cities. It is the cumulative result of over-lighting at malls, gas stations, parks and residential neighborhoods around the country.
Also known as Cut Off Lighting, Friendly Lighting or Good Neighbor Lighting, Dark Sky Regulated. Dark Sky Regulated refers to lighting fixtures that cut glare, prevent light trespass, reduce sky glow to eliminate wasted energy. Communities are now passing legislation to enforce environmentally sound outdoor lighting practices.

Glare: Glare is often felt by motorists at night when your pupils adjust to the darkness. A passing car with high beams will cause momentary blindness because of your eyes nighttime state. Home and business lighting can have the same effect on motorist's eyes. By aiming lights downward or using a visor, glare can be prevented.


Light Trespass: A neighbor's spotlight or floodlight shining through your window can be an annoyance. Dark Sky Regulated lights reduce light trespass by aiming lights down, choosing fixtures with hoods or visors and using motion sensors to turn off lights when they are not needed. These lights can also prevent excess light shining onto a street and blinding passing motorists. Artificial light has been shown to affect many species and the ecological community.


Sky Glow: Urban residents often forget what the night sky looks like because of the city's sky glow. This can also happen in suburban and rural areas when exterior lighting is installed incorrectly. To prevent sky glow, properly installed exterior lighting will light areas for security and accent purposes.

By causing glare, light trespass or sky glow, energy is being wasted that could be used for families enjoyment and security. The simple steps of properly mounting spot and flood lights or purchasing Dark Sky Regulated fixtures will prevent a neighbor's annoyance and allow the night sky to shine.
There is no safety, aesthetic or visible benefit in lighting up the sky. There is a way to get back a star filled night with lighting designed to contain the wasted light that goes up and out well beyond the need.

, The Energy Star label identifies products that are designed to meet the highest standards of energy efficiency.Save Money: Products with this label meet strict standards of low energy consumption set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).Protect the Environment: Besides saving energy, when you choose Energy Star qualified products, you help protect the environment from the air pollution associated with power generation. If just one room in every U.S. home had Energy Star labeled lighting, the change would keep one trillion pounds of greenhouse gases out of the air.Quality of Light: Advances in efficient lighting technology have made the quality of light provided by Energy Star labeled fixtures equal to or better than the light cast by traditional lighting.Color Temperature: The color temperature of a light source indicates the color of the light emitted measured in degrees Kelvin. The color temperature chart below shows a range of Energy Star labeled bulbs, from warm to cool.Safety and Reliability: All Energy Star qualified fixtures follow National Fire Protection Association guidelines for fire safety. Compact fluorescents are much cooler to the touch that incandescent and halogen bulbs. Compared to incandescent lighting, Energy Star qualified fixtures.Lighting Your Home: The way we light our homes can make a real difference in our utility bills and to the planet. Energy Star labeled fixtures meet high standards for energy efficiency and quality, so they use less energy without sacrificing performance or design. They are also safe, reliable and provide just the right light and color.
Today's kitchen is much more than a place to cook. The kitchen is not only used for preparing and eating food but also for gathering and many family activities. This makes good lighting an even more crucial design element in the kitchen.

By casting light from the ceiling level with recessed lighting, it has the power to do a wide variety of jobs. Located above the sink, it provides task lighting. Placed throughout a ceiling, it offers clean, unobtrusive general lighting.

The role of the bath has changed in modern years. It is no longer just functional, it is also high fashion. Energy Star labeled bathroom fixtures will accurately show the colors of skin, clothes and cosmetics.

Providing sufficient illumination for to hallways and stairways is crucial for safety. Look for Close-to-Ceiling, Recessed and Wall Sconces that are Energy Star compliant.

Before you go to the trouble of replacing the ballast, you should determine if a bad ballast is indeed the likely cause of the problem.,
Remove the lamps and place them in a safe location.








,
Turn the light off at the switch, as well as at the circuit breaker.,
Before you cut any wires, it is recommended that you check both the hot and neutral feed wires for voltage with respect to ground.,
Unscrew the nut holding the ballast to the fixture while holding it in place with your other hand.,
Take the ballast with you to your local home center or hardware store and purchase a like replacement.,
Install the replacement ballast by reversing the instructions in step 5.,
If you opt for the cutting method, cut the wires so they overlap the fixture wires by about 6 inches (150 mm).








,
Strip about 1/2"" (12 mm) of insulation from the ends of all 8 of the wires.








,
Use a wire nut to connect the blue wire to the blue wire, the red to the red, the white to the white, and the black to the black.,
Reverse step 3.,
Replace the new lamps.








,
Turn on the light.








",How to Replace the Ballast in a Fluorescent Lighting Fixture," First, replace the tubes with new tubes or with tubes that you know are good. Usually, if the lamps have turned black at one or both ends, they are bad, but the only way to know for sure is to replace them with good ones. Note, however, that fluorescent lamps generally burn out gradually over time, not suddenly. If all of the tubes in a fixture stop working abruptly at the same time, it's likely that the problem is not the tubes.
If replacing the tubes does not fix the problem and if the light fixture has one or more ""starters"" (found only in older fixtures), replace the starters. There will be one starter per lamp (tube). The starter is a small cylindrical part (3/4-inch (20 mm) diameter x 1 1/4-inch (30 mm) long) that is twisted into a separate socket, usually located near the end of the fixture or behind a lamp. Starters are very inexpensive (about $2 each) and easy to replace. It is difficult to determine if starters are functional merely by inspecting them visually. Swap with a new or known ""good"" starter to check. If changing the tubes and starters does not correct the problem, the most likely culprit is the ballast.






;
,, (If you are not sure which breaker operates the light, shut off the whole house breaker to be safe.) Turn the metal tabs near the center of the fixture perpendicular to its length. It will fall away from the fixture. Pull it toward you and store it in a convenient place. Do the same with the other side., (And see the alternative to cutting in step 11 before doing any cutting.) The voltage can be checked with a simple voltmeter or voltage sensor. Locate the ballast and follow the wires until you find the wire nuts (caps) that connect wires of the same color (red to red, etc.). If there are no wire nuts, you will have to cut the wires about 12 inches (300 mm) from the center of the fixture on each side. Complete this until all wires are cut or all wire nuts are removed.








, This is best done with a nut driver or socket wrench. Remove the ballast by lowering the side held by the nut, and sliding it in that direction.








, Note the number of tubes in your fixture and their wattage, length, type (T8, T12, T5, etc.). Note also there may be two ballasts in a four-tube fixture, each ballast running two of the tubes.








, Be sure the red and blue wire face the end with red and blue wires, and the black and white wires face the other end.








,,, As a quick and easy alternative to cutting and wiring, simply rotate and pull the wires out of the lamp connectors. A little back and forth rotation (in the manner of a screwdriver) suffices, but is necessary otherwise the wires won't come out. Make a note of the wire colors when you pull them out. To connect the new ballast, simply push the wire into the hole from which you pulled the old wire out and give the wire a tug to make sure it's seated firmly, the same method as used at the factory.








, Make sure the tabs are in the holes at the end of the fixture.

"
Make sure that the power is switched off.,
Prepare a stepladder or other support.,
Rotate the first tube 90 degrees.,
Gently lower the fluorescent tube straight down through the slot.,
Lift the new fluorescent tube into place.,
Repeat this process with the other lamp.,
Test the new bulb.",How to Replace Fluorescent Lighting1," Before replacing a fluorescent light, you should make sure the fixture is not powered on. Do not simply use the wall switch to remove power to the fixture. You can use the fuse box to shut off power to the lamp's circuit. Use a voltage tester to verify that there is no power in the fixture.





;
, Most likely, you will not be able to reach the fluorescent light fixture comfortably from ground level. Position a stepladder underneath the fixture to replace the lamps comfortably and safely.







, Reach up, and gently support the first fluorescent tube with both hands, keeping your hands as close to the ends of the bulb as possible. You will be able to rotate the tube in either direction a quarter-turn until it stops. This action rotates the prongs, that project from each end of the bulb, to a vertical alignment, and so allows you to slide the tube downward and out of the fixture.








, Place the tube gently out of the way, where it cannot roll or be disturbed.








, To install the new light, line its prongs up with the slots in either socket. Push the tube straight up into the sockets, and then rotate it 90 degrees until you feel it lock into place. You can give the lamp a gentle tug to ensure that it is firmly in place.







, Most often, fluorescent light fixtures are designed with two tubes side-by-side. The process for replacing each tube is the same.







, Flip the fuse box switch back on, then flip your wall switch on. See if the new fluorescent bulbs light up properly, noting that fluorescent lamps take a minute or so to reach full brightness. If the new bulbs do not work properly, you may have a defective component in your light fixture that needs to be replaced.

"
Put on gloves and safety glasses.,
Remove any broken pieces of glass from the floor.,
Put down a tarp to catch additional glass if necessary.,
Unplug the lamp if the fixture is plugged into the wall.,
Turn off the power to that part of your house if the bulb is on a wall or ceiling fixture.,
Try to unscrew the metal base counter-clockwise with gloved hands.,
Use needle-nose pliers for more force and precision.,
Try using the pliers from the inside of the lightbulb base.,
If none of the above methods work, carefully assist the pliers with a screwdriver.,
Dispose of all broken glass according to local law.,
Insert a new bulb while the power is still off.",How to Remove a Broken Lightbulb from the Socket1," Always put on thick gloves before handling broken glass to avoid cuts. Ideally, you should put them on over rubber gloves or glove liners to protect yourself from electricity, in case the power is turned back on while you are working. Safety glasses will protect your eyes from glass shards, and are especially important if the light fixture is on the ceiling.


If the light fixture is on the ceiling, a hat in addition to the safety glasses will keep broken glass out of your hair.
Even though you will be removing the power to the light fixture, there is a small chance the fixture is still charged due to faulty wiring.Wear insulating gloves to protect yourself from this scenario.;
, You can use a broom, rag, or vacuum cleaner to sweep the glass into a dustpan and throw it away. Smaller fragments can be scooped up with a piece of stiff paper or cardboard, while glass powder can be picked up with a piece of sticky tape.Warning: Compact fluorescent lightbulbs, also known as energy saving lightbulbs with a coiled shape, can let off mercury vapors when broken. Open windows or doors to the outside, shut off your house's heating and air conditioning, and only use a vacuum cleaner as a last resort., If there is still a fair amount of glass on the bulb, or the bulb is in a ceiling fixture, put down a tarp underneath it to make further glass cleanup easier., If a lamp is broken, all you need to do to remove the power is unplug the cord from the wall socket.

, Locate the panel containing your fuses or circuit breakers and turn off the power to the part of your house that powers the light fixture.Remove the fuse by unscrewing it, or set the circuit switch to the off position.


If your fuses or circuit breakers aren't labeled, remove the power from every circuit. Don't assume the power to the light fixture is off just because you removed the power from a nearby outlet.
If there is no natural light in the room with the broken fixture, find a flashlight before you shut off the power.

, Only ever do this when wearing thick gloves to protect yourself from cuts. If the bulb is in a wall or ceiling fixture, rubber glove liners can protect you from the small chance that faulty wiring causes a shock even with the power off.


Make sure not to drop the bulb as it comes out, to avoid cleaning up even more broken glass.
If you encounter resistance partway through unscrewing, twist slightly in the other direction (clockwise) then resume untwisting. Trying to force your way past a point of resistance could break your light fixture., Needle-nose pliers allow you to safely grab the metal base with the narrow, precise ends of the pliers. They should allow you to twist the metal base off using a bit more force than you can with your fingers. Always twist counterclockwise.


Don't worry if the metal light bulb base begins to tear.This will make it easier to remove, and you will be throwing away the light bulb anyway.
If you do not have needle-nose pliers, borrow some from a neighbor or buy some. Do not try alternate methods without first reading the Warnings section below.

, If you can't grip the outside of the light bulb base, or twisting it counterclockwise from that position, try pointing the pliers on the inside of the broken lightbulb, and spreading the arms outward against either side of the metal base.Twist counterclockwise as before.

, Insert a small flat-head screwdriver between the base of the metal base and the socket.Gently and carefully bend the metal socket inward, just enough to get a good grip on the base with the pliers. Attempt to twist as before.

, You may need to look up ordinances in your area about disposing of light bulbs, or contact your city's trash collection service and ask for instructions. Incandescent bulbs with an actual bulb shape can usually be thrown directly into the trash. Compact fluorescent bulbs, with a coil design, may require transport to a local recycling center in some areas due to their small mercury content.Empty vacuum cleaner bags used for picking up glass into the trash immediately.

, Keep your gloves and safety glasses on and the power turned off. Screw the light bulb in clockwise until you feel a slight resistance. Don't use any more force than necessary.

Change out cracked sockets.,
Inspect the ballast.,
Check the fuse box for flickering lights.",How to Replace Fluorescent Lighting2," Cracked sockets are often caused by other objects bumping into the fixture, or too much stress while removing a bulb. First, turn off the power to the light, and remove the bulbs. Keep the wiring order straight as you take out the old socket. It is important to cut only one wire lose at a time. Strip each wire back by 1







, The ballast controls the amount of incoming voltage that start the light tubes. It also regulates the electricity to give constant light. If you believe that the ballast needs replacement, you may want to consider purchasing a whole new fixture. Ballast replacement may cost the same amount as a new fixture.








A humming sound produced by your fluorescent light fixture usually indicates that the ballast, rather than the bulbs, needs to be replaced.

, The bulb may not be getting enough power. Try resetting the fuse box by flipping the power switch off and on.








If the bulb is still flickering, try replacing the bulb."

Check for light frames.,
Remove the cover.,
Clean the fixture.,
Take out the bulb.,
Lock in the new bulbs.,
Finish the job.",How to Replace Fluorescent Lighting3," Office lighting is usually behind a bezel lens with a frame. These types of recessed fixtures are holding the light tubes in place to minimize accidents and breakage. They can be very frustrating due to the lack of wiggle room or freedom of movement. The frame is held in place by lever locks or snaps that you have to take out.








, First, use a screwdriver to pry down the levers, while supporting the frame in the middle. It is important to support the frame because it can ruin the locks or swing down and hit you in the head.







, Take the opportunity, while the lens is down, to remove insects, dust, condensation or mold from the lens surface.








, Depending on the bulb, you will either need to twist, or unsnap, each end of the fluorescent tube. Be sure to only do one end at a time to maintain more control over the bulb. Once you wiggle the first tube out, the other tubes will come out much more easily.








Search for holes, or a recessed area, that the cathode/anode pin can sink into that permit freedom of movement.

, To install the new light, line its prongs up with the slots in either socket. Push the tube straight up into the sockets, and then rotate it 90 degrees until you feel it lock into place. You can give the lamp a gentle tug to ensure that it is firmly in place.







, When the last tube is in, swing the lens frame back in. Use both hands to support the frame in place. Then, use your thumbs to swing the frame lock back in.









Snap locks may need to be pressed firmly to snap back in."

Pull the brass tab at the base of the socket to the correct position.,
Insert new light bulbs gently.,
Use a clean, dry cloth to wipe the inside of the socket.,
Use an electrical contact cleaner to wipe off heavier corrosion.,
Use bulbs intended for a higher voltage if your light bulbs burn out frequently.",How to Remove a Broken Lightbulb from the Socket2," If your last light bulb was jammed into the socket, it may have pushed a small brass tab too far down to make proper contact with the light bulb.This tab should be raised at a 20º angle above the base of the fixture.If it is not, turn off the power and use needle nosed-pliers to pull this tab gently to the correct position.

, When inserting a light bulb, you should line up the threads on the socket, then turn slowly clockwise. As soon as you feel a slight resistance, stop. If you turn the light on and it flickers, turn it off again and turn only another quarter-turn clockwise.



Warning: Always make sure the lamp is unplugged or the switch is in the off position before changing a light bulb.

, Only do this when you are absolutely sure the power to the fixture has been turned off. Remove the light bulb from the socket if there is one present. Wearing gloves made from rubber or other non-conductive material, take a clean, dry rag or towel and rub it along the inside threads of the metal socket.You may also wipe the outside threads of the bulb base before insertion.


The cloth wipes off rust or other corrosion that has built up on the socket, reducing the chance of both burned out bulbs and a bulb jamming in the socket.
Use a Scotchbrite pad or bronze wire brush if the corrosion won't come off onto a cloth., If there is too much corrosion to wipe off with a cloth, you may need to wipe them with a specialized lubricant. Only use an electrical contact cleaner or contact spray for this purpose.


There are several commercially available products called ""bulb and socket lube"" that can be applied to the socket or the base of a new bulb prior to installation. The product appears similar to Vaseline and greatly reduces the incidence of ""sticking"".
Using any other substance as a lubricant carries the risk of burning out your bulb, blocking the electrical current, or jamming it in the socket., If your light bulbs only last a few weeks or months, they may be receiving too much power. Too much vibration or heat can also wear out a light bulb quickly.A long-life bulb with a slightly higher voltage than recommended for your fixtures should last longer.


In the United States, most home outlets are 120 volts. Use a ""long life"" bulb that can handle 130 volts.
In the European Union and most other European countries, the standard varies between 220 and 240 volts.
Standards vary widely in the rest of the world. If you're not sure what voltage your outlets use, see this list by country and these images of outlet types.

,
Replace the switch plate and tighten the screws into place.,
Return to the breaker box and turn the power to the light switch back on.",How to Replace a Light Switch1," Tell the store employee what kind of switch you want and how many you’ll need, and they can help you determine the best purchase.


Single-pole switches are the simplest and most common. A single-pole switch has just two positions—“on” and “off.”;
, It’s a steel box that may be located inside the house, in the basement, in the garage, or along one of the outside walls. You can either turn off the breaker that controls the lights in the specific room you are working on or turn off all the power to the house by switching off the main breaker.








, Flip the light switch on and off several times to be sure the power is off.

, Using a flat-head screwdriver, turn the screws holding the plate in place counter-clockwise to loosen them.








, Once the switch plate cover has been removed, use a flat-head screwdriver to remove the screws mounting the switch to the wall. Turn the screws counter-clockwise until they are freed from the wall.








, Pull the switch away from the wall to expose the wiring, but leave the wires connected. Use a circuit or voltage tester to ensure no current is flowing.









If using a circuit tester, hold one probe of the circuit tester against the grounding wire (green or bare copper), and touch the other probe to each of the screw terminals (located along the sides of the switch).
If using a voltage tester, simply hold the tester near the wires.
If the tester registers any current, stop the project immediately until you’re able to power off the circuit.

, Pull the switch as far from the electrical box as the wires allow.









Take careful note of how the switch is wired. The wires will be connected to the switch by either screw terminals or push-in connectors.
Take a picture or draw a diagram so you can wire the new switch in the same way.

, Use a marker or colored tape to uniquely label each wire so you can tell them apart.


The box will contain one or two cables (or sets of wires). If the box contains two cables, it means the switch is in the middle of the circuit. You’ll see a total of six wires: two black (hot) wires, two green or bare copper (grounding) wires, and two (neutral) wires, which may be black, white, red, or any other color than green.

Mark the wire connected to the brass screw terminal or to the hole on the same side as the brass terminal as the “hot” wire.
Mark the wire connected to the silver screw terminal or to the hole on the same side as the silver terminal as the “neutral” wire.
Finally, mark the green or copper wire connected to the green screw terminal (on the other side of the switch from the brass and silver terminals) as the “grounding” wire.


If the box contains only a single cable (or single set of three wires), it means the switch is at the end of the circuit. You will see a black (hot) wire, a green or bare copper (grounding) wire, and a third (neutral) wire, which may be black, white, red, or any color other than green.

Mark the wire connected to the brass screw terminal or to the hole on the same side as the brass terminal as the “hot” wire.
Mark the wire connected to the silver screw terminal or to the hole on the same side as the silver terminal as the “neutral” wire.
Finally, mark the green or copper wire connected to the green screw terminal (on the other side of the switch from the brass and silver terminals) as the “grounding” wire.



, The switch may have either screw terminal connectors, which will be located along the side of the switch, or push-in connector holes, which will be located at the back of the switch.









If the switch has both screw terminals and push-in holes, most electricians recommend using the screw terminals for a more secure connection. But do not over-tighten; you may break the internal parts of the switch. If you tighten the terminals and hear a crack, discard the switch and use another.
If the wires are connected to screw terminals, turn each screw counter-clockwise with a screwdriver to loosen and slide the wire out with a pair of needle-nose pliers.
If the wires are connected to push-in connectors, the holes that the wires are pushed into will typically have a small slot beneath the hole. Insert a small screwdriver into the slot and push forward to release the wire.

, Attach the black wire (hot) to the brass screw terminal. Either:









Use needle-nose pliers to wrap a little more than half of the bare wire clockwise around the screw and then tighten the screw clockwise to secure the wire.
Or push the wire into the push-in hole on the same side of the switch as the brass screw.

, Either:









Use needle-nose pliers to wrap a little more than half of the bare wire clockwise around the screw. Tighten the screw clockwise to secure the wire.
Or push the wire into the hole on the same side of the switch as the silver screw.

, Use needle-nose pliers to wrap a little more than half of the bare wire clockwise around the screw. Tighten the screw clockwise to secure the wire.

, You should see the word “top” written on the switch indicating the side of the switch that should be vertically oriented toward the top.

,, Do not over tighten the switch plate, since it may crack under too much pressure.








, Go back to the new switch and flip it on and off several times to ensure it’s in working order.

Close blinds and drapes over the window covering.,
Turn off any extra lights in your house.,
Unplug unused electronic devices.,
Block off the bottom of your door.,
Purchase a sleep mask.",How to Make Your Room Pitch Black During the Day," Several companies make “privacy film,” which is basically removable, cut-to-size plastic film that you can adhere to your windows. While this film alone will not completely block out light, it will reduce the amount of light that comes through your windows., Aluminum helps reflect the sunlight coming in through the windows, so it can reduce your utility bills as well as block light. Use painter’s tape to secure the foil to avoid damaging your windows.


If you rent your home, be aware that some property managers will not allow foiled windows. If you’re not sure whether you’re permitted to use foil, ask first.

, Blackout curtains are usually made from thicker fabrics and have liners that block light. In addition, they can reduce your utility bills because they help insulate your home.


You can also search for “thermal” curtains, which are also heavy and lined and serve the same purpose.
If you really like your curtains, you can purchase just a blackout liner and hang it behind your existing curtains using clips or a second rod. IKEA, Home Depot, and many department stores sell blackout liners., If you’re crafty, you can often sew curtains yourself for much cheaper than purchasing them. Most fabric stores sell “blackout drapery lining” and thermal fabrics that you can use behind any curtain fabric you choose. You can even sew linings into your existing curtains.

, Roller shades, roman shades, and other fabric window shades often block more light than curtains alone. They are widely available from home supply stores, departments stores, and online.


You can also make your own shades from blackout fabric. While these may not be as attractive as purchased shades, they are usually cheaper., Drapes and blinds will help block any light that still comes in through filmed or foiled windows

, Light can pass through the cracks of your bedroom door if you have the lights on elsewhere.

, Many devices have lights to indicate that they’re plugged in, charging, or powered on. These can emit a surprising amount of light in your room, so unplug them when they’re not in use to shut those lights off.


As a bonus, unplugging your unused electronics can save you money on your electric bill -- as much as 10% over a year!You can use a power strip to easily cut power to all your electronics in an area at once. Simply plug all the electronics into the strip and flip the switch to “off” when you’re ready to rest.

, Rolling up a blanket or towel and placing it along the bottom edge of your door can help stop light from seeping in through the crack. You can also purchase or make a “draft snake,” which is a filled tube that covers the crack below the door.

, This is probably the easiest way to immediately darken any room. Many sleep masks even come with aromatherapy scents like lavender to help you relax and fall asleep. Wearing a sleep mask in combination with using blackout treatments will help you get the rest you need.

Head to your breaker box, and turn off the corresponding breaker with the room your broken bulb is located in.






;
, When working with electricity, it is best to double (and even triple!) check your power source before beginning a project. Start by turning on







, When working with broken glass and electricity, you should always wear rubber gloves; gardening or dish gloves work fine. You may also want pliers with a rubber handle, and a cloth for grabbing any broken pieces of glass.








, It is generally considered the easiest to remove and clean a broken lightbulb using a pair of regular needle-nose pliers. Use the pliers to twist the metal part of the bulb in a counter-clockwise motion. The metal may tear off in strips, but this should actually make it easier to pull out. If there is any broken glass still attached to the bulb, you can use the pliers to keep your hands safely away or to pull out the glass before touching the rest of the bulb.








, It may sound strange, but you use duct tape for everything else, right? Cut a long piece of duct tape, and roll it back on itself to create a sticky wad about the size of your broken light bulb. Stick the wad into the center of the bulb and apply a bit of pressure, and then turn the bulb counterclockwise. Any remaining glass should stick to the tape, all while giving you a better grip







, Soap has been recommended as the easiest means to remove a broken light bulb by some, but it may require a bit of cleanup afterwards. Simply push the soap up into the broken bulb; the glass will harmlessly become stuck in the soap, and the soap will give you a means to twist the base. Spin the soap







, The old housewive’s trick of using a potato to pick up broken glass works well in this scenario. Halve a potato, and then stick the raw side into the broken light bulb. The jagged edges will stick to the potato, preventing it from cutting you. Continue twisting the bulb counter-clockwise to remove it from the socket. You may have to wipe up any potato juice left behind with a clean, dry towel when finished.







, Although not everyone has a large piece of cork on hand, if you do, you can use it for removing your broken light bulb. Hold the cork up to the bulb and apply pressure so that the rough edges of the bulb stick to the cork. Then, simply remove the bulb as you normally would by twisting the cork/bulb base in a counter-clockwise direction until the bulb pops out.

The switch may have either screw terminal connectors, which will be located along the side of the switch, or push-in connector holes, which will be located at the back of the switch.

, A three-way switch requires three wires: a hot wire, a neutral wire, and a traveler wire. The switch will also have a green or bare copper grounding wire. The box may contain one or two cables, or sets of wires.


Mark the wire connected to the colored screw terminal or to the hole on the same side as the colored screw terminal (it will typically be a dark color and will not be green) as the “common” wire.
Mark the two wires connected to the other two screw terminals as the “traveler” wires.
Mark the green or copper wire connected to the green screw terminal (on the other side of the switch) as the “grounding” wire.

,


If the wires are connected to screw terminals, turn each screw counter-clockwise with a screwdriver to loosen and slide the wire out with a pair of needle-nose pliers.

,


Connect the black (common) wire to the common screw terminal, which you can identify because it will be a different color than the other two terminals (and not green).
If the box contains two cables or sets of wires, you will attach the traveler wires (typically black and red) to the remaining two screw terminals. Either: A) Use needle-nose pliers to wrap a little more than half of the bare wire clockwise around the screw and then tighten the screw clockwise to secure the wire.

Grab this point firmly using a pair of needle-nose pliers.You'll be breaking glass during this step and during many of the other steps in this process, so it might be best to work over a box or several sheets of newspaper. You should also wear goggles and gloves.;
, Twist the solder point with your pliers until you feel the interior brass break one or more wires connected to the filament. Once the solder point is free, lift it out.


Keep a firm grasp on the light bulb with your other hand while lifting out the solder point.
You may need to nudge the sides of the solder point back and forth if twisting it does not prove effective.
The sides of the metal should be raised enough for you to get a good grip on the tip with your pliers before you lift that point out.

, Hold one side of the black glass insulator at the bottom of the bulb with your pliers. Twist it up to snap the glass apart.


The glass here is thick, so it will take a lot of force to actually break it. Make sure that you hold onto the bulb firmly with your other hand as you work.
The insulator will break into many chips when you do this, so proceed with caution.
You may need to break the insulator from several angles around its perimeter if the entire thing does not break off the first time.

, Use tweezers to clean away any black insulator glass from the socket of the bulb.


These pieces of glass will probably be very sharp, so you should not touch them with your bare hands.
After clearing away the insulator glass, you should be able to see the inner components of the light bulb from the bottom of the bulb.

, Insert a flathead screwdriver into the bottom of the light bulb, next to one side of the interior tube. Press the screwdriver against the side of the tube to break it free.


The bulb will be filled with argon, or a similarly inert and harmless gas. When you break the tube free, you'll here a noise that will signify the release of the argon gas.

, Slide the screwdriver around the sides of the tube to break it completely free, then lift it out with tweezers or pliers.


If you successfully manage to break the tube free without breaking the tube itself, you can reuse it for another project.
If you cannot break the tube free from the sides, though, you may need to twist the screwdriver around more forcefully, breaking the tube itself in the process. Remove the broken shards with tweezers when done.
You'll need to use considerable force, so make sure that your other hand has a firm grasp on the light bulb as you work.

, Gently shake the rest of the filament assembly out of the bulb and onto your work surface.


If the wire is still whole and intact, you can reuse this, as well.
Note that you may need to remove the wire with pliers or tweezers, though.

, If there are any small bits of glass remaining around the interior edge of the bulb, carefully break them off with the screwdriver.


Lift the broken bits of glass away with tweezers.
At this point, the light bulb is open and empty. You may even be able to stop here, but continue reading to determine whether or not that is the case.

, For most projects, you can keep the metal socket piece intact. If you only want the actual glass bulb for your project, however, you will need to remove the socket piece before continuing.


You may want to remove this piece for visual aesthetics. Another reason to remove it would be to create as large an opening at the base of the bulb as possible.
If you want to reattach the metal socket after removing it, you can do so by simply applying a little glue to the top edge and pressing it back onto the bottom of the glass bulb.

, Place a shallow amount of Muriatic acid in a glass bowl. Rest the attached socket in this acid and let it soak for 24 hours.Muriatic acid is a powerful cleansing agent often used for cleaning toilet bowls and other heavily stained plumbing surfaces.
Only use enough acid to submerge the metal part of the bulb.

, After soaking the socket, remove it from the acid and rinse it well under running water.


Use a little soap or a mild base, like baking soda, to neutralize the acid still clinging to the surface of the bulb socket.
Wear gloves while working to protect your fingers from the harsh chemical.

, Hold the bulb firmly with one hand, then slowly twist the socket off the bottom with your other hand.


The acid should have dissolved the powerful adhesive glue holding the metal socket to the glass, making the socket loose and fairly easy to remove.
If done carefully, you should be able to avoid breaking any glass at the bottom of the bulb.

, If you started with a clear bulb, you don't need to clean it out. If you used a bulb coated with white kaolin powder, however, you'll want to clean this powder out before using the bulb for anything.Kaolin is considered a safe substance, but you should still avoid ingesting it or getting it in your eyes. Keep your goggles and gloves on.

, Stuff enough paper towel into the bulb to fill most of it, leaving a long enough ""tail"" sticking out from the bottom for you to grab.


Watch out for any sharp edges or sharp bits of broken glass.

, Using the tail of the paper towel, twist it around the interior of the bulb, wiping away the powder in the process.


Dry paper towel will usually work well enough, but if you have difficulty cleaning the bulb with dry paper towels, consider moistening the towel slightly and trying again.

, If some of the kaolin will not come out, fill the bulb one-quarter to half full with salt.


You'll use the abrasiveness of the salt to help scrub the corners and angles of the bulb.

, Carefully cover the bottom of the bulb and give the entire thing a good shake. The salt should scrub away most of the remaining traces of kaolin.


Place your gloved thumb over the bottom of the bulb to prevent salt from flying everywhere. You could also hold a paper towel over the bottom to accomplish the same goal.
Dump out the salt when done. Dispose of this salt; do not reuse it.

, If there is any salt or kaolin inside the bulb, use your paper towels to clean it out.


The material inside the bulb should be loose enough at this point for the paper towel to catch.
Once you are finished with this step, the bulb is completely open, clean, and ready to use for whatever project you have in mind.

Some bulbs can be reached simply by sliding your hand into the shade and grasping the bulb.
Others require that the shade is removed first to allow you to get a better grip on the bulb itself.
If the shade does need to be removed, check to see if it unscrews or if it has small thumbscrews on the sides that need to be loosened in order for the shade to come off.;
,,, Don't hold it too close to the top, as too much pressure in this spot may cause the bulb to crack.

Stand up the two remaining clips, then clamp the graphite between them.,
Put the glass jar on top of the clips and graphite.,
Attach the final wire to the other end of the batteries to turn the light on.,
Troubleshoot to get a stronger light.",How to Make a Light Bulb1," You should use the kind you get in mechanical pencils -- the thin, solo pieces of graphite that you can usually buy in packs. The thinner, the better -- try something like .5mm thickness.


Pencil lead actually isn't lead at all, it is graphite. Graphite is an electrical conductor, making it a good filament for homemade light bulbs.;
, Everything here is easy to round up at a local hardware store, if you don't already have it all at home. You'll need.


Two strands of copper wire (roughly 1-2 feet, each)
Four electrical clips
One clear glass jar
Five or more batteries

, The ends of each wire should have a clip on it. If you don't have clips, you can still make a light-bulb. To do so, curl each end of the wire into a little round hook.








, This simply means you tape them together, end to end, so that they all work together to provide power. Make sure you line them up positive end to negative end. Then use electrical tape to secure all the batteries together into a long rod.









You must arrange the batteries so that there is a positive node on one end, and negative on the other.

, Usually, you'll have a wire with red clips and one with black. Hook one end of the red clips up to the positive end of the batteries, but leave the other clip off for now. If you hook everything up, you'll actually be turning the light bulb on before you're ready. You could get burned if you're not careful









You can reverse the red and black if you want-- you just need different wires on each end.

Remember you only want to hook up one wire right now.

, Think of making an H-shape, where the two clips are the sides and the graphite is the horizontal line in the middle.









The longer the graphite, the longer your bulb will last.
Use some tape, glue, or modeling clay to help stick the clips face up.

, This isn't strictly necessary, as the graphite would still light even without the jar. But the process creates smoke, and the graphite can shatter. Moreover, having an actual ""bulb"" helps create a more even light.








, You are making a simple circuit, connecting the batteries in an electrical loop. The light comes from the graphite -- as electricity flows through it, it heats up and emits energy in the form of light and heat. Thus, your light bulb!

, If the light is weak, or isn't working, there are some things you can do to make sure you get a working light.



Check the graphite thickness. While larger thicknesses work, 0.5 mm seems to work best.

Add a few more batteries. Also, make sure that the ones you have are touching end to end.
Make sure the wires are snug and well-connected to the batteries.

Finished.








",How to Install Rope Lighting," Note the line of where the rope will run.






;
, Buy a single rope that equals that length, rather than splicing several shorter ropes together.








, Space them every 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm).









Nail the clips in only half the length of the nails. This will give you space to slide the rope lighting in under the clips.

, You will be able to slip some ropes up into the clips, while other arrangements will require you to slide through the open arch of the clips like a snake. In either case, slide the rope through all the clips before proceeding.








,, It's usually better to use an extension cord to reach the outlet, rather than running the rope lighting itself to the outlet.








, Less expensive models lack a switch, so you'll need to plug and unplug the rope -- or plug it into an outlet attached to a light switch.

Frame the skylight from inside while on a ladder.",How to Install Skylights," Most skylights are manufactured with specific roof pitches in mind. It is important to measure the pitch of your roof before purchasing your skylight. Use a level with a ruler on the side to measure the roof run and height to calculate the pitch of your roof.


From the side of the house measure from the corner along the wall 12 inches (30.5 cm) and mark the spot with a pencil. Make sure that this line is level using the bubble on your level. Then use a tape measure to measure the distance between the mark and the underside of the roof. Your roof ratio will be this vertical length divided by 12 (for 12 inches).
Some skylights are also designed specifically for use on corrugated metal roofs.;
, While inside your house mark the location of choice in the wall. Use a hammer to make a small hole in the ceiling in the chosen location. This way you can check if there is any special plumbing or electrical wires at this location.


If there is anything in the way, it is usually easier to simply choose a new place for the skylight. Otherwise, it is possible to re-route plumbing and wires around the location.
The opening should fit in between 2 rafters to prevent structural damage.
If you are installing a skylight on a corrugated metal roof then it should be positioned just below the lap of the roofing and aligned with the grooves on the skylight fins.

, If you have significant space between the ceiling and roof or have an attic to push through then you will have to cut the ceiling from the inside. Otherwise you should be able to make one cut from the top of the roof through all the layers.


Remove any drywall and insulation you cut through.

, After you make sure there is no plumbing or wires in the way and cut a hole in the ceiling you should drive four deck screws through the roof at each corner., Strip the shingles from the rectangle plus at least 7 inches (18 cm) on each side. This way you won’t cut through and damage the shingles and therefore can use them again later after installing the skylight.

, Use chalk line between each of the four screws to mark a rectangle where you will cut through the roof. Use a circular saw to cut through three of the sides of your rectangle.


Be careful not to put weight on the cutout.
These roof cuts are not reversible so make sure they are accurate.
If making cuts on a corrugated metal roof you will need a special blade to cut metal.

, Have someone hold the cutout up from the inside while you make the fourth cut. This prevents the cutout from falling and damaging your floor or furniture.

, There are two types of skylight: those that have a frame in place and those that are mounted on a curb. For those that have a frame in place, the sheathing is a layer that will fit beneath your skylight to help prevent water leaks. For curb-mounted skylights you will need to secure two by sixes (5 cm by 15 cm) along the edges of the opening.


To attach the sheathing for frame in place skylights, nail it down around the perimeter of the opening on top of the roof. Then attach a strip of self-adhesive membrane along the bottom edge of the opening. One inch (2.5 cm) of this adhesive should be folded over the edge into the opening of the roof.
To create the curb for curb-mounted skylights you must measure the sides of the opening and cut four 2x6s (5 cm by 15 cm) to fit along the upper edges. Nail the four pieces together into the shape of a rectangle. Make sure this box is square and then toenail it into place around the roof opening. Toenailing involves driving the nails in at an angle to securely attach the curb to the roof., Ask someone to hold the frame from the inside of the opening and bring it through the opening onto the roof. This way the skylight is secure and reduces the chance of dropping it or causing damage to the window.


Be careful when working with the skylight at this point so that you do not damage it.

, Rest the skylight against the bottom edge of the opening first and then lower the light onto the roof. If the skylight is curb-mounted then you will need to lift window over the curbs and rest it on top of the sills.


Skylights for corrugated metal must be slid under the upper flap of the roof. To slide it under the top flap of roof you will need to make two cuts in the roofing so that the skylight can be slid into location. This protects the roof from water leakage.

, Put 2-inch (5 cm) screws through the metal brackets on the frame's sides. Drive the screws through the skylight's neighboring rafters for frame in place skylights. Curb-mounted skylights will be attached directly to the curb.


Skylights in corrugated metal roofs will be secured with 1 ¼ inch (31 mm) self-tapping sheet metal screws at 3 inch (7.5 cm) intervals.

, Staple 18 inch (46 cm) wide roofing felt onto the roof up close to the edges of the skylight. Make sure it surrounds the entire perimeter of the skylight.

, Some skylights will recommend a membrane around the edges of the skylight frame or curb that extends 6 inches (15 cm) past the skylight’s sides. This membrane will act a little like tape and will provide another barrier against leaks.


Start at the bottom edge when applying the membrane.
Allow the ends of the membrane to extend past the corners. Then cut the membrane at a 45 degree angle from both corners to create two points. Secure the bottom point to the roof and the top point around the corner of the skylight frame.
After applying the membrane on the bottom, put it on the sides and then last on the top edge of the skylight.
Skylights in corrugated roofs should be sealed using roofing-grade silicone sealant. Apply a generous amount of sealant around the opening 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the edges., Nail the roof shingles back into place on top of the membrane around the edges of the skylight. Don’t worry about the nails going though the membrane because the membrane will seal around them.

, The bottom sill will be a U-shaped metal piece that slips over the bottom of the skylight. Nail it to the side edges of the frame or curb of the skylight. The roofing felt and step flashing helps keep water from leaking around the skylight.


The bottom sill flashing for skylights with a frame in place will be nailed directly to the roof at the top outside corners of the sill.
The flashing of curb-mounted skylights will never be nailed to the roof. These flashings should only be nailed to the sides of the curb.

, Add shingles over the exposed edges of the bottom sill flashing.

, Overlap the top half of the shingles covering the bottom sill with one of the L-shaped step flashing pieces. Nail it in on the top outside counter and cover with a shingle. Continue with the rest of the step flashing.


For the next piece, overlap the next step flashing piece on top of the shingle, again securing with a nail on the top outside corner. Place another shingle on top of that step flashing piece.
Continue alternating step flashing pieces and shingles on both sides of the skylight.

, The counter-flashing will either surround all four sides or just be on the sides of the skylight. This is essential for preventing water leaks through your skylight so be careful to install the counterflashing correctly.


The counterflashing should simply snap into place.
Counter-flashing is essential for protecting against wind-blown rain and snow.

, The saddle flashing is the top flashing piece that will cover your skylight. Lift up the top layer of shingles and slide the saddle flashing into place. Nail this piece into place underneath the shingles. Then add a layer of shingles on top of the flashing, making sure to leave 4 inches (10 cm) exposed.

, Measure the sides of the openings and create frames from 2x4 (4 x 10 cm) lengths of wood. Attach them to the roof and ceiling to hold the rest of the light shaft frame in place.

, These four 2x4 (5x10 cm) pieces of wood will form the basic frame for the light shaft. Cut the pieces so that they are the correct length to fit between the corresponding corners of the openings and nail them into each of the corners.


You will likely need to cut the ends at an angle to fit securely against the ceiling and roof surfaces.

, Add additional beams between the frames of the ceiling and roof. These will be the studs for your drywall installation.


Again use 2x4s (5 x 10 cm) to create these beams and nail them into place.

, While in the attic, nail rigid foam insulation around the outside of the light shaft frame you have just created.

, Cover the skylight's interior support with 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) thick drywall. Prime and paint the interior around the skylight if needed using the same color paint as your ceiling."

Cut some copper wire into two sections, roughly 1-2 feet each.,
Remove 1"" of shielding from each end of the wire.,
Use the nail to pierce two holes into a cork.,
Thread one end of each copper wire through the cork.,
Bend the end of the two strands inside the cork into a hook shape.,
Cut the iron wire into 1-1/2 to 2 inch (3.8cm to 5cm) strips.,
Twist the five iron wire lengths together with your fingers.,
Place the twisted iron wires onto the copper hooks, making sure it touches both copper strands.,
Lay the jar on top of the cork.,
Wrap both ends of the wire around separate ends of a battery to turn the light on.,
Troubleshoot if you're not getting enough light.",How to Make a Light Bulb2," Copper is a great conductor of electricity, and most wiring is copper. You need two strands about 1 ½ feet (45 cm) long.


Use small wire cable cutters to cut the copper wire.

, The shielding is the rubber that covers the copper wire. Removing it can be achieved by carefully squeezing the cable cutter so that it cuts through the shielding but not the wire. The shielding can them be stripped from the ends with your hands.








, The holes should be in the middle of the cork about 1/2"" apart. This cork will hold your wires in place. Think of it as the bottom, metal part of your light bulb.








, Leave about 2"" or so exposed above the top of the cork.








, The hook of each strand should curve the same way. This will hold onto your filament, the part of the bulb that actually lights up.

, Make five strips. The thinner your wire is before beginning, the better. Thinner wire will almost always result in a better light.

, You want a long braid of wire. It needs to be tightly wound as well.








, For an even better fit, you can tighten the hooks around your iron filament. The more of it touching, the better.








, This is your ""bulb."" It will help protect from shock, but also creates a more concentrated light.








, If you have electrical clamps, they will be much safer and easier to use. If you don't, make sure you're wearing rubber-soled shoes and have safety gloves on. Attach one wire to each end of the battery to complete the circuit and ""turn on"" the light bulb.









You can use any battery, but starting small is usually best. C or D batteries (1.5 V each) will do the trick.
If you're not getting enough light, try attaching your batteries in series.


, This is a simple scientific machine, so their are simple ways to test and fix bulbs that don't work.



Ensure all the ends are touching. You must have a complete, unbroken circuit to get light.

Thin out the filament. Try it with only 3-4 strands. You could also replace the iron with graphite, as mentioned in method one.

Add more power. Use a bigger battery, or attach multiple batteries together, for more power and more light.

Read the installation instructions.,
If possible, consult an electrician to determine how much voltage your circuit can reliably carry.,
Shut off the power before beginning any work.,
Mark out the location of each light.,
Check for obstructions in the ceiling.",How to Install Recessed Lighting1," In the user manual, you'll find a variety of user/installation instructions, including voltage requirements. Reading the user manual will also give you the dimensions of the hole you'll need to cut in which to place your lights.;
, Installing beautiful recessed lighting may be all the rage, but if your circuit is overloaded, what use will they be for you? If you are taking out old fixtures and installing new ones, you can safely add lights that draw as much amperage (or less) as the previous ones. If you want to add more, consult an electrician.


For example, if you had 6 fixtures, each with 100 watt lights, your circuit can hold at least 600 watts before hitting capacity.

, It is a good idea to lock the circuit breaker panel while you work so that no one else can turn on the circuit. Never work with circuits that are energized.

, Use the manufacturer's template or make your own by cutting out a circle of paper. Place the template against the ceiling in the desired location and trace around it with a pencil, marking the center point as well.


If you want to place your lights according to a straight pattern or in a straight line, consider buying or renting a laser level. This will allow you to plot out the holes for the recessed lighting extremely straight. There's nothing wrong with looking more professional.

, Use a stud sensor or other type of structure sensing device to locate any possible obstacles in the area where you're planning to install.


If you have an attic or crawl space directly above the light fixtures, start by drilling a 1/4 inch (~6 mm) hole through the ceiling at the center point of each circle. Next, go into the attic and visually check for obstructions around each hole; you will need the light fixture to fit between the ceiling joists.
If a finished area is above the ceiling, you can check for obstructions with a wire coat hanger. Bend a length of the coat hanger at 90 degrees about 3 inches (~8 cm) in. Insert the bent wire into each hole you drilled, rotating the bent portion around to check for obstructions. If the wire hits a joist, relocate your lighting fixtures accordingly.

Cut the openings for the lights.,
Install the mounting hardware for each light fixture.,
Stapling your wiring about every three feet, put in your loops from fixture to fixture.,
Strip the ends of the wires with a wire stripper.

,
Take the stripped wires, connecting the cables that you ran from the power source to the terminals on the fixture's mounting hardware.,
Cap any connections with wire connectors.",How to Install Recessed Lighting2," Use a drywall saw to carefully cut around each outline you drew on the ceiling. Avoid cutting too much away; you can always cut more later, but it is much harder to remedy too large a cut.


Cover your floor with a painter's canvas and hold a disposal bag underneath the ceiling; any drywall, sheetrock, or insulation that falls down while you're cutting should make it right into your bag.

, If the attic is above the ceiling, it is best to install mounts that are secured to the joists themselves, as they are very secure. If the area above the ceiling is finished, you can use mounting hardware that fits through the hole you cut and mounts to the drywall itself.

, Doing this now will save you more time later. Leave about 18 inches (45 cm) of wire hanging down through each hole; this will ensure that you have enough slack to wire each light.


If the attic is above the ceiling, you can easily run the wire through the attic. If a finished area is above the ceiling, you can use a long, flexible drill bit to drill the necessary holes in the ceiling joists, and then fish the wires through the joists.

,, If you're using connectors to hook your wires into the fixture, simply snap in the connectors into the housing. Feed one set of wires from the junction box, and any additional wires to the next light in the chain (if you want to work with a single switch) and tighten off at the housing.

, Lock off the wires into the wire connectors push lock system, organizing the same colors together into one push lock. Put the wires and connectors back into the fixture box. Do this same process for each recessed light you want to install.

If you don't have an outdoor outlet, you will need to have an electrician install one.;
, It is important to plan ahead when installing low voltage lighting so that you can avoid any potential problems, especially with the setup. Make a plan for where you want the lights to go and think about what kinds (and lengths) of connecting wires you'll need a head of time so that you can purchase the right materials and ensure your project will go smoothly.


This step is important to help determine how much cord and what capacity transformer you'll need to buy. Draw the layout of the lights on paper, and take measurements outdoors to determine how much wire you'll need. Lights can be installed in several different configurations.

, The transformer will plug directly into the outlet, so it can be quite an eyesore. Try to pick an outlet that is on the side of the house or hidden by shrubbery.


Depending on what kind of transformer you use, some must be mounted on the wall as well as plugged into the outlet. So keep this in mind as well.

, A transformer is a small device that converts the high voltage power (120 V or 230 V, depending on your location) from your electric main to a lower voltage (usually 12 volts). There are many different varieties, so it is important to do your research.


Some transformers have sensors that detect sunlight so that they automatically come on at dusk. However, many people have complainedthat the light sensors activate even when the sun goes behind a tree or cloud. So if you have many trees in your yard, you might want to consider getting a transformer where you manually set the time it will come on each evening.

, There are several things to consider when selecting a transformer.


Make sure to buy a transformer that can handle the lighting load you need it to. A transformer will be rated at a certain wattage; make sure that the wattage of your transformer exceeds the sum of the wattages of all your lights.
Consider what kind of power switches the transformer has. Some transformers will have built-in timing switches to help you create a schedule for the lights to turn on and off. Others will have a photo cell that can determine whether it is dark enough out to cycle the lights on. Make sure to get a transformer that fits your needs.

, Transformers are installed simply by plugging them into your outdoor outlet, though some larger ones must be mounted on the wall., Cables used in installing landscape lighting is typically buried underground. The cable runs from the transformer to each light fixture to give them power.Low Voltage electrical cable comes in several gauges (12, 14, 16 are the most common). The lower the gauge number is, the thicker the wire will be. Thicker wires have higher capacities for voltage.Transformers usually have a recommended gauge of wire to use with their system based on the amount of power the transformer can tolerate. Check with the manufacturer of your specific transformer to determine which gauge to use.

, Low voltage lighting can include several different types of lighting. It is important to choose the type that works best for your project.


Accent fixtures are the smaller, less obvious types of lights that include floodlights, spotlights, etc. Usually, this type of lighting is used to illuminate trees, plants, flowerbeds, ponds, and other features in your landscape.Pathway lighting (as the name implies) is designed to illuminate pathways. They are often more decorative than accent fixtures as they are designed to be seen. You can use them to line your driveway, to light up the walkway to your front door, or to shine some light on a pathway in your backyard.

, There are several different ways to design the way the cables run from the transformer to the fixtures. The design you choose depends on the outcome you want.


You can wire the lights in a straight run from the transformer. This means that there is a single length of wire running from the transformer to each of the lights in sequence.
Another option is to wire the lights in a loop, with the wire returning to the transformer. This helps reduce the power dropping off at long distances from the transformer, which keeps distant lights from dimming.
You can also install multiple straight runs from the same transformer. Keeping the lights closer to the transformer will help eliminate the voltage drop that occurs when lights are further away.

, Once you have determined a layout, set each light fixture on the ground where it will be installed. Run the cable above ground in the location where it be installed.

, Attach the wire to each light fixture; many low voltage light fixtures use quick connectors to make this process simple. Then, attach the wire to the transformer's terminal screws. Before plugging the transformer in, dig a 3-inch (7.5 cm) deep trench along the wire's length and bury it in the ground. Plug the transformer in.

, Once the whole setup has been wired completely, position and mount each light according to the manufacturer's directions.

Check your local laws.,
Choose your bulb type.,
Choose the style of lights.",How to Install Fog Lights1," Some areas have restrictions on the type and color of lights you can install. Check your local regulations to make sure that your new lights are in compliance. Not all fog lights are approved for road use by the Department of Transportation.;
, There are three main types of bulbs available for fog lights. Pick the style that you find most useful.


LED (Light Emitting Diodes) are very bright and have a long life. They also use less energy and are not as prone to vibration. The downside is their cost, as they are quite a bit more expensive than halogens.
HID (High Intensity Discharge) use xenon gas to produce a high quantity of bright light. HIDs are popular because the light produced is closer to daytime light.
Halogen is the oldest type of light, but also the most widely available and cheapest to obtain. It is made with a single filament bulb and halogen gas. These lights typically run hot and are prone to burnouts.

, There are a large variety of fog light styles available, but they all break down into three mounting categories. Decide which style fits your vehicle best.


Bumper Mount. Bumper mount lights fit in specifically designed holes and are usually round or rectangular. This style is the way that most fog lights come from the factory. If you’re replacing your stock fog lights, this is where to start.
Grill Mount. Larger, usually round. These lights are installed on the front grille or mounted directly behind it. This style is typically seen more with trucks and SUVs.
Rack Mount. Round or rectangular lights. These are mounted above the vehicle or onto a front brush guard. This style is also seen more with trucks and SUVs.

, Bumper mounted fog lights are typically below the headlights. Check your vehicle manual if you have difficulty locating them.

, This disconnects the fog light from the vehicle’s power system. It should disconnect by detaching the clip.

, This will allow you to remove the fog light housing. Make sure that you hold on to all your parts until the installation is complete.

, Be careful not to scratch the bumper. If you are installing grille or roof-mounted lights, lift away from the vehicle to be sure to avoid scratching the roof or body.

, The housing should fit into the space left by the old one. If it does not, you may have purchased the incorrect headlights.


Make sure that the bolt holes line up; otherwise you may have to drill new ones.

, Thread the washer and nut over the bolt, tightening with a ratchet or wrench. Do not over tighten as you may damage the fog light housing or the vehicle. The housing should be snug and immobile.

, Reconnect the fog light switch using the clip. The new fog light should now be properly powered by the vehicle’s battery.

, Test your new lights. Ensure that the angle is good for visibility and won’t shine in other drivers’ eyes.

Set the timing.",How to Install an Outdoor Motion Sensor Light," Since most outdoor motion sensor lighting is installed in place of a current porch light, you will need to begin the project by removing the old light. Before you even touch the light, you want to go to your home’s electrical box and cut off the power to the existing light.Test that the power is indeed off by turning on the light switch to the light to make sure it stays off.;
, Use a screwdriver to remove the screws holding the existing light in place. Don’t pull too hard away from the wall since the light is still connected by the electrical wiring in place.


To be doubly safe, have a wire tester handy and test the wires connected to the old light to ensure no power is running to them before you actually touch them., You will see three separate wires attached to the light. There will be a white wire (the neutral wire), a green or copper wire (the ground wire), and a black or red wire (the hot wire).Disconnect all three wires from the current light after testing to make sure they aren’t receiving any power.


Occasionally, especially on older homes, the hot wire may be a color other than black or red such as yellow., If the current light fixture is especially old, you may want to use having the light off as an excuse to change out the electrical box housing the wiring. This is especially true is you see any evidence of moisture or degraded seals around the box. The box will simply be screwed into place, and you can remove it and feed the same wiring into a new box before screwing it back into place.

, The motion sensor light kit you purchase will come with a small crosspiece bracket with several different holes, allowing you to attach it to electrical boxes of different sizes.Line up the bracket according to the electrical box you have installed and screw the bracket into place.

, The new light package will include a rubber gasket that fits tightly against the base of the fixture where it attaches to the wall. Slip this gasket over the wiring on the light and into place. It doesn’t have to be perfectly aligned just yet; you just need the gasket in place before you connect the wiring on the light to the electrical box, otherwise you’ll have to disconnect it again., You have to make sure you connect the wiring properly. That means connecting the neutral (white) wires together and the hot (black/red/yellow) wires together.Use a wire cap over the connected wires to help hold them together, and then use electrical tape around the bottom of the wire cap to help keep it in place.There will be a small colored screw inside the light fixture near where the other two wires exit the casing. You will tighten the copper ground wire down around this screw by simply loosening the screw, looping the ground wire over it, and tightening the screw back down to make constant contact with the wire., Once the wiring is all connected and taped off, you can simply push the wiring into the electrical box to give yourself more room to fit the light assembly on the wall. Your particular setup will likely have one or two screws that you use to attach the light to the cross bracket that you already attached. Make sure the rubber gasket is properly aligned on the back of the fixture, hold it against the wall, and screw it into place., Once you have the assembly properly in place, you are ready to screw in the bulbs that came with it. You can always choose a different type of bulb as well if you don’t prefer what your system comes with.

, After you have restored the power to the light and ensured that it works, you will want to seal the light fixture where it attaches to the wall plate. Use a silicone caulk around the casing where it attaches to the wall.This will help ensure that no moisture can get inside the casing and short out the light.

, Now that you’ve installed the fixture, you’re ready to test it. The first thing you need to do is go back to your breaker box and turn the power back on to the fixture.

, With the power to the light restored, walk in front of the sensor to ensure that the light comes on. Once you’re certain the light comes on, this is the point where you should seal the fixture around the wall with the silicone caulking. Then you can worry about adjusting the settings.

, This step is likely easier to do at dusk or in the early evening. Most motion sensor lights consist of two separate lamps that you can easily swivel and position how you want. Turn the lamps until you have a spread of light around the area that satisfies you.

, The sensor for most models of motion sensor lights is on a pivot that allows you to angle the sensor toward a specific location such as your driveway or a gate. The sensor will have a rather wide field of view, so you can angle it toward multiple spaces at once in many cases.

, Depending on your model of light, it may come with a switch or a knob to adjust the sensitivity of the sensor.The higher you tune the sensitivity, the more objects will cause the sensor to switch on the light. On some lights, especially ones that can be seen from bedroom windows, you probably don’t want the light switching on every time the wind shakes a rosebush, so adjust the sensitivity based on your needs.


If there’s a specific corner you want the sensor to stop reacting to—such as a dog’s dog run beside the house—you can place a small piece of electrical tape on that corner of the sensor to stop it from receiving the data. Just make sure you don’t tape further over than you intended. You can test it by placing the tape and walking beside it to see where the sensor’s field of vision picks back up and adjust accordingly.

, Most motion sensor lights also have a time setting beside the sensitivity setting, allowing you to determine how long the light stays on when the sensor trips it.This setting is typically just a switch that changes the increment, so set it to your preference.

Detach the fixture. This process will depend on the type of fixture you previously had installed. If possible, have someone hold it up while you detach it from the ceiling to decrease the likelihood of dropping it.
Remove the old wire connectors. These are the small plastic caps covering the connections between the fixture wires and the house wiring. Usually they can be removed by twisting them counterclockwise until loose.
Before disconnecting the wires, it's a good idea use a voltage checker to make sure the wires have no electricity running through them.
Finally, disconnect the wires and remove any remaining parts of the old fixture that are still attached to the ceiling, such as a base or trim., Make sure your installation location is structurally sound.Your electrical junction box should be supported by a beam or other support system, not simply screwed into drywall.









If the electrical box and light fixture are not adequately supported, it may fall. Further, this is likely a building code violation. If there is not adequate support to hold your fixture up, do not proceed with the installation.

, Make sure the screws holding the electrical box in place are tight and the box is secure. Tighten screws if necessary, but do not over-tighten.







, Have an assistant hold the light fixture up to the ceiling while you connect the wires from the light fixture to those hanging out of the junction box.









Connect wires according to the directions provided with the light. Usually, this means connecting black to black and white to white. Wrap the exposed ends of the wires together.If there is not enough exposed surface on each wire, you may need to use wire strippers to peel back some of the wire insulation.Screw on wire nuts/connectors to cover the exposed connections and secure them tightly.These should be provided with the fixture, but if not, can be purchased cheaply at any hardware store.

, Find the ground wire on the pendant light. Depending on your wiring, you'll either wrap it around a ground screw located in the junction box or attach it to a protruding ground wire. 








The ground wire is usually either a green wire or a bare copper wire.If you have a ground screw, tighten the screw to hold the wire in place.

, Push or fold the wiring up into the junction box, making sure that all wires remain secured together with the wire nuts.








, Follow the manufacturers instructions.

, Attach the canopy of or base of your light to the mounting screws or bracket.This process will also vary depending on the style of pendant light you are installing, so it's a good idea to check your directions before you start.









In some cases, the process is as aligning your mounting screws with some small holes in the fixture, and turning the fixture about a quarter turn.In other cases, you'll have to screw the fixture into a mounting bracket., Screw a light bulb of the correct voltage and size into the pendant light fixture.

, Your light should now be functional.








If your light does not function, turn the power back off and check your wiring., If your fixture has a trim, a cover, or any other remaining parts that still need to be installed, install them now, and make any final adjustments to the light's height.

Open your circuit breaker panel.,
Identify whether any breaker switches have tripped and are in the “Off” position.,
Switch the breaker back to the “On” position.,
Identify the circuit for the breaker you suspect is bad.,
Unplug all electrical appliances connected to that particular circuit.,Return to the circuit breaker panel.,
Flip the circuit breaker you suspect is going bad.,
Contact a professional electrician for help with repairing the faulty circuit breaker.",How to Tell if a Circuit Breaker Is Bad," The circuit breaker is a metal box often located in your basement, hallway, or storage room.

Make sure the floor and your hands are dry before touching the circuit breaker panel. This will help you avoid electric shock.;
,

Do not touch or attempt to fix the circuit breaker yourself if you see bare wires or signs of burning upon opening the circuit breaker panel. Instead, skip to step #7 and contact a professional electrician for further assistance., If this resolves the problem and the breaker stays on, the circuit breaker is in good working condition.

Proceed with the following steps if the circuit breaker trips and returns to the “Off” position.

, Most breakers are labeled accordingly, and will tell you which circuit is being controlled by the breaker. For example, a breaker labeled “kitchen” controls the circuits and electricity for all major appliances in your kitchen., This helps identify whether the problem is due to an overloaded circuit, which is when a circuit has more amps flowing through it than it can support. For example, if the circuit is for your living room, unplug all lamps, television components, computers, and any other appliances plugged into living room outlets.,, If the circuit breaker is in good working condition, you will hear a loud, definite “click.” If the switch trips immediately, emits a burning smell, or flops back and forth easily without clicking, it’s possible the circuit breaker is faulty.If the circuit breaker works for a few minutes or hours, then trips again later on, the circuit may be overloaded. If this happens, move electrical components from the faulty circuit to another circuit to distribute electricity more effectively.

, A professional electrician will take the necessary precautions to fix the circuit breaker and any wiring problems in your home."
"
Make certain that the electricity is turned off to the circuit that you are working on.,
Remove the outlet or switch cover plate.,
Find the two screws, one at the top and one at the bottom.,
Label the wires with some sort of identifying mark on masking tape wrapped around each wire.,
Loosen the screws on the new electrical outlet/switch where the wires will be held.,
Connect the wires as was described in the step 1 of this ""part""/subsection above.,
Tighten the screws, as you keep a firm hold on the outlet to ensure the wires don't slip.,
Push the electrical outlet back into the electric box.,
Screw the electrical outlet back into the box.








,
Turn back on the power, using any method as described above, turning on the breakers or reinstalling the fuses.








,
Test the outlet one more time.,
Remove the small electrical device and replace the outlet's cover plate.








,
Make sure the following devices are connected to GFCI


For Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) receptacles (these have ""Test"" and ""Reset"" buttons and are required in bathrooms, garages, outdoors, and other locations within 6 feet of a water source, such as plugs serving counter top appliances near a sink in kitchens).,
Determine which devices are not connected to GFCI.,
Make sure to mark each wire in the box per device with a label, and have the new replacement devices to connect.",How to Replace a Defective Electrical Switch or Outlet," You should plug a lamp (test it first) into the outlet that you intend to change and then turn off the circuit breaker to make the lamp go off. If the device isn't working, find a different method to determine the power is off.









If the outlet doesn't function at all, and you are not sure which breaker turns it off, then you may want to turn off the main breaker. This will shut down the entire house, but it is better to be safe than to risk electric shock. A voltage detector (""power sniffer"") is also useful for detecting voltage.
The light fixtures are usually on the lower value amp circuit breakers (usually 15 amps). If you leave the light fixtures on, it gives you better lighting to work on the plugs and switches. Standard outlets are usually connected to 15 and 20 amp circuits breakers.
If the outlet in the room isn't protected by circuit breakers, but by fuses, make sure that fuse has been removed.

, Traditional outlet plates usually have one screw per outlet (but some - including GFCIs - have two) and switch plates two per switch. There may be multiple switches or outlets in one box, but you can replace just one if needed.









If you need to replace more than one, work on each one at a time so that you do not confuse the wiring.
Make a diagram (or take close-up digital photos) to have a clear record of how it looked before you disconnected anything.

, These hold the switch/outlet to the electrical box. Remove these two screws and gently pull the switch or outlet out.








, Use the same mark for each wire connected to the same terminal screw of the device.









The ""hot"" (usually black or red) wires should be connected to the side that the shorter plug slot is on and generally have gold colored screws.
The ""neutral"" white wires should be connected to the side that the taller plug slot is on and generally have silver screws.
The bare-copper or green wire will connect to the green ground screw attached to one of the outlet mounting brackets.
There may be one, two or more sets of wires connected to your outlet, depending on its location in the circuit. It does not matter which wire of a colored pair goes to which screw unless the outlet is controlled by a switch.;
, Use a screw driver to open the screws until you feel you might have room enough to pull the wires on, so don't open them too much.








, Make sure that the wires wrap around the screw completely without touching the plastic edges and without breaking off the tip of the wires themselves. Pull the wires around each of these screws until they are seated and won't disconnect if accidentally pushed backwards.








, Tighten them until they are tight and the wires are touching the metal piece on the side of the outlet behind the screws.








, Make sure that the top screw tab is in line with their respective holes.








,,, Use an small electrical appliance or one that won't draw too much power (such as a television set, computer system or mobile device), but be careful as open areas are now live. A better way to test an outlet is to use an electrical outlet tester. These can be purchased at your local hardware store, and usually cost between five and ten dollars.









If the outlet tester reads ""open ground"", connect the grounding wire (green or bare) to the green grounding screw. If your home does not have grounding wires, you should replace the outlet with either a two-prong outlet or a GFCI outlet.
If the outlet tester reads ""open hot"", connect the hot wire (red or black, unless re-identified) to the hot screw.
If the outlet tester reads ""open neutral"", connect the neutral wire (white) to the neutral screw.
If the outlet tester reads ""hot/neutral reverse"", switch the positions of the hot and neutral wires on the outlet.
If the outlet tester reads ""hot/ground reverse"", switch the positions of the hot and ground wires on the outlet.

,,
Label the wires with some sort of identifying mark on masking tape wrapped around each wire. Use the same mark for each wire connected to the same terminal screw of the device. #* Look for an indication of ""LINE"" and ""LOAD"" on the body of the plug near the terminals. Each LINE and LOAD side has a gold and silver screw. It is very important to pay attention to this detail.

Power source hot (most likely black or red) must connect to the LINE gold screw.
Power source neutral (most likely white from the SAME cable carrying the power source hot) must connect to the LINE silver screw.


A GFCI receptacle can provide ""downstream"" protection to other receptacles. For example, a GFCI in a kitchen may protect one or more other kitchen receptacles. If you have other ""downstream"" devices that are wired so that they are protected by the GFCI receptacle, there will be another cable(s) in the box.
The cable(s) that feed the protected downstream plugs must be connected to the LOAD gold and silver terminals, and also the ground (green) terminal. If you connect any of these wires incorrectly, you will lose ground fault protection and/or damage the device.

, Some devices should not be connected to GFCI receptacles because of the possibility for ""nuisance tripping""; for example, refrigerators, fluorescent lights, laser printers, garbage disposals, trash compactors, dishwashers, clothes washers and dryers, home heating and cooling systems, artesian well and driven point jet type pumps,microwave ovens and freezers are some of the more commons items.


For switches:

Label the wires with some sort of identifying mark on masking tape wrapped around each wire. Use the same mark for each wire connected to the same terminal screw of the device
Determine the type of switch you have. A single-pole switch (one switch controls the light fixture(s)) will have two screws and be marked ""ON"" and ""OFF"" if a toggle type, a 3-way switch (two switches control the light fixture(s), typically at each end of a stairwell) will have three screws, one of which is black, and a 4-way switch (three switches control the light fixture(s)) will have four screws, two of which are black.
Both the 3-way and 4-way switches do not have ""ON"" and ""OFF"" markings. A ""two pole"" switch has four screws as well, but unlike the four way switch; has ON and OFF markings
Do not confuse these two switches. You must use the same type of switch that you are replacing!



, Regardless of the way it was wired when you opened the box, electrical device (receptacles, switches, etc.) terminals are designed for one conductor per terminal.


Furthermore, outlets are not allowed to ""complete"" a circuit - this is sometimes called ""daisy chaining"". This means that you should not have to rely on the outlet to maintain power to the rest of the circuit. This is accomplished very easily by using wire nuts and ""pigtails"" (a 6 - 8 inch long piece of wire with stripped ends).
Simply gather the wires that have the same identifying mark, and a ""pigtail"" and twist all of these wires together and secure them with a wire nut.
Gently fold this wire nut bundle towards the back of the box, leaving the pigtail sticking out towards the front of the box.
Put the same label on the end of the pigtail as those under the wirenut that you just put on. This is the new single wire that represents the group that was attached to the device when you started.
Repeat this procedure for each wire with the same label. Obviously, if there are any wires that have unique labels, they should not be pigtailed, unless they are too short to easily connect to a terminal.
After you have securely tightened the wires (wrap the wire clockwise around the screw, i.e., in the direction the screw turns as it tightens) to the new switch or outlet, gently push the wires back into the box and secure the outlet/switch to the electrical box.
Inspect for damaged insulation / exposed conductors.
Tape off exposed conductors. Do not wrap electrical tape over wire nut connections (the wire nut should stay on by itself if it is properly connected).
Replace the cover and turn the electricity back on. Test the circuit to make sure it is functioning properly.

Determine if the light you're installing a dimmer on is single pole or 3-way.,
Purchase either a single pole or 3-way dimmer at a hardware store.

,
Locate your circuit breaker and flip off the power switch to the light switch you're changing.

,
Remove the wall plate of your current light switch.,
Unscrew the screws that hold the switch itself to the electrical box behind it.

,
Pull the switch away from the wall slowly to reveal the wiring.

,
Detach the wires leading into the wall terminal from the old light switch.,
Wire your new dimmer into the wall terminal.,
Push the wires inside the wall box carefully as you fix the new dimmer over it.

,
Screw the dimmer onto the wall terminal with the 2 screws from the previous switch.

,Screw the dimmer cover plate to the wall using the other 2 screws.,
Attach the dimmer knob or other dimming device onto the metal protrusion.

,
Flip the switch on the breaker back on.",How to Install a New Dimmer,"


A single pole switch means that the light is controlled only by 1 switch. A 3-way switch means 1 or more light switches control 1 light.;
,,,


Use a screwdriver to take out the 2 screws that hold the plate into place.

,,,

If your switch is 3-way, there will be 3 wires that are fastened to 3 screws. One of the 3 wires connects to a screw that is unlike the others in color or in label. Place a piece of tape or tag on that wire for later use when installing the dimmer.
If your switch is single pole, 2 wires will be fastened to 2 screws. The colors should be the same.

,


For single pole switches, take the green ground wire from the wall terminal and connect it to the ground wire from your new dimmer. Curl the wires around each other clockwise and place a wire connector nut over the connection. Connect the 2 black dimmer wires to wires from the wall terminal.
For 3-way switches, perform the same initial process as you would for single pole switches by connecting the green ground wire of the wall box to the ground wire of the dimmer. Take a black dimmer wire and connect it to the wall wire you taped or tagged. Connect the other 2 black dimmer wires to the remaining wall terminal wires. Make sure to place wire connector nuts over each connection.

,,,,, The dimmer should now operate.

Use a cord connected surge suppressor.,
Plug the suppressor into an outlet and lay it flat on the floor.

,
Plug any electrical equipment into the surge protector's outlets and then turn the surge protector on.

,
When a surge occurs the alternating current (AC) sine wave becomes truncated and increases in amplitude.,
When a sag occurs, other components (usually capacitors or coils)release their charge when the power goes out, keeping your electronics running for short sags.,
Use a whole house surge suppressor.",How to Protect Electronic Equipment with Surge Protectors," The easiest way to protect equipment is using a surge suppressor, which also functions as an extension cord or ""multi-outlet strip"". They usually have several outlets and a power switch built in. Surge suppressors use a combination of components (gas tubes, avalanche diodes and metal oxide varistors or MOV's) to protect equipment in an over voltage condition, and ""clamp"" it to safety ground. Some devices may provide for very short duration under voltage protection as well.;
,,, The devices ""clamp"" the voltage to ground preventing it from reaching devices connected.

, These devices do not replace a UPS (uninterruptible power supply).

, These devices are installed at the electrical service panel and as the name implies, protects all the circuits in the house. This device should be installed by a professional or other competent person.

"
"
Use surge protecting power strips in your home.,
Install a whole-house surge protector in your electrical panel.,
Contact your electricity provider about meter-mounted surge protection.,
Install GFCI outlets throughout your home.,
Protect appliances from power outages using an uninterruptible power supply (UPS).",How to Protect Household Appliances From Electrical Disturbances," The quickest and least expensive solution for protecting appliances is plugging them into a power strip with a built-in surge protector. These power strips are usually equipped with a fuse that is designed to fail in the event of a voltage spike, cutting off power to your appliances and protecting them.


This option tends to provide the least protection against severe electrical disturbances, however, and your appliances may be damaged even if the fuse blows as designed.
Note that not all power strips or extension cords feature a surge protector. Note also that many surge protector strips will feature a switch that must be engaged for the surge protection to work.;
, A more thorough and robust solution than using power strips is to install a snap-in surge protector directly into your electrical panel. A single protector of this type offers surge protection for your whole home, and can be installed easily if you are comfortable working in your electrical panel.


Because this type of surge protection engages before the voltage spike spreads through your home's wiring, it offers greater protection for your appliances than individual power strips.
Whole-house surge protectors are usually designed to accept 240 volts, which means you'll need 2 empty and adjacent 120-volt spaces in your panel to install this device.

, The most robust solution of all is to mount a surge protector along your incoming electrical line, just before your meter. This type of work must be done by a certified electrician and in accordance with your local utility provider's restrictions.

, In many countries, GFCI (ground fault circuit interrupter) outlets are required in new kitchens and bathrooms; they are the electrical outlets with red and black buttons labeled ""Test"" and ""Reset."" These outlets monitor the electricity flowing into and out of each socket and shut off the flow if the difference exceeds a certain amount.


These outlets help protect against ""ground faults"" - when electricity flows out of an appliance's wiring and into the ground through the nearest conductor. If this conductor is a person, severe injury or death can result.
Updating your existing outlets with GFCI outlets (especially in wet areas like kitchens and bathrooms) is a quick way to add additional protection against electrical problems with your appliances.

, A UPS is type of large power strip that contains a backup battery. If any problems are detected in the incoming voltage (which includes both surges and power outages), the battery engages, allowing you to operate the appliance without interruption. This is especially useful for protecting desktop computers from outages that can cause lost work.

Check your local wiring codes and schedule inspections.,
Decide what type of fixture will work best in the area you’re trying to illuminate.,
Decide what kind of bulb you want for your fixture.,
Determine voltage and current requirements for the fixture.,
Locate a suitable power source.,
Plan the wiring route.,
Cut openings for the wiring.,
Install the wiring.,
Make sure your wiring is up to code.,
Connect the devices as shown in the diagram that matches your application.",How to Install a Light Fixture," Several inspections and permits are required for most residential construction projects, especially when it involves installing or replacing new wires (simply replacing a fixture usually does not require permits and inspection).To make sure you're up to code, you may need to schedule the following with the Housing Administration in your city or country:

A Temporary Service Inspection
Rough-in inspection
Final inspection
Even if you're not doing it yourself, any electrical work done by a subcontractor needs to be be inspected (usually both rough in an finals) for example - well pumps, or external wood fired furnaces.;
, You wouldn't want to light up a workshop in the same way you'd light up a nursery, or a kitchen the same way you'd light living room. Think about the purpose of the room to determine where and how you'll light it. Is it a place for sitting and reading quietly? A sconce or wall-mounted fixture might be most appropriate.

For most jobs, you'll be working with one of a few different locations for a new fixture. Typically, you'll install fixtures in the wall, in the ceiling, or in a pole mount.

, Incandescent, fluorescent, LED, mercury vapor, high pressure sodium and halogen are among the most common choices, each with its own unique color tone or range of color tones form which to choose. The tones and varieties of bulbs are expressed as a temperature, in degrees Kelvin. Warm tones (yellow -red) have lower temperature (2000°) while cool tones (blue) have higher temperatures (8300°). For reference purposes, daylight is generally accepted to be about 5600°.

If you’re looking for more intimate or relaxing, go for warm white. Around 2700 degrees would be appropriate for the purpose.
If you're looking for a work light, cool white or daylight is better. These bulbs are around 4000 degrees.
When changing a bulb, you should obtain one with the same temperature light, otherwise colors in the room will be cooler or warmer depending on the tone of the light source. This is even more noticeable if there are two or more adjacent lamps of different temperatures.

, The fixture must operate on a voltage available at the location. Nearly all fixtures available at home centers in North America will be the 120-volt variety or have the ability to choose from two or more voltages by connecting specific wires and leaving others disconnected.

Current requirements for 120 volt incandescent fixtures (this includes tungsten, quartz, halogen) is .83 amps per 100 watts. A 100 watt fixture can usually be added to existing circuits without incident. Most fixtures will list a wattage or amperage requirement to avoid overloading the circuit.

, Find a nearby outlet or an existing junction box in the ceiling that's close enough to branch out from. If a suitable power source isn't easily available, you might have to run a new branch from the electrical panel.

It's important to find suitable power sources that are close by. It's unlikely that you'll be able to use the basement electrical source to feed a switch on the third floor to operate a fixture that illuminates the front sidewalk. That's a lot of wiring.

, There are three possible ways to wire the circuit for a new installation. Power to switch, power to fixture and installing the power and load point at same switch. The three points, source, switch and fixture need to be connected together all with simple two-wire Romex cable when there is one switch controlling the fixture.

If you're wiring multiple switches to multiple fixtures, it's important to separate your wring systems to keep them straight. The fixtures need to be wired to each other with a two-wire cable, and the switches need to be wired to each other with a three-wire cable.
The power source can be brought to either of the three-way switch boxes, or any fixture box with two-wire cable. The cable between the switch and fixture(s) is also 2 wire type, but must be run from either three way switch box to the fixture box that has the power source. Do not deviate from the requirement.

, Cut openings into the ceiling, or wall surfaces for the boxes, for the switch(es), and for the fixture support by first tracing around the box on the wall or ceiling surface. Be sure to match the switch box height to those in the rest of your home.

If a fixture is to be installed in the ceiling, the box should be a 4"" octagon box. It is important to note that even if a small light fixture is planned to be installed here, consider installing a fan-rated box, as a paddle fan might be installed here in the future.
If installing recessed light fixtures, no box is installed as a wiring compartment is provided on the fixture itself. The open to be cut in the ceiling is provided by the template included with the fixture by most manufacturers or by tracing around the rough-in housing opening.

, Install the Romex or other cable between the power source and boxes in the voids of the walls, ceilings, and floors with a snake or fish tape. After determining there is enough ampacity in the circuit to support the additional load, extend wiring of the same size from the power source to the switch and fixture locations. If running a new circuit directly from the electrical panel, the new wire should be sized according to the fuse or circuit breaker size., National Electrical Code Requirements for wiring need to be followed closely when you're installing a new fixture. When you're selecting wire for the job, make sure it fits the following constraints:

A wire smaller than #14 copper is not permitted for power wiring. Smaller wires (#28 through #16) are permitted for low voltage applications such as thermostats and zone valves in gas & oil fired heating systems, door bells and buttons, alarm systems, telephones, networking, etc. These wires never enter electrical panels.
A 15 amp circuit breaker or fuse should have no less than a #14 gauge copper wire connected. A 15 amp circuit is designed to safely carry up to 12 amps continuously on a #14 copper wire. Intermittent loads of up to 15 amps can be carrier for up to several hours. If the load of any device or appliance is greater than 12 amps, a larger size wire and circuit breaker is required.
A 20 amp circuit breaker or fuse should have no less than a #12 gauge copper wire connected. A 20 amp circuit is designed to safely carry up to 16 amps continuously on a #12 copper wire. Intermittent loads of up to 20 amps can be carrier for up to several hours. If the load of any device or appliance is greater than 16 amps, a larger wire and circuit breaker is required.

, If you'd prefer to follow detailed instructions to wire the fixture to just two 3-way switches, please see the 3-way switch wiki.

"
Electrical safety is without question, the most important aspect of any electrical work.,
It really just takes a common sense approach, but just as important; it demands your undivided attention.,
All it takes is one mistake – and some think that 120 volts is not dangerous.,
Keep a flashlight near your electrical panel at all times, just in case of a power loss.

,
Use fiberglass ladders for any electrical work that you do.,
Never work on electrical systems in the rain, or in damp or wet locations, or where power is not completely shut off.

,
The best type of shoes are rubber-soled shoes, and when possible stand on a rubber mat, or dry wooden floors or sub-floors.,
Anything can conduct electricity if the conditions are right.,
When you turn off the power to a breaker, tape that breaker off.,
In your home, at minimum put tape over the breaker, red tape if you have it, then close your service panel cover, and put a piece of masking tape across the cover, or a sign that says, “Do Not Open,�?,
Furthermore, inform your family members that you are doing electrical work so that, if you’ve got teenagers or kids that are capable of turning breakers back on, they are completely aware that you are working on the electrical system.

,
If you are working with fuse panels instead of breaker panels; when you remove a fuse, use only one hand to remove it.,
Now, electricity can still flow through one hand and one foot and pass through your heart, but if you’ve taken the other precautions I mentioned above, you will minimize your exposure to that hazard.

,
Another important aspect of safety that frequently goes unmentioned is tool use.",How to Master Do It Yourself Electrical Safety," And just like anything we do in life, fear comes from ‘not knowing’. So imagine what you could accomplish if you could perform home wiring safely and confidently. Imagine saving thousands of dollars over the years, if you could do-it-yourself!;
, It’s very important that you do not get in a hurry. Make sure that you have planned your project adequately, and that you’ve allowed plenty of time to complete your project, or at least if you have to pull off of it and come back to it later, that you find a suitable stopping point, and that you can do without the circuit that you’re working on.

, It’s not only dangerous. It is lethal. Shut the power off to any circuit that you are working on. (This means turn the power off at the circuit breaker panel. Just switching off a wall switch does not turn off the power in the wires.) Confirm the power is off with a simple pocket tester, a multi-meter, or lamp, blow dryer or another similar appliance.

,, Fiberglass ladders are non-conductive. Don’t use an aluminum ladder. Spend the money for a good fiberglass stepladder.

,, Never work barefoot or in socks or slippers, and don’t assume that it’s safe to work without rubber-soled shoes on concrete floors. Concrete is conductive, particularly when it’s damp (a good reason to never load or unload your washing machine while you’re barefoot).

, Even if by definition it’s called an insulator. (A conductor allows the flow of electrons, and an insulator resists the flow of electrons).

, OSHA requires us as contractors to lock it off, and tag it out with a procedure called lock out/tag out. It involves red tags and devices that will lock the breaker off to prevent it from being turned on. (If you have your panel cover off, remember that even when you turn breakers off, there are still energized components in the panel itself!).

, or “Danger�?, or something similar, so anybody who approaches that panel will see that, and immediately know what’s going on.

,, Put your other hand either in your pocket or behind your back, and that’s a good practice to develop anyway. What that does is keeps you from grabbing a circuit with two hands and providing a path for the electricity to flow through your heart.

,, It is well worth spending a little extra money to purchase quality tools. I’m referring to hand tools like your lineman pliers, screwdrivers, wire strippers, and other hand tools that you will use for electrical work. For instance, Good wire strippers will prevent you from nicking or skinning the wires. Good screwdrivers will prevent slipping out of screw heads or rounding them out. You get my point; good tools not only improve the quality of your workmanship, but improve your confidence as well. So don’t skimp on tools. You can stock your tool pouch with good quality tools for $100 or less.

If working on a bare floor is not an option, consider applying a light coating of anti-static spray to the rug or carpet prior to handling electronics.;
, Pets with hair such as dogs, cats, and ferrets can increase the risk for electric shock if they come into contact with you or your electronics.

, Static electricity buildup occurs most frequently in dry, cold environments.

, Items such as paper, plastic bins, and cellophane can all generate static when being moved around on your desk or workspace.

, A grounded object is something that has a direct conductive path to the earth, such as a water pipe, wall, or wood table. When working with computers, the most ideal way to ground yourself is to touch the exterior metal box of your computer's power supply before unplugging the machine.

, This device prevents static buildup by tethering you directly to your computer so the charge is shared, and discharging cannot occur., These types of mats, also known as ESD or grounding mats can help prevent electric shock.

, This prevents any electric currents from running through the machine as you work.

, Electricity is normally transmitted via exposed pins, connectors, and circuitry located away from the edges of CPU and components."

, You are using aluminum foil as your conductor in this method of building a parallel circuit. The foil will be used to connect the power source to the loads.


Cut the foil into four narrow strips: two 8"" pieces, and two 4"" pieces. They should be narrow, about the width of a drinking straw.

, You're now ready to start hooking up your parallel circuit.


Take one of the 8"" strips of foil and connect it to the positive terminal of the battery. Take the other 8"" strip and connect it to the negative terminal of the battery. , You're now ready to connect your loads to the conducting material.


Take the two shorter, 4"" strips and wrap one end of each around the long strip coming off the positive terminal. (Place one 4"" strip near the top of the strip, and the other about three inches down towards the battery.)Wrap the loose ends of the shorter strips around your two lightbulbs. You may find it helpful to secure the strips with electrical tape.

, Once you finish connecting all of the elements of the parallel circuit, your lightbulbs should glow.


Place the ends of the two lightbulbs against the 8"" strip of foil that is attached to the negative terminal of the battery.
The lightbulbs should now shine brightly!

Increase humidity levels in your environment.,
Avoid wearing clothing made from wool and synthetic fabrics.,
Keep your skin and hands moisturized.,
Touch a metal object using another metal object to release static discharge.",How to Ground Yourself2," Dry, cold environments with low humidity levels generate a higher level of static electricity. Consider using a humidifier in your home or office to achieve between 35 and 50 percent humidity.

, Wool and synthetic fabrics such as polyester, rayon, and spandex are more prone to rub together and create friction and static electricity.

, Dry skin causes static buildup, and can even cause your clothing to rub against your skin repeatedly. Drink plenty of water, and apply lotion or moisturizer to your skin as needed to prevent and treat dryness.

, This allows sparks from the discharge to affect the metal object, and not your skin. For example, touch a doorknob using a key instead of your hand at first to lower the risk for electric shock."

Determine where you want to hang the icicle lights.,
Estimate how many feet of lights you will need.,
Purchase your icicle lights from a local retailer.,
Purchase an extension cord that has enough power to support the number of icicle lights you are hanging.,
Purchase enough icicle light clips to support the number of strands.,
Map out how you will hang the lights prior to performing the work.,
Place the Christmas light clips on the area of your home that you are lighting.,
Attach the first light string to your home with the light clips.,
Attach the remaining strings, and repeat the process of hanging the icicle lights until you have covered the entire area.

",How to Hang Icicle Lights," Popular choices are under the eaves of your roof, along or under the railing of your deck, or around the windows of your home.;
, Use a tape measure to measure the locations you are placing the lights. If you are placing them along your rooftop, you may need to estimate the length rather than to actually measure the roof.

, There are varying sizes available, and most lights are sold by the ""count,"" or by how many bulbs are on each strand. You can find the approximate footage of each strand on the product's packaging. Buy as many sets as needed to cover the area you want to hang the lights on.

, You may need more than 1 cord. The total wattage of the lights can also be found on the manufacturer's packaging. Add up the total wattage of all the sets you intend to string together, and make sure the extension cord can support that number.

, Refer to the light clips' packaging for guidance on how many you will need. These clips will hang on your deck, rails, or windows and hold the lights in place.

, It may help to take the lights out of the box and lay them out on the ground in the order they will hang. Determine where you need to plug in the extension cord, and then plot out where the first string will need to hang. The next string will need to plug in to the first, and so on until all lights are connected together. Make sure you have the arrangement correct before installing the lights.

, The clips should be evenly spaced and no more than 1 foot (.31 m) apart. The clips will need to run the entire length of the area.

, Place the first hanging string as closely to the clip as possible, and hang it. Pull the slack from the main cord so that it's tight against your home, and attach the next section of the string to the next clip. Repeat this process until you reach the end of the first string.

Choose this method as a slightly advanced project.,
Gather the main components of a parallel circuit.,
Prepare your wires.,
Connect the first lightbulb to the battery.,
Begin to connect the switch to the battery.,
Connect the switch to the first lightbulb.,
Connect the second lightbulb.,
Complete the parallel circuit.,
Turn on the switch.",How to Make a Parallel Circuit2," While creating a parallel circuit is not complicated, this method requires you to use wire and a switch; it may be suited for slightly older students.


For example, this method will require you to strip wires, but if you lack the necessary tools for this or don't want young ones performing this task, you may prefer to read the method explained above.

, You don't need much to complete this project: You need a power source, a conducting material, at least two loads (the items which use electricity), and a switch.


Our directions call for you to use a battery as your power source. A 9-volt battery will work well.
You'll be using insulated wire as your conducting material. Any kind will work, but copper-wire should be easy to find.
You'll be cutting the wire into several pieces, so make sure you have plenty (30-40"" should do it).
Our plans use lightbulbs as the load of choice, but flashlight bulbs are also a good choice.
You should be able to find a switch (as well as all of the other materials) at any hardware or home improvement store.

, The wire is your conducting material, which will create the circuits between the power source and your leads.


Cut the wire into five pieces (between 6"" and 8"" will be fine).
Carefully remove approximately ½"" of the insulation from both ends of all your wire pieces.
Wire strippers are the best tool for removing insulation, but if you don't have these, scissors or wire-cutters will work; just be very careful not to damage the wires.

, Attach one of the wires to the positive terminal of the battery and wind the other end around the left side of one of the lightbulbs. , Take a separate piece of wire and connect it to the negative terminal of the battery. Take the other end of the wire and connect it to the switch. , Using yet another piece of wire, connect it first to the switch, and then wind it around the right side of the first lightbulb. , Take your fourth piece of wire and wind it around the left side of the first lightbulb, and then wind the other end around the left side of the second lightbulb. , Using your remaining piece of wire, wrap one end around the right side of the first lightbulb, and the other end around the right side of the second lightbulb.

, Flip the switch, and you should see both bulbs light up. Congratulations—you successfully built a parallel circuit!

Find out the maximum wattage your recessed light fixtures can individually consume.,
Determine whether the total wattage of new and existing lights will overload their shared circuit.,
Turn off the power to the circuit(s) for the existing fixture(s) you will be working on.,
Test that the power to the circuit is off using an electrical tester.,
Mark the location of each new fixture opening on the ceiling.,
Check above the ceiling for any obstructions.,
Cut holes to fit the new recessed lights in the ceiling with a drywall saw.

,
Disconnect an existing recessed light fixture from its nearby junction box.,
Pull electrical wire to each new light fixture and leave 18 inches (45 cm) of excess wire hanging from the ceiling.,
Connect the existing light fixture to its junction box and the wire going to the next recessed light.,
Use wire connectors to cap wire connections.,
Mount the recessed light cans and trim components according to the manufacturer's instructions.

,
Screw in light bulbs to the new lights.

,
Remove an existing track lighting fixture.,
Examine the wiring behind the removed fixture.,
Connect a black wire from an existing light to a new black wire for the next light.,
Continue connecting the black wire from one light to the next until finished adding lights or until you reach the maximum wattage of the circuit switch.

,
Connect and join white wires from the existing light to the new lights as for the black wires.",How to Daisy Chain Lights," This may differ from the wattage of the light bulb in the fixture.


If you are not sure of the fixture maximum wattage, use 100 watts per fixture as an estimate.;
, If using a dimmer switch to control your lights, for example, most of these switches can handle up to 600 watts. If you have a total of 7 light fixtures that each consume 100 watts, then the dimmer switch could be overloaded.


To prevent overloading a circuit, you may need to upgrade the control switch to a higher wattage. Ask a licensed, professional electrician to install the new switch for you. You can also consider dividing the additional lights among additional circuits.

, Do this by shutting off the circuit breaker(s) that sends power to the fixture(s).

, If possible, lock the service panel (breaker box) to prevent someone else from turning the circuit back on while you work.

, Use the manufacturer's template to do this. Drill a 1/4-inch (0.63 cm) hole into the ceiling at the center of each new opening.

,


If an attic is above the ceiling, simply look for obstructions in the attic.
If a second story or other finished area is above the ceiling, poke a coat hanger through the drilled holes for any possible obstructions.

,, Extend wiring from the junction box to the first new recessed light. Let about 18 inches (45 cm) of electrical wiring hang from the ceiling.

, The extra wire will provide slack when connecting the new lights.


Run the wire from the attic if this is above the ceiling of recessed lights.
Drill through joists with a long, flexible drill bit if a finished floor is above the ceiling. Fish the electrical wiring through the framing.

, Match up black (hot) wires to each other, white (neutral) wires to each other, and ground (bare or green insulated) wires to each other.

, Continue connecting matching wires to daisy chain the lights until finished.

,,, It should be connected to a junction box or electrical box along the lighting system path.

, Black (hot) and white (neutral) wires are generally involved in connecting the track lights.


Make note of any connections in wiring that appears more complex or involves other colored wires besides black and white.
Sketch how a light fixture is wired. Designate the wires by color in the sketch.
Alternatively, label wires with masking tape and a pencil to know how to reconnect them later.

, Add a plastic wire connector to join the connection between the two wires.

,,


In some track lighting systems, you may need to screw the black and white wires to terminals on the track connector. Screw the black wire to a terminal that has a brass-colored screw. Screw the white wire to a terminal with a silver screw.
If you will have multiple wires going into screw terminal connections, attach pigtail leads to the terminals. The pigtails are short wires that connect to terminals on switches or receptacles. Twist wire connectors onto the electrical wires to attach them to the pigtails.
Connect any ground wires, which are bare or green insulated wires, in new track lighting fixtures to any existing ground wires. Connect the new fixture grounding wires to grounding screws in metal electrical boxes if such boxes support the fixtures.

Make sure all electrical outlets are fitted and tight to the wall.,
Do not tamper with electrical plugs.,
Use a surge protector for multiple plugs.,
Replace any frayed or cracked electrical cords.,
Use extension cords as a temporary solution.,
Keep electrical cords away from carpets and water.",How to Prevent Electrical Fires1," Start by checking all the electrical outlets in your home or on your job site. Make sure they are tight and fitted to the wall, as loose-fitted plugs can be a shock or fire hazard. If you notice any of the wall plates are broken or missing, put new wall plate over the outlets so there are no exposed electrical wiring.You should also cover any unused outlets with protective covers, especially if you have young children who will be moving around in the space. This will prevent electrocution and other electrical injuries.;
, You should never remove the third prong on a plug to try to make it fit into a two-conductor outlet. You should also never bend or twist the prongs on the plug, as this can lead to an electrical hazard.Make sure you never force plugs into an outlet. Instead, hold the covered top section of the plug firmly to slide it into and out of the electrical plug. Pulling on the cord itself can wear it out and increase the risk of an electrical fire., Overloading an outlet with too many plugs can cause an electrical fire. Instead, buy several surge protectors, or power bars and place them in the electrical outlets in your home. You should then plug no more than one to three cords at a time into the power bar.Make sure you get power bars with internal overload protection. The internal overload protection will cause the power bar to shut down if it gets overloaded, preventing an electrical fire from occurring., You should also check the electrical cords in your home to ensure they are not frayed or cracked. If they are, replace them with new electrical cords. You may need to contact the manufacturer of an appliance for a replacement cord.You should also make sure the electrical plug is securely attached to the electrical cord. You do not want any exposed wiring or components on the plug or the cord.

, Though it may be tempting to use extension cords to extend the cords on your appliances or electronics, they should only be a temporary solution. You should not use extension cords as permanent electrical wiring for your home or office. They can be a major electrical hazard.If you do use extension cords, make sure they have safety closures on them. This will protect young children from getting shocked by the cords.

, Try not to place electrical cords under carpets, rugs, and furniture where they are hidden. They could end up causing a fire if they become frayed and come into contact with carpet or furniture. You should also place electrical cords in low traffic areas so they are not stepped on often or tampered with in any way.You should also keep water away from any electrical cords, as water can cause the cords to spark and could lead to an electrical fire. Do not use a hair dryer, for example, by a sink or bathtub.
Do not nail or staple electrical cords to walls, floors, or other objects, as this can interfere with the electrical current and lead to an electrical hazard.

Unplug the unit or flip the breaker off if it is directly plugged into the wall.,
Remove fluorescent tubes and set safely aside.,
Remove the cover plate that was hiding above the bulbs.,
Unhook all wires attached to the ballast.,
Remove the ballast.,
Buy a new electronic ballast suitable for the wattage of your lamp, using the one you removed as a guide.,
Screw the new ballast into the unit.,
Re-connect the wires by following the manual with your particular ballast.,
Replace the cover and tubes, then flip the light on to check.",How to Fix Fluorescent Light Humming," If the light is permanently connected to power, shut off the breaker. Do not disassemble the unit without disconnecting power.





;
, Make sure you don't break them! You can put them off to the side.








, The plate is usually screwed or clipped in, and easily removed. Make sure you save any screws or clips in a little pile for re-assembly.








, The ballast is the heavy metal block with several wires coming out of it. Disconnect the wires from power connection and from the contacts at the ends of the unit. Some units you cannot unwire, so you'll have to cut the wires and use wire nuts for re-assembly. If the wires don't come off, snip them.








If you have to snip wires, take a few pictures first so you can be assured you'll re-attach everything correctly.

Caution: If the power has been on the light, the ballast will likely be very hot.

, It is usually screwed into the light fixture on the sides. As always, make sure you save all screws for later. Some ballasts fit into metal grooves, also called tabs, to take some of the weight off the screws. Note how your particular ballast is installed before removing to make replacement easier.







, Almost all ballasts sold today are electronic, and they can range from $12-$200, depending on your light. Use the old ballast to determine the exact wattage of your new one. Ballasts can be found at most major hardware stores. When buying, you'll need to know:


Your light's wattage
The number of bulbs in the light
The wiring system on your old ballast., Before you get into the wiring, securely mount the ballast to the fixture.








, Be sure you've connected the color-coded wires to the proper terminals and to the power connection. Check it again. You really want to get this right the first time. If the wires clip right in, then this should be easy. For older models, you may have to do some basic wiring. To do so:









Cut wires to appropriate length
Strip 1/4"" of sheathing from the wires.
Group the matching wires from ballast to light according to your ballast's manual
Feed both ends of matching wire (one from the ballast, one from the light) into the wire nut.
Twist the nut clockwise to combine the wires, making sure the nut is very tight. Give the nut a slight tug to make sure everything is secure., Fluorescent lights really only have two parts -- the tube and the ballast. This means a new ballast is really the only repair you'll need to make to fix a humming bulb.









If you have flickering or continued issues, check the sockets. A bad or loose socket may be the culprit.
Finally, try replacing the light. They are cheap and easy to swap out."

Follow the manufacturer's instructions.,
Disconnect small appliances when not in use.,
Make sure you use the right light bulbs in fixtures.,
Make sure there are Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters in your outlets.",How to Prevent Electrical Fires2," Make sure you follow the manufacturer's instructions when using any electrical appliances or equipment. Do not use the products in ways that are not recommended by the manufacturer.You should also never use defective appliances in your home or office. Get them inspected by the manufacturer or by a qualified electrician.

, You should try to get into the habit of disconnecting small appliances like electric kettles, toasters, and hair dryers, once you are done using them. This way, you save electricity and you lower the risk of an electrical fire due to these appliances.You should also make sure you unplug all appliances before you clean them. You do not want water to come into contact with the appliances while they are plugged in.

, You should only use light bulbs that match the wattage of the fixture. Do not use light bulbs that have a higher wattage than recommended on the light fixture. This is an electrical hazard.Check that the light bulbs are screwed in properly. Improperly secured light bulbs can lead to overheating, which can then lead to an electrical fire.

, Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs), can help to prevent electrical fires by shutting down automatically if a circuit is overloaded or at risk. Your home or office may already have GFCIs installed in the electrical outlets. There will be a small black ""test"" button and a small red ""reset"" button on the outlets. You can then use these buttons to reset your electrical current if there is a power overloadThe most common type of GFCI is the ""receptacle-type"" GFCI, which can be installed in your electrical wall outlets by a qualified electrician.You should have GFCIs installed throughout your home, such as in your kitchen, your bathrooms, your laundry room, your workshop, your basement, and your garage.
There are also temporary, portable GFCIs available for construction sites and outdoor areas where you are using electric tools or yard equipment like lawn mowers or trimmers.
GFCIs in your home or office should be tested on a monthly basis to ensure they are functioning properly. They should be tested by a qualified electrician.

Pay attention to warning signs of faulty wiring.,
Get the electrical wiring checked by a qualified electrician.,
Update the electrical wiring every ten years.",How to Prevent Electrical Fires3," Older homes and apartments are at a higher risk of faulty wiring. You should be on the look out for any warning signs of faulty wiring in your space and make sure the wiring is inspected by a qualified electrician as soon as possible. There are several warning signs, including:Flickering light bulbs and lights that dim when you use certain appliances.
Light switches that are hot to the touch.
Plugs that spark when you try to plug them in.
Outlets that sound like they are buzzing, crackling, or hissing.
Circuit breakers and fuses that trip or short constantly.
Electrical wires and fuse boxes that feel hot to the touch.

, You should have the electrical wiring in your home or office inspected before you move into the space and on a consistent basis. Make sure you hire a qualified electrician to do the inspection of the entire space.The electrician should check that the circuit breakers and fuses are properly rated for the circuit they are protecting. The circuit breakers should also work properly.
The electrician should also check for any loose wires or loose lighting fixtures. They should replace any broken or faulty wiring in the space.
The electrician may also advise that you increase your space’s electrical service capacity, especially if you tend to have fuses that blow or trip often. You may need to upgrade the electrical service capacity to keep up with a high number of lighting, appliances, and electronics in your space.

, You should make sure the electrical wiring in your space is updated at least every ten years to prevent any electrical fire hazards. You may need to have a qualified electrical do small upgrades in your space and recommend additional protection, like GFCIs in other areas of your home.You should also make sure any smoke alarms in your home are replaced every ten years. Check the date of manufacture on the smoke alarm to confirm it is within ten years old. If not, replace it with a new smoke alarm.

Straight Runs: Straight Runs are the most basic form of track lighting. Link together track sections with a straight connector and piece together a simple track lighting system.
""L"" Layout: Construct an ""L"" Layout with an ""L"" Connector to piece together your track sections. There are two types of ""L"" Connectors: Inside Polarity and Outside Polarity. The Inside Polarity is generally the most popular choice. To identify polarity, orient the connector to ""L"" shape and the polarity grooves will intersect where indicated.
Flex Connector: Create a unique track lighting system by joining track sections with a flex connector. A Flex Connector permits a variety of track # layouts at almost any angle and variation of planes, including wall-to-ceiling or even cathedral ceilings. These connectors can flex up to 90 degrees.
Cross Layout: Cross Layouts are a great option for a room's complete coverage. Use the cross connector to piece sections together.
Grid Layout: Create a grid for the ultimate in track lighting. Use ""T"" Connectors and Cross Connectors to link track sections.
""T"" Layout: Construct a simple ""T"" Layout with the ""T"" Connector.
""H"" Layout: Create an ""H"" Layout by using ""T"" Connectors. There are two types of polarity for these connectors: Inside-Right and Inside-Left Polarity. The Inside-Right Polarity type connector is most often used. To identify polarity, orient the connector to ""T"" shape and the polarity grooves will intersect where indicated.
Dog Leg Layout: Piece together a Dog Leg Layout by using both Inside Polarity and Outside Polarity ""L"" Connectors.
Modified Grid Layout: Use both Inside Polarity and Outside Polarity ""L"" Connectors to create a modified grid layout.;
, A track is a surface mounted channel that holds the Track Heads. Mount the tracks directly to the ceiling, on the wall, or with pendants or cables for higher and sloped ceilings. (If you have higher ceilings, remember to place the tracks further away from the walls.) Keep in mind that track systems are normally only compatible with a given product line. Track sections range from 2' to 12' sections. Combine any amount of sections together for your ideal arrangement. Use the suggested layouts listed above, or put together your own unique system. Power supply is available anywhere along the track, so position Track Heads wherever you need them! Use End Feeds, Canopies, ""Anywhere"" Power Feeds, or a Cord and Plug as your energy source.

, Track Heads come in all different types and styles. Whether you're looking for a more decorative track system, a powerful light source to showcase artwork, or an unobtrusive lighting option, we have a wide selection of Track Heads to choose from. When browsing through our selection, consider the following:

Low Voltage: These track heads are usually 12 or 24 volts, consume less energy and are less expensive to maintain. (Transformer required)
Line Voltage: These track heads operate at 120 volts. (Transformer not required)
PAR Lamps: PAR lamps are line voltage halogen, energy efficient, have good optics, and excellent color quality.
MR-16: MR-16 bulbs are low voltage halogen lamps. Their precise beam control makes them a great choice for accent lighting. MR-16 lamps may cause shadows, so they may not be the best choice for task or general lighting.
Fluorescent: Fluorescent lights are also a great alternative. They're quite cost-effective for commercial settings because of their long hours of operations.

Figure out the height of the ceiling in your room.,
Figure out how big your bedroom is.,
Add up the width and length you calculated, in this case 14 + 10 = 24.",How to Choose the Right Size of Chandelier," The reason for this is that higher ceilings usually require larger fixtures while lower ceilings require smaller fixtures. A common favorite is to 2.5 to 3 inches (6.4 to 7.6 cm) for every foot of height for a room. So if the ceiling is 8 feet (2.4 m) high, the fixture should have a height of between 20 and 24 inches.;
, For our purposes, let's assume the room is 14 by 10 feet.

, The perfect diameter of the chandelier for a room like this would be approximately 24 inches (61.0 cm).

Find a bulb for an outdoor fixture.",How to Choose the Perfect Light Bulb for Your Lighting Fixture," The first thing to consider when matching a lightbulb to a light fixture is the wattage amount. Every light bulb has a matching wattage - the amount of energy it is capable of producing. This number will range anywhere from 40-watts to 120-watts for a traditional light fixture. On the flip side, every light fixture has a maximum wattage amount. This is the highest wattage the fixture is capable of using without becoming a fire hazard (it can’t handle a high wattage). You therefore need to choose a light bulb with a wattage amount that is equal to or less than the maximum wattage on your fixture.


Using a light bulb with wattage above the maximum that the fixture can handle is a major fire hazard.You can use a light bulb with wattage less than what your fixture asks for.;
, Lumens refers to the amount of light the bulb will put out (as opposed to wattage, which is the amount of energy). The higher number of lumens, the brighter the light bulb will be. Therefore, if you’re trying to illuminate a large space, you’ll want to use a light bulb with a high number of lumens (above 1000). A small fixture or table lamp does not require a bulb with a high number of lumens.


The more lumens, the closer the appearance of the light is to that of natural sunlight.

, There are many different shapes of light bulbs, each with a different use. The most commonly used bulbs are the generic ‘bulb’ shape, the spiral shape, and the A shape. Additionally, there are drop shaped, globe shaped, flame shaped, tubes, and more varieties of bulbs. Generally the shape doesn’t really matter, but some light fixtures require a specifically shaped bulb in order to work or appear correctly. Check your fixture first, and then look for bulbs that match.


Make sure to check the socket type and size of your lighting fixture so that you know what light bulbs you need.
There are 4 commonly used thread size groups for mains supply lamps: Candelabra - E12 North America, E11 in Europe; Intermediate - E17 North America, E14 (Small ES, SES) in Europe; medium or standard - E26 (MES) in North America, E27 (ES) in Europe; Mogul - Mogul: E39 North America, E40 (Goliath ES) in Europe.
The number after the E refers to the external diameter of the light bulb's thread in millimeters. For example, E27 means that the external diameter of the thread is 27 millimeters.

, All light bulbs are not created equal; in fact, some bulbs last quite a long time, while others will only remain lit for a few months or years of use. Each bulb should say on the back what the life expectancy is, normally based on three hours of use a day. If you’re putting the bulb in a well-used fixture, it will do you good to find a bulb that has a longer life expectancy than a bulb that goes in a rarely-used lamp.


Incandescent bulbs generally have the shortest life expectancy.
Halogen bulbs are cheap upgrades over traditional incandescent bulbs, having improved efficiency and lifespan with only a small increase in price.
Compact fluorescent bulbs have a lifespan that is several times better than an incandescent light bulb but the lifespan is reduced significantly if the bulb is switched on and off frequently.
LED bulbs have arguably the longest lifespan of all light bulbs, several times better than an incandescent light bulb and significantly better than most fluorescent bulbs. Manufacturers are giving long warranties to confirm the long lifespan of LED bulbs, typically 15,000 hours (15 years at 3 hours/day), and to support 50,000 switch cycles.

, Most bulbs will advertise the ‘light appearance’ on the package - this tells you how warm or cold the color of the light is. Light appearance that is on the warm side will be more orange/yellow, while light appearance that is on the cold side will be more blue/white. Although this may not be a serious consideration for you when choosing your bulbs, you might want to make sure you don’t accidentally purchase a bright white bulb when you intended to buy a warm yellow bulb.Light appearance is measured in temperature using the Kelvin scale. Color temperatures in the range 2700K–3000K are considered ""warm white"". 3500K-4500K would be ""neutral white"", sometimes called ""bright white"", over 5000K would be ""cool white"" or ""daylight"". (These names are approximate descriptions. Lower color temperatures are warmer/yellower; higher temperatures are cooler/bluer).

, Besides the initial cost of the light bulb, there is an additional overall energy cost associated with the bulb. This is the price you will pay in electricity bills for the one bulb over its lifetime. Energy efficient light bulbs will cost much less over their lifetimes than will traditional light bulbs. When possible, you’ll want to choose bulbs that have a low lifetime cost. This may mean paying a bit more up front, but you’ll reap the benefits down the road.

, The mercury content of the bulb doesn’t affect the light or overall use of the bulb; the only thing a bulb that contains mercury will do is prevent you from throwing it away. If your bulb has any mercury in it at all, it cannot be disposed of in the trash. Now, mostly screw-in CFL bulbs contain mercury, but you should check all bulbs you purchase just in case., Compact fluorescent is a generic term used for a variety of bulbs. CFLs use 20-40% less energy to produce the same light or lumens (a measure of light intensity). They are color adjusted to produce light close to real sunlight.


CFLs generate less heat and offer a longer lifespan than incandescent bulbs saving you money on electric bills and protecting the environment from harmful greenhouse gas emissions.
Look for Energy Star labels on fluorescent fixtures and lamps for assurance of maximum savings, quality and standards.
Compact fluorescent light bulbs are commonly used in desk lamps, floor lamps, under cabinet lamps, table lamps, linear strips, wall sconces, flush mounts, chandeliers, close-to-ceiling or flush mounts, pendants, ceiling clouds, kitchen island lights, path lights, outdoor wall lanterns, outdoor post lanterns, as well as outdoor wall and ceiling mounts. First generation compact fluorescents can not be used in motion sensor fixtures or lights with a dimmer switch; however newer second generation CFLs (that are usually more expensive) may be specifically labeled and sold for that purpose.

, Choose fluorescent light bulbs for energy conservation and versatility. Fluorescent light bulbs are an energy efficient bulb, using 20-40% less electricity than standard incandescent bulbs lasting up to 20 times longer. Many new compact styles make fluorescent bulbs practical for task lighting. Screw-in types can be used in place of incandescent bulbs in standard lamp sockets. The warmth and softness of the fluorescent light bulbs is improving.


Fluorescent light bulbs are commonly used in desk lamps, floor lamps, under-cabinet lamps, table lamps, linear strips, wall sconces, flush mounts, chandeliers, close-to-ceiling mounts, pendants, ceiling clouds, kitchen island lights, path lights, outdoor wall lanterns and outdoor post lanterns.

, Many of today's lamps use halogen light bulbs. Halogen bulbs produce a whiter light and produce more light (lumens) per watt than standard incandescent bulbs. They most closely replicate the color spectrum of the sun. Their small size and intensity make halogens great for task lighting.


For precise and controlled beams of light, low voltage Halogen bulbs are specified for dramatic effect in highlighting details with pinpoint beams of light on artwork, architectural details, sculptures, etc... Low voltage bulbs are 12 or 24 volt and require a transformer.
Since halogen bulbs burn hotter than other types, they require more caution. All halogen lamps sold today in the USA have approved safety shields to reduce fire risk. When changing a halogen bulb, be sure to wait until the bulb cools to touch it. Always use a clean rag to handle a halogen bulb, as oils from your hand will cause the bulb to burn hotter and can greatly reduce the lifespan of your bulb. Examples: GU-10, MR-16, JC/JCD, G9, JDE-11, JT-3, JT-4, PAR
Halogen Lamp light bulbs are most commonly used in desk lamps, torchieres, floor lamps, accent table lamps, under-cabinet lighting, bath brackets, vanity lights, wall sconces, swing arm lamps, ceiling lamps, flush mounts, pendants, directional lamps, chandeliers, kitchen island lights, landscape lighting, path lighting, and also outdoor spot/flood lights.

, Incandescent light bulbs are the most common bulb used in lamps today because they are inexpensive and widely available. Common incandescent bulbs vary from 15 to 150 watts and produce a soft yellow-white but are available in a variety of light temperatures ranging from pinkish to bluish. They are generally available in clear, frosted or colored styles.


With standard incandescent bulbs, light is generated when a filament is heated to incandescence (illumination) through an electric current within the glass bulb. Incandescent reflector bulbs provide general overall illumination and are often referred to as floor and spot lights.
Incandescent bulbs are great for standard ambient lighting and higher wattages and are good for task lighting. When using incandescent bulbs be sure to never exceed the maximum wattage recommended for your lamp! Examples: G25, G16.5, T Bulb, BR/R, Standard Medium Base, Standard Candelabra, Fan/Appliance
Incandescent light bulbs are typically used in accent lamps, buffet lamps, reading lamps, desk lamps, floor lamps, hurricane lamps, magnifying lights, display lighting, bath/vanity lighting, wall sconces, swing arm lights, wallchieres, ceiling clouds, chandeliers, close-to-ceiling mounts, directional lights, flush mounts, kitchen island lighting, pendants, pot rack lighting, outdoor hanging lanterns, landscape lighting, path lights, post lanterns, spot/flood lights, and outdoor wall lanterns.
Incandescent light bulbs are being phased out over more energy efficient lighting solutions. This is done by either a complete ban or a higher standard for efficiency.

, Choose PAR lamps for control of light levels. PAR stands for Parabolic Aluminized Reflector. A PAR lamp can be incandescent, halogen or an HID and has a precision-pressed glass reflector lamp that reflects light coming from the filament much like a parabola. PAR lamps rely on both the internal reflector and prisms in the lens for a controlled or focused light beam. These bulbs are extremely bright and can be used for the accurate controlling of light levels.


Halogen PAR bulbs have a mirrored reflector to control the light. Halogen PAR bulbs are often specified for task and accent lighting.

, Choose Xenon light bulbs for path lighting. Xenon light bulbs are made from Xenon, a rare gas used in specialized lamps. They are known to last up to 10,000 hours. Xenon bulbs can be touched with a bare hand unlike halogen bulbs and are commonly used in path lighting.


Festoon bulbs: Festoon bulbs have a unique shape and are usually a low-voltage bulb. They come in frosted or clear glass. If using festoon lamps for task lighting or indirect lighting (under cabinets and shelves, over cabinets, or inside cabinets), frosted lamps are best. However, if the festoon lamps are being used for accent lighting to illuminate items that should ""sparkle"" (jewelry, china, crystal), it's recommended to use clear lamps.

, LEDs are a small electronic device that lights up when electricity is passed through it. LEDs are highly energy-efficient and have very long lives. They can be red, green, blue or white in color. LED bulbs can be used almost anywhere, typical applications are general room lighting, desk lamps, outdoor hanging lanterns, landscape lighting, path lighting, and spot/flood lighting.


LED light bulbs are relatively new to the market but they show immense potential. The LED lamp market is projected to grow by more than twelve-fold over the next decade, from $2 billion in the beginning of 2014 to $25 billion in 2023, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25%.

, A few different choices might fit the bill.


Black Light: A fluorescent light designed to emit invisible ultraviolet (UV) light.
Heat Lamps: Light bulbs used to increase the temperature in a focused area. They are most often used in the food industry and outdoor waiting areas.
Krypton Lamps: A premium light bulb that uses krypton gas instead of argon.
Shatter Resistant, Silicone & Teflon Coated, Etc.: These light bulbs feature a safe shield coating that protects them from shattering and breakage. They come in different types.
Full Spectrum Daylight: Full spectrum light bulbs are designed to reproduce natural light and are thought to be beneficial to health by reducing stress, depression and headaches, amongst other things. Full spectrum bulbs are most often used in desk lamps and floor lamps.
Germicidal Lamps: Germicidal lamps offer ultraviolet technology that is a non-chemical approach to disinfection. In this process of disinfection, nothing is added which makes this development simple, economical and requires very low maintenance.

, These bulbs are an emerging technology that offers a new choice for consumers seeking energy-efficient lighting without the dangers of CFLs or the high cost of LEDs. The R30 ESL Bulb is designed to replace the 65-watt incandescent flood bulb commonly used in recessed “can” light fixtures, which are popular in new construction and remodeled homes.


The R30 ESL bulb gives uniform flood illumination virtually indistinguishable from the incandescent lamp it replaces. A high power factor gives the R30 ESL bulb less total power load than competing compact fluorescent lamps. It generates approximately 10,000 hours of light without any significant color shift. Its pricing is expected to be around $15-20 U.S. While testing and production of these bulbs has slowed their expected release to the public market, they are still planned for future mass production., If you’ve got a free-standing lamp for a floor or a large table lamp, you’ve got a few options for possible light bulbs. Look into using a spiral or closed-A shape bulb that is compact fluorescent or incandescent. Stick with bulbs on the warm-side, as they will be lighting up your room and generally tend to be easier on the eyes in a warmer hue (like a ‘daylight’ bulb).

, Because pendant fixtures tend to have at least part or half of the bulb exposed, your choices are limited for possible lights. You’ll want to start by finding a bulb in a traditional ‘bulb’ or ‘globe’ shape, in the warmer side of the light appearance scale. Most people prefer to use a compact fluorescent light bulb or a halogen light bulb for this purpose.

, Ceiling fixtures are generally enclosed so that the light bulb is not visible, giving you many more options for bulbs than a pendant fixture does. Choose a bulb that has a long lifespan, so that you don’t have to change it often. The light appearance you want will vary depending on the atmosphere of the room. Any type of bulb (so long as it is compatible with the fixture) will work for a ceiling fixture, but it will do you good to try to find an energy efficient bulb when possible.

, Wall sconces tend to be on the smaller side and are mostly decorative, meaning that the bulbs you choose will need to be small enough to be covered completely by the sconce. Choose a bulb that is tube or flame shaped, as these are narrow enough to fit inside the sconce. Compact fluorescent light bulbs and incandescent light bulbs are most commonly used for a wall sconce.

, Because recessed can fixtures don’t allow much ventilation, they are the highest risk for fire hazard. As a result, your primary goal will be to choose a bulb that does not exceed the maximum wattage for your fixture. Most people choose a halogen, compact fluorescent, or incandescent light bulb for a recessed can fixture. The light appearance will vary depending on the location., If your outdoor fixture is exposed to the elements, you’ll need to purchase a special outdoor bulb which won’t be damaged from exposure. Otherwise, choose a bulb that is either spiral or tubed in a ‘bright white’ light appearance. LEDs are popular choices, as are incandescent and halogen bulbs. Keep in mind that you’ll need to buy a special bulb if you have a photosensitive fixture or a fixture that is on a timer. Check your local lighting store for these alternatives."

Wait until the bulb is cool.,
Tear off a strip of duct tape.,
Fold over each end of the duct tape.,
Stick the duct tape to the light bulb.,
Twist to unscrew.,
Finish unscrewing by hand.,
Replace the light bulb with the same method.",How to Change a Lightbulb in a Recessed Light1," If the light was recently on, wait until it is cool to the touch. This shouldn't take more than five minutes for a normal light bulb. Halogen lights may take twenty minutes., The strip should be about 12 inches (30 cm) long, or half as long as your arm.








, Fold a short section of the duct tape over and stick it to itself. Repeat on the other side. These folded ""handles"" should be long enough for you to grip, with a sticky segment in between them.








If you find it easier, you can wrap the duct tape in a circle instead, with the adhesive on the outside. Make the circle large enough to fit your hand through it.

, Hold the handles of the duct tape and press the sticky segment against the flat surface of the recessed bulb.








, Once the tape sticks to the light bulb, you should have enough leverage to get it loose. Almost all light bulbs use standard screw threading, so turn the bulb counterclockwise to unscrew it.









If it doesn't budge, read the method below for help removing the surrounding collar.

, Once the light bulb has emerged enough for you to grip the sides, pull off the duct tape. It's faster at this point to spin the bulb out by hand.

, Screw in the new light bulb as far as you can by hand. When it's nearly flush, stick on the duct tape and turn clockwise to tighten to a secure fit.

"
"
Turn off the light.,
Look for a metal ring around the light bulb.,
Cut away paint if necessary.,
Look for a screw or button.,
Test whether the collar twists or pulls out.,
Pry out the ring with a screwdriver.,
Remove a stuck ring.",How to Change a Lightbulb in a Recessed Light2," Let the bulb cool to room temperature before you handle it.

, Many recessed fixtures hold the bulb in with a metal collar. These are often removable, but follow the instructions below to avoid damaging your ceiling.


This is not necessarily the large ring that holds in the entire fixture, although it can be. Look closely for a second ring flush against the light bulb., If someone has painted over the ring, it may rip away pieces of drywall when you unscrew it. To avoid this, cut the paint around the ring with a utility knife, working it against the collar.Now try the steps below until you find one that works for your model.

, If you're lucky, your collar is simply held in place by a couple of screws. Some models have a small metal button, which you push or slide sideways to free the fixture., Some models can be twisted or pulled out by hand. Use light pressure only, unless you have confirmed this is the intended approach with a manual or the manufacturer. Here are two examples of light fixtures you can remove this way:


Modern recessed halogen lights often have a plastic collar with three tabs. Press your fingers against these tabs and rotate counterclockwise. Once you have access to the bulb, grip the base and the wire and wiggle them apart.Some recessed LED light fixtures can be pulled directly out of the ceiling. Watch your fingers, as a sharp metal clip will pop downward from the edge as the fixture emerges. You can then unclip the bulb from the wire., Some older halogen fixtures use a small, toothed, metal ring with no special fastener. Carefully insert a flathead screwdriver in between the ring and the light bulb, and pry outward. There is a gap in the ring, so you can flex it outward and carefully pull it down with your fingers. Grip the base of the bulb and gently wiggle the two prongs out of the socket to remove it.Take care not to chip the glass with the screwdriver.

, If there is no obvious fastener for the ring, but it refuses to twist out, it may be jammed. Try gently pushing up on the light bulb with a couple fingers from each hand. If the bulb recesses further into the ceiling, press your fingers outward against opposite sides of the ring. Try to rotate the ring while pressing to improve your grip.If this still doesn't work, and your model has three small tabs on the plastic collar, grip one of the tabs with a pair of pliers. Push with the pliers as you push another tab by hand."
"
Determine what type of housings you'll need.,
Consider your trim.,
Often times, several different trim types will match one particular housing, so browse through the definitions and find one that meets your needs.

,
Consider the lamp/bulb.",How to Choose Recessed Lighting," If you're building a new home or office, you'll need housings specifically designed for New Construction. If you're replacing an old recessed light, or adding to an existing structure, you'll need a Remodeling, or Old Construction, housing. Once you've narrowed your search this way, consider these options:


Ceiling Insulation (IC, Non-IC): If your ceiling is insulated, you'll need IC rated housings. If your ceiling is not insulated, you may use either IC or non-IC rated housings.

Airtight/Energy Efficient:These are energy-saving, and are an evolving trend across the country. Traditionally, recessed lighting has been manufactured with many penetrations to the outer housing allowing heat or cooled air to escape into the ceiling space. This creates an unnecessary strain on heating and cooling systems, ultimately resulting in higher than needed electric and gas bills. To find out if your state has an energy code, refer to the map below, and remember: Airtight Ready fixtures are not Airtight, they require certain trims or a field-installable gasket kit to cover the holes in the product.

UL/CUL Damp Locations: A Damp Location is an area that is exposed to moisture, but not directly to water. Keep an eye out for items noted as UL or UL/CUL listed. These products are the safest bets for showers, kitchens, or any other area that might be exposed to moisture.



 



Fire Rated Light Covers: Many contractors and home-builders struggled in the past trying to maintain the fire rating of the ceiling when penetrated by recessed light fixtures. They either built labor intensive drywall boxes or relied on expensive fire rated lights. But besides their high cost, these lights are also only available in selected sizes and colors, limiting the choice of home-builders. A smart and UL-classified alternative are Fire Rated Light Covers. The covers are made from an intumescent material that expands internally to fill all of the available space with a fire resistant, highly insulating char. They are easy to install, by simply putting them on top of the light without any additional tools and can be fitted in seconds. Besides its primary function to maintain the fire protection performance of a ceiling, the FF109-300 covers also provide thermal and acoustic insulation. The product seems to be a win-win situation for private home-builders, designers, architects and contractors.

EZ Barrier Fire Rated Enclosures: Another easy, simple and secure alternative that provides a one hour fire rating for recessed lighting and can be used with both IC and non IC fixtures. Simply mount the lighting fixture to the inside of the rectangular 24 GA non-porous, corrosion resistant galvanized steel enclosure and then secure the enclosure to the ceiling/floor assembly simply by screwing four wood screws through the pre-drilled holes in enclosure's flange to the wood truss and finally run your wiring through one of four round knockouts. The ezb 16-24-9 meets the following fire-rated specifications: UL 263, UBC 7-1, NFPA 251 and ASI A2.1.







Firebox: Separation walls and floor/ceiling assemblies have specific hourly fire ratings. These ratings identify the amount of time it takes for fire to pass through these barriers, as well as how much time a building's occupants have to escape before the structural integrity of the building is jeopardized. Fireboxes maintain this fire rating, while historically, recessed lighting has eliminated a structure's rating. A Firebox housing installs the same way any other downlight would, and eliminates the hassle of custom built boxes. Additionally, they are UL classified to maintain fire ratings, where custom built boxes are not tested for anything. When using recessed lighting in fire rated ceilings it is critical to use a Firebox to maintain the integrity of the structure in the unfortunate event of a fire.<br.


Commercial Use: If your needs are aimed toward commercial use, check out housings like Progress' compact fluorescent Pro-Optic Series. These housings allow for higher light output, and are available in 6"" and 8"" trim sizes. These housings will also greatly minimize the perceived brightness of the fixture, and improve the overall efficiency of the housing/trim combination.;
, Trims come in all different colors and styles, and are the only part of recessed lighting that is visible. When purchasing trims, make sure the trim you choose corresponds with your current or new housing. There are several types of trims:



Baffles: Baffles trap and shape the light, ultimately minimizing glare and reducing brightness by narrowing the focus of the downlighting beam. They also provide control for R, BR, and PAR lamps. (see lamp details below)

Reflectors: Reflectors maximize light output. These trims are ideal for general, accent, and task applications for both residential and commercial needs.

Wall Washers: Wall Washers emphasize vertical surfaces and visually increase the perceived size of a room. Aim wall washers toward pictures, fireplaces, or wall hangings.

Lenses and Diffusers: Lenses and Diffusers are ideal for closets, bathrooms, and covered porches to diffuse light and shield the lamp.

Eyeballs and Adjustables: Eyeballs provide adjustable and directional lighting suitable for accent, task, and wall washing.

Open: Open trims are the most economical choice for recessed lighting. They create an attractive finished look without compromising the efficiency of the light source.

Decorative: Decorative trims are a great way to give a room or space a stylish boost. They're all UL listed for damp locations, and accommodate a number of lamp types.

,, Your housing and trims will specify what type of lamp you will need, but here is a general rundown on major ones to consider:

' 'Incandescent: Standard incandescent bulbs give off a warm glow, and work well with day to day decorative lamps.


Incandescent R Lamps: R Lamps also give off a warm light color, and are ideal for recessed downlighting and downlights in chandeliers. These are reflective general service lamps.

Incandescent Par Lamps: Par Lamps are the most sophisticated reflector lamps with incandescent or tungsten halogen light sources. These lamps offer a wide variety of beam patterns and a whiter light.

Incandescent Halogen Lamps: The lamps are miniature halogen lamps that provide excellent color rendition and maximum beam control.



Compact Fluorescent: Compact Fluorescent lamps are great for general illumination. They are long life and energy efficient fluorescent lamps.

Low Voltage 12 Volt:Low Voltage lamps offer excellent color rendition and beam pattern control. They also offer good precise task lighting with energy savings.

MR and PAR Lamps: MR and PAR lamps are compact halogen unit sources with good beam pattern control.

Bayonet and Bi-Pin Lamps: Bayonet and Bi-Pin lamps are halogen or incandescent low voltage lamps ideal for landscape and undercabinet applications.

High Intensity Discharge: There are three types of High Intensity Discharge.

Metal Halide: Metal Halide has good color rendering characteristics, long life, and optical control.

High Pressure Sodium: This is the most efficient HID source. High Pressure Sodium emits a yellowish color.

Mercury Vapor: This HID lamp is suitable for outdoor use and emits a blue/green light.

Fluorescent: Fluorescent lamps are about five times as efficient converting electricity as incandescent lamps.

LED: LED lamps are relatively new to the market but show extreme potential. LED light bulbs are highly efficient and long lasting.

Make sure the power is turned off.,
Take other safety measures.",How to Change a Light Bulb1," This is a good idea any time you are messing around with electrical fixtures. Why not be safe?


Just switch the red power button to “off” in your fuse box. Be aware this will shut off all of your power, not just for one fixture.
You should also unplug the lighting fixture before you change the light bulb (if it’s a fixture with a plug, that is). If you don’t, you could risk getting shocked. Always be careful around electricity.;
, There are a few things you should keep in mind, especially if the bulb is high up in the ceiling.


Let the bulb cool off before you unscrew it. If the light was on recently, the bulb will be hot to the touch, and you could burn your fingers.If the bulb is in a ceiling fixture, don’t try to balance on an unsteady chair or something similar. Use a sturdy stepladder. That way you can reach the light bulb without falling.
Instead of a step ladder, you can buy a special extension tool to switch a light bulb that is very high up. This is often safer than trying to climb a ladder. And remember: You could always hire a handyman! You shouldn’t need any other tools to change a light bulb in a lamp fixture.

"
"
Take the bulb out of the socket.,
Put a new bulb in the socket.",How to Change a Light Bulb2," If the fixture is easy to reach, such as a lamp, the process is pretty straightforward. Sockets do differ depending on your lighting fixture.


If you have a bayonet mount, which is common in the UK and places like New Zealand, hold the bulb gently but firmly, and then push down and turn the bulb counter-clockwise. This should release it from the socket. This type of socket has two prongs.
If the socket has a screw fitting, which is common in America and throughout Europe, you should gently twist the bulb counter clockwise. It should then come loose from the socket, and you can remove it.

, In order to put a new bulb into a lighting fixture’s socket, you will want to turn the bulb in a clockwise direction. Just remember: Counter-clockwise to remove; clockwise to insert.


The bulb might lock into place or you might have to twist it a bit until you can’t twist it anymore. This will depend on the socket. Don’t screw the bulb too tight or it could break. If you have a bayonet bulb, you will need to align the bulb’s base with the two pins. Push down and then twist upwards, using a clockwise motion.
In the case of a screw cap bulb, simply place it into the hole and then twist it. You will usually want to choose a bulb that has the same wattage as the old bulb, unless you want softer or brighter light than what you already had.
Check the label on the bulb socket or fixture for the max watt/amp rating. Make sure the bulb’s power rating doesn’t exceed that allowed by your lighting fixture (check with the manufacturer or packaging).

Change a light bulb in a home dome light.,
Change a light bulb in a high ceiling.,
Remove a car dome light bulb.",How to Change a Light Bulb3," You’ve seen these lights. They’re set into the ceiling. To change the light bulb, you usually have to remove the screws that hold the glass or plastic dome over the light bulb. Usually there are about 2-3 screws holding the dome to the frame. Remove them with a screwdriver.


Now, lift the dome head carefully off the frame. Some dome lights have notch mechanisms instead. In those cases you will push up on the dome lightly, twist it, and then pull it down. This could release it. If there is a notch, you may need to push up into the notch, and then pull it down.If the dome light is not screwed in, you could twist the dome off with your hands. Try wearing rubber gloves to remove it in order to increase the friction.Some dome fixtures are fastened to the frame with metal clips. Try pulling out one of the clips, and the dome should usually fall off. Some glass dome lights have a single center nut that you need to unscrew to get the dome off.
If you have one of those dome lights with a metal rim, you should be able to unscrew the metal trim with your hands. It’s possible you will have to break the seal on it first. For example, sometimes people paint too close to the trim, so paint could have dried between the metal rim and the dome cover. Try pushing it slightly upwards and then twisting it counter clockwise after breaking the seal (you could use a flat head screwdriver or knife to do this. Be careful).

, What if the light bulb is way up on a vaulted ceiling? And is recessed lighting? For example, some people have ceilings that are 16 feet high.


Go to a home improvement store or online, and purchase an extended light bulb changing pole. These are long poles that you can use to change light bulbs. These extenders can give you a very long reach.Attach the suction cup to the hole. Attach the string to the side of the suction cup so that you can release the suction cup from the bulb.This process works for recessed lights. The pole works by fastening the suction cup onto the bulb. Extend the pole up to the lighting fixture. Place the suction cup on the bulb. Untwist it, and slowly remove the old bulb. Pull the string to take the bulb off.
Put a new bulb on the end of the suction cup, which should still be fastened to the pole. Put it up into the recessed lighting fixture. Twist it in. Pull the string to loosen the suction.

, It shouldn’t take you very long to replace the light bulb that illuminates the inside of your car. You probably can do this yourself.


Take off the bulb lens cover. It’s possible you will need a screwdriver to do this because some lens covers are held in place with two screws. In other cases, you can just pry it off with a flat head screwdriver.
Put the screwdriver opposite the light switch. Press in.The lens cover should pop off. Now unscrew the light bulb from the socket. Screw a new bulb in (ask at an auto store to make sure you get the right bulb). Replace the lens cover by snapping it in place or replacing the screws.

"
"
Get rid of the bulb safely.",How to Change a Light Bulb4," Be aware that light bulbs are very fragile. Thus, you don’t want to just toss them haphazardly in your garbage can. If the bulb breaks, the shards can cut someone.


Wrap the old bulb in the new bulb’s package before throwing it away. You could also wrap the old bulb in a newspaper or old magazine.
Throw the bulb away in places that children can’t reach. Make sure to recycle the bulb if possible or required in your area.

"
"
Danger!,
Find the circuit breaker and turn it off!,
Get a standard wooden broomstick, an extension pole for a paint-roller, or any wooden pole that is about an inch (25 mm) in diameter will work also.

,
Put newspaper or a box under the socket to collect broken glass.

,
Cover the light bulb with a large, thick towel or cloth, and tap it gently to break the glass.,
The pole will fit nicely into the medium screw base.

,
Unscrew the base from the socket -- the socket should stick to the pole.

",How to Change a Stuck Lightbulb," Do not break compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs)! These bulbs contain toxic mercury vapor which is extremely hazardous to the health of humans and pets. Do not use this method to remove CFLs.;
, Or, in the case of lamps, unplug it from the electrical socket. Do not continue until this step is complete.

It is unnecessary to lower the water level.,
Go inside of the fixture.,
After the lens is removed, remove the bulb.,
Install the new bulb.,
Reassemble the lens onto the fixture, using a NEW lens gasket.,
Place light under water and check for air leaks (a few bubbles may come off of the fixture ring).,
Replace the fixture into the niche.",How to Change a Bulb in Your Underwater Light,";
, Most all light fixtures have enough cord coiled up inside of the light niche to allow the fixture to be brought up onto the deck for repair. Remove the single stainless steel screw at the top of the light (at 12 o'clock). Once this is removed, use a flathead screwdriver to pry the fixture out of the niche. Most fixtures have a tab at the bottom (at 6 o'clock). You may need to pry and wiggle in the direction of the tab to remove the fixture. Once removed, lift it up onto the deck.

, Use quality tools of proper size, so as not to strip any of the soft metal screws, bolts, etc. On very old fixtures, screws may break easily, or be corroded from years of water and chemical exposure. Old model lights have 8 brass screws around the fixture, which tighten down on tabs. Newer models have a clamp band with only one screw or bolt/nut. Remove the screws or clamp and gently pry the glass lens out of the front of the fixture.

, Most will twist out counter-clockwise. Some spa lamps or small halogen lamps for pools have small bulbs that you need to push in and then twist to remove. Whatever it's type, be careful in removing the bulb, old bulbs may break at the base during removal. It's good practice to cover the bulb with a soft cloth before turning it (counter-clockwise to remove). After removing the bulb, use the cloth to wipe clean and dry all interior surfaces. Thread in a new bulb, specifically made for the fixture. Don't use anything other than the real thing.

, Before reassembly, turn on power Very Briefly (for 1 - 2 seconds) to check that the bulb/lamp is working.

, This is the rubber gasket around the lens, approx 8"" diameter. Complete the reassembly of the fixture. Make sure screws are very tight. Follow any printed instructions on the lens for proper alignment of lens to fixture.

, If you have no bubbles streaming out of your gasket, you have a good seal.

, First coil the cord around the back of the fixture, then locate the bottom tab (on the fixture) and tab receiver (on the niche). Line them up and insert the tab into position, and push the fixture flush into the niche. Then it's just the ""not always simple"" task of getting the top screw back in through the light bezel ring and into the threaded hole in the niche. Tighten screw down just snug (not too tight). Test your light again.

Secure the outlet.,
Turn the power back on.",How to Ground an Outlet," A circuit tester plugs into the outlet and has several light sequences to indicate the different problems an outlet may have. If you're going to ground an outlet, it's an important tool to have. You can purchase these at any home repair store. One model has a button to test GFCI outlets. It's a little more money but a better buy to verify the GFCI.;
, Plug the circuit tester into each outlet and look at the indicator lights. If the lights indicate the outlet is not grounded properly, mark the cover with a piece of masking tape. Move on to the next outlet.


Do not try to fix more than one outlet at a time. Unless you are sure of your work, its better to check them one at a time. This may involve turning the electrical circuit breaker on and off many times while you work.

, Either turn off the circuit breaker that controls the outlets to the specific room or turn off the main switch for the whole house. If you only turn off the breaker, retest the outlet with the circuit tester to ensure it's the correct one.

, For the most part, cover plates will be attached with flathead screws, which means you should be able to easily remove them with a small, flathead screwdriver. If paint or wallpaper is in the way slightly, you might need to carefully cut around the outlet with a utility knife to keep the wallpaper from tearing and making the wall look raggedy.

, Several inspections and permits are required for most residential construction projects, especially when it involves electrical work.To make sure you're up to code, you may need to schedule temporary service inspection, a rough-in inspection, and a final inspection. This needs to be done whether you're doing it yourself or hiring a subcontractor.


The National Electrical Code requires all GFCIs within 5 feet of the floor to be child-safe and clearly marked. Outdoor GFCIs must also be weather resistant and clearly marked, even if it has a weather cover.
Check your local wiring codes to see if a GFCI is an acceptable replacement for a non-grounded two-prong outlet. There are acceptable installation procedures for non-grounded GFCI usually involving putting a sticker on the outlet cover stating ""Non-Appliance Ground."" In some areas, you may need a GFCI due to nearby water fixtures.

, Unscrew the mounting screws located at the top and bottom of the outlet. You may need to cut the painted edge and pry it loose. Pull out the outlet from the box as far as the wires allow and locate the green grounding screw near the bottom of the receptacle.


Locate the grounding wire, if applicable. The grounding wire may not covered by insulation and is usually copper colored. Oftentimes, the insulation will be green.

, If you have three wires in the box (black, white, and copper), you will need to attach or tighten the grounding wire. If you have only two wires and a 2-prong outlet, you can ground the outlet by attaching a GFI or GFCI receptacle.


This assumes a ground wire has been run to the outlet, and that the outlet box is grounded. If your older wiring only has two wires (black and white, with no grounding wire), the box is not grounded and you will have to install a new outlet.
In the United States, no separate ground wire may be run to an existing outlet to provide a Ground for a GFCI outlet, because it's a violation of the electrical code.
If you have a ground wire, usually a bare copper or green wire, in the box, it may or may not be grounded, which means you should test that for ground. If you have one of those wires in the box, you can hook it up to a grounded outlet and use the tester to see if it’s properly grounded.

, Often the grounding wire is wrapped around the cable as it enters the box and tightened beneath the clamp that secures the cable to the outlet box. In this case you can simply replace the 2-prong outlet with a 3-prong outlet, since the third prong will be grounded through the screws that mount the outlet to the box.

, If you don’t have a ground wire in the box, grounding that outlet would require installing a new outlet to code. If you are going to use a GFCI to protect and control additional outlets, you can run a wire set (3 wires) to other outlets that are in line (down the chain) from that GFCI, but only if you have a verified ground at the GFCI outlet. One GFCI will protect them, but all must have a three-prong outlet in each box. You may need to switch them all out, after ensuring you have a good ground at each outlet.


The load screw or load terminals on the GFCI is only used if you’re trying to protect other outlets with that GFCI. There are two terminals on the outlet that are normally used: hot, neutral, ground, if necessary. Load terminal is only used in cases where GFCI is protecting other non-GFCI outlets. It wouldn’t normally be used if you’re swapping out a two-prong with GFCI.

, If the grounding wire has become loose or disconnected, loop the grounding wire over the green terminal screw and tighten with a #2 Philips screwdriver. Make a loop at the end of the copper wire with a pair of needle-nose pliers. This secures the wire onto the screw. Be sure to place the loop of the wire on the terminal screw so that when you tighten the screw, the loop is tightened and not pushed off the terminal.


Check the connection of the other wires as well. The black wire should be securely fastened to the to the brass terminal, which is marked ""load,"" and the white wire to the silver terminal, which is labeled ""line.""

, Wrap the outlet with electrical tape, covering the terminals, and push the outlet back into the box. Tighten with the mounting screws. Replace the cover plate and tighten securely, but not hard enough to crack the plastic.

, Retest with the circuit tester to be sure you now have a correctly grounded outlet. If it is a GFCI press the test button on the circuit tester to confirm its correct operation.

Decide where you want to place your switch.,
Always turn off the power to the fixture.,
Measure the distance from your fixture to the location of your new switch...always add an extra 12"" or 30 centimeter (11.8 in) to your measurement - it's always better to have too much electrical wire than not enough.

,
Check your fixture with a power tester to ensure that there is no power.,
Strip 2""/5 centimeter (2.0 in) of the plastic sheathing from the end of the black and white wires.

,
Connect the black wire from the electrical cable with the black wire you just removed from your fixture.,
Using a black marker, ""re-code"" the white wire from your electrical cable to black.,
Connect your re-coded ""hot"" wire to the fixture.,
At your new wall switch, pull all the wires through the back of the electrical box.,You will need to re-code the white wire as a ""hot"" wire with a marker, as in step 7

,
Screw the black wire to the top screw on your switch.,
Screw your newly re-coded second ""hot"" wire (white) to the bottom screw.,
Flick the switch to the ""off"" position, then turn on power to the fixture.

,
Test that your new switch works.,
You should always leave the light""on"" at the chain/cord in order to have full control from the wall switch.,
Provided everything works, you can close up your light fixture and attach a switch plate cover.

",How to Add a Wall Switch to Light Fixture Controlled by a Chain," Generally wall switches are on the right-hand side, a few feet/metres past the door opening. Go around your house and measure the height of other switches. 60"" or 1.5m from the floor is common.;
, If there are other people in the home, always tell them that you have turned off the power, or leave a note on the breaker/fuse box so someone doesn't accidentally turn it. 

,, Remove the black (or ""hot"") wire only. Leave the white (or ""neutral"") and any ground (green or bare) wires on the fixture.

,, Always use screw-on wire connectors..never use electrical tape. Ensure that the connection is tight

, Mark on the plastic sheathing with a permanent marker so that anyone will know this is now a ""hot"" wire.

, You should now have a white and re-coded black wire on your fixture.

, Strip black and white wires as in step 5. Connect the ground wire to the electrical box itself (there should be a screw at the back or side of the box).

,, This will be the top of your switch.

, Ensure that both screws are secure and screw the switch into the electrical box. Do not attach the cover until you check that everything functions correctly

,, If it does not, double check that you have not turned off the fixture from the chain/cord.

, You can still use the chain, however this defeats the purpose of having a wall switch.

Determine the structure type.,
Identify circuit destinations.,
Determine if an exemption applies.,
Choose a method of providing protection.,
Provide both AFCI and GFCI protection where required.,
Add AFCI protection voluntarily.",How to Determine when to Use Arc Fault Circuit Interrupters (Af Circuit Breakers)," If circuits are installed in a space for use other than a dwelling unit, AFCI is not required (commercial and industrial spaces are not required to have AFCI protection). AFCI protection is required only in dwelling units (apartments, homes, manufactured homes, RVs and mobile homes).;
, All 120 volt / 15 or 20 amp branch circuits supplying outlets (includes both lighting outlets and receptacle outlets) in dwelling unit family rooms, dining rooms, living rooms, parlors, libraries, dens, bedrooms, sun rooms, recreation rooms, closets, hallways, or similar rooms or areas shall be protected by a listed arc fault circuit interrupter. This means that nearly every habitable space in new homes are required to have this protection.

, Most fire and smoke alarm systems are prohibited from being connected to GFCI or AFCI circuits. Absent from the list of spaces that require AFCI protection are outdoors, laundry rooms, unfinished basements, attics and garage spaces, to name a few. Circuits that provide more than 20 amps or more than 120 volts (208 / 240 volts circuits) are also exempted from AFCI protection. That means most electric ranges, water heaters, clothes dryers, permanently installed electric heaters (baseboard and blower types), artesian well pumps, etc. are exempt because they are supplied by double-pole circuit breakers which puts them on 240 volt circuits and / or rated at more than 20 amps.

, AFCI protection is provided by either an AFCI circuit breaker installed at the electrical panel, or by a receptacle specifically identified as providing arc fault protection. Both the circuit breaker and receptacle are installed similar to the GFCI circuit breakers and receptacles that are present in many homes already. The circuit breaker method protects the entire circuit, while the receptacle protects only from the point of installation on the circuit, to the end of the circuit. A caveat for the receptacle method is that it is only considered meeting the code requirements if the portion of the circuit between the electrical panel and the AFCI receptacle is installed in pipe or armored cable and all boxes in the circuit must be metal (the common practice of using plastic / fiber boxes or romex cables would prohibit this solution).

, Any required GFCI protected receptacle(s) that are installed in a location that additionally requires AFCI protection (see list above), will have to be AFCI protected as well. It is possible to install an AFCI receptacle on a circuit protected by GFCI circuit breaker to satisfy the requirement but only if at least the portion of the circuit between the panel and the AFCI receptacle is installed in pipe or armored cable and all boxes in the circuit must be metal (the common practice of using plastic / fiber boxes or romex cable would prohibit this solution). In this case, install an AFCI circuit breaker and a GFCI receptacle. The pipe, armored cable, metal box, etc. limitations on AFCI receptacles are not applicable to GFCI receptacles. Some manufacturers offer circuit breakers that provide both AFCI and GFCI protection in a single package.

, Existing installations are not required to upgrade to AFCI protection. In homes without AFCI devices, the ultimate protection would be to provide AFCI protection throughout the dwelling (except for circuits that have problems with AFCI). Replace all existing single pole 15 and 20 amp circuit breakers (and any double pole 15 and 20 amp circuit breakers that supply circuits with shared neutrals that provide two 120 volt circuits), or replace the first receptacle on a circuit to an AFCI type to add this protection.



Use AFCI circuit breakers to add arc fault protection to the entire length of existing circuits. This is simply a matter of locating the circuit's hot wires (black, red or blue that are connected to the circuit breaker) and the circuit's neutral (white) wire and replacing the circuit breaker in the panel with the AFCI type. AFCI breakers, like the GFC\I counterparts, have a coiled neutral wire that must be connected to the electric panel's neutral bus. The hot and neutral circuit wires will all connect directly to the AFCI circuit breaker, and protects the entire circuit from arc faults.

Use AFCI receptacles to provide protection to the circuit only from the point at which the receptacle is installed. Replace the first non-GFCI receptacle in the circuit with the AFCI receptacle and connect the wires from the panel to the LINE terminals and the wires that continue to the rest of the circuit to the LOAD terminals. Depending on wiring methods used during construction, this method may not satisfy the requirements of the code. The AFCI receptacles were much more popular prior to 2008 code, when this protection was required only in bedrooms. Since then, the code expanded the requirement to include significantly more locations in the dwelling, it seems that manufacturers have begun to produce the circuit breaker instead. As a result, AFCI receptacles may be more difficult to obtain.

If you don't know where your electric panel is, see How to Find the Fuse Box or Circuit Breaker Box.
Consider taping a note to the circuit box to let other people in the house know that you'll be working with electrical wiring and that the circuit should not be turned back on.;
, Turn the light switch on and off a few times to make sure there is no power running to the current fixture. If there is no fixture currently installed in that location, use a non-contact voltage tester or circuit tester to test each wire. You may use a multimeter instead, although the device is more complicated to use.


Follow instructions carefully when using a multimeter to test for voltage. Using the wrong settings could give you a false reading or damage the device.

, If a fixture is currently installed that includes light bulbs, glass light covers, or other detachable parts, remove them now and set them aside. This makes it easier to detach the fixture without breaking these pieces.


You may skip this step if the fixture is small and you have an assistant to help you remove it.

, You may require a screwdriver or wrench to remove any screws or lock nuts attaching the fixture to the ceiling. Make sure you or an assistant has a firm grip on the fixture before you detach it from the ceiling. Do not detach the wires yet.


This step may be much easier with an assistant to hold the fixture. A stepladder may also be required.
Do not let the old fixture hang with no support other than the wiring. This will likely cause the fixture to fall and could damage the wiring as well.

, There should be two or more wires connecting your old fixture to your home electrical system. They may be color coded with white and black insulation, or identified with a ridge or lettering. While full wiring instructions will be given later on in these instructions, you may have an easier time if you make a diagram of where each wire is connected. If the wires are not easily distinguished from each other, mark them with colored tape.

, Unscrew the plastic wire connectors counterclockwise and detach wires. Transfer the old fixture to a storage space where it won't get in the way of the installation.

, If you did not need to remove an old fixture as described earlier, you may not have turned off the power. Go to the electrical panel and turn off the circuit breaker or remove the fuse associated with the circuit you'll be working on. Make sure the power is off by using a circuit tester or by removing power to the entire house.

, Typical ceiling mounting boxes are intended to support no more than 50 pounds (22.7kg).If the chandelier is heavier, you will need to install a fan brace or box that will support the weight of the chandelier.


If the current support is sufficient to hold your chandelier, you may skip to the next section.

, This plastic or metal box should be attached to the ceiling or a brace bar using screws or nails. Remove these with a screwdriver or hammer, and pry the box away from the ceiling.These are also referred to as junction boxes or electrical boxes.

, If there is a metal bar resting on top of the ceiling, use a close quarter hacksaw to cut it in half.Pull the two pieces through the hole and discard them.

, Purchase a fan brace rated to support a higher weight than your chandelier's; most can support a weight up to 150 pounds (68 kg). Put the fan brace through the hole in the ceiling and rotate it so it is resting on top of the ceiling, across the hole. Turn the bar between your fingers to extend its arms until you feel both ends make contact with the ceiling joists. Use a wrench to tighten the brace firmly, but do not put tension on the joists by using excessive force.The spiked ends should dig into the wooden joists, and the rectangular bar should end up with sides parallel to the ceiling.


Place the bracket that came with your fan brace over the top of the brace, with bolts placed through its holes. Slot the mounting box onto the bolts and attach by fastening the nuts., Heavy-duty junction boxes are round metal objects sometimes referred to as ""pancake boxes"". Make sure to choose one that is able to support the chandelier's weight. Mount it to the ceiling joist using only the high weight capacity screws that came with the box. Do not try to use standard screws, or the chandelier could break free of the ceiling.Make sure the wires are slotted through the hole in the side of the box before you attach it. They should be easily reachable once the box is installed.

, Screw all parts of the chandelier together, except for the canopy that will be attached to the ceiling. Don't install the light bulbs yet as it will be easier and safer to mount the chandelier without them.

, Your chandelier may have more chain than you need. Decide how long a chain you'd like, then use a pair of heavy pliers to open one of the chain's links at the chosen point and remove the excess length.The base of light fixtures should be at least 30 inches (76 cm) above table surfaces to reduce the chance of bumping into them and to provide good illumination.Chandeliers hanging in foyers and other locations used by large numbers of people should be at least seven feet above the floor, and out of the way of tall doors.

, This small metal bar with holes in it should come with your chandelier, or there may be one already installed. They are also available at hardware stores.To install a mounting strip, simply screw it into the junction box at the existing screw holes, the placements of which vary with junction box design. Be sure to use screws of suitable size to make a tight connection.

, Thread all of the chandelier's wires through every other chain link. Continue to thread them through the metal canopy the will cover the electrical box, the small chain holder that attaches to the top of the chain, and finally the thin metal nipple which holds the wires together. They should extend fully through the nipple, far enough for you to work with them easily.

, In order to attach each of the wires, you will need to have the chandelier stable in place near the ceiling. Either have a strong assistant hold the chandelier in place, or hang the chain or chain holder from a strong hook hanging from the mounting strip.

, Both the chandelier and your home electrical system should have a bare copper grounding wire. Each of these should be wrapped around the grounding screw attached to your junction box, making sure the two wires are in contact with each other.This screw is often colored green.


The grounding wires send excess current to the ground (or another safe location) in case of fault.

, Use a wire stripper to remove about 0.5 inches (1.25 cm) of each wire's insulation, so the bare wire is exposed.

, The neutral wires carry current to the ground in normal use. Find the chandelier wire that has an identifying mark such as a groove, ridge, or lettering. Place the bare end of this wire together with the end of the white-insulated wire coming through the junction box, and twist together with a wire connector.


You may choose to ] and cover the connection thoroughly with electrical tape instead.
If the ceiling wires do not have white insulation, you may need to refer to the diagram of your old light fixture you made in an earlier section and determine which wire of your old light fixture was neutral (with an identifying mark as described above).

, These are the wires that carry current to the chandelier. The black insulated ceiling wire should be joined with the insulated chandelier wire with no identifying marks should be connected the same way. Twist the bare ends together with a plastic wire connector.


If there are more wires than mentioned here, or the number of wires in the chandelier and junction box do not match up, you may need to call an electrician to safely install your system.

, After mounting and wiring the chandelier, screw in the bolts or lock nuts to secure it to the ceiling. This process may vary according to your chandelier model, so you may need to read the instructions to locate the attachment points.

, Install the bulbs, switch on the power and test the chandelier. If it does not come on, you may have connected the wrong wires. Be sure to switch off the power before attempting to switch the wire connections. Call an electrician if you cannot get the chandelier to work yourself."

Find something that will put you at a comfortable height and allows you to use both hands easily.

, If your bulb doesn't have a protector on it, the oil from your hands can cause some serious damage to the bulb. Try to only grip it from the sides if it doesn’t have a protector. If it turns out the bulb is only loose rather than burned out you don't want to risk it exploding due to the oil on your hands once you screw it back in.

, Keep your grip and pressure constant on the bulb with the thumbs as you turn the bulb slowly counter-clockwise. Once it feels like it won’t turn any further, you can stop pushing it inward. You should rotate it about 90 degrees. , Wiggle it gently as it comes out to make sure it comes out cleanly. Be careful not to drop it, especially if you are on a ladder.

, Remember to keep your gloves on as you do this so as not to get any oil from your hands on the new bulb, which would be even more dangerous and could cause it to explode in the socket if it heats improperly.

, Once you’re back up on your ladder, you’ll press the bulb inward into the same position that you took the old bulb out from. Twist it clockwise as far as it will go, and you can turn the lights back on!

Use a ladder or chair if your light fixture is too high up for you to reach. Make sure you can comfortably move your arms about as this task will require some dexterity.

, You will want to push a good inch and a half of the straw up into the gap. You will then want to take the straw and move it around the circumference of the light bulb. You may need to do this a couple of times. For best results, treat the straw like an old fashion can opener by working all the way around the edge of the circle multiple times. You need to do this because a clip holds the wires that hold the bulb into place in the top of the light fixture. The straw causes the clip to release the wires which allows you to grip the bulb. Remember, this isn’t the case for every single GU10 Halogen lightbulb. However, if you are having troubles using your hands this could be a good solution.

, This is not as easy as it should be. The bulb's end is a white plug shaped mechanism. You will need to grab the socket in one hand and the bulb in the other. Then push the bulb (gently!) into the socket and turn counter-clockwise. Use the same techniques that you would use to open a child locked medicine bottle. , There isn't a visible difference between a good bulb and a burned out bulb. Don't risk confusing the two.

, See those little holes in the middle? There are four of them. You want to line the new bulb's plug so that it fits into the larger holes. Then you turn it clockwise until you feel it ""snap"" into place. , As you do this, work the bulb back into the fixture.

, All you will have to do is push it back in on top of the light, just like the way it was before. After that, everything should be as good as new and you’ll be able to use your lights again.

Check for obvious signs of physical damage.,
Check for signs of tampering.,
Devices shipped with integral Ground Fault Interrupting cords (such as blow dryers, etc.),
Check for signs of misuse.,
Check the electrical rating of the equipment.,
Understand how long lengths of extension cords can cause electrical devices to over heat, run slowly and even fail completely.,
Check voltage and resistance with a meter.,
Know what to expect.",How to Do Electrical Testing," Accidental contact with energized parts can cause shocks, burns and even death. Manufacturers design and build electrical products to shield users from these parts with either insulated or grounded barriers. When these barriers become compromised due to exposure, age, cracks or removal, the potential for serious injury grows exponentially.


These insulating barriers include: plastic or rubber jackets on cords, non-conductive cases or bodies of tools and appliances that are ""double insulated""; or have ground wires from cords extended to a metal case or body.;
, Manufacturers spend a great deal of time and money safeguarding people from their products in design, manufacturing and independent testing - such as ""UL"" (Underwriter's Laboratories), ""FM"" (Factory Mutual), etc. Fasteners are designed to remain in place and often designed not to come out at all and show obvious tampering.


Appliances, tools and equipment that have a large amount of metal on the exterior are often wrapped in an insulator or provided a 3 wire grounding cord set that connects to the case.
Missing ground pins, screws and other parts are indicators of possible tampering - and should be replaced for the safety of the user.

, should be checked before each use by pressing the TEST and RESET buttons. If the RESET button fails to extend after pressing test, if it extends but the device can be operated still, or the RESET button will not latch back ""in"", it it needs to be repaired or replaced.

, Misuse can be easy to see as damage and more difficult to see as in the case of prolonged overloading. Some overloading can be brief and severe, too. Severely overloaded equipment can have sooty, black carbon deposits on or near electrical wires, windings, terminals, etc. Some equipment may show extra ""play"", or ""slop"" between mating or moving parts. Removed ground pins on cords are a major concern. These devices may fail during use or cause injury to the user.

, All electrical tools and devices leave the factory with a label that states the voltage and amperage requirements (and more).


Cords are provided that prevent accidental connection to circuits that provide the wrong voltage or current. Many ""residential use"" items are 120V / 15A types that will fit 99% of the 120V plugs in your home.
Make sure you're not trying to connect to one of the other 1%.

, Resistance is the opposite of conductivity and is the enemy of electricity.


Two common variables that contribute to resistance are length as mentioned above and size or diameter of the conductors in the cord. Most tools and small appliance cords have small diameter copper wires inside thick insulated jackets. Larger appliances have larger size conductors.
Nearly all cords will have the size of these wires inside printed or otherwise indicated on the outer jacket of the cord or cable. Typical sizes are 14 & 16 gauge - but there are others, too. A cable might indicate 18-3 (or 18/3) followed by a few letters (the letters identify the type of insulation material). The 18 is the size and the 3 is the number of wires as would be needed for a 3 prong cord.
An 18 gauge wire is smaller than a 16 gauge wire, which is smaller than a 14 gauge wire, and so on. Never use an extension cord made with wires that are sized smaller than those used in the cord of the tool or appliance.
Always use the same size or larger if a short length; or a larger size if a longer length. A 50' (or longer) extension cord with 18 gauge wires may only be suited for a simple 100W drop light. The higher the amperage rating of the device the more easily it can be damaged when powered by a long extension cords or those with small wires.
Typical current capacity values for short cords: #12 wire 20 Amps, #14 wire 15 Amps, #16 wire 10 Amps, #18 wire less than 5 Amps.

, You must know how to set up and use your meter properly, furthermore you'll need to be able to interpret the display. Meters provide the most accurate measurement of voltage, amperage and resistance. A device other than a meter falls into the category of a ""tester"". Testers will provide the user with very broad information, and should only be used by those that can properly interpret the indications they provide. Some common testers are the ""wiggy"" voltage tester, test lights, continuity lights / or probes, continuity probes that provide a tone, etc. A continuity light or tone probe may give a very similar indication or alert for a zero ohm circuit as it does for a 40 ohm circuit - but you may not be able to tell the difference. A meter of the other hand will provide the precise information. It is impossible to differentiate a wiggy that is connected to a 90 volt source versus when connected to 125 volt source. There are also 12VDC test lights that are popular for motor vehicle voltage probing - these too can be a source of aggravation with newer vehicles have data bus voltages of 8VDC or more.

,

Switches - have only two states: open or off and closed or on (resistance checks must be made with the circuit powered off). Open or off should indicate an infinite amount of resistance and closed or on should indicate zero (or as close to 0 as possible) ohms resistance. Readings anywhere between indicate a need for replacement. Unless... If the switch is still in the circuit (you didn't disconnect the wires connected to the switch's terminal screws), you may be reading everything that is connected to the switch - the light bulb filament, etc. Such a reading would suggest the switch is bad when in reality it may be fine. Remove the device (switch, heating element, etc.) from the circuit for testing.
Loads - have one state and should never indicate infinite or zero ohms resistance. If the load does show infinite - it has ""blown"" or opened. Keep in mind that some appliances or cord connected devices (see below) may have very high resistances to DC (the battery in your ohm meter) or, may need to be powered to complete circuit. If it does, you won't be able to measure resistance with the meter as this can only be done only with power off. If the load shows zero ohms, it has likely ""shorted out"". A light bulb may indicate open if it has blown while in use a circuit; if damaged in transit - might even show as shorted out (but when connected to 120 volts it would likely ""pop"" inside the glass and then indicate as open). Do not confuse zero ohms with very low resistance values such as one or two ohms - or less. The difference between zero and ""anything"" regardless of how how low - is significant. That is not to say that everything that is at 1 or 2 ohms is still good however. This is when knowledge of Ohms Law comes into play, and then - it applies to DC circuits only (but can be loosely adapted to many AC components too).
TVs, refrigerators, microwave ovens, etc. - can not be resistance checked ""as a whole"". There is no single or range of resistance values that the meter will indicate to the user if the device is ""good"" or ""no good"". This is where troubleshooting training and skills help a technician quickly track down and repair the cause of a device that does not work.

Measure your dining room.,
Take the size of your dining room table into account.,
Consider the visual weight of the hanging light when choosing a size.,
Choose a style that complements your dining room décor.,
Shop around.",How to Buy a Hanging Light for a Dining Room," Your dining room lighting should be to scale in relation to the size of your room. The following guidelines may be used as a reference, although factors like the table shape and size and the décor/style of the dining room should also be taken into consideration:


For a room that is 10 feet (3.0 m) by 10 feet (3.048 m by 3.048 m), choose a light that is somewhere around 18 inches (45.72 cm) in diameter.
For rooms that are 11 feet (3.4 m) by 11 feet (3.35 m by 3.35 m) to 13 feet (4.0 m) by 13 feet (3.96 m by 3.96 m), then you should find a hanging light that measures about 24 inches (61 cm) in diameter.
Rooms that measure between 14 feet (4.3 m) by 14 feet (4.27 m by 4.27 m) and 18 feet (5.5 m) by 18 feet (5.49 m by 5.49 m) can visually support a lighting fixture that measures anywhere from 26 inches (66.04 cm) to 36 inches (91.44 cm) in diameter.
Your dining room lighting should also be height proportionate. For each 1 foot (.3048 m) of wall height, give 2.5 inches (6.125 cm) to 3 inches (7.62 cm) to your fixture. For example, a dining room that is 9 feet (2.74 m) high can house a lighting fixture that is 22.5 inches (57.15 cm) to 27 inches (68.58 cm) tall.;
, A good rule of thumb is to choose a hanging light that is half of the width of your table.

, Once you have the approximate parameters for the size of your lighting fixture, it is important to assess the design of the fixture itself in order to determine the appropriate choice for your dining area. For example, a bulky, ornate dining room chandelier has a visually heavier feel than a simple pendant light, and takes up more space aesthetically. You should therefore choose a visually heavy fixture that is at the smaller end of your diameter guidelines, or a visually light fixture that is on the larger end of your diameter guidelines.

,


Decide between pendant lighting or a dining room chandelier. Pendants are hung by stems, as opposed to chandelier chains, and are typically a simple stem and bulb housing design. Chandeliers are more traditional dining room lighting fixtures, and are generally circular in shape and more complex in design than pendant lighting. Pendant lighting provides a streamlined, modern effect, while chandeliers are more ornate.
Pick a finish that matches the hardware throughout your house. For example, if your buffet knobs are a brushed nickel, then you should choose a lighting fixture in the same brushed nickel finish.
Counter the weight of the furniture with your hanging light. If your dining room set is dark and bulky, then opt for a simple lighting fixture with a lightweight feel.

, There are many sources for dining room lighting, including websites, home improvement stores, retail department stores, yard sales, specialty lighting stores and classified ads. Be sure to ask about installation before you make a purchase.

Consider using passive design.,
Prefer CFL bulbs.,
Try halogen or low voltage lighting.,
Look for the LED (light emitting diode).,
Seek solar lighting.,
Look for green light fittings.,
Switch to a dimmer.,
Turn it off.,
Avoid adding to light pollution.,
Use Motion Detector Light Switches in Selective Areas.",How to Green Your Lighting," The best source of light, obviously, is natural light – the sun. And the better use one makes of it, the less lighting you need. Use passive design by making sure that your windows are south facing if you are in the northern hemisphere (and north facing if you are in the southern hemisphere) which allows as much natural light into the house as possible; keep the blinds up, open the curtains, and put in the odd skylight. Solar tubes are a new kind of mini skylight that mimics an electric light fixture in appearance, but channels sunlight into inner rooms and cost less than skylights to install.;
, Fluorescent bulbs (CFLs or low-energy light bulbs) may cost a bit more than incandescent light bulbs, but they use a quarter of the energy and last a lot longer (some 10,000 hours or 12 times longer than an ordinary light bulb). Most stores stock CFLs. Although the color of the light is different from incandescent -can look cooler or more bright white - there are new versions of CFLs with ""warm"" color indicators, which look more like incandescent. New dimming CFLs are coming out in the market already and this will not only achieve the dimming atmosphere many like but also saves energy.


See the below Warnings on audio, environment, and health considerations before buying CFLs.

, Halogen bulbs use less electricity than conventional light bulbs, however, they still use significantly more than CFLs. The halogen lamp is commonly found in recessed lights in bathroom, kitchens, bedrooms etc. and it will pay to replace these with slightly larger recessed CFLs. Low voltage lighting systems must be wired correctly, if not, even when the light is off they can still draw a small amount of current. Low voltage lighting uses a transformer to create a much lower voltage than the voltage commonly found at outlets and light fixtures throughout the home. To conserve maximum energy, the power switch must control the high voltage ""input side"" of the transformer, not the lower voltage ""output side"" created by the transformer. Otherwise, even when the light switch is ""off"", the transformer remains on. Halogen based standing or ""torchiere"" lamps and the halogen flood lights (used mainly outdoors) - the type that have long thin bulbs – often provide significantly more light than needed. The lamps have relatively short lives, create a great deal of heat and require special handling during installation. These reasons make these lights and fixtures ideal candidates for replacement.

, Now bright enough to use for in-home lighting, we’re counting on technology and the burning need for ""green"" lighting alternatives to bring LEDs into the limelight soon. Early LEDs were only bright enough for displays in calculators and digital watches, but they’ve started appearing in the car industry - that has sworn to replace all incandescent bulbs in cars by the end of the decade. In the USA they’ve just begun to enter the consumer market, but still cost quite a bit more than CFLs. However, they use less energy, last far longer (have a lifespan of between 60,000 and 100,000 hours) and are far safer and ""green"". They also fit both halogen and normal bulb sockets.

, At the moment, this can be used mainly for lighting your garden. Nonetheless, these little solar lights are cute and do well at night for lighting up enough so that you don’t trip over your feet on the way to the shed.

, Keep your eyes peeled for light fittings and lamps made from natural or recycled materials such as metal, glass, plastic and natural materials like wood, cloth, or even reclaimed materials like bottle tops.

, By dimming your lights, you use only a fraction of the electricity that you would use at full power. Dimming not only saves energy, it also extends bulb life, thereby reducing landfill waste and saving you money. It allows the light level to be tuned to your liking and lets you control how much power you're using. Dimmers can be used on nearly all lamp types, including incandescent, fluorescent, CFL, and halogen; although some types require the use of lamps designed expressly for dimming (as in the case of CFLs) or require appropriate hardware (as in the case of a special ""dimming ballast"" to be installed in traditional fluorescent fixtures. Dimmers are widely available at hardware and lighting stores and are easy to install. Unlike old rheostat dimmers, modern dimmers are almost 99% efficient, dissipating only a very small amount of energy as heat.

, This is a no-brainer: leaving electrical appliances on ""standby"" mode or double adapters and chargers hooked into the wall, all still continue to draw electricity. Switch them off at the wall and unplug any adapters, even when devices aren’t switched on. And get into the habit of switching off lights in any room in which you’re not, even if you’re stepping out for only a few minutes.

, According to sustainable home design, light from outside lamps should shine from the fitting at a 30 degree angle, so that no direct light shines up into the sky or onto neighbours. Apparently a flight over a city like Frankfurt reveals very little light pollution by comparison with South African cities, for example.

, These are handy for areas like entrance areas or garages; or storage areas or break rooms at offices. They are also known as ""occupancy sensors. They turn on automatically when someone enters a room; and then, after a predetermined amount of time, they turn off automatically. You can vary how long lights stay on after someone leaves, at the time of installation of the sensor.

Drop the battery.",How to Test Your Batteries1," If you have have a device that harbors multiple batteries, it would be a good idea to test all of them. Keep in mind that this method only works for alkaline batteries, more specifically the AA and AAA models.
, Preferably have it held one or two inches above a flat surface, such as a table., If it bounces and falls over, then you can assume that it is dead.

Check the readings.",How to Test Your Batteries2," The benefits of this method is that it is much more versatile, and can work with non-alkaline batteries and different battery types (such as the 9-volt, C, and D models). This method is also helpful if you cannot deduce the condition of the battery from the drop test., This is to ensure that this voltage is above the battery voltage.,

For AA, AAA, C, and D batteries, the positive terminal is the protruding end.
For 9-volt batteries, the positive terminal is the smaller of the two ends.

, If the reading is very close or exact to the proper battery voltage, then the battery should still work. If it's not, then it's probably dead. Below is a list of the proper battery voltages as a guide:

AA, AAA, C, and D alkaline batteries are 1.5 V.
AA and AAA nickel-cadmium/nickel-metal hydride batteries are 1.25 V.
9-volt batteries, of course, are 9 V.

",How to Create Lighting Using Upcycled Globes," It can be cut in half or just around the top. Depending on the type of look you are going for, you can cut the globe several different sizes.


To reduce the risk of the globe becoming a fire hazard, cut the globe along the equator, or in half. If you only cut around the North Pole and South Pole area so that the light kit fits through the top and shines down below, this may present a fire hazard depending on the type of light kit and globe being used.





;
, Take measurements of the pendant light, then match those measurements to the top of the globe. Ensure that there's enough room to fit the kit through the top of the globe.

, Consider tracing around the pendant on a sheet of paper and then transferring that tracing to the top of the globe.

, Cut following the pencil markings.

, This will help to create an attractive inside finish that enhances the glow of the light bulb. You can use a variety of colors, however white paint works well., Depending upon how handy you are, you may want to contact an electrician to perform this step.

Keep batteries in the original packaging if possible.,
Separate batteries by make and age.,
Check the charge levels on rechargeable batteries.,
Store your batteries at room temperature or below.,
Control humidity.,
Prevent electrical conduction.,
Recharge lead acid and lithium-ion batteries periodically.,
Restore discharged batteries.",How to Store Batteries," Storing batteries sealed in their packaging ensures that they remain protected from environmental factors such as humidity. It also ensures that you do not confuse new, fully charged batteries with older ones, and it prevents the terminals from coming into contact with other metals.;
, Batteries of different types or from different manufacturers can react with each other, causing leakage or other damage. If you are storing disposable (non-rechargeable) batteries, avoid storing new and used batteries together.Separate containers are ideal. If you plan to use one container, place each type of battery in its own plastic bag.

, Many rechargeable batteries will permanently damage themselves if kept in a discharged state. The ideal level of charge depends on the technology:
Lead Acid
Store at full charge to avoid sulfation, which lowers capacity.

Lithium Ion (Li-ion)
For best results, store at 30–50% maximum charge.If you will be unable to recharge within a few months, store at full charge instead.Nickel-based (NiMH, NiZn, NiCd)
Can be stored at any state of charge., In most cases, any cool room away from direct sun is fine. Even at relatively warm temperatures of 77ºF (25ºC), a typical battery only loses a few percent of its charge capacity each year. Storing batteries in the refrigerator (or anywhere between 34–60ºF / 1–15ºC) causes minor improvements in this area, but is not necessary unless you have no good alternative or maximum performance is vital. For most consumers, the refrigerator is not worth the risk of water damage and the inconvenience of waiting for batteries to warm up before use.Do not put a battery in a freezer unless the manufacturer recommends it.Traditional nickel-based batteries lose their charge quickly even at low temperatures. They recharge faster at cool temperatures, but not below 50ºF (10°C) for consumer-grade chargers.More recent LSD (Low Self-Discharge) NiMH batteries are designed to maintain their charge at room temperature.


, Keep your batteries in a vapor-proof container if they are in a high-humidity environment or if there is risk of condensation (including in the fridge). Alkaline batteries can be safely stored in moderately humid conditions (35 to 65% relative humidity).Most other batteries prefer drier environments., Your batteries may start conducting electricity if they come into contact with metal. This will drain your batteries quickly, and create heat. Take steps to prevent this problem and reduce fire risk:Do not store batteries in a metal container. Use a sealed plastic container or a specialized battery storage box.
Do not store coins or other metal objects in the same container.
Align batteries so the positive terminals cannot contact the negative terminals of other batteries. Cover the terminals with masking tape or plastic caps if you cannot guarantee this.

, Storing a lead-acid battery at a very low charge state can cause permanent crystal formation (sulfation) that reduces capacity.Lithium-ion batteries at low charge can develop copper structures that short the battery, making it dangerous to use.The exact recharge instructions depend on the battery design. Follow these guidelines if you do not have access to manufacturer instructions:
Lead Acid
Recharge to full whenever voltage drops below 2.07 volts / cell (12.42V for a 12V battery).One charge every six months is typical.Lithium Ion (Li-ion)
Recharge to 30–50% capacity whenever voltage drops below 2.5 V/cell.Do not recharge if voltage drops to 1.5V/cell.One charge every few months is typical.

, If your rechargeable batteries drop to low charge levels for more than a few days, they will likely require special treatment before you can use them again:
Lead Acid
The battery will usually recharge, but with permanently reduced capacity. If a small lead acid battery fails to recharge, apply a very low amount of current at a high voltage (~5V) for two hours.Anti-sulfation devices are not recommended without an experienced operator.Lithium Ion (Li-ion)
The battery may enter ""sleep mode"" and fail to recharge. Use a charger with a ""boost"" feature, taking care to apply the voltage with the correct polarity.
Never boost a battery that falls below 1.5V/cell for a week or more, as it is permanently damaged and dangerous to use.Nickel-based (NiMH, NiZn, NiCd)
No major issues. Some types may require charging and fully discharging a couple times to return to full capacity.For large scale use, consider a battery analyzer that can ""recondition"" the battery."

Insert each battery to be charged into the charger in the proper configuration.,
Allow the batteries to fully charge.,
Remove the batteries when the charging process is complete.",How to Recharge Batteries1," Rechargeable batteries are most often charged in an A/C adapter, which you can plug into a basic home outlet. These chargers feature terminals sized in a variety of ways, from AAA to D. Depending on what kind of batteries you want to charge, you can usually find a charger appropriate for the size at any electronics or hardware store.


Some chargers feature a variety of adaptable sizes, meaning you can charger AA and AAA on the same terminals. If you've got a lot of different-sized batteries, this would be an ideal choice.
Rapid-chargers are similar to regular chargers, but often don't have a charge-control mechanism that halts or slows the flow of voltage. These are effective at quickly charging batteries, but can reduce the life of the battery more significantly.;
, Never try to recharge single-use batteries, or you risk causing corrosion and damage to your charger. Only try to recharge batteries specifically labeled ""rechargeable."" If you've got some dead single-use batteries, dispose of them properly and buy rechargeable ones.


Nickel–metal hydride (NiMH) batteries are common in consumer products, especially power tools, while lithium-ion batteries are common in electronics. Both varieties of battery are commonly used and both are rechargeable.
When you first start to use a new set of rechargeable batteries, run them completely down before recharging them. This will decrease the possibility of a phenomenon called ""memory effect,"" which is when the battery's capacity diminishes from being recharged prematurely. Use a battery tester to determine if there is life left in a battery before attempting to recharge it. Many battery testers are inexpensive, easy to use and provide an instant reading.

, With most A/C adapter chargers, a power light should come on automatically, or by flipping an ""On"" switch. Make sure that any power indicator lights come on, and you'll be ready to start charging your batteries.


Always defer to the manufacturer's instructions. Read the battery charger instruction manual thoroughly, which should contain important information, including the time it takes to complete charging, a key to indicator lights and safety information specific to the batteries being used.

, This means putting the positive (+) ends into contact with the charger's positive terminals and likewise with the negative (-) ends.


On most A/C chargers, there should be a diagram showing you how to orient the batteries properly. Generally, the flat side of the battery should rest against the spring, and the ""bump"" on the battery should rest against the flatter side.

, Most chargers should change a light from green to red, or vice versa when the batteries are fully charged. Do not interrupt the process by unplugging the charger's cord or by removing the batteries early, or the battery life will be significantly diminished.

, Overcharging of batteries is the primary cause of a reduction in the life of the battery, especially in rapid charge chargers.


""Trickle charge"" is a technique of lowering the charge to roughly 10 percent of the capacity of the battery, which is usually enough to keep a battery fully charged, without triggering the discharge that results in a diminished capacity of battery life.Most manufacturer's don't recommend long-term trickle charging, but if you have a charger with an adjustable charge rate, dropping it to a lower rate can be an effective way of keeping your batteries juiced.

Remove the battery from the vehicle, if necessary.,
Clean the battery terminals.,
Determine the voltage of the battery.,
Use a charger with the appropriate output voltage.,
Set the output voltage to the correct number.,
Attach the leads.,
Keep the charger and battery as far away from each other as possible.,
Let the battery charge fully.",How to Recharge Batteries2," Make certain that the vehicle is shut off completely and remove the grounded terminal first, to prevent arcing, then move the battery to a well-ventilated area to charge it.


It is possible to charge a battery without removing it, but you need to know whether or not the battery is grounded to the chassis, to avoid clipping the negative in the wrong place. If it is grounded to the chassis, clip the positive to the positive terminal, and the negative to the chassis. If it isn't, then clip the negative charger to the negative terminal, and the positive to the chassis.If you want to know how to jump your vehicle, read this article.

, On most well-used car batteries, corrosion will typically build up around the terminals, and it's important to clean these periodically to make sure that your battery terminals make good contact with the leads. The best way to do this is to use plain baking soda and water, and brush the terminals with an old toothbrush to remove the corrosion.


Refill each cell with distilled water, to the proper manufacturer levels, if necessary. Do not overfill. Some lead-acid batteries won't have removable ports, so defer to the manufacturer's instructions as always.

, Usually, you'll be able to find this in the owner's manual for your vehicle, if it isn't listed on the battery itself. If you're unsure, you can also usually visit any auto parts retailer and have them check for your, at no charge.

, Depending on your vehicle and the battery in it, you'll need a charger with enough capacity to recharge it. Typically, batteries will be either 6 or 12-volts, but depending on whether or not your battery is a Standard, AGM, and Deep Charge model, you may need a stronger charger, depending.Some chargers are manual, which means you'll have to shut them off when the battery is fully charged, while other automatic batteries will shut off when the battery is full. Other than that, and slight differences in design, all chargers work in essentially the same way.
Again, if you're not sure, head to the auto-parts store for a quick check. You don't have to pay for it, and you'll be sure you've got the right info.

, After you know the voltage of your battery, you can set the output voltage to match. Most chargers have digital readouts, which just let you toggle up or down to the appropriate voltage. Some chargers have adjustable rates, but it's always better to start lower and slower than you think your battery might be able to take.

, Chargers come with two clips, one of which you should attach to the positive battery terminal and one of which to the negative. Switch the charger to the ""OFF"" position and remove the plug from the wall to be safe. Don't let the clips touch each other at any point during the process, and turn away from the battery itself when you make the final connection.


First, connect the positive cable, which is usually the ungrounded one.
Next, connect a jumper cable or an insulated battery cable that's at least two feet long to the negative post, and connect the negative battery cable to this cable.
If the battery is still in the car, you'll want to clip the ungrounded cable to the ungrounded peg on the battery, and the grounded cable somewhere to the chassis of the car. Never clip a charger to the carburetor, fuel lines, or the body of the vehicle.

, Stretch the cables as far as they go, and never place the charger directly above the battery that's being charged. Corrosive gasses will sometimes be emitted from the battery, which can be dangerous.

, Depending on the battery and the charger you're using, it may take as many as 8-12 hours to charge your battery. If you're using an automatic charger, it should shut off as soon as the battery is charged. If you're using a manual charger, you'll need to check and make sure the battery is charged before you do.

Wait until the battery is completely drained for NiCds.,
Check for noted charge rates.,
Set your charger, if necessary.,
Insert your batteries.,
Remove all charged cells.",How to Use a Battery Charger1," Both NiMh and NiCd batteries can be recharged over time, but you might want to think about investing in NiMh batteries over NiCd. NiMh batteries use newer technology to store more charge and can also be fast, slow, or trickle charged.Check the product in which you plan on using your batteries before purchasing your batteries. Certain equipment may require either NiMh or NiCd to operate best.;
, These are one of the least expensive varieties of battery chargers available on the consumer market. A pre-set shutoff timer will charge all batteries in the charger for a period of time and shut off once that time has elapsed.These chargers are less precise than smart chargers, which can lead to under- and over-charging. Take this into account when buying a timer charger; over-charged batteries can be ruined and cost you more money.

, Smart chargers can be more expensive initially, but these are equipped with sensors that detect missing voltage in your batteries. This way, your charger will continue to charge your battery until it has reached full charge, saving you the cost of batteries ruined from over-charging., The rechargeable batteries you bought earlier will also help you to decide which charger you invest in. Some chargers are intended for only NiMh or NiCd batteries, though some universal chargers are available.Most AA and AAA battery chargers can be used for both NiMh and NiCd batteries, though you should always consult your manual to be certain.

, You should never attempt to charge a battery that isn't intended to be rechargeable. This can cause a dangerous explosion from hydrogen gas buildup and may ruin your battery or charger as well.Check the manual that came with your charger to know the recommended safety procedure for your charger, but generally you should:


Keep your charger and batteries away from fire or intense heat.
Do not charge your batteries around or on top of flammable materials, including flammable gases, like gasoline vapor.
Insert your batteries into your charger firmly before plugging in your charger.
Prevent your charger from being exposed to rain, snow, water, and oil., These kind of batteries experience what is called the ""memory effect."" This means that if you charge your battery before it is completely dead, your battery will remember the smaller capacity as its full potential, which will hurt your battery life., Some batteries may have a specific amperage for best results. This may include charge times for ""fast"" or ""standard"" charge speeds. Always follow manufacturer recommendations for best results and safest use.


As an example, you may see that your battery might have ""Std. CHARGE: 60mA 14 - 16 hrs"" written on it. This battery would charge best at 60 milliamps for a minimum of 14 hours.

, Some chargers come with an interface or a timer that you might need to set. You may be able to set the rate of charge (fast, quick, normal, slow, trickle) as a function of capacity. This is represented by a fraction of the capacity, represented by the format ""C/#"".You should also set your timer with respect to your charge rate (C-rate).


For example, charging your battery at C/10 will charge 10% of your batteries full capacity per hour, charging your battery fully in a little over 10 hours, depending on efficiency of your charger.
Many manufacturers recommend slower rates of charging. Faster charging will result in less efficient charging.

, This should be done before you plug your charger into an electrical outlet, unless otherwise indicated by your charger manual. Once you feel the batteries click into place, you can plug in your charger and begin charging.

, Once your timer is up or the display on your charger indicates that all batteries are fully charged, as is usually the case with smart chargers, unplug your charger and remove the batteries. If you find that your batteries are difficult to remove, use a gentle tapping motion until one is jarred free.

Gather your materials (listed below).,
Using your fingers or the box cutter, peel away the outer wrapping of the 9-volt battery.,

Once all foreign parts are removed, test the batteries.",How to Get AAA Batteries from a 9 Volt," You may also want to wear gloves for the latter parts of the procedure, but this is optional.

A 9-volt battery (Make sure its an alkaline battery.)
A pair of scissors
A box cutter or utility knife;
, This isn't entirely necessary, but it greatly facilitates the next few steps. After peeling, you should notice that the battery ""case"" is made of plastic or steel., Using the knife, make cuts around the top rim of the battery, where the terminals are placed. If the casing is made of plastic, it is also helpful to make cuts on the sides to help open up the battery., A pair of pliers or a screwdriver may assist you in this step, but you can use your hand as well. If the top is still stubborn in not coming off, make more cuts to the rim., You will notice 6 small-sized batteries connected to the top end you just pulled off. Cut off the connecting pieces of the batteries, removing the metal pieces that are stuck on them., The 6 batteries you obtained should work decently as AAA batteries. They are slightly smaller than the average AAA, but this shouldn't be a problem."

Know the consequences of high and low amperage.,
Purchase a car battery charger.,
Check the remaining capacity of your battery.,
Connect your charger.,
Turn on your charger.,
Prevent overcharging by minimizing your charging time.,
Turn off and disconnect your charger.",How to Use a Battery Charger2," Most basic car battery chargers will charge at a rate of about 2 amps per hour with most batteries being rated at 48 amp hours. This means that your charger will take 24 hours to fully charge the 48 total amp hours if your battery is completely flat.Fast charging, while tempting, should be considered carefully. The heat created from fast charging can cause battery plates to buckle, or can cause other damage to your battery., These are relatively inexpensive when compared with the cost of replacing flat batteries over time and can be purchased at most automotive or hardware stores. Be sure you read all information provided with your charger so you have a thorough understanding of safe operating procedure., If your battery is flat dead, this step may be unnecessary. However, if you are unsure or want to take extra measures to protect your battery from overcharging, you should check the remaining charge with a hydrometer. A hydrometer is a turkey-baster shaped tool that measures electrical capacity as a function of specific gravity by:Carefully removing the battery cell cover as directed by your battery instructions.
Squeezing the hydrometer bulb to force out air and maintaining this position.
Inserting the nozzle of your hydrometer into the battery cell.
Taking the reading of the electrolyte fluid drawing from the cell into your hydrometer.
Comparing your reading to the normal reading for fully charged batteries, usually between 1.270 and 1.290. The reading for depleted batteries ranges from 1.130 to lower values., Be sure your charger is off before connecting it to your battery.Remove any cap covers from the positive and negative terminals of your battery. Your car battery charger should have clamps at the end of positive (+) and negative (-) leads. Clamp these to the corresponding terminal on your battery.The leads, clamps, and covers are almost always color coded to ensure the correct connection. For most vehicles, red will indicate positive and black negative., Now that the leads are connected, you can turn on your charger and begin charging your battery. Most car battery chargers come with an ammeter which reads the amperage used to charge the battery. Verify the reading on this to ensure you are not charging at too high of an amperage., The starter for most car engines will have enough energy to operate after about 10 - 15 minutes of charging. Once your starter can run, you can start your engine and allow the car to idle. This will allow your alternator to restore charge to your car without the sustained use of your charger., Once you have charged your battery sufficiently for your purposes, you can turn off the charger. With the charger off, you should have no difficulty removing the clamps from the positive and negative terminals of your battery.Remember to reattach the caps that cover the terminal ends of your battery. Corrosion to the terminal can ruin a good battery.

Clean the connections.,
Verify good connections between charger and battery.,
Investigate fuses.,
Prioritize slow charging.",How to Use a Battery Charger3," Over time, dirt, grime, or corrosion may have degraded the connections of your charger's charging plates or clamps. If you notice a white film, rust, or other signs of dirtiness, you may want to clean the connections with a manual recommended cleaning product.


Consumer battery charger connections can sometimes be cleaned with alcohol, but you should consult your manual to prevent accidental damage to your charger.
Car battery chargers can be cleaned with a solution of baking soda and water., Sometimes a battery will sit in its charging slot slightly askew, which can prevent your battery from charging. Make sure the positive and negative ends of your battery are completely connected to your charger connectors.

, Some chargers, especially the high amperage charger you may use on your car, can draw too much current and blow an electrical fuse. This can even happen in outlets equipped with a wall fuse. Check your fuse box or wall fuse to make sure your charger is receiving power, and reset any blown fuses.

, Charging a battery isn't a perfectly efficient process. Some electricity will be lost during the exchange of energy between your charger and battery. Due to this fact, you will have to put 120% - 140% of the full capacity of your battery back into it. A slower charge will result in greater efficiency, less potential for damage caused by over-charging, and better performance."

Their electric fields can also play havoc with electronic devices, so you'll probably want to build and run your Tesla coil in an out-of-the-way place, such as a garage or other workshop. You will also want to consider whether it makes more sense to build a Tesla coil from a kit, or gather materials from scratch. Both have advantages and disadvantages in the areas of cost, building time, resources for help, and reliability. To figure how large a spark gap you can accommodate, or how much power you need to make it work, divide the length of the spark gap in inches by 1.7 and square it to determine the input power in watts. (Conversely, to find the spark gap length, multiply the square root of the power in watts by 1.7.) A Tesla coil that creates a spark gap of 60 inches (150 cm) (1.5 meters) would require 1,246 watts. (A Tesla coil using a 1-kilowatt power source would generate a spark gap of almost 54 inches, or 1.37 meters.);
, Designing and building a Tesla coil requires understanding certain scientific terms and units of measure. You’ll need to understand their purpose and function to properly make a Tesla coil. Here are some of the terms you'll need to know:Capacitance is the ability to hold an electric charge or the amount of electric charge stored for a given voltage. (A device designed to hold an electric charge is called a capacitor.) The unit of measure for capacitance is the farad (abbreviated ""F""). A farad is defined as 1 ampere-second (or coulomb) per volt. Commonly, capacitance is measured in smaller units, such as the microfarad (abbreviated ""uF""), a millionth of a farad, or the picofarad (abbreviated pF and sometimes read as ""puff""), a trillionth of a farad.
Inductance, or self-inductance, is how much voltage an electric circuit carries per the amount of current in the circuit. (High-tension power lines, which carry a high voltage but a low current, have high inductance.) The unit of measure for inductance is the henry (abbreviated ""H""). A henry is defined as 1 volt-second per ampere of current. Commonly, inductance is measured in smaller units, such as the millihenry (abbreviated ""mH""), a thousandth of a henry, or the microhenry (abbreviated ""uH""), a millionth of a henry.
Resonant frequency, or resonance frequency, is the frequency at which the resistance to transfer of energy is at a minimum. (For a Tesla coil, this is optimum operating point for transferring electrical energy between the primary and secondary coils.) The unit of measure for the resonant frequency is the hertz (abbreviated ""Hz""), defined as 1 cycle per second. More commonly, the resonant frequency is measured in kilohertz (abbreviated ""kHz""), with a kilohertz being equal to 1000 hertz.

, You'll need a power supply transformer, a high-capacitance primary capacitor, a spark gap assembly, a low-inductance primary inductor coil, a high-inductance secondary inductor coil, a low-capacitance secondary capacitor and something to suppress, or choke, the high-frequency noise pulses created when the Tesla coil operates. For more information on the parts, see the next section, ""Making a Tesla Coil.""


Your power source/transformer feeds power through the chokes to the primary, or tank circuit, which connects the primary capacitor, primary inductor coil and spark gap assembly. The primary inductor coil is placed adjacent to, but not wired to, the inductor coil of the secondary circuit, which is connected to the secondary capacitor. Once the secondary capacitor has built up sufficient electric charge, streamers of electricity (lightning bolts) discharge from it.

, Your power supply transformer determines how large you can make your Tesla coil. Most Tesla coils operate with a transformer that puts out a voltage between 5,000 to 15,000 volts at a current between 30 and 100 milliamperes. You can obtain a transformer from a college surplus store or from the Internet, or cannibalize the transformer from a neon sign., The best way to create this capacitor is to wire a number of small capacitors in series so that each capacitor handles an equal share of the total voltage of the primary circuit. (This requires that each individual capacitor have the same capacitance as the other capacitors in the series.) This kind of capacitor is called a multi-mini-capacitor or MMC.


Small capacitors, and their associated bleed resistors, can be obtained from electronics supply stores, or you can scrounge for ceramic capacitors from old television sets. You can also make the capacitors out of sheets of polyethylene and aluminum foil.
To maximize the power output, the primary capacitor should be able to reach its full capacitance each half-cycle of the frequency of the power being supplied to it. (For a 60 Hz power supply, this means 120 times each second.)

, If you're planning on a single spark gap, you'll need metal bolts at least a quarter-inch (6 millimeters) thick to serve as the spark gap to withstand the heat generated by the discharge of electricity between the sparks. You can also wire multiple spark gaps in series, use a rotary spark gap or blow compressed air between the sparks to moderate the temperature. (An old vacuum cleaner can be used to blow the air.)

, The coil itself will be made of wire, but you'll need something to wrap the wire around in a spiral shape. The wire should be enameled copper wire, which you can obtain from an electrical supply store or by cannibalizing the outlet cord from a discarded appliance. The object you wrap the wire around can be either cylindrical, such as a cardboard or plastic tube, or conical, such as an old lampshade.


The length of the cord determines the inductance of the primary coil. The primary coil should have a low inductance, so you'll use comparatively few turns in making it. You can use non-continuous sections of wire for the primary coil, so that you can hook sections together as necessary to adjust the inductance on the fly.

, This completes the primary circuit.

, As with the primary coil, you're wrapping wire around a cylindrical shape. The secondary coil must have the same resonant frequency as the primary coil for the Tesla coil to operate efficiently. However, the secondary coil must be taller/longer than the primary coil because it has to have a larger inductance than the primary coil, and also to prevent any electrical discharge from the secondary circuit to strike and fry the primary circuit.


If you lack the materials to make the secondary coil tall enough, you can compensate by building a strike rail (essentially a lightning rod) to protect the primary circuit, but this will mean that most of the Tesla coil's discharges will hit the strike rail and not dance in the air.

, The secondary capacitor, or discharge terminal, can be any round shape, with the 2 most popular being the torus (ring or donut shape) and the sphere.

, This completes the secondary circuit.


Your secondary circuit should be grounded separately from the grounding for your household circuits supplying power to the transformer to prevent a stream of electric current from traveling from the Tesla coil to the ground for your household circuits and possibly frying anything plugged into those outlets. Driving a metal spike into the ground is a good way to do this.

, Chokes are simple, small inductors that keep the pulses created by the spark gap assembly from wrecking the power supply transformer. You can make one by winding thin copper wire around a narrow tube, such as a disposable ball point pen.

, Place the primary and secondary circuits next to each other, and connect the power supply transformer to the primary circuit through the chokes. Once you plug the transformer in, your Tesla coil is ready to run.


If the primary coil is of sufficiently large diameter, the secondary coil can be set inside it.

Once you've successfully constructed the motor, the screw will spin.;
, Take the neodymium magnet and attach it the head of the drywall screw., You can put the tip of the screw on either side of the battery. The side you choose will determine which direction your motor will spin.The single point of contact between the tip of the screw and the battery serves as a low-friction bearing. A heavier magnet will decrease the amount of friction between these two points., Take your copper wire and hold it to the other end of the battery. For example, if you placed your screw on the button end of the battery, hold the copper wire to the flat end., Gently place the free end of the copper wire to the side of the magnet. The magnet and the screw should start to spin.When you place the copper wire to the side of the magnet, you complete the circuit between the battery terminals. The current flows from one end of the battery, down the screw, and into the magnet. By touching the wire to the side of the magnet, you allow the current to keep flowing through the wire, and into the other end of the battery.A homopolar motor is capable of continuous rotation without the need to reverse the direction of the current.It does not take long for the screw to start spinning at high speeds.

, Pour about .25 to .5 inches (0.6 to 1.3 cm) of water into the dish. Don't fill the dish completely. Stir in a few dashes of salt and pepper, and place the dish on the magnet.Adding salt improves the conductivity of the water. Adding pepper allows you to see the propulsion at work., Bend each piece of wire so that when you hold the wires to the battery, the opposite ends are only a few centimeters apart.When you hold the the copper wire to the battery, the wires should almost make a ""Y"" shape. Be careful not to let the ends of the wire touch each other., Hold one wire against the positive side of the battery, and one end against the negative side of the battery., Place one wire in the center of the dish, and the other against the side of the dish. You should see the water begin to swirl around one of the wires.The water moves due to the Lorentz force. Each wire carries an electrical current. When you dip the wires into the salt water, you complete the circuit. The current moves horizontally through the water, from one wire to the other. Because the dish of water is sitting on a magnet, there is a magnetic field moving upwards through the water. When the electrical current moves through the magnetic field, the Lorentz force causes the water to spin.If you turn the battery around, you can reverse the direction of the current, and the water will spin in the opposite direction.You're dealing with water and electricity, so exercise caution when performing this experiment."

Use a transformer to step down the output from high-voltage AC to low-voltage AC.,
Run the low-voltage AC through a rectifier.,
Add a large electrolytic capacitor to smooth out the voltage.,
Pass the output of the smoother through a regulator.",How to Convert AC to DC," In North America and parts of Central and South America, the AC voltage at most sockets is 110 to 120 volts at 60 hertz. In Europe, Asia, Australia and most of the Middle East and Africa, it's 230 to 240 volts at 50 hertz. The standard in other areas may differ.;
, Check the manufacturer's instructions, if necessary. Too much of either amperage or voltage will destroy the components, while too little will not allow the device to work correctly. Most have a safe range; aim for the center so your input power can vary somewhat.

, Electrical current enters the primary coil of the transformer and induces a current in the secondary coil, which has fewer coils, resulting in a lower voltage. Little power is lost in this process because the amperage increases in relation to the decrease in voltage.

, A rectifier usually consists of 4 diodes arranged in a diamond shape -- a type called a bridge rectifier. A diode only allows current to pass in 1 direction; the diamond configuration allow 2 diodes to pass the positive half of the current and the other 2 diodes to pass the negative half. The output of both sets is a current that climbs from 0 volts to the maximum positive voltage.

, A capacitor stores an electrical charge for a short time and then releases it slowly. The input from the rectifier resembles a string of humps; the output of the ""smoothing capacitor"" is a somewhat steady voltage with ripples.


For devices that only need a low current, you can create a regulator with a resistor and a zener diode, which is designed to break down when a certain voltage is reached, allowing current to pass through it. The resistor limits the current.







, This smooths out the ripples and creates a very steady current that will operate your electronic device without damaging it. Regulators are integrated circuits and can either have fixed or variable output voltages.


Although regulators include protection against excessive current and heat, yours may still require that you attach a heat sink to keep it from becoming too hot.

Turn off the power feeding the panel you are going to be working in.,
This wikiHow is about wiring a simple electrical circuit.,
Look at the following requirements that must be considered before proceeding with this project.,
Measure the distance from the electrical panel box to the location your new outlet will be installed, following the path you have selected, and trying to determine the actual distance the wire must run.,
Feed the wires through the conduit from the receptacle box.,
Cut the wire to length so that 20cm (8"") sticks out of the outlet box, and about 80cm (30"") sticks out at the electrical panel.

,
Cut about 15cm (6"") of the (usually yellow or gray) outer jacket away from the wire, being careful to not damage the inner black or white jackets.,
Strip about 1.5 cm (5/8"") of the insulation away from the end of both the black and white wires.,
Use the needle nose pliers to form a small hook at the exposed copper ends of all the wires to attach to the terminals on your receptacle if you are not going to feed additions devices through this outlet.,
Carefully strip both ends of the pigtails as outlined above.,
Fold the group towards the back of the box, with the pigtail sticking out to the front of the box.,
Repeat this procedure for the remaining wires.,
Look at the outlet.,
Wrap the hook you made on the wires around the screw terminals of the outlet.,
Look on one end of the outlet for a green screw.,
That completes wiring of the outlet end of the circuit.

,
Gently push all the wires back into the electrical box, screw the outlet into place, and put the cover on it.

,
Go to the electric panel.,
Put the rubber mat down and stand on it while you do your work, and bend the wires out away from the panel while preparing them, so that your hands are not working close to potentially live circuits.

,
Locate the neutral / grounding bus bar.,
Cut the ground wire to length so that it comfortably reaches the grounding post after following a path out of the way of other wires, typically following right-angles across the bottom of the panel and up to the grounding post.,
Find an unused terminal on this grounding bar, unscrew it part way, insert the ground wire, and then tighten the screw back down onto the exposed copper until the wire is secure.,
Locate the neutral bar if there is one.,
Cut the white neutral wire to length, then strip 1.5cm (5/8"") of the jacket off and bind it to the neutral binding post the same way as you did for the ground wire.,
Locate the open slot in the electrical panel that you want to install this circuit into.,
Being careful to not touch anything conductive, determine the length of wire needed to reach this slot easily, also following a path around the outside of the panel.,
Check or select a circuit breaker suitable for the task and panel.,
Locate the single binding screw on the new circuit breaker.,
Strip 1.5cm (5/8"") of the end of the black wire, insert it into the breaker, and bind it securely to the breaker.

,
Make sure that your new breaker is switched off.

,
Standing on the rubber mat, place one hand at your side or behind your back...,
Using your remaining hand, slide the slot in the breaker over the tab in the electrical panel.

,
Then firmly push the other end of the breaker in over the electrical contact until it is seated in line with the other breakers.

,
Locate the place on the panel cover where this new breaker needs to be exposed.,
Restore power to the panel.,
Turn the new circuit on.,
Plug a lamp into your new circuit to test it.",How to Wire a Simple 120v Electrical Circuit," It may help to take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with all of the tips in the related wikiHow article on ""How to Master Do It Yourself Electrical Safety"". Shut off all the individual circuit breakers in the panel and then shut off the main switch that supplies power to the panel. This is preferable as it is much safer to operate many smaller current devices, one at a time; than to operate a single, large current device just once. When all the smaller circuit breakers are off, the amount of current flowing through the larger 50, 100 (or more) amp circuit breaker should be zero.;
, It doesn't cover the following information, which may vary depending on the type of installation you are doing, and the type of existing wiring you may be connecting to.


Choosing and installing electrical boxes.
Selecting and installing conduit.
Upgrading an existing electrical panel box to accommodate a new circuit.

, These are beyond the scope of this article, so these items should be addressed before starting.


You will need to get and install the receptacle (junction) box. For flush installation in a drywall wall, you may choose a cut in or repair type, for other installations, a surface mounted cast aluminum or PVC weather resistant (damp location) box may be applicable.
You will need to determine the path for the wires between the receptacle box and the electrical panel box.

You will need to install conduit if you use single insulated wires.
Install the actual wires if you use a non-metallic cable (Romex).



, Allow a little extra for corners, especially if you are installing in conduit, since these have ride radius curves for turning sharp angles. Also, allow at least 24 inches for hooking the wires to the breaker or fuse block and neutral and ground terminals in the panel box, and 6 or 8 inches for terminating in the receptacle box.

, Put a couple of pieces of electrical tape over the end of your wires, so the copper is not exposed. This way, if your wire touches an exposed live conductor while feeding it through, it won't short out or conduct the current back to you.


If you have installed conduit and the run is very short, you may be able to just push the wire from the outlet box back through to the electric panel.
For long runs, you may need to push a ""fish tape"" through the conduit so you can hook onto the wire and pull it through.
If you don't have conduit, you will have to ""fish"" the cable or remove wallboard and possibly drill 5/8 inch or larger holes through the wall studs to feed the wire through.
Either way, you have to get the wire run between the electric panel and the outlet box in a way that it is not exposed and the insulating ""jacket"" is not damaged.

,, This usually leaves one bare copper or green wire (the ground wire), one black wire (the hot wire) and one white wire (the neutral wire).

, If you have wire strippers, simply clamp the insulated wire in the slot that matches the size of your wire, turn the strippers half a turn to score the insulation, and pull the wire through. This will remove the insulation without damaging the copper conductor inside it.


If you can't strip the jacket, use the ""14 gauge"" jaws. Using the 12 gauge jaws of the tool significantly decreases the chance of nicking the wire. When using the 14 gauge jaws, hold the tool at a right angle to the wire, otherwise you will damage the wire. Also strip the end of the ground wire if it is insulated. If you cut too deep, don't worry... Cut the end off and try again. You have 3 or 4 tries before the wires will start to get too short to work with. It is very important to NOT nick the wire.

, Otherwise, cut 8"" pieces of black, white and bare / green wires from the unused portion of the roll to be used as ""pigtails"".

, Gather all of the ""hot"" wires (black or red usually) and the 8"" black pigtail. Twist them together and spin a properly sized wire nut securely over the top. No exposed copper should be seen extending from the insulating cover of the wire nut.

, Use the needle nose pliers to form a small hook the exposed copper end of pigtail. This lone black wire represents the bundle of blacks, and will be easier to work with than a whole bundle of wires.

, If you have a metal box, you'll need to cut an extra bare / green wire pigtail to ground the box.

, On the side of the outlet, you will see screws. The screws will be darker on one side than the other, usually, brass for the dark side, and silver for the lighter side. On the back of the outlet, you will see 2 or 4 sets of small round holes near the screws. These are the ""quick connect"" points.


NOTE: You can use either the wiring screws or the quick connects. However, the screws are the preferred method as they provide a better contact between the wires and the outlet. Also, if you fail to strip enough wire for the quick connect, the wire can work itself loose over time causing all the outlets downstream to fail.

, Doing this provides a significantly superior connection compared to back-wiring, and most electricians use this technique on their own houses because of it. If you insist on back-wiring, insert the tip of the black wire into one of the holes nearest the dark screws and push it in as far as it will go. You may need to use the needle nose pliers to push the wire in, as these can be really stiff sometimes. The wire should go nearly the full 1.5 cm (5/8"") in. Repeat this with the white wire into a hole near the lighter colored screws.

, Put the hook you made in the ground wire clockwise around the green screw. Tighten the screw until it is secure. This connection must be tight.

,,, Make sure you double-check that the power is turned off. Still, it is a good idea to treat all exposed wires and conductive metal as though it is live (energized, or hot).

,, This is a long bar with many screw terminals with existing uninsulated and green insulated (ground) wires terminated to it and often times will have white wires terminated to it as well. Most properties with only one electrical panel has a single such bus bar (as described above) for the termination of both ground and neutral wires. Most properties that have more than one electrical panel (a second panel for a detached garage or dedicated shop area; or provided during expansion of or addition to a home - are common scenarios), are required to have a bus bar for the termination of ground wires and a separate bus bar for the termination of neutral wires. Suffice to say, if the panel has one bar used to terminate only white wires and another bus bar used to terminate only green or / and bare wires, it is very important to maintain the integrity of these two systems by adding ground wires only to the ground bus bar and neutral wires only to the neutral bus bar. Failure to do so is a code violation and a potential shock hazard.

, Don't cut it too short, but don't leave too much slack either. If the ground wire has a green jacket, strip 1.5cm (5/8"") of the jacket from the end of the wire.

, Place only one wire per terminal. Do not over tighten and crush the conductor under the screw.

, This is similar to the grounding post, except that it will have only white wires hooked into it. In many cases, the neutral bar and ground bar are the same. If this is the case, both the ground wire and the white neutral wire may be terminated to the same grounding bar.

, Place only one wire per terminal. Do not over tighten and crush the conductor under the screw.

, Note that there is a ""hot"" conductive bar that sticks out on one side, and a plastic or grounded metal tab on the other (depending on panel manufacturer).

, Cut the wire to length.

, The panel cover will provide a list of circuit breakers models that have been tested with and are approved for use in the panel by an independent test facility such as UL (Underwriters Labs), FM (Factory Mutual), etc.. Under no circumstances should any circuit breaker that does not appear on this list be installed into the panel - regardless if it fits; or not. Circuit breakers made by Square D, Murray, ITE, Sylvania, Westinghouse, etc. are to be installed in panels made by the same breaker manufacturer. Do not make the mistake of trying to install a Square D (or other manufacturer) circuit breaker into a different manufacturer's panel.

, Don't put the breaker in place yet, but take a look at how there is a slot for the tab in the panel to fit into, and there is another slot where the conductive bar will fit.

,,, This is not a tasteless joke, but is actually a safety measure. Working with two hands is dangerous because if you ever touch anything that is hot, current can run in one arm, through your heart, and back out the other arm. One hand is all you need, so keep the other out of the way.

,,, There is very likely a metal tab that needs to be broken out of the panel so the new breaker can stick out from it. Break out this metal tab and put the cover back on the panel.

, Reverse the order of the shut down procedure in the first step by turning the main breaker back on. This large current switch has no load on it and will be less stressful on it as a result. Continue restoring power to the circuits by moving remaining circuit breaker handles to the on position, one at a time. Hold off on turning the new circuit on for last. Once all the other circuits have been restored, check that all the original electrical circuits & devices are functioning once again. If any breaker immediately trips, it probably indicates that you created a short circuit. In this case, you will need to either shut all the power off and carefully inspect the panel and / or other work to find it; or call in an electrician.

, If it immediately trips, you will need to recheck your work and connections.

, Odds are that it will now work just as it should. Smile because you just saved yourself $300 or more!

",How to Wire a Wall Switch,"


Common applications include ceiling or hallway light switches, a cellar or attic light, a ceiling fan or chandelier, or an outdoor patio light.
A single-pole wall switch usually has a lever or toggle that completes the circuit when it is flipped up to turn a light, device, or appliance on.
When the toggle is flipped down, the circuit is broken, and the power goes off.
Single-pole switches have 2 brass terminal screws on the side, and newly purchased switches usually have a ground wire.;
,


Locate your circuit breaker box and the circuit breaker specific to the switch to be wired.
Turn off that circuit breaker.

,


Remove the faceplate from the switch with a screwdriver.
Touch a non-contact voltage detector near each of the 2 screw terminals.
If the voltage detector lights, electricity is still on, and you are at risk, so return to the circuit breaker to determine if it is off and/or if it is the correct circuit breaker.
If the voltage detector does not light, the electricity is off, and you can proceed.

,


Measure the height, width, and depth of the electrical box in place to determine if your new light switch will fit.

,


Keep the wires separate; the wire from the top terminal should be positioned differently from the wire from the bottom terminal.

,,


Use needle-nose pliers to shape a loop at end of each wire.
Place loops over terminals and tighten terminal screws with screwdriver.

,


Attach the ground wire to the ground post in the box.
Clip a grounding clip to the bottom edge of the box if there is no grounding post.

, Take your second piece of cable (with the exposed end) and attach it to the other side of your battery. This should be the positive side of the battery. When you touch the wire to the surface of your battery, it should light up. This is because the electrons flow out of the negative terminal of your battery, through the bulb, and back into the positive side. This creates a circuit that causes the bulb to light up."

Test the fuse.",How to Test a Fuse With a Multimeter," Fuses are really just wires that are designed not to last, but their purpose is to prevent damage to more valuable electrical equipment or prevent fires (especially in homes) caused by power surges. If too much power runs through the fuse, it will ""burn out,"" quite literally, and break the circuit. There are number of varieties of fuse, but their differences are primarily in appearance. Here is a description of the two you are most likely to see:


The cartridge fuse is a cylindrical fuse that has been common in a wide variety of devices for many years, from homes to small electronic devices. They have metal contact or terminal points on either end and consist primarily of a tube that contains the wire.The blade fuse is a common type of automotive fuse that has come into use in the last 20-30 years. They vaguely resemble the plug of a power cord, with two metal prongs emanating from a plastic housing that contains the wire. Previously, most vehicles also contained small glass cartridge fuses. Blade fuses plug conveniently into banks, and relatively little space is required to house a large number of them together.;
, Multimeters measure AC and DC voltage, electrical resistance, and the flow of current. For testing a fuse, you can either use it as an ohmmeter (that is, a meter that tests resistance) or an ammeter (a meter that tests the flow of current). A multimeter has a positive and negative lead. When testing resistance or current flow in a circuit, the meter will transmit a small quantity of electricity from its own battery and then measure the amount that passes through the circuit or object.

, Testing fuses is the simplest way to examine what is going on in the electrical systems of your car or home, and for that reason it is a vital skill to possess.


It is easier to test fuses than it is to test other electrical equipment. Other car or home components involve complex wiring systems that run on for some length. In addition, most car parts can only be tested at repair shops, and to do so will usually cost quite a lot of money. Testing fuses with a multimeter is comparatively simple to do, and the equipment involved is cheap and easy to operate.
Many types of fuses allow for visual confirmation that the fuse is still functional. They are made clear so that you can see if the wire remains intact. If the translucent area is blackened, it is usually because the fuse has burned out. However, some fuses will create that blackened stain after only slightly overheating, and that may have even been the result of an unnoticed incident weeks or months earlier. If a device is not working, you should test the fuses. If the fuses are all still working, there is likely a more serious problem and it may be time to call on an expert.

,, Make sure it is turned off before the fuse is removed.

,


You can rotate the selector to Ω, or OHMS. This will measure resistance. Before you test the fuse, put the positive and negative leads together and look at the reading. The number it provides should be close to the one you see when you test the fuse.
Alternatively, you can test the flow of current by setting the meter to the symbol that looks like an arrow traveling along a line.

,


Because the fuse is little more than a single wire--and no complex parts to worry about--it does not matter which side receives the positive or negative lead.

,


If using the multimeter to measure ohms, the reading should match (or nearly match) the one provided when you touched the two leads. If the fuse is blown, it will not read anything at all, or the meter will display O.L. depending on the brand and type of meter you are using.
If using a digital multimeter set to measure continuity, the meter should beep continuously as you hold the leads to the ends of the fuse. That means the circuit is complete. If it does not do so, the fuse is blown.

Attach your cable to the LED diode.,
Test your light.,
Fray the wire.,
Wrap your batteries.,
Use your finger as a switch.",How to Make a Light out of Batteries2," This flashlight is very easy to make and only uses a couple things. Make sure to use AA batteries, because higher voltage will cause the wires to get hot very quickly and your flashlight will be dangerous.


Insulated wire cable (1” and 3”)
2 AA batteries
LED diode
Electrical tape
Scissors
Paper sheet

, Line up your 2 AA batteries so that the positive end of one is attached to the negative end of the other. Using your electrical tape, connect the batteries. Make sure that the connection is strong so that you don’t have to push the batteries together with your hands to create the charge.

, Using your scissors, cut the insulation away from the ends of your electric cable. This will expose the wire. Be careful not to cut through the wire. Do this to both pieces of cable.

, Using the smaller piece of cable, wrap the wire tightly around the one side of your LEO diode. Do the same with the larger piece of cable on the other side. Tape these together., Using the shorter cable, place the exposed wire onto the negative side of the battery. While holding the wire directly on the battery, place the exposed wire from the longer cable onto the positive side of the battery.


If your LEO diode doesn’t light up, switch the cables so that the shorter one is on the positive side and the longer one is on the negative side.

, Once you’ve discovered which charge your shorter wire needs to attach to, fray the end of it and tape it to the proper side of the battery. Fraying the wire will ensure connection because it will cover more surface area of the battery.

, Cut your paper sheet down to the length of your batteries. Roll the sheet over them (keeping the wires inside) to form a small flashlight. Your longer wire shouldn’t be taped down yet. Tape the paper over your batteries with the light at one end and the end of the longer wire and exposed side of the battery on the other., Now, you can hold the end of the wire on the exposed side of the battery. This will cause your light to turn on. You can either hold it, or you can tape it down to keep the light on.

Wait at least 15-20 minutes after you drain a battery to charge it.,
Know what is considered hot for a battery.,
Wait at least 15 minutes after charging a battery to use it.,
Understand battery terms when buying an RC battery.,
Discard (properly) batteries that have ballooned up after flight.,
Never discharge your battery past 85%.,
Don't overcharge a battery.,
Determine charge rate.,
Be careful.",How to Lengthen RC Battery Life," This allows the battery to cool down before each charge cycle.


Make sure the battery is cool to the touch before charging it again, but 15 minutes should be alright.;
, If the battery is hot after use, then it is a good sign that your battery is getting old.


Anything warmer than about 140 degrees is dangerous; if your battery is this warm after flying, it's time to replace it. You should probably not use it anymore so it doesn't explode. This is a good indication that in the near future you should look to getting a new one.
Try for a higher quality / mAh battery (keep the same voltage, though) if the battery running out is a stock battery.

, Once again, this is to let the battery's chemical processes have a break.

,


mAh: Milli Ampere Hour. This is basically the electric charge transferred by a current of one milliampere for one hour. The higher the mAh, the longer a battery will last per charge. This is the one part of a battery that you can change without damaging the heli.
Volt: The electrical pressure. Basically this determines how much power can flow to the motor. For lipo batteries the voltage comes in multiples of 3.7 volts, or 3.7 volts per cell.
Cell: An independent 3.7 volt battery.
Litium-Ion (Li-Ion): a type of battery that has a rigid cell structure and shape. It is safer than a lipo battery, but not as efficient.
Lithium-Polymer (Lipo): a type of battery with a flexible cell structure and shape. Lipos can catch fire and explode if mistreated or dropped on a hard surface. Be careful! Although more dangerous, they are more efficient than li-ion batteries and can come in practically any shape with the same cell count.

, This is a good indication that the battery is too old to use anymore; flying with a battery that has ballooned puts you at serious risk of an explosion which could destroy your copter.


Overusing an old battery in this way costs more in the long run than buying a new one.

, Discharging (or in other words, using in flight) the battery past a certain point can damage the battery and significantly reduce its lifespan.Usually, flying with more than 85% discharged doesn't allow you to fly more than a foot off the ground. You can tell if your battery is getting low because the ESC (electronic speed controller) will be limiting the voltage to the motors. In other words, you will be flying lower with the same throttle setting.
When this happens, land, wait fifteen minutes, and charge your battery again. If you feel tempted to continue flying until the ESC automatically shuts off the heli, don't - tell yourself that you are giving up 30 seconds now for dozens or hundreds of flights in the future.

,


Overcharging a Lipo battery is damaging and potentially explosive to it. You don't need to worry about this with the battery and charger that come with a helicopter, but when buying a new charger or battery it is important to know.

, To determine what rate would be safe to charge at:


Take the mAh rating (for example, on the mCP x, this would be 200mAh). Divide this number by 1000 to get the basic amp charge; for example 200/1000 = 0.2 amps.
With a pack rated at less than 20C, charge only at the basic amp charge or less.
If your battery has a ""C"" rating over 25, it is alright to charge it at twice the basic number, aka 0.4 amps. If your battery has a ""C"" rating over 35 (a continuous rating, not a burst rating), then it is okay to charge it at 3 times the basic number, or 0.6 amps.

, Please note that if your charger does not have a variable rate, then you should be very careful to not charge any battery with a smaller mAh capacity than your stock battery. Usually with these type of chargers, it is okay to charge a higher mAh pack.

Gather your materials.,
Fill the plastic cup roughly 3/4 full with soda.,
Make sure the soda can is completely empty.,
Cut a strip of aluminum from the soda can.,
Sand the aluminum strip (optional).,
Place the strips into the solution.,
Attach lead wires to metal strips.,
Test the battery.",How to Make a Homemade Battery1," For this battery you will need one unopened can of soda (any type will do), one plastic cup (6 to 8 ounces), and one 3/4-inch-wide strip of copper that’s slightly longer than the height of the cup. In addition, you’ll need a pair of scissors, a voltage meter, and two electrical lead wires with alligator clips at both ends.If you don’t already have these materials around your house, you can purchase them at a hardware store.
You can substitute the copper strip with several pieces of copper wire stuck together or bent in a zig-zag fashion to reach the desired width.;
, Note that the cup doesn’t absolutely have to be plastic. It just has to be non-metallic. Styrofoam and paper cups will also work.

, Discard (or drink) any soda that remains in the can. Turn it upside down in the sink and give it a few extra shakes to make sure that all the soda is out.

, Cut a 3/4-inch-wide strip from the side of the soda can. Ensure that’s it’s slightly longer than the plastic cup’s height; if this isn’t possible, don’t worry — you can just bend the top of the strip and let it hang over the edge of the cup and into the fluid.


Instead of cutting the can, you may purchase aluminum strips from a hardware store.
Aluminum foil is not an effective replacement for an aluminum strip; don’t use it!

, You can skip this step if you bought the aluminum from a hardware store. If you cut the strip from a soda can, you’ll need to sand off the coatings (i.e. paint, plastic) on both sides of the strip.

, Ensure that the strips do not touch each other. Place them across from each other — not side by side or overlapping — in the cup.


Ideally you’ve cut the strips long enough that their tops sit above the soda, extending slightly past the rim of the cup.
If the strips do not extend past the cup’s rim, you can bend each strip lightly so that it hangs off the edge of the cup.

, Attach one lead wire to one metal strip by opening the alligator clip and closing it on the strip. Then, attach a different lead wire to the other metal strip, again using the alligator clip.


Be careful not to let the alligator clips touch the soda.
It doesn’t matter which color of wire attaches to which strip.

, Following the instructions that come with your voltage meter, connect a lead wire from each metal strip to the voltage meter. The meter should read your battery’s voltage at roughly 3/4 of a volt.

Test the battery.",How to Make a Homemade Battery2," For this battery you’ll need one plastic cup (6 to 8 ounces), two 3/4-inch-wide strips of metal that are taller than the cup, and one tablespoon (14.79 ml) of salt. Each strip must be a different type of metal, but you can choose which type: zinc, aluminum, and copper are popular choices. In addition, you’ll need a pair of scissors, a voltage meter, and 2 electrical lead wires with alligator clips at both ends.


A variation on this recipe is to add one teaspoon (4.93 ml) of salt, one teaspoon (4.93 ml) of vinegar, and a few drops of bleach to the water instead of one tablespoon (14.79 ml) of salt. If you choose this variation, be careful, as bleach is a hazardous chemical.
Metal strips, electrical lead wires, and voltage meters are available at hardware stores. You should also be able to find lead wires at shops that sell electrical components.

, Note that the cup doesn’t absolutely have to be plastic. It just has to be non-metallic. Styrofoam and paper cups will also work.

, It’s the same process if you decide to follow the salt, vinegar, and bleach variation.

, Ensure that the strips are touching the saltwater and extending past the cup’s rim. If the strips are too short, bend them so that they hang off the cup’s rim and dip into the solution.

, Attach one lead wire to one metal strip using an alligator clip. Then, attach a different lead wire to the other metal strip, again using the alligator clip.

Test the battery.,
Boost the voltage.",How to Make a Homemade Battery3," For this battery you’ll need some copper wire, 15 sheet metal screws, an ice cube tray, and water.In addition, you’ll need a pair of scissors, a voltage meter, and two electrical lead wires with alligator clips at both ends. You’ll wrap each screw in copper except for one, which you will use as a negative terminal (to which you will attach one of the lead wires once the battery is complete).


How many screws you use will depend on how many ice cubes your tray is meant to hold. The tray in this example can hold 14 ice cubes.
As long as they aren’t copper, you can use any type of metal screw. Zinc-coated (galvanized) or aluminum work well.As for size, aim for screws that are around one inch in length.

, Wrap a piece of copper wire two times around the top of each screw, just beneath its head. After wrapping the wire around a screw, use your finger to bend the wire into a hook. You’ll use this hook to clip the screw to the edge of its ice cube tray compartment.


You can either pre-cut the copper wire into pieces long enough to wrap around each screw (with a bit extra for the hooks), or you can work with it long, cutting it as you finish each screw.

, Each ice cube hole will act as a single cell in your battery. Affix one screw to the edge of each cell. Ensure that there is only one screw in each cell.

, On one end of the tray, hook a piece of copper wire to the outer edge of one of the cells. On the same end of the tray, place a screw in the cell next to the one in which you just placed the copper wire. Ensure that the screw sits above the rim of the tray, as you will need to attach a lead wire to it.

, Ensure that the cells are full enough that the copper wire hooks and screws are touching the water.

, Attach one lead wire to the copper wire terminal using its alligator clip. Then, attach a different lead wire to the screw terminal, again using its alligator clip.


Be careful not to let the alligator clips touch the water.
It doesn’t matter which color attaches to which terminal.

, Attach the other ends of the lead wires to your voltage meter. The 14-cell battery that you've just made should measure roughly 9 volts.

, You can boost the voltage of your battery by switching your conductive solution to saltwater, vinegar, bleach, lemon juice, or lime juice, or by using more copper."

Gather your materials.,
Place the aluminum and copper plates on a piece of wood.,
Connect the plates to a voltage meter.,
Place one hand on each plate.",How to Make a Homemade Battery4," For this battery, you’ll need one copper plate and one aluminum plate -- both roughly the size of your hands. You’ll also need two electrical lead wires with alligator clips at both ends, and you’ll need a voltage meter.


You can purchase the metal plates, wires, and voltage meter at a hardware store.

, If you don't have a piece of wood, you can also place the plates on another non-metallic surface — for example, plastic.

, Using the alligator clips, connect the copper sheet to one end of the voltage meter, and the aluminum sheet to the other end of the voltage meter.


If you’re unsure of how to connect items to your specific voltage meter, check its instruction manual.

, When you place your hands on the metal plates, the sweat on your hands should react with the metal plates to produce a reading on the voltage meter.


If the meter doesn’t show a reading, reverse your connections: attach the copper plate to the terminal that the aluminum plate was connected to, and vice versa.
If you still struggle to get a reading, check the connection and wiring. If everything is working well, it could be that the plates are oxidized. To remove oxidization, clean the plates with a pencil eraser or steel wool.

Use a wall mount charger or laptop adapter to charge the battery overnight.,
Use a power dissipating package to charge the battery at C/3.33 for 5 hours if you cannot wait the 15 hours required for the overnight method.,
Use a microprocessor-controlled battery charger to charge the NiMH battery at 100 percent of its capacity for 1.5 hours.",How to Charge NiMH Batteries," Charge at C/10 (ten percent of the battery's rated capacity per hour.) For example, if you have a 100 mAH battery, you would charge it at 10mA for 15 hours. Your battery is likely to contain an oxygen recycling catalyst to prevent overcharging, but this feature is not functional if the battery is charged at a rate exceeding C/10.


To preserve the life of the battery, do not allow a wall mount charger or laptop adapter to charge a NiMH battery for more than 13 to 15 hours.;
, Before charging, fully discharge the battery to eliminate battery memory. You can drain the battery by allowing the charger to discharge it at 1 volt per cell.


Once the battery is completely discharged, turn on the charger for the required time of 5 hours.

, This type of charger contains a temperature monitor so that venting or overheating does not occur. It also senses voltage and current and adjusts itself accordingly. To end the charging session based on unsafe temperature increases, set the dT/dt value at 33.8 to 35.6°F/minute (18.8 to 20°C/minute).

",How to Clean Battery Terminals1," You do not need to remove the battery to assess it or to clean it. To simply access the battery, pop open the car hood and locate the battery. Check the general condition of your car battery. If your battery case has cracks you should replace the entire battery. If the battery appears fine continue to the next steps.;
, Lift up, and to the sides, the plastic/rubber covers on top of the battery. This will reveal the terminal/clamp interface. Examine the battery cables and clamps for excess wear or corrosion. Corrosion appears as a white, ashy deposit around one or both battery posts. If the damage is extensive, you may want to completely replace the cables and clamps to avoid future problems. If however, the cables and clamps look good, just a little buildup, follow the instructions below on how to clean them.

, Before starting you will need to disconnect the battery. To do this loosen the nuts on the clamps using a wrench. Once loosened remove the negative clamp, marked with a ""-"" first. It is very important the order. Only after the negative clamp is removed, remove the positive clamp, marked with a ""+"" .


The clamps may prove difficult to remove, especially if there is a lot of corrosion. You may need to use pliers to remove them. If you do need to use any metal tools, such as pliers, be careful not to touch the tool to the car frame (or anything else metal) and the battery while working. Doing so will short out the battery.

, Combine 2–3 tablespoons (29.6–44.4 ml) of baking soda with a tablespoons or so of water. Stir to make a paste.

, Apply the baking soda paste to the battery connections. Be careful, although baking soda is generally safe, you should take care not to get it on other car components or on your self. Once the baking soda is applied, you will see it bubble and foam, as it reacts with the corrosion.


How you decide to apply this paste is up to you. You may rub it on with an old toothbrush, a damp rag, or even your gloved hand.

, If your battery terminals have heavy deposits you may need to scrape them off. An old butter knife works well for this. After you have removed the major deposits use a wire brush or steel wool to remove any remaining deposits.


There are special ""battery post"" and ""battery clamp"" brushes available at most auto parts stores, but these are not necessary. A general steel brush works fine.
It is best if you wear vinyl (dishwashing) gloves while cleaning the terminals, especially with steel wool, as you will be coming in direct contact with potentially caustic agents.

, When the foaming stops and there are no major deposits left to be scraped off. You need to rinse your connections. To do this, just use a little water. Be careful not to rinse the the baking soda paste into the battery vents, as the baking soda can neutralize the battery's acid and shorten the battery's life.

, Wipe the terminals clean with a dry clean rag.

, Add something hydrophobic, such as petroleum jelly (vaseline) or grease to the now cleaned terminals. This will help slow future corrosion.

, Put on the positive clamp first, then the negative clamp. Use a wrench to tighten if needed. Once the clamps are on, replace the rubber or plastic shields covering the clamp/terminal junction.

Here are the instructions for building the battery backup system.,
Assemble all the parts as shown in the diagram.,
Connect the 6 feet (1.8 m) electrical AC power cord to the relay as shown in the diagram.,
If you connected the DC to AC inverter and relay according to the manufactures instructions, the electrical power for your sump pump should now flow from the electrical wall outlet through the relay and then to your sump pump.,
Disconnect the AC electrical power cord from the wall outlet (This is to simulate a power failure in your home).,
Take a couple of buckets of water (or hose) and fill up the hole where your sump pump is located.,
Plug the power cord back into your wall outlet so the sump pump is working off of the electrical power running through your house.",How to Design a Sump Pump Battery Backup System," The instructions listed below are for a ½ HP sump pump. Do not connect any sump pump larger than ½ HP to this battery backup system.;
, Connect the AC relay, DC to AC inverter, ½ HP sump pump, and marine battery together - according to the manufactures documentation or schematics. Note: For safety reasons, secure the relay and wire connections in a watertight plastic enclosure. Also, make sure all parts of this system are protected against any water splashing in the sump pump area., That’s where the 110VAC (electrical outlet) connects to the relay. You'll see later that this power cord will plug into your electrical wall outlet.

This step is extremely important. Triple check your connections before you apply any AC electrical power to your battery backup system.

, This is the normal operating mode when your house has electrical power., The relay should now flip into battery-backup mode., When the water level raises the sump pump float to its tripping point, the sump pump should turn on and pump the water out of the well.

Notice here, that the sump pump is now working off of the battery backup system and not relying on the electrical power grid in your house.

,

Now, when you lose power throughout your house, the battery backup system will kick in and keep your sump pump working.

",How to Clean Battery Terminals2," How you access the batteries will depend on the device they are powering. In general you will need to open or remove the device's cover to access the battery cradle. Remove any old batteries. Assess these old batteries for cracks and leakage. Any leakage is likely potassium hydroxide, a strong base. If leakage is found proceed with caution and be sure to wear skin and eye protection, as potassium hydroxide is caustic.


You should never try to clean up any battery leakage with the following methods. The following baking soda cleaning method is just for any corrosion around the terminals, not for a leaking battery.

, Examine the now empty battery cradle's terminals and the battery for corrosion. Mild corrosion will appear as black spots, more severe corrosion appears as a white, ashy deposit around one or both battery posts or terminals. If you see corrosion follow the steps below to clean.

, Use a damp soft cloth or cotton swab to remove any major corrosion deposits. Wear vinyl (dishwashing) gloves while cleaning any battery corrosion.


In some lucky cases the entire battery cradle may be removable from the electronic device. If this is the case you may soak the entire case in water or a diluted baking soda solution. However, in most cases you will have to patiently rub off the corrosion with a cotton swab, while the battery cradle remains in the device.
Take care not to touch with bare skin the white crusty buildup, as it is caustic.
Be careful not to get any water on your electronics when cleaning.

, Make your cleaning agent by combine 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of baking soda with a teaspoon or so of water. Stir to make a paste. Apply the baking soda paste to the battery connections using a cotton swab or small piece of cloth. Once the baking soda is applied, you may see it bubble and foam, as it reacts with the corrosion.


Be careful, although baking soda is generally safe, you should take care not to get it on other electronic components or your self.

, When the foaming stops and there are no major deposits left to be scraped out. You need to rinse your connections. To do this, use just a little water applied with a cotton swab. Be very careful not to get any water any electrical components.

Mild corrosion: On the traditional shiny terminals, this usually shows up as a dark dull spot.

Build up: In extreme cases, you may see a crusty build-up. If the build-up is significant, the solution is a bit more tricky.

,,, Don't be alarmed if there's a fizzing reaction. That's perfectly natural.

, If that still doesn't remove the corrosion, you can gently rub the area with fine sandpaper to remove the corroded bits before trying the vinegar again.

, And remember to remove them before putting your camera away next time.

,, That's battery acid which has leaked from the battery and it can burn your skin.


If you do touch it, rinse your hands off thoroughly with warm soapy water before getting them close to your eyes or any mucous membranes. Let the water run vigorously because the acid will likely become active as it's hydrated. Fast-running water will help rinse it off before it starts to burn you.

, This would be used in the best case scenario.

, Remove as much as you can in this manner.

, You will almost definitely get hissing and fizzing, as well as the creation of salt and water. If the battery casing is not waterproof (it generally isn't), you may want to perform this step over a sink with the battery case facing down so that any generated water or salt will drip out.

, Distilled water is better in the long run to prevent build-up, but tap water won't cause significant problems in this situation.

, Ensure that everything is dry before putting the batteries in. If necessary, leave the battery sitting out overnight to let any remaining water get out."

Connect the cable to the mini-USB socket.,
Connect the USB end of the cable to a power source.,
Charge the power bank.,
Charge your device.",How to Charge a Power Bank," A power bank will normally have two plug sockets: one USB socket, and one mini-USB socket. Connect the mini-USB side of the cord that came with the power bank into the power bank. The other end of the cord should be a regular USB plug. This regular USB plug will fit into either a USB wall adapter, or a USB plug on a computer. Take the mini-USB port end of the cable, and plug it into the appropriate mini-USB port on the power bank.


Normally, the mini-USB socket is the socket used to connect to the power bank to a source of power that charges the power bank.
The USB socket is normally used with a power cord leading from the power bank, and is connected to whatever device the power bank is charging.;
, There are two ways you can connect the USB side of the power bank cable to receive energy. You can plug the USB into a USB wall adapter (like a typical iPhone charger), and then plug the adapter into a wall socket, or you can plug the USB end of the cable directly into a USB port on a laptop, desktop computer, or in a car. Whichever way you are going to connect your power bank to energy, plug in the USB end of the cable into your chosen power source.


If you plug the USB end of the cable into a wall adapter, the adapter can be plugged into to any kind of wall socket.
If you plug the USB end of the cable into a laptop, desktop computer, or car, the power bank will only charge if the power source is turned on. That means the laptop, computer, and car all need to be running in order to supply energy to the power bank so it can charge.

, Once the power bank is connected to some sort of power source, an LED light should illuminate somewhere on the power bank. This LED light indicates that the power bank is indeed receiving power and charging. When a power bank is charging successfully the light should be a yellow or orange color (however the charging color of the LED light may vary). Once the power bank is fully charged, the light may go out, or change to blue or green color. Again, this varies depending on the individual power bank. You may need to leave the power bank to charge for several hours.


Typically, it may take between two to four hours to charge a power bank from connecting it to a wall socket, and about eight hours to charge it from a computer.Often the power bank light is blue/green when it is on and is being used, orange/yellow when it is being charged, and red when it needs to be charged.

, Once your power bank is completely charged, it is ready to be connected to and charge a device, like a phone. Whatever charging cable you use to normally connect your phone is going to be the same cable you use to connect your phone to the power bank. The charging cable must be an adapter type charger, where it is detachable from the adapter, exposing a regular USB plug. Detach the adapter from the charging cable. Take the USB plug that was just connected to the adapter, and inset it into the power bank. Then take the other end of the cable (the end that plugs into your phone or other device), and plug it into your phone. Click on the power button of the power bank, and the power bank should instantly start charging your device.If the power bank is successfully charging your device, the LED light on the power bank should be on, and the device should show some visual sign that it is in the process of being charged (like a lighting bolt symbol or a plug and socket symbol).

Identify that the battery really needs changed.,
Order a battery online or go out and buy one from a brick and mortar store if you can't wait.,
Collect the tools that you will need (see the ""Things You'll Need"" section below for a list of tools.),
Once you have your tools you can begin.,
Use the screwdriver to take the four screws off the back of the watch.,
Once you have all of the screws loosened, remove the case back.,
Put on your gloves if you have them.,
Try not to detach the small layer of plastic (it's over the inside of the watch, and it has several holes in it), as it will be hard to get back on.,
Slide the battery under and out of the plastic layer and discard it once it is dislodged.

,
Take your new battery out of its casing.,
Put the watch above your head to see if it is working.,
Grease the gasket if you have silicon grease.,
Gently pull the gasket (it is black and all around the exterior of the inside) out, and put a thin layer all over it.,
Gently place the gasket back into place.,
Put your case back back over the watch.",How to Change the Battery on a Sleeptracker," Symptoms include a dim screen, lackluster backlight, poor sound, and the watch randomly resetting itself.;
, Note it will be many times more expensive at a store. You will need a CR2032 battery. You can find a five pack on eBay for $1. Usually cheap ones have a lot of life.

,

, Find a good clean surface to work on. Wash your hands as best you can. You don't want to get any dirt and especially any oil into your watch, as it can rust it slowly over time. Clean your pointy object.

, Small watch threads are easy to strip, so be as careful as possible while still using the necessary force.

, Set aside the screws and be sure not to lose them. Be careful not to get grease or dirt on the inside of the caseback.

, If you do not, make sure that your hands are clean. When you have the case back off, do not rotate the watch so it is vertical or flipped over. You will usually lose the small gold springs on the inside of the watch which are key for many of its functions. Once they are lost they are very hard to reattach.

, It is attached fairly well though, so don't worry very much. There is an indentation, usually with black plastic on the inside of it around the battery.


The plastic should not be covering it. Slide your small flat screwdriver or pointy object into it and pry the battery out. Don't worry about damaging the battery, but try not to do it quickly and damage the electronics below the battery.







,, Try not to dirty it. If you have a voltmeter, check its voltage. New ones should be between 3 and 3.3 volts. Otherwise, proceed. Slide the battery under the plastic and into its slot. Be sure to insert it with the side stating its battery type and voltage up, look how the old one was.

, Do not put it vertical or flip it over. If it isn't, make sure the battery is properly snapped into place.

, Greasing the gasket will help ensure your watch remains waterproof and will keep the gasket in good shape, so it won't need to be replaced.

, Be sure not to tear it. Do not use motor grease, axle grease or anything else that isn't designed for gaskets.

, Be sure it is in the right way.

, Be sure it is aligned properly, as it is easy to mess up. Start screwing the screws in, and don't tighten them down if the case looks off. Try to put them down firmly, but not extremely hard. If you tighten them as hard as you can, you will probably strip them.

Clean the electrical contacts (optional).",How to Clean up Battery Acid Spills," Battery leaks can contain caustic chemicals that irritate the skin, lungs, and eyes. Always wear rubber, nitrile, or latex gloves before you handle the leaking battery or the leaked material.Wearing safety goggles or a face mask is highly recommended when handling car batteries or lithium batteries. Work in an area with good ventilation, blowing away from your face.


If you feel a burning sensation in your eyes or on your skin, or if the spill gets on you, leave the area and remove affected clothing. Rinse in lukewarm, gently flowing water for at least 30 minutes.Acid leaks, typically from a car battery, are much more dangerous than alkaline battery leaks.;
, For small batteries, use transparent plastic so you can identify the type of battery before you continue. For car batteries and other large batteries, put them inside two trash bags, ideally made from 6mm+ (0.2 in) thick polyethylene.Tie or seal the bag closed immediately., Batteries for cars and other motor vehicles are almost always lead-acid batteries.Smaller batteries that slot into electric devices are more varied, so examine the label to find the type. The most common types for small batteries are alkaline, lithium, and nickel cadmium, followed by lead-acid.


Size and shape alone are not reliable identification methods.

, If the only label is the voltage display (V), you can make an educated guess: Alkaline batteries have voltages that are multiples of 1.5. Lithium battery voltages can vary, but are often written as multiples of 3 to 3.7. Nickel cadmium voltages are multiples of 1.2, and lead-acid batteries are multiples of 2., Be sure only to follow the instructions for your type of battery. Treating the spill with the wrong chemical could cause an explosion.


See the end of the next section for information on battery disposal and cleaning electrical contacts.

, These types of battery can leak a strong acid, which eats through clothing, carpet, or in some cases even metal. Approach it with protective gloves and face shield, and cover liberally with baking soda, until newly added baking soda does not cause additional fizzing or bubbling. Clean up remaining residue using a thick paste made from baking soda and water.


Also pour baking soda into the trash bag containing the damaged battery.

, For alkaline batteries, dip a cotton swab in vinegar or lemon juice, and swab the spill to neutralize the basic leak. Use an old toothbrush dipped in the same material to scrub at a spill that has dried. Water can cause further corrosion, so wet a paper towel as lightly as possible and use that to wipe up the acid. Repeat until clean, then let the device dry for several hours.

, For lithium batteries, often used in cell phones or ""button"" batteries, immediately place the bag in a sealed, sturdy container, as it could cause a fire or explode. Any electric device exposed to the leak is no longer safe to use. Throw the device away, and clean up spills with water and nothing else., In some states and countries, you may dispose of alkaline batteries in the regular trash, but most batteries are required by law to be recycled.Visit earth911's online tool to find a nearby hardware store or other location that will recycle your type of battery.


Some battery manufacturers may offer you a free or reduced-price replacement battery.

, If the battery was connected to a device when it leaked, the device's electrical contacts may need to be cleaned before the device can be safely used. Scrape off any residue using a plastic or wooden stick, and use a slightly damp paper towel to wipe it off, throwing the towel away immediately. If the contacts themselves are corroded, pitted, or discolored, file them down using sandpaper or a metal file, but be aware that they may need replacement."

, Using the flat edge of a screwdriver, carefully pry the camera apart. Be careful not to touch the printed circuit board or any metal parts inside.








, You'll be dealing with the potential of getting a painful shock if you accidentally touch the flash capacitor, which carries about 300 volts.

, It is commonly a black cylindrical item, with two leads coming out of the bottom., Use a tool with an insulated end to avoid getting shocked. An insulated tool has a rubber grip that prevents an electric current from shocking you. Slide your screwdriver’s tip against one of the sealants by the flash to discharge the capacitor. You should hear a quick pop followed by a small spray of sparks.









Once the initial spark has sparked, you shouldn’t need to redo this. As you remove the board, continue checking the soldered sealants on the circuit board by the capacitor.
You do not need to slide the screwdriver’s tip hard. Don’t damage the rest of the circuit board checking for active energy., After carefully taking apart your disposable camera, remove the board and capacitor.

Fire when ready.",How to Build an EMP Generator3," Locate your wire and cut it to the desired length. You don’t want too much slack, so try anywhere from 3 inches to a foot. This wire will connect the switch to the capacitor. You’ll also need to strip the wire from the rubber casing.








, Solder the wire to one of the two terminals of the capacitor. Use a quality soldering gun to avoid a messy circuit board. Solder a blob of lead free rosin core to the surface. Then heat the wire to the blob with your soldering gun. It should dry shortly to create a firm connection. 







, Take the wire you just soldered to the capacitor and attach it to the “off” side of the switch. You might need to solder the wire onto the switch, but most switches you buy have screwable ports for wires.








, Wrap a strip of tape around your circular object with the adhesive side facing outward until it overlaps. Now take the enamel coated wire and wrap it 7-15 times. Leave some wire out to attach to the terminals. Don’t overlap any of the coil. Take time and be precise. Make sure the wire is snug and that there aren’t any spatial gaps.









Coat the finished wiring with tape so it’s secure.
Slide the windings off the object.
Cut the terminals of the coils to the desired length, but make sure you leave yourself enough room to work with., Using sandpaper, file down the tips of the wire to remove the enamel coat. This will create a stronger bond between the components.








, Attach a strand of coil to the other terminal of the capacitor. Use care and don’t create a mess.









Solder onto the opposite side of the switch.

, Connect one of the leads of the coil to the other “on” terminal of the switch., Make sure your battery for the device is charged and in place. Test the device on a handheld video game. Newer models might not work. Insert the electronic device into the circular coil and flip the switch.

",How to Build a Magnetic Stir Plate," Then place the magnet on top of the washer. The washer acts as an electromagnetic shield between the magnetic components of the fan and the mounted magnet.
, You want the magnet to be as close as possible to the top of the enclosure. Some people use bolts with nuts and washers to raise the fan from the bottom of the enclose.

NOTE: Keep in mind that the weight of the container of liquid may cause the top of the enclosure to sink.

,, Then connect the positive line from your jack to the on/off switch., Review the ""LM317T Flowchart"" and ""Wiring Comments"" images, and the LM317T Voltage Regulator Datasheetlink for specific wiring guidelines.

, The 0.1 µF capacitor is required if the distance between the DC power jack is greater than 6"" from potentiometer. The 1.0 µF capacitor is not necessary but is recommended to reduce transient response., Double check your connections and make sure wires are not touching inappropriately. Turn your potentiometer about halfway, plug in your 9V or 12V power supply and click the on/off switch if necessary. If it doesn't work, review the diagrams and try to determine what's wrong., Remove any pieces of wire, solder, or woodchips that may still be in the enclosure.

Put the charged battery inside the battery holder.

,
Give the armature a gentle spin to get it in motion.",How to Build a Motor," This coil of wire will be the moving motor armature. If the wire is thick then the diameter of the coil should be larger. A thin wire with smaller coil diameter is recommended for beginners since it is easier to bend. Make approximately 30 loops in the coil so enough power can run through the electric motor.;
, Hold the wire tightly to keep it bent.

, This will prevent the wire from uncoiling.

, Make the loose ends point outwards at opposite ends of the coil.

, It should look like the wheel on a car. This will allow you to get one of the loose ends of the wire flat against the flat surface.

, When you are done the scraped side will look shinier than the other side.

,, The axle supports also need to be made of conductive metal wire because they provide the points of contact where electricity will flow through the electric motor. You need 2 axle supports so just take 2 pieces of small wire and make a loop in the middle of each one. Once you have made the axle support it should look like the loop end of a safety pin.

, Basically, the armature should be in mid-air with nothing touching it except the insides of axle support loops.

,,,, Once the armature is set in motion the alternating electricity received from the battery through the axle supports will make it continue spinning.

Mount the stationary outer portion.,
Add an amplifying horn (optional).",How to Build a Siren," The heart of a mechanical siren is a spinning cylinder, or rotor, inside a stationary object, or stator. Both the rotor and the stator have holes cut at regular intervals, so air is alternately blocked and forced through. This results in a wave of pressure through the air, or in other words, a sound wave.Because this design involves heavy materials moving at high speeds, a homemade siren can be difficult to make and potentially dangerous to operate. Starting with a siren rotor no more than 6 inches (15 centimeters) across is recommended. This can still be quite loud if attached to a motor.


Alternatively, you can purchase a kit or download a plan for building an electronic siren. These use circuitry to send out a sound wave instead of mechanical air flow, and building them does not require any carpentry.
While these instructions assumes you are using wood, it is possible to build a small siren out of almost any material. Try using thick cardboard, or a wide, shallow cookie tin.;
, To make a simple, one-pitch siren, you'll only need two circles. If you would like a siren that has the distinct, two-tone sound of an air raid siren, cut out three circles instead. Trace each circle to the same size using a compass or circular object, then cut them out using a jigsaw or router. Optionally, for greater accuracy, attach a circle-cutting jig to your jigsaw before cutting.Circles no more than 6 in. (15 cm) across are recommended for your first siren. A larger circle can produce a louder noise, but this will require a more powerful motor and more careful building to prevent the siren from breaking during use.
Eye protection is recommended while handling high-speed saws.

, The first plywood circle will need a hole for attaching the shaft of a motor, in order to set it spinning. Drill this precisely at the center to keep it balanced, and choose a size that will tightly fit the shaft so it does not slip off. The second (and third) plywood circle should have a much larger circle removed using a jigsaw, 1/3 or 1/2 the radius of the full circle. This turns the second (and third) plywood circle into a disc shape.

, Trace one of your circles onto a new piece of plywood. On this trace, use a flexible tape measure to measure 1/12 of the circle's circumference and mark it off at either end. Draw a concave line from one end and a convex one from the other, tapering toward each other to meet at a point, which will just touch the inside edge of your plywood discs. This should look similar to the stereotypical shape of a shark's dorsal fin, pointing toward the circle's center.

, Cut out your ""shark fin"" piece of plywood, and use it to trace the same shape onto a length of 2 x 4 (38 x 89 mm), six times. Use your jigsaw or router to cut out these shapes.


If making a dual-tone siren with three plywood circles, , Arrange the ""shark fins"" around the circumference of the plywood circle, so their bases are even with the circle's edge, and the tips tapers in pointing toward the center. Space these evenly, so you can see curved channels between them where the air will be pushed through from the center outward. Use a strong carpenter's glue to attach these to the surface, and clamp the plywood and the ""shark fins"" firmly together while the glue dries.


Check the label of your adhesive to find out how long it takes to dry.
If, after the glue has dried, you can pull off or move the wooden fins, repeat with a stronger glue or a stronger clamp.

, Glue the plywood disc on top of the shark fins, and clamp until dry. If you are building a two-tone siren, cut out more shark fin shapes of a different size to form the second cylinder. For instance, trace shark fins with a base covering 1/20 of the circle's edge, and cut out 10 of them to glue on top of the plywood disc. Glue the last plywood disc on top of these.

, Find a marble or other perfectly round object, and fit it into the small hole on the plywood circle, where the shaft will eventually go. Place the entire rotor on a flat surface, resting on top of this marble, and attempt to balance it. When the rotor falls over onto one side, mark which side that is and remove some weight from that side by drilling holes through the plywood circle, near the circumference, or through the ends of the shark fin shapes.Repeat until the rotor is as balanced as possible, to minimize stress on the siren during operation.

, The cylinder, or rotor, that you built will blow air if spun, but won't yet make any sound. For that, you'll need a stationary container, or stator, around the cylinder. Start with a piece of plywood, and cut a hole just a bit larger than the cylinder you'll be putting through it.


Alternatively, if you can find a sturdy wastebasket of the correct size, cut a hole in the base of it. This will also provide a horn to amplify the sound., Cut out wooden pieces with the same outer circumference as the hole you cut, and the same thickness as the ""shark fins"" you used in the cylinder. The goal is to end up with an outer rim with holes that will line up exactly with the cylinder's.Glue these around the hole and clamp until dry.

, If your cylinder has two spinning levels of ""shark fins,"" you'll need a second wooden rim protruding beyond the first, where the second level of your cylinder will spin. This rim, similar to the first, will have spaces that line up exactly with the second level of the cylinder as it spins.

, Fit the small hole at one end of the cylinder onto a motor shaft. This fit should be as secure as possible, so replace the motor shaft with one of a different size if necessary. A small siren may function on a hand-cranked motor, but larger motors will be required for heavy sirens.



Never put your hand or any object on the cylinder while it is attached to a motor, even while it is not spinning.

, The larger the siren, and the more powerful the motor, the more effort you'll need to spend keeping it all in place. Consider constructing a sturdy lumber platform to hold a large motor in place. For hand-cranked motors, a small stand to keep the cylinder off the ground may be all that is required.

, Standing well behind the siren, turn on the motor (or start cranking) and watch what happens. Be ready to turn it off again immediately if necessary. It's better to discover a broken piece or other problem now, before you attach the rest of the siren. Turn the motor off and let the cylinder wind down on its own before you continue.

, Carefully place the outer plywood board with the hole cut through it around the cylinder. Bolt it tightly in place to the motor's platform, so the wooden rim around the hole is near the cylinder, but in no danger of colliding with it.

, Your siren is already functional, and you will likely want to test it before you decide to make it louder. Any horn- or trumpet-shaped object, flaring outward, can be used to amplify the sound. Attach the base of this object onto the front of the wooden rim, not blocking the holes.


You may need to expand the platform in back to balance out the weight of the horn.

Lay the desktop computer on its side and open the cover; this should be relatively easily done by unscrewing the screws running alongside of the cover.
,
After removing the cover, extract two of the main components, the PSU and the DVD burner.,
After extracting the first two main components, you need to extract the heat sinks; they will easily pop out with no effort and are usually located on the motherboard.,
Open the DVD burner and extract the sled.,
Once you remove the sled, unscrew the diode head from the sled and file down the soldered metal to make a smooth shape around the base.,
Press the laser diode into an AIXIS module.,
After squeezing the diode into the module, make sure that you attach long wires into the diode following this schematic.,
In this step, you will need to be very careful as to not reverse the polarity when soldering wires; make sure you clearly marked your (+) and (-) wires on your laser diode.,
Drill a ½ inch hole horizontally into your heat sink.,
During this step, you will be working on the PSU.,Make sure all of your wire connections are properly insulated and soldered, since we are working with a 110V power supply all naked wires must be covered to make sure no exposed wires are rubbing on each other.,
While wearing safety goggles, make sure that the diode is facing a wall of a hard surface, and plug the PSU into a power outlet.",How to Build a High Powered Laser,",

The PSU should come right out, and the DVD burner might be anchored down with two small screws. Undo those and it should come right out of place.



 



, The picture above is what the heat sinks look like The second heat sink will be a smaller version of the one shown, it will be placed directly on top of the motherboard, so when you open the computer and take our components out will see a tiny heat sink sitting on top o what looks like a giant microchip, just pull it out. .

, After extracting the sled, you will need to remove the laser diode located in the sled.

The sled should be relatively easy to remove, as it is located on the upper face of the burner.







, You should end up with a lense diode that is captured in the picture above.Most DVD burners will have the same set-up, however, if your burner is different, your diode will still look like the one in the picture, if you need further guidance on how to remove the diode please refer to the following youtube video from user ""tingawinga5"" :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndHKivuU7RQ

, Those can be purchased on eBay for around $3-8 each, and can be easily assembled and re-assembled.,

Your positive IN will show a thick circle around the attachment point so will your PD (unused). However, your negative will show a thinner circle around its entry point, and they will be arranged in the same order as this schematic. Solder your wires into the proper points and your end product should look like figure two above.











, Solder the positive output wire to the 3 ohm resistor, then continue by soldering the second end of the resistor to the output tongue of your lm 371 module(3). As for your diode’s negative wire, solder that directly into the ground tongue of your module(2) and create a wire for running to a negative wire. From your input tongue on your module(1), solder the positive running wire.When soldering i suggest the use of a plastic card as a separating all between elements to avoid run off of the liquid metal, if you are new to using a soldering iron i suggest you practice on some spare wires first by following this video from youtube user ""cold restart"":https:




, After that, clean the whole form (all metal debris), and insert your laser diode assembly into it, making sure the side with the lense sits flush against the edge of the heat sink. After carefully positioning the diode assembly, use thermal glue to permanently affix it into place. Allow ample time for the finished product to dry. (During this time you will start working on the PSU.),

The PSU can be slightly tricky, so we will break down the following instructions into simple steps:
Clip off all of the white plastic wire connectors.
Sort the wires by colors; this will make the job way easier.
Find the black and green wires, clip them, and then tie them together (make sure you cover the exposed area with electric tape)
The yellow wire will be your (+), the red wire your (-).
Solder the wires to your module wires as directed in step eight.
You may want to glue the second heat sink to the module chip, since this chip might get really hot.

,, Turn on the power button and enjoy your new laser. #*The laser can run for prolonged periods of time without getting hot since the heat sinks will help dissipate the heat from both the diode and the module.

",How to Install an Electrical Outlet from Scratch," Based on the load you want to serve, (meaning how much current in amps will be needed from the outlets) a 14-2 Romex® cable, which is a relatively thin cable suitable for up to 15 amps (or 12 amps continuous load) could be selected. Otherwise, a 12-2 Romex® cable, which is one size larger than 14-2 Romex® cable and suitable for up to 20 amp circuits (or 16 amps continuous load) is the other size cable installed for outlets. Most home's outlets are wired with 14-2 Romex®, that supply up to 8 outlets per circuit. Oversimplified, the National Electrical Code (NEC) mandates outlets in the kitchen and dining room must be served by 20 amp circuits. A 12-2 Romex® circuit would provide for this (installing a 30 amp dryer outlet or 50 amp range / welding outlet is beyond the scope of this article, but is similar).;
, It is best to identify what type of panel you have and whether or not the breakers are available or obsolete. Part of this process involves removing the dead front assembly (the door over your breakers) and looking inside at the bussing. This can potentially be dangerous if you accidentally short out the metal plate to the bussing in the panel. Depending on the type of panel it can be relatively simple or very hazardous. Murray or Bryant type panels usually are the safest to install into. If your panel happens to be a Zinsco, Stablok or Pushmatic you can set yourself up for serious problems trying to do this yourself. For instance on Pushmatic panels the bussing is usually energized. Without the proper knowledge you could accidentally short the bussing out and cause a catastrophic failure (phase to ground or phase to phase short). The symmetrical amperage faults available are only limited by the primary fusing on the transformer and the overall design of the system. Just something to keep in mind when doing this job yourself. I would recommend disconnecting power and removing the meter and ring if possible to eliminate hazards. This too is often outside the scope of do it yourself type work.

, Romex® cable (""Type NM"" cable) is the easiest to work and least expensive way to accomplish this, and is the wiring method used in this wiki.

, If a 14-2 cable is run from the panel to the outlet, then a 15 amp circuit breaker is the largest that can be used to protect that circuit. If a 12-2 cable is run from the panel to the outlet, then a 20 amp circuit breaker is the largest that can be installed to protect the circuit.

, Starting at the panel, route the Romex® to the outlet. Pull about a foot of cable beyond the outlet and the balance of the Romex® coil on the floor at the panel. Staple the Romex® (where exposed) neatly back to the panel driving insulated staples every three feet and 18 inches (45.7 cm) from every box that has cable clamps / connector or 12 inches (30.5 cm) from those without a clamp / connector.

, The end of the cable needs to be carefully stripped of the outer jacket prior to installing into the box. Strip back 8 inches (20.3 cm) of jacket.

, Push the cable into the box opening / connector until only about an inch of jacketed cable is inside the box. The outlet location needs to have the wire installed into an old work/new work box which is either to be cut in to wallboard or nailed to the wall/stud. Use of plastic or fiber electrical boxes are quicker to work than steel boxes because they do not require additional grounding. A steel box must be grounded so that it does not require the device for it to be grounded (pigtailing the ground to the device AND the box solves this).

, The white wire (neutral wire) needs to be secured under either silver screw on the side of the receptacle.

, The black wire (""hot"" wire) needs to be secured under either gold screw on the opposite side of the neutral wire.

, If a metal box, cut (2) eight inch lengths of bare copper wire, and combine them and the bare wire from the Romex® cable under a properly sized wirenut. The free end of one wire will connect to the green ground screw of the outlet, and the other free end is to be connected to the metal box with a green screw (expressly for that purpose) or other approved means (special clips, etc). If a plastic (or other non-conductive material) box is used, simply connect the bare copper wire directly under the green screw of the outlet.

,,, Even though you have turned off the power, there are STILL live parts in the panel, particularly the large cable that feeds the main / service disconnect switch. Exercise extreme caution working near this switch.

, This 7/8"" opening in the trade is called a ""half inch k o"" You need to have a 1/2 inch (trade size) connector to insert in the k o, to transition the cable from outside the panel to the inside. These are available in a variety of styles, and materials. The easiest to install are the low profile plastic push in type. Regardless of type, use the type that is suitable for ""NM"" Type (Non-Metallic) or Romex® cable and is the same size as the k o removed.

, Allow plenty of cable for use in making up the inside the panel by tripling the panel's longest dimension for the Romex® length inside the panel. (24"" by 15"" panel would need 24"" x 3 = 72"" or 6 feet of slack). Again, strip the entire jacket except to allow for about an inch of jacket cable inside the panel. Install the Romex® connector into the panel's 1/2"" k o according to instructions. Wrap the end of the cable with a couple of turns of electrical tape. Push the cable through the connector and help pull it with your other hand once it enters the panel. This push / pull motion speeds installation and reduces risk of damaging the insulation. Once about an inch of jacketed cable is INSIDE the panel, stop advancing cable, and secure it within 18"" of the panel with an insulated staple.

, The panel has one or more terminal bars to the left and / or right or bottom of the circuit breakers. Look carefully at the bar(s). Determine if you have: two or more bars and that the white wires are NOT mixed with bare / green wires. (this arrangement has separate neutral and ground bars); or if you have one or two bars that has both whites and bare / green wires mixed in both bars (this arrangement has combined neutral and ground bars, and more common in typical residential settings). Regardless of which type you have, you must maintain the integrity of the grounding and neutral systems by duplicating the termination scheme outlined below.

, The white and ground (bare) wires are to be secured under the bar(s) in the main panel. Cut these wires to length PLUS 12 inches (30.5 cm) or so of slack. If you have the combined neutral and ground style, secure these two wires in terminals as close together as possible. Do not install BOTH wires in the same terminal! If you have separate neutral and ground bars, install the wires in the respective terminal bar.

, The 14-2 Romex®'s black wire is to be connected to a 15 amp breaker. If you ran 12-2 Romex®, up to a 20 amp breaker can be connected. Cut this wire so as to allow it to be connected to ANY breaker position in the panel - plus a little slack. You never know when you might have to move the circuit to a different location in the panel, having enough wire to do so will make the job much easier. Set the handle of the circuit breaker to OFF. Install the circuit breaker into the panel by first hooking or clipping to the grounded or insulated slot or rail (manufacturer dependent) on the outboard side of the insulated electrical contacts, then line up the clip or slot of the circuit breaker with the electrical contact rail or bus. Press the circuit breaker firmly into the panel. Some styles ""click"" into place others just ""bottom out"". If the new circuit breaker is ""even"" and aligned with adjacent circuit breakers, it is most likely properly seated.

, Once complete, you will probably have to remove the appropriate rectangular metal k o for the new circuit breaker on the cover of the panel. After doing so, reinstall the cover onto the panel.

, Do not stand in front of the panel, but rather to the SIDE of the panel and set the Main / Service Disconnect switch to ON. Next, move the new circuit breaker handle to ON and it will power up your electrical outlet that you have just installed.

, Use a meter or plug the appliance or device into the outlet and turn it on. Verify that it is working and return to the panel. Listen for hum and or crackling. Either condition is indicative of a potential connection failure or heat build up. Label the circuit breaker.

, Installing these breakers VOIDS the UL listing and can result in insurance problems if there is an electrical fire.

,, Plugs installed in but not limited to basements, garages, outdoors, or indoors and accessible from grade, bathrooms, etc. will require a Ground Fault circuit breaker or plug, UNLESS it is dedicated to a ""fixed"" appliance such as a washer, refrigerator, etc.

Tape together four pencils.,
Wrap wire around the pencils.,
Loop the loose ends around the coil.,
Secure the battery.,
Strip the ends of the coil wire.,
Slide each end through the eye of a needle.,
Tape the needles to the battery terminals.,
Bring a magnet close to the coil.,
Spin the coil.,
Experiment with different methods.",How to Build a Simple Electric Motor," Tape the pencils in a two by two cluster. This will give you something solid to wrap your coil around. You can substitute the pencils for a cylinder that’s roughly half an inch in diameter., Once you have the pencils taped or find a suitable cylinder, begin wrapping your wire around it tightly. Start in the middle of the wire and wrap the coil fifteen times toward one end and fifteen times toward the other. Once you have finished wrapping the coil, remove the pencils from the middle. This will leave you with two loose leads at either end of the coil., Wrap the loose ends around either side of the coil three or four times. This will help keep the coil wound tightly. Point the remaining loose ends straight out away from the coil., Use tape or clay to hold the battery in place on a flat surface like a tabletop or desk. This will allow you to connect it to the coil without having to hold it with your hands. Make sure the battery is laying on its side so that you can easily reach both terminals., Use wire strippers to remove the insulation on either end of the wire. These leads will connect to the batter and allow current to flow through the coil. For the best results, you can sand the ends of the leads as well. This will remove any film or protectant that may have been applied to the wire., A needle makes the perfect holder for the wire leads. Insert each end into the eye of a separate needle. You can also bend two paper clips (one for each side) to make a holder., Once you have the wire in both needles, it’s time to hook your wire up to the battery. Tape one needle to the positive side of the battery (marked with a “+”). Tape the other needle to the negative side of the battery (marked with a “-”). Be sure the needles are pointing with the sharp end down toward the battery and the eye at the top holding the coil.
Do not let either needle touch both sides of the battery.
Once both leads are connected, there will be an electric current running through the needles and the wire. It is best to use rubber or insulated gloves for this step.

, Once a current is flowing through the coil, it can interact with a magnet. Either hold the magnet close to the coil, or tape it to the battery right underneath the coil. The closer the magnet is to the coil the stronger it will interact., See what happens when you spin the coil. Depending on the direction the current is flowing and the side of the magnet that is interacting with the coil, the coil may continue to spin or may not. If the coil does not keep spinning, try spinning the other direction., Different variations will give you different results. The coil may spin faster, slower, or not at all if you change something. Try moving the magnet closer to or further from the coil, pick a stronger or weaker magnet, or use the other side of the magnet. These variations are a fun way to understand the forces in an electric motor."

Obtain a fuse.,
Obtain a power supply and wires.,
Obtain and wear protective gear.,
Connect the power supply to wires.,
Connect the wires to either end of the fuse.,
Do a safety check.,
Turn on the power supply.",How to Blow a Fuse," There are two main types of fuses: cylindrical and plug fuses. Cylindrical fuses consist of a ribbon of fusible metal enclosed in a ceramic or fiber cylinder. This type of fuse is usually used in appliances. Plug fuses are typically used to protect in home electrical wiring and consist of a metal strip through which current must flow. These are placed in an electric circuit so that current flows through the metal strip to complete the circuit. These typically have a window in the plug so you can see the condition of the metal strip. If excess current flows through the fuse, the metal strip will heat to its melting point and break. This is what blows a fuse.An ampere, or its abbreviation ""amp"", is a unit that is used to measure electrical current. Current can be defined as a count of the number of electrons running through a circuit. One amp is the amount of current produced by one volt. The ampere rating of a fuse is based on the number of amps (i.e the amount of electrical current) a fuse can handle before it will blow. ;
, You should have a power-supply with an ampere-rating greater than your fuse ampere-rating. And lastly two wires that will connect the power-supply and the fuse. The ampere-rating of the wires should be greater or equal to power-supply ampere-rating.


In order to blow a fuse, the number of amps produced from the power supply and wires must be greater than that of the fuse. When you want to blow a fuse you need to make sure that you are putting more amps through the fuse than it can handle.A power supply can be a battery. Copper wires are good conductors of electricity. These, and most fuses, can be purchased from most hardware stores. Consult packaging for amperage ratings. , Some fuses may explode, so you need to protect yourself from danger with protective gear.


Wires may get hot when power supply runs through them. Also keep in mind that wires are conductors of electricity. In order to safely handle these, make sure you have gloves made of 100% rubber, as this is the only sure way to protect yourself from both the heat and electrical current of your wires. Rubber is an insulator from electric current.It is also a good idea to wear protective goggles to shield your eyes from glass or plastic debris that might result from an exploded fuse.

, In order to blow your fuse, you must create a complete circuit using the power supply, wires, and fuse.


All power supplies, such as batteries, will have a positive and negative terminal. This is where you should connect your wires to your power source. Place one wire on the negative terminal of your power supply.
Place the other on the positive terminal of your power supply.

, This will complete the circuit needed to run electric current through the fuse from the power supply.


Make sure the wires are touching both the positive and negative ends of the terminal as well as both ends of the fuse. If there is not complete contact, the circuit is not complete and electricity cannot be conducted. , Some fuses may explode, so it is an important safety step to make sure your gear is properly worn before turning on the power supply.


You should not work near any flammable materials. Electric currents may produce a spark that can ignite flammable liquids and dry flammable objects.

, The fuse should now blow. Proceed with caution.


If your fuse does not blow, disconnect the power supply and check to see that your circuit is connected properly.Check to make sure that the metal strip inside the fuse is intact. If it is not, the fuse is already broken and you should try a different fuse. If you are using a battery as a power source, test to see that it is working properly.

Gather your materials.,
Remove the insulation from the copper wire.,
Wrap the wire around the nail.",How to Create an Electromagnet1," Before you can make an electromagnet, take a moment to gather your materials. You will need the following:


An iron nail that is 15 centimeters long
Three meters of 22 gauge insulated copper wire
At least one D-cell battery
A pair of wire strippers, which you can pick up at a local hardware storeA rubber band;
, Copper wires are usually coated in a layer of plastic for insulation purposes. This is to protect users from electric shock. However, the battery cannot transfer electrons to the wire through the insulation. The coating needs to be removed.









Using your wire strippers, remove a few centimeters of insulation from each end of the wire.Wire clippers look like a pair of scissors with a hole cut out in the middle. You feed the wire through this hole and pull the clippers across the wire to strip the insulation. You should get a wire stripper that's small enough to strip a very small bit of copper wire., Once you've prepared the wire, you can begin building your battery. To start, neatly wind the wire around your nail. The smaller loops you use, the stronger your battery will be. Be careful to leave enough wire on either end. You'll be attaching the excess wire to your battery, so it's a good idea to leave about 8 inches of loose wire on each end.








You should wrap the wire in one direction. This assures that electrons can flow through a wire in a way that creates a magnetic field.If the wire is wrapped in opposite directions, magnetic fields will fight against each other. They will end up canceling each other out."
"
Connect the battery.,
Test the electromagnet.,
Fix any issues.",How to Create an Electromagnet2," Once your done wrapping the wire, connect either ends of the wire to the battery. Connect one end to the negative side and one end to the positive side. Make sure the portions of the wire that have been stripped of insulation are the ends touching the battery. Use your rubber band to strap the wires in place by wrapping the rubber band around the battery from the negative end to the positive end.








It does not matter which end of the wire is connected to which end of the battery. It will work either way.If a rubber band is not holding the wires in place, you can use two pieces of masking tape instead.

, You should now have successfully created an electromagnetic. To test the magnet, hover the battery over a metallic item like a paper clip. The paperclip should rise up and attach to the battery. You have created a magnetic charge with the wire, nail, and battery.








If you want to increase the strength of your battery, increase the number of coils running around your nail. This will allow your electromagnet to pick up more objects., In the event your magnet does not work, check the battery. A dead or low charge battery may not be effective in creating an electromagnet. If the battery is fine, review your process. You may have curled the wire in opposite directions, disrupting the flow of electrons. You may also have forgotten to remove the insulation from the wire.

Use gloves when handling your magnet.,
Be conscious of heat.,
Disconnect the wires when you're done with your magnet.",How to Create an Electromagnet3," Always use gloves when you begin experimenting with your magnet. Wires can get hot when in use. You want to make sure you do not burn your hands when handling your electromagnet. This is especially vital if you're working on strengthening your magnet. Electromagnets get hot as their strength increases., As stated, electromagnets get hot when you increase their strength by wrapping the wire tighter. If the device becomes very hot, you might want to disconnect the wires to deactivate the magnet for a bit. Excessive heat can cause burns and, in rare cases, may be a fire hazard., You should not leave an electromagnet plugged in for long when it's not in use. For one, the battery can drain the magnet swiftly. Also, once again, heat is a concern. Once you're done playing with your magnet, disassemble it."

Oh, and enough wires and solder/crocodile clips to connect everything together.
, The more turns the better. Strip the insulation from the ends of the wire to allow you to connect it to the circuit., The diagram pretty much says it all., This is what the LED is for: it indicates that the generator is charging. The charging time (in seconds) is about 5RC. This should influence your choice of resistor R. If you are using a 1F capacitor, a ten ohm resistor in place of R will give a charging time of about 50 seconds. If you use the same resistor with a 360F capacitor, it'll take 5 hours to charge. Choose the resistor with care., If you get a really big switch and a servant with a lisp, it's the perfect opportunity to yell, ""Igor, pull the switch!"""

Depending on the mounting position, the float on these switches rise or fall as per the liquid level. The operation can be either Normally Open or Normally Closed by rotating the switch by 180 degrees. Do not position it inside a tank in a way that it might get obstructed. Proper deployment of level sensors can prevent serious accidents.
, Selecting the right materials and testing them for compatibility is critical to maintaining the life and continuous operation of these products., Typically, these devices do not require any hard core maintenance. In case of too much contamination in the liquid, a casual wipe-down is all that is required., Make sure the signal cables are routed away from the power sources or any other electric fixtures. Cable routing, if done properly, can be beneficial. Improper routing can lead to increased electric noise at higher voltages., Always double check that the sensors are grounded properly. Using a single ground will help you avoid interference or shock. Together, a perfect cable, a good ground, and proper cable routing will prevent electromagnetic interference, thereby maintaining clean measurement signals., It is recommended that independent high level switch devices be fixed to all tanks. These high level switch devices can offer a safeguard against spills in case of a failure with the unit’s measuring instrumentation. This can be a form of secondary protection against overspills., Make sure the electrical specifications, pressure and temperature limitations, for your level and flow sensors, do not exceed more than what is mentioned in the directions., Check for the ambient temperature changes as they affect the switch set points. This is because the density of a fluid can fluctuate with the varying temperatures., Most sensors are designed to resist shock, wear, and vibration. It’s important to make sure shock and vibration are minimized for prolonged use., Filter the liquid media containing any form of particulate or debris to ensure the proper operation of the products. Also, check to see that the mounting point and the electrical entries within the tank are properly sealed for liquids or vapors, to prevent any damage."

Choose the right material for installing electrical conduit fittings: The most preferred material is known as EMT (Electrical Metallic Tubing).,
Chalk out a wiring plan: Find out the location of the electrical boxes on your wall to trace the route of the conduit.,

Tape the ends and put the wires in place: Use a widely available fish tape and run it through the entire route of the conduit fittings you just installed.",How to Install Electrical Conduits," EMT is very easy to install as you can effortlessly bend it and assemble it as per your needs. Also, you can conveniently take it off in case your wiring goes wrong somewhere. If you do not have it in your house, you can buy EMT from any of the electrical surplus stores for pretty cheap.;
, Draw the path from the main power source to the electrical box.

, Now cut the length that you just measured with a tool called hacksaw. The cut ends are likely to have burrs which can be removed using a deburring tool or with pliers.

, Owing to the easy flexibility of EMT, this should not be very difficult. Conduit benders come in handy for doing this bending.

,, Fix together the ends along with the electrical wires with the same fish tape. Give a finishing touch by pulling all the wire in the pipe in their right place.

Unwind several feet of the light string and feed a little bit of it into one end of the pipe.,
Start up the vacuum cleaner and attach it to the other end of the pipe.,
Once you have pulled the light string through the pipe, attach a heavier string / rope to the end, and pull this through manually.

,
Once the heavier string / rope has been pulled through the pipe, attach your final wire or cable, and pull this through manually.,
Use a metal or fiberglass fish tape or snake.",How to Fish Wires Through a Conduit or Pipe,";
, Try to seal the connection the best you can to make the most efficient use of the vacuum. The vacuum should pull the string through the pipe..


Watch the end where the string is feeding into the pipe to make sure it doesn't get snagged and stop. It is important to be aware of how much string has been pulled in, so you know when to expect the string's exit on the other end.
Watch the end where the vacuum is for the appearance of the string. If you don't, a lot of string can be sucked into the bowels of the vacuum cleaner.

,, If needing to pull more than one to three smaller wires, connect wires in such a way that the point of connection to the heavy string is not a single ""clump of wires"" folded over. This will make for a difficult ""pull"" through the conduit. Instead, connect only one wire directly to the string, create one or more loops in this wire 6 - 8 or more inches down the wire from the connection point. Slip any additional wire(s) several inches into the loop, fold over and wrap around the first wire. Repeat this as often as required and wrap electrical tape around the string / rope just above the connection point all the way down just beyond the last wrap of the last wire hooked through the loops. The result should look like the end of a pencil and will pass much easier through the conduit.

, If the conduit run is long, has several bends, has more than 25% of its area filled with wires, etc., the strength and flexibility offered by a fish tape or snake will make pushing into the conduit much easier. Often times it can be used to pull new wires directly into the pipe - saving time of multiple pulls of increasing strength string / rope. Fiberglass does not conduct electricity and is highly recommended for use instead of metal fish tapes and snakes.

Select a switch rated above the maximum current (in amps) that will flow through the switch.,
Select a switch with the right type of electrical connections for your project.,
Select a suitable mount.",How to Install a Toggle Switch," As with nearly all types of electrical work, it's extremely important to ensure that there's no risk of electric shock before starting work on your device. Attempting to modify a ""live"" device is an easy way to seriously hurt yourself or cause a short circuit and permanently damage your device.


The precise method for disconnecting your device from its power source differs depending on the device you're working on. For cars, you'll want to disconnect the negative terminal of the battery, for instance, while other devices may require you to yank a plug or manually disconnect the power supply in some other way.;
, Installing a toggle switch on a device requires you to gain access to the device's internal wiring, which usually means removing the device's exterior paneling or housing. If possible, rather than removing the paneling for the entire object, try to remove only the paneling from the part of the device where you intend to install the switch.


For instance, if you're installing a toggle switch in your car, you'll want to remove the dash paneling - if possible, a small portion of paneling where you want to install the switch, rather than the entire dash panel.
This may require screwdrivers, pry bars, ""panel poppers"", or other specialized tools.

, To accommodate your toggle switch, you'll usually need to create a suitably-sized and shaped hole in the paneling or housing of your device. For basic toggle switches, this is usually a circular hole, but depending on the type of switch you're using, differently-shaped holes may be necessary. Measure the dimensions of your switch bushing (the part of the switch in which the ""lever"" is seated) so that you'll know how large to make your hole.

, Next, make a hole in the paneling of your device to fit your switch. For the most basic toggle switches with circular bushings, this will mean drilling with a bit slightly larger that the diameter of the switch bushing. For differently-shaped holes, you may need to use a jigsaw, sandpaper, and/or other tools.


Use a HSS (high speed steel) twist drill bit to drill through wood, plastic or mild steel. A spade bit may also be used if you are drilling through wood.

, Finally, put your switch in the hole you've just carved for it, passing through from the underside. Secure the toggle switch in place with its mount. This usually means installing the mount over the hole, passing the toggle switch through, and tightening it in place with a nut.


For example, in a basic toggle switch setup, you might have to thread a jam nut onto the switch's bushing to fasten it to the panel mount, then tighten the nut with an adjustable wrench.

, The types of devices onto which you might want to install a toggle switch will have electrical configurations that vary greatly. Thus, no single guide is likely to provide a one-size-fits-all solution. The steps in this section are meant to be taken as general guidelines for a simple on-off (SPST) toggle switch. They should never supersede any instructions included with your toggle switch or the device into which you're installing it.


When in doubt, consult a skilled electrician to save time and avoid inadvertent damage.

, For your toggle switch to function as an on-off switch, you'll need to wire your toggle switch to the device's power supply. Use wire cutters to cut your device's supply wire in a location that best allows for routing either or both ends of the wire to the switch. Strip approximately 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) of insulation from each end of the wire using a wire stripper.

, A pigtail is a short length of wire (usually about 6"") with both ends stripped. It can be connected to wires to that aren't quite long enough to reach your toggle switch as a sort of ""extender"". Add a pigtail as follows:


Determine the gauge of the existing wire and obtain black wire of the same gauge.
Cut a piece of black wire long enough to reach from the cut end of the supply wire to the toggle switch.
Strip 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) of insulation from each end of this piece of wire.
Connect one end of the pigtail wire to the supply wire by twisting the ends of the wires together clockwise. Twist a wire nut of the proper size clockwise over the wire joint until the wire nut is tight.

, At this point, you've a made a break in the device's supply wire, you'll need to add your toggle switch in the middle of the break so that it can regulate the flow of electricity through the circuit. The way you do this depends on the type of toggle switch you have. See below:


If your toggle switch has wire leads, twist the end of each lead to one of the supply wires (or pigtail extensions) and twist a wire nut over each wire connection until they're tight.
If your toggle switch has screw terminals, loosen the terminal screws, loop the ends of the supply wires and hook each loop over a terminal screw so the loops point clockwise around the shaft of each terminal screw. Then, tighten the terminal screws.
If the toggle switch has solder connections, bend the ends of the wires around the switch terminals. Needle-nose pliers may be useful. Heat each terminal with a soldering iron while holding the end of solder wire in contact with the terminal (but not in direct contact with the soldering iron tip). When the solder begins to melt, withdraw the soldering iron tip and allow the melting solder to flow and cover the wire-terminal joint.

, When your toggle switch is wired properly, carefully re-connect the device's power supply and test the function of the toggle switch. If it works as intended, you may replace the panel or device housing. Congratulations! You've successfully installed a toggle switch.

, In electrical terminology, a toggle switch can have one or more ""poles"" and ""throws"". Pole refers to the number of circuits controlled by the switch - usually, this is the number of outwardly-visible ""levers"" on the switch. Throw refers to the number of positions a switch has. Usually, for simple on-off capability, you'll want a SPST (single pole, single throw) switch.


However, if the device you're attaching your toggle switch needs more than basic on-off control, you may need a more complicated switch. For instance, if you're installing a toggle switch to control a car's hydraulic system, you'll probably want a switch with multiple poles to control the hydraulics for the different sides of your car and/or multiple throws so that you'll be able to set the hydraulics to ""off"" or varying degrees of ""on"", rather than just simply ""off"" or ""on"".
Note that there are differences between British and American terminology when it comes the colloquial names for common switches. In the States, a SPST switch is also called a ""two-way"" switch, whereas in Britain, it's called a ""one-way"" switch. Similarly, in the US and Britain, a SPDT (single pole, double throw) switch is called a ""three-way"" and ""two-way"" switch, respectively., Different electrical devices require different amounts of current to power them. When searching for switches, make sure the contact rating of the switch you select is equal to (or greater than) the circuit current you plan for it to regulate.

, Your toggle switch is useless if it can't connect to the device it's supposed to operate. Be sure to pick a switch that's compatible with the electrical connections inside your device. If you don't, you may find yourself having to make improvised connections with a soldering iron, electrical tape, etc., which can be daunting for the inexperienced. Common types of switch connections include:


Screw connectors.
Solder lugs, pins or terminals.
Wire leads.

, If your device comes with spaces specifically designed to accommodate toggle switches, you may be able to get away without having to make any extraneous modifications to your device. However, the types of devices in which toggle switches are often installed usually don't. Thus, you should usually expect to need to drill a hole for the switch and to install a mount to seat the switch in.


Often, you'll need a type of mount called a panel mount that interfaces with a type of switch called a panel switch. A panel mount switch has a threaded body that protrudes up through a hole in a panel and is secured to the panel with a panel or jam nut.

Turn off power supply to the electrical panel.,
Inspect the circuit breaker arrangement for unused locations.,
Remove the electrical panel cover.,
Test the panel for power.,
Locate an unused space above, below or between existing circuit breakers.,
Select the correct circuit breaker.,
Locate the circuit breaker mounting points.,
Set the circuit breaker handle to the OFF position.,
Install the circuit breaker by aligning with the unused space in the panel.,
Connect the circuit.,
Remove all foreign objects.,
Install cover.,
Test.,
Identify the circuit.",How to Install a Circuit Breaker," Locate the Service Disconnect or Main circuit breaker in the panel, and set to the ""Off"" position. This circuit breaker is likely to be the largest value and located either at the top or bottom of the panel. If no such circuit breaker is identified in the panel, it is likely in another panel in the building, or in the meter socket enclosure. Look for other panel(s) to find the circuit breaker needed.;
, Pay particular attention to unused spaces at the top and bottom of the cover. Some manufacturers of electrical panels have removable knock outs or plates at these locations, but the panel itself lacks provisions to mount a circuit breaker. Simply stated: Do not rely on the cover alone to determine the ability to add circuits to the panel - check the bus bar.

, Remove fasteners while a helper supports the cover, then pull straight away from the panel.

, Use a tester or meter set to the highest AC voltage range (120 Volts minimum) available, and check for the presence of power by touching one probe to ground or neutral (the bar that has bare or green and white wires connected - or the bar that has just white or just bare or green wires connected). Touch the other probe to the screw terminal of a circuit breaker that has a black, red or blue insulated wire connected. If 120 (or more) volts is indicated, the panel is still powered. If the Service Disconnect or Main circuit breaker is in this panel, it will always indicate power on the terminals that have cables connected. The output of the Main or Service Disconnect when located in the panel, connects to the bus bar. The bus bar should have no power present when this breaker is OFF. Testing at the Service Disconnect or Main circuit breaker is not recommended due to this ""seemingly conflicting"" information. Do not continue if power is present on a circuit breaker other than Service Disconnect or Main circuit breaker, until the power source has been shut off.

, A single pole or single width circuit breaker will provide a a single 120 volt circuit (or in the case of a ""tandem breaker"" or ""half width breaker"" it will provide two 120 volt circuits - not a 240 volt circuit), while a double pole or double width circuit breaker will provide a 208 or 240 volt circuit. Carefully compare this location to the cover that was removed earlier. It is very important that the cover has provisions for exposing the new circuit breaker by removal of the metal twist-out(s). If there is no twist-out(s), the circuit breaker must be located to a different place in the panel.

, The panel label will list all approved circuit breakers for installation. Deviating from the list is a code violation and voids any UL, FM or other listing service's approval. Typically, the only breakers allowed to be installed are from the same manufacturer of the panel - even if other brand breakers are labeled as ""fits (brand name here) panels"". In the USA, Canada and other countries, a single pole breaker would be used for a 120 volt circuit and a double pole breaker for a 240 volt circuit. The breaker should be of an ampacity that does not exceed the circuit conductor's rating. This is typically 15 amps for #14 copper, 20 amps for #12 copper and 30 amps for #10 copper conductors or wires. The code book should be consulted to determine sizes for other circuits. The breaker's terminals should be rated to match the conductor material; CU for copper and AL for aluminum. The terminal size should be large enough for the wire to fit. The need to remove strands of wire to fit the terminal is an indication of an error somewhere along the line.

, The circuit breaker will have two mounting points. Both are mechanical contacts; one of which also serves as the electrical input contact. Both contact points are on or very near the bottom of the circuit breaker.


The non-electrical contact point is at the screw terminal end of the circuit breaker. This end is engaged first when installing. The contact point will consist of a clip, bracket or tang and works with a support structure on the outboard part of the panel designed specifically for this use. The clip is pressed on and snaps to a raised rail for the Square D QO style (and others) breakers, The Square D HOM, Murray, GE and many others use a bracket molded in the case to land a clip from the panel. Finally, the tang type used by some other circuit breakers simply aligns with a slot in the rail.
The electrical contact is at the opposite end of the circuit breaker. This end is engaged last when installing. The contact mechanism is often inside the circuit breaker; partially visible through a slot or opening in the case. It is closely aligned with the bus bar (metal ribs or tabs in the center of the panel) after the mechanical contact point has been engaged. The electrical contact is established when the circuit breaker has fully engaged the bus bar - simple downward pressure is all the is required to fully seat.

, The circuit breaker has 3 possible positions; ON and OFF and a mid position when TRIPPED. Push the handle towards the OFF position unless OFF already.

, Tilt the circuit breaker so that the mechanical contact point engages the support structure (rail, slot or clip). Once engaged, pivot the circuit breaker on the mechanical contact and roll towards the center of the panel - making sure the bus bar of the panel is still aligned with the slot or opening on the circuit breaker case. Firmly press on the circuit breaker surface to ensure it has been fully seated. While it will require firm even pressure to be seated, it should not have to be forced. Compare it to other previously installed breakers.

, After making sure the circuit breaker is still in the OFF position, connect the circuit conductors or wires to the circuit breaker terminal(s), ground and neutral bar terminal screws. Use appropriate oxide inhibitor when connecting aluminum conductors.

, Remove, tools, wire scraps, etc. from the interior of the panel. Look for and remove accidental conductors in the panel that could cause a short circuit when power is restored.

, Bring the cover up to the panel to compare the new circuit breaker location to the cover openings. Remove the metal twist-out(s) at the appropriate location. Place the cover on the panel to check that the circuit breaker has fully seated at both contact points. The circuit breaker should not be a high point under the cover. Remove the cover and press the circuit breaker into the panel as needed to provide proper cover fit. Secure the cover to the electrical panel with the fasteners.

, Standing to the side of the panel, restore power to the panel by setting the Service Disconnect or Main to ""On"" and then set the new circuit breaker to ""On"" Clear any short circuit before attempting a reset if circuit breaker instantly trips. Check for correct operation of the new circuit (light, outlet, etc.) with a test light or meter.

, Locate the panel's circuit directory. It will often be found on the inside of the panel door. Determine the circuit breaker location (or ""circuit number"") and write a description of the circuit (load type such as ""refrigerator"" or a location such as ""living room"") in the space provided. Be sure to edit the directory if any circuits were moved to install the new circuit.

Hide the cord behind furniture.,
Place the cord behind a secondary baseboard.,
Try taping the cord.,
Feed the cord through the wall.",How to Hide an Electrical Cord1," One of the easiest ways to hide an electrical cord is by positioning it behind furniture. Try hiding an electrical cord behind a desk or dresser. You can also easily hide an electrical cord by positioning it behind a bookcase.
, If you need to hide cords that are close to the floor, try creating a secondary baseboard in front of your existing baseboard. You can then hide the electrical cord between the two baseboards.For example, you can create a secondary baseboard that looks like a white picket fence, position it in front of your existing baseboard, and hide the cord between the two baseboards.

, You can also hide an electrical cord with tape. Try using clear packing tape to affix the cord to an area that is not the focal point of the room, like the leg of a chair or the back of a table. Then run the electrical cord down the length of the leg toward the electrical outlet., If you are concerned about cords dangling from a mounted appliance, like a television or computer screen, try drilling a hole below the base of the appliance. Then drill a hole near the floor or electrical outlet and feed the cord through the holes."

Turn off the power.,
Confirm the space is free.,
Locate the same spot from above or below.,
Cut through the drywall.,
Drill through on the other side.,
Pull the cable through with a fish tape.,
Drop a string from above instead.,
Draw the wire along with a magnet.,
Approach lath and plaster construction with caution.,
Drill through fire blocks.,
Thread wires past insulation.,
Cut through drywall for horizontal fishing.,
Drill through studs or joists as a last resort.,
Seal holes in fire blocks with fire-resistant caulk (recommended).",How to Fish Wires Through Walls," Shut off the electricity to the circuit you are modifying. Double check with a multimeter at the closest outlet where you plan to connect the wires., Check for studs at the location where you want the wire to exit. Confirm there are no cross beams or duct work along the path the wire will take (typically straight up to the attic, or straight down to the basement). Ideally, use a stud finder that can tell the difference between studs, pipes, and other obstacles.Failing that, locate studs with magnets, or knock on the wall listening for hollow sounds.


If there is any uncertainty, drill a small test hole and explore with a bent wire coat hanger.
Avoid locations with another electrical outlet less than two studs away. Stay away from exterior walls, which typically contain braces and insulation., Check the attic, basement, and/or crawlspace to confirm you have a clear path to thread the wire. You can often find a 2 x 4 or larger beam (the top or bottom plate) running along the wall, and measure along it to find the correct spot. If there is no beam, locate the wall using one of these methods:Look for a row of nails in the subfloor, or a pair of joists very close together.Find a feature visible from both sides, such as a vent. Measure from there to the location you chose, then measure the same distance on the other floor.
If all else fails, drill a small test hole from the main floor to the attic or basement. Thread a pipe cleaner or similar object through and locate it on the other side., Return to the main floor and cut out a piece of drywall where the wire will exit:If installing an electrical box, trace the outline onto the drywall to get the exact dimensions. Otherwise, just draw a rectangle.
Drill two holes in opposite corners of the rectangle.
Slowly cut along the outline from one hole to the other, using a manual drywall saw.
If you need to patch the hole afterward, cut at an inward slant and remove in one piece.

, Return to the attic or basement, and drill through the wall plate where you want to guide the wire through. You may encounter nails, so choose a drill bit that won't get damaged by metal.If you're working in a crawlspace, you can use a flex bit drill to drill this hole from several feet away.
Keep the hole at least 1¼"" from the edge of the wood.If this does not allow for a hole large enough to insert your wires, separate the wires and insert them through separate, smaller holes, spaced a reasonable distance apart.

, Carefully extend the fish tape from one opening to the other. Tape the end of the fish tape onto the cable with electrical tape. Retract the fish tape to pull the cable through.


Move slowly to avoid snagging the cable or damaging it due to kinks or friction., If you want to bring the wire up to the attic, tie something to a string and lower it through the hole from above. Once the string reaches the bottom, go down to the lower opening and tie the cable and string together. Pull the string from above to fish the wire through.

, A magnet may be the most effective method for long vertical distances or tricky corners. The key is to place the magnet at the stationary end, so it does not attach itself to a metal object in the middle of your wall:Tape a powerful magnet (such as a rare earth magnet) onto the end of the cable.
Stick the magnet and cable through one opening.
Tie an iron nail or similar object to a fish tape (or a string if the fish tape is not long enough).
Lower the nail on the fish tape through the other opening, until it makes contact with the magnet.
Remove the magnet and attach the cable end to the fish tape using electrical tape.
Retract the fish tape up to thread the cable through.

, Old plaster tends to break off the wooden lath easily, which makes installation much more difficult. If possible, mount electrical boxes next to a joist for a sturdier support.Be prepared to repair the plaster after installation.

, If there are horizontal fire blocks between studs, you have two options:Use a flex bit to drill through the center of the fire block.

Or cut through the drywall at the fire block, and chisel out a notch ¾-inch wide x 1-inch deep (1.9 x 2.5 cm). Cover the notch with a metal nail plate after pulling the cable through.

, If the wall contains insulation, try to fish the wire between the outer paper or plastic cover and the wall. If there is no cover, press the wire against a stud and use it as a guide.While handling fiberglass insulation, wear gloves, eye protection, and a mask that covers your mouth and nose., If there is no way to avoid fishing your wire horizontally, you will likely need to cut through the drywall. A small cut with a penknife is usually enough to let you guide the wire through.In most cases, you will also need to drill through a wall stud as described below.

, If there is no open path for the wire, you may need to drill through wall studs or ceiling joists. Follow these guidelines to avoid causing structural damage:Wall stud: drill through the center of the stud, using a maximum diameter of 60% of the stud's width (40% for load-bearing walls).
Ceiling joist: center the hole vertically, not through the top or bottom 2"" (5 cm). Avoid the ends of the joist as well as the middle third. Maximum diameter is ⅓ of the actual depth of the joist (not the depth as labeled).
Vital support structures: Never drill through ""glue lams"" (laminated support beams), or through supports above doors, windows, or arches.

, Wiring through unprotected holes can allow a fire to spread rapidly between floors of your house. If you drilled through a fire block in your wall, or through fire-resistant flooring material, seal up the holes with fire-resistant caulk or a similar product."

Try cord clips.,
Use a surge protector that disguises cords.,
Try a cord cover.,
Try painting over a flat wire covering.,
Keep cords out of sight with a binder clip.",How to Hide an Electrical Cord2," A cord clip can help prevent a tangled mess of cords and wires. You can purchase cord clips at your local hardware store or online. Try affixing the cord clips to the back of a table or desk. Then position the electrical cord in the clips., You can purchase a surge protector that also houses unsightly electrical cords. Try using a surge protector with cord storage. Mount it on the wall under a television, computer, or other appliance that is wrought with unsightly cords., If you can’t hide the cords behind another object in the room, try wrapping it in a spiral cord cover. You can purchase electrical cord covers online or at your local hardware store. Choose a cover that matches your walls or floor, or buy a paintable cover for a custom fit., If you need to hide electrical cords on your walls, try disguising them with a flat wire covering. Once you have placed the flat wire covering over the electrical cord, attach the covering to the wall. Paint over the flat wire covering to help the cord and its covering blend into the wall., If you need to corral multiple electrical cords, try attaching them together with a binder clip. You can then hang the binder clip on a nail, screw or hook that is in an inconspicuous place, like the back of a piece of furniture."

Unbox the USB outlet/surge protector item once you've transported it home.,
Find and take off the original switch-plate.,
Make sure that the original outlet box set has been tightened down, if it's been quite awhile since it's last adjustment.,
Figure out the direction of the way the outlets are formed.,
Match the prongs of the surge protector outlet up with the original outlet, as you push these prongs into the outlet themselves.,
Stop pushing the box into the outlet until it stops or becomes unmovable and tight.,
Place the screw into the center hole of the box between the three prong outlet and the USB ports, and tighten down the screw with a screwdriver.,
Sample (or plug in) an electrically-powered item to ensure all outlets work.",How to Install an Outlet‐Mounted Surge Protector or USB Extender Box," Inside most of these boxes, you'll find that the surge protector is there (that has prongs that will be inserted into the wall directly), as well as a longer-sized screw.;
, For almost all of these, you can only install these outlet surge protectors onto a 2-outlet electrical plate that only contain 2 outlets. If you see more than that, or another set next to this, you'll need to find another outlet where these can be installed. You'll most likely need a screwdriver that is either Phillips head or flathead. For European, there are metric screwdrivers that are available that must be used in place of these, but this will differ dependent on the type of screw that was used.


You can't just take the outlet out of the box and stuff it into the switch-plate. Although that would look logical and way too easy, it's not safe to do anything with that type of outlet to plug it in that way.
Much like regular electrical outlet extenders that contain six outlets that go right into the wall, these must have the original outlet switch-plate removed first.
Set the switch-plate and screw off to the side. You should be now done with this older switch-plate (as the older switch-plate can be used elsewhere now).

, If it hasn't been too long (about a year or two is on average the max time when these screws start to come a teeny bit loose and will continue to loosen over time) ago, you can skip this step and continue on with the steps below, unless you want to double-check that these are still steady and will not move, causing the outlet to loosen.

, For American outlets with the three prongs (two long and one almost round), you'll need to know the direction in which they are facing so the one can go right overtop of the other one without problems. Some can be facing to the left, some can be facing to the right, and some can be one on top of the other, and others yet can be one on top of the other--bottom side up!

, Look at the back of the surge protector outlet to look at the prongs and the way they are formed, much like you looked at the outlet themselves in the previous step, but now on the surge protector as you plug it into the wall itself.


Grab onto the edges, as soon as you've aligned the surge protector's holes up and have started to push them into the outlet themselves, and continue pushing. Your palm of your hand must be completely open and extended and almost covering most of the electrical outlets on the surge protector outlet extender box, as you push it into the wall.

, There will be a tiny gap between the original outlet box and the surge protector outlet, but if you can stick your finger between them, you know you've gotten it not far enough in. If you can only see the tips of the grounding prongs on either side of the original outlet box, you'll know that they are in far enough.


Try not to stick your fingers in at an angle, if you can get them down between this crack. Although you shouldn't need to turn off the power to add this box, you can turn off the power; as long as you keep your fingers out, you should be fine and electrical-short free!

, Make sure not to confuse this center hole with the grounding prong (that looks like a half-moon with a flat bottom) hole of the electrical outlet; however, outlets are built so that the screw can't be inserted into this hole, no matter how hard you try to (without brute force, that is).

, If it came with USB ports, try both of these out as well. Make sure to know the concepts built into the USB extenders as some of them have special rules for plugging in any iOS devices you might own (such as iPods, iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, etc.)


If the one outlet works, the others should; however, try them all out. Use a low-powered electrical appliance such as a night-light or other small light to ensure you aren't draining massive amounts of power and overcharging the circuits all at once.
As you unplug the appliance the first time, make sure to watch for any slight shifting patterns of the electrical box, as sometimes the box could slip around (if the box isn't tight enough), causing both the outlet to make the prongs slip around in the plug as well as the box to move around on the wall, and this must be rectified promptly (ASAP) to avoid electrocution later!

Disconnect completely and/or turn off all power to the circuit you are testing.,

Turn the ohmmeter off when not in use.",How to Use an Ohmmeter," You must have a completely dead wire or circuit in order to ensure accuracy in measurement, as well as your own safety. Your ohmmeter will supply the voltage and current for your circuit so NO other power is necessary. As the instructions for our Blue Point volt/ohmmeter state, testing a powered circuit can ""cause damage to the meter, circuit, and *you*.""






;
, Analog ohmmeters are very basic and inexpensive, and usually range from 0-10 to 0-10,000 ohms, digital devices may have similar ranges or ""auto-range"", reading the resistance of your device or circuit and selecting the correct range automatically.








, If you just bought an ohmmeter, the battery may have come pre-installed in your unit, or packaged separately with instructions for installing it.








, For multi-functional meters, you will see a ""common"", or negative plug, and a ""positive"" plug. These may also be colored red (+) and black (-).








, Notice that the scale reads in the reverse direction of most conventional measuring scales, that is, less resistance is to the right, and more resistance is to the left. Zero resistance should be observed when your probes are connected directly to each other, and you can adjust this by holding them together and turning the ""adjust"" dial until the needle on the scales is at zero ohms.








, For practice, you can use almost anything which conducts electricity, from a piece of aluminum foil to a pencil mark on a sheet of paper. To get an idea of the accuracy of your readings, buy a few different resistors from an electronics supplier, or some other device with a known resistance value.








, If you bought a 1000 ohm resistor, you can place a probe on each conductor on the resistor, and select the 1000 or 10,000 ohm range, then read the meter to see if indeed it reads 1,000 ohms.








, If you are reading the ohms on a resistor in a printed circuit board, you will have to unsolder or unpin the resistor to assure you are not getting a false reading through another path in the circuit.








, If you read ""infinite ohms"", there is no path for the electrical current to follow, and in simple terms, this suggests a burned out component somewhere in the circuit, or a broken conductor. Because many circuits contain ""gate"" devices (transistors or semiconductors), diodes, and capacitors, however, you may not read continuity even when the complete circuit is intact, which makes it difficult to test complete circuits with only an ohmmeter.








, Occasionally the test leads will become shorted while the device is stored, draining the battery.

Remove power from the circuit containing the resistor.,
Isolate the resistor from the circuit.,
Inspect the resistor.,
Read the resistor value visually.,
Prepare a digital multimeter (DMM) to measure the resistor.,
Measure the resistance.,
Determine the actual resistance of the resistor.,
Reattach a resistor that gives an accurate reading.,
Replace a resistor that measures outside of the acceptable value range.",How to Test Resistors," This can be done by unplugging it from the mains or by removing the batteries if it is a portable device. Keep in mind that some devices still can be charged with a potentially harmful voltage until minutes after removing its power!;
, An attempt to measure a resistor that is still connected to the circuit can yield an incorrect calculation, as part of the circuit might also be measured.


Disconnect one end of the resistor from the circuit. It does not matter which end of the resistor is disconnected. Disconnect the resistor by pulling on the resistor. If the resistor is soldered in place, melt the solder with an electronic grade soldering iron and pull the resistor free using small needle nose pliers. Soldering irons are available at electronic parts and hobby stores.

, If the resistor shows signs of blackening or charring, it may be damaged by excess current flow. A resistor showing blackening or charring should be replaced and discarded.

, The resistor value will be printed on the resistor. Smaller resistors may have their value indicated by color coded bands.


Note the resistor tolerance. No resistor is precisely the value indicated on it. The tolerance indicates how much the printed value may vary and still be considered a properly sized resistor. For example, a 1,000 ohm resistor with a 10 percent tolerance indication is still considered to be accurate if it measures no less that 900 ohms and no more than 1,100 ohms.

, DMMs are available at electronics parts and hobby stores.


Ensure that the DMM comes on and does not indicate a low battery condition.
Set the adjustable scale of the DMM to the next setting higher than the expected resistor value. For example, if the DMM may be set to scales that are multiples of 10 and a resistor marked as 840 ohms is to be measured, set the DMM to the 1,000 ohm scale.

, Connect the 2 leads of the DMM to the 2 legs of the resistor. Resistors have no polarity, so it does not matter which DMM lead is connected to which resistor leg.

, Read the result shown on the multimeter. In determining whether or not the resistor is within the allowable range for that resistor, do not forget to take the resistor tolerance into account.

, Reconnect it to the circuit by pressing it back into place if you pulled it free with your fingers. If the solder joint had to be melted and the resistor had to be disconnected using pliers, melt the solder with the soldering iron and use the needle nose pliers to push the resistor back in to place.

, Discard the old resistor. Resistors are available in electronics parts stores and hobby stores. Note that replacing the malfunctioning resistor will not necessarily fix the problem, if the resistor fails again the source of the problem should be sought elsewhere in the circuit.

Fuses are round and screw into sockets in the fuse box, much like a light bulb.Older homes tend to have fuse boxes. If you have a particularly large house, you may even have multiple fuse boxes., If you lost power in your bedroom, unplug everything in that room before replacing any fuses.If you don't unplug any appliances before replacing the fuse, you run the risk of blowing the new fuse as well., You should see a main power switch in the fuse box that can be toggled between On/Off. Wear gloves and rubber soled shoes when working in the fuse box.Be sure to remove any jewelry before replacing fuses.It is possible to replace fuses without turning the main power off, but it is dangerous. Exercise caution when working in the fuse box., In each fuse box there should be a circuit list that tells you what fuses control what circuits. This will give you an idea of what fuse may have blown. Find the fuse that corresponds with the area of the house that lost power.The blown fuse will be cloudy or the metal line in the fuse will be broken.If you don't have a circuit list, you may have to guess which fuse is blown. If you pull a fuse out and no other circuits lose power, you've found the blown fuse., To replace the fuse, simply screw the new fuse into the socket. Make sure you replace the fuse with a new one of the same amperage. Do not replace a blown fuse with one of a higher rating.Fuses are rated at 15, 20, or 30 amps. The higher the rating the larger the appliance they power., Once you have replaced the fuse, switch the main power back on. If the fuse blows again, call an electrician to inspect your wiring.If the fuse does not blow, plug in any appliances you were using. If the fuse blows, there could be a problem with the appliance. There could also be too many appliances plugged into one circuit., When you trip a breaker and lose power to a room, unplug everything in that room., You can spot the breaker in question by finding the switch that is out of line with the other switches. If you have power, your breakers should all be in the ""on"" position. The tripped breaker will either be flipped to ""off"" or it will not be fully on., Flip the tripped breaker all the way off before turning it back on. Many breakers will not reset unless they have been turned off completely.If the breaker trips immediately, call an electrician to inspect your wiring., Once you have flipped the breaker back on, plug your appliances back in. If you trip the breaker again, there may be an issue with your appliance, or you could be plugging too many appliances into one circuit.If you trip the breaker from plugging in too many appliances, try using a different outlet. If that does not solve the problem, call an electrician."

Make a note / list of all the items that are not working on the circuit.,
If you live near an Electrical Supply House go and purchase a 220Volt, 60 or 100 watt light bulb.,
Remove the blown fuse and note the amperage.,
If it is a 30 amp fuse and there are lights or outlets not working on the circuit, it probably is the wrong size fuse installed.,
Screw the light bulb into the socket that had held the blown fuse.,
Now starting at one of the items (from your list of items that were not working) close to the location of the fuse panel, start unplugging items from the circuit / outlets.,When you unplug the defective item, causing the short, the light bulb at the fuse panel will go off.,If you have unplugged all the items on the circuit, and the bulb at the panel is still lit, then start turning off ceiling lights that are powered by the troubled circuit.,
Having found the defective light / appliance and it is still unplugged, it is time to replace the bulb at the panel with a standard fuse.,
If the blown fuse was a 30 amp fuse, it will be necessary to open the panel so that you can determine the proper size fuse to use for the wire attached on that circuit.,If in doubt about the gauge of the wire, use a 15 amp fuse and see if it will hold the load.,If your home has aluminum wire, use a 15 amp fuse on 12 gauge wire and 20 amp fuse on 10 gauge wire.,If you have unplugged everything and the bulb at the panel is still lit, it is time to call an electrician for a more extensive trouble shooting job.","How to Find and Clear a Short on a ""Fused"" Circuit"," (Lights and appliances)
, A standard bulb will also work, but a 220 Volt bulb would be better., If you look at the bottom of the fuse, the amperage will be stamped into the center contact., (more on that later in this article)., The bulb should light up. It may or may not be bright, but it will be lit., Do this, one item at a time.,,, Insert a fuse of the same amperage as the original blown fuse.

Check for a diode check mode.,
Shut off power to the circuit.,
Select the diode check function.,
Identify the positive and negative sides of the diode.,
Test the forward bias of the diode.,
Test the reverse bias.",How to Test a Silicon Diode with a Multimeter1," Most digital multimeters have a diode check mode. To enable this mode, turn the dial to the symbol for ""diode:"" a black arrow pointing to a vertical line.


If your multimeter does not have this mode, test resistance instead.;
, Turn off all power to the circuit. Test voltage across the diode to confirm there is no charge. If the voltage reading is zero, continue to the next step.


If the power is off but there is still voltage, you may need to discharge capacitors in the circuit.This is highly dangerous and should not be attempted by novices.
If the diode is connected to other components in parallel, you may need to remove the diode from the circuit completely. This usually requires desoldering, then soldering it back once you're done testing.

, Turn the dial back to diode check mode. Confirm that the black (negative) lead is plugged into the port marked COM, and the red (positive) lead is plugged into the port marked V, Ω, and/or R. Touch the leads together and listen for a tone that indicates continuity. If you do not hear anything, double check that your multimeter is on and set up correctly. If you do hear a tone, the function is working. Continue to the next step.


This mode produces a current in order to measure the diode's voltage, but this current is too small to damage any typical component.

, The two ends of the diode have opposite polarity. The cathode, or negative end, is usually marked with a stripe. The anode, or positive end, is usually left unmarked. If your diode uses a different labeling system, look up the manufacturer's guide. Alternatively, conduct the tests and examine the results to determine which is the cathode.

, A forward-biased diode has a positive charge flowing from the anode to the cathode. Touch the red (positive) lead to the wire on the anode side, and the black (negative lead) to the wire on the cathode side. Interpret the results:


A result between about 0.5 to 0.8 volts means the diode is working.Some multimeters will also beep to indicate continuity.
A result of OL (overload) means the diode is opened, blocking all current flow. This diode needs to be replaced, but check the next test first. You may have hooked up your multimeter in the wrong direction.
A result of 0.4 volts or less means the diode may be shorted. Confirm this with the next test., A reverse-biased diode has a positive charge on the cathode side, and a more negative charge at the anode. Diodes are designed to prevent current flowing in this direction. To test whether this is working, just switch the position of the leads. The red (positive) lead should be next to the striped cathode, and the black (negative) lead should be next to the anode. Read the multimeter display:


A result of OL (overload) means the diode is successfully blocking the current.
A result of 0.5 to 0.8 volts means you've made a mistake. You are actually testing the forward bias. (The previous test you did should have a result of OL.)
If the forward-biased result was 0.4 volts or less, and this test gives the same result, the diode is shorted and needs replacement.
If the forward-biased result was 0.4 volts or less, but this test is successful (OL), you may be working with a germanium diode, not a silicon one.

Consult the relay schematic or data sheet.,
Do a basic visual inspection of the relay.,
Disconnect the power source.",How to Test a Relay1," Relays have fairly standard pin configurations, but it is best to search for the data sheets to find out more about the number of pins from the manufacturer, if available. Typically, these will be printed on the relay.Information on current and voltage ratings, pin configurations, and other information is sometimes available in the datasheets will be invaluable in testing, and eliminate most errors associated with testing. Testing pins randomly without knowing the pin configuration is possible, but if the relay is damaged, results may be unpredictable.
Some relays, depending on their size, may also have this information printed directly on the body of the relay as well.;
, Many relays have a clear plastic shell containing the coil and contacts. Visible damage (melting, blackening, etc) will help narrow down the issue.


Most modern relays have an LED to tell you if they are in the active state (ON). If that light is off and you've got control voltage to the relay or coil terminals (typically A1and A2 ) then you can safely assume that relay is bad.

, Any electrical work should be done with all power sources disconnected, including batteries and line voltage. Be especially mindful of capacitors in the circuit, as they can hold a charge for a considerable length of time after removing the power source. Do not short capacitor terminals to discharge.


It is best to check your local laws before performing any electrical work, and if you feel unsafe, leave it to the professionals. Extra low voltage work typically will not fall under this requirement, but it's still important to be safe.

Use this method when necessary.,
Set your multimeter to resistance mode.,
Plug in the leads.,
Disconnect the diode.,
Measure the forward bias.,
Measure the reverse bias.,
Compare to a working diode.",How to Test a Silicon Diode with a Multimeter2," This method of testing diodes is less accurate than the diode check function.Follow these instructions if you have an analog multimeter, or if using a digital multimeter without a diode check function.

, Turn the dial to resistance mode, usually marked with the ohm symbol Ω. On some older models, this may be labeled R. Choose a low range, such as 2KΩ or 20KΩ.Some digital multimeters are auto-ranging, and will only have one Ω setting.

, Plug the negative lead into the COM port. Plug the positive lead into the port labeled Ω or R.


On almost all digital multimeters, the red lead is positive and the black lead is negative.
An analog multimeter may use the red or the black lead as the positive lead. Check your manual to find out which setup your multimeter uses in resistance mode., A resistance test can give faulty results if the diode is connected to a circuit.Desolder the diode from the circuit for independent testing.

, Touch the negative lead to the cathode (the negative end of the diode, marked with a stripe). Touch the positive lead to the anode. A working diode should have a low resistance value in this direction (usually below 1KΩ).


If the result is 0, try lowering the resistance range on your multimeter dial. If the result is still 0, your diode may have broken down. The remaining tests can confirm this or rule it out.
The exact quantity displayed has no useful meaning for circuit design, as it is influenced by multiple factors.You may get a different result on a second multimeter, but it should still be in the same low range.

, Set your multimeter to a high resistance range, 200KΩ or higher. Reverse the position of the leads, so the negative lead touches the anode. Since diodes are designed to block current in this direction, the resistance should be very high. Most working silicon diodes should display a resistance in the hundreds of KΩ, or an overload reading (OL) meaning it is too high to measure.A result of 0 means the diode needs to be replaced.


No matter what the results are, the diode is broken if you get similar results in the forward and reverse direction.

, For best results, test a new silicon diode or a silicon diode you know is working correctly. If you get similar results, the diode is most likely functional. If you still encounter issues with your circuit, consider buying a multimeter with a diode check function for a more accurate test.


If your forward-bias result is 0 for both diodes, then your digital multimeter most likely isn't producing enough current for an accurate test. Try again with an analog multimeter."
"
Measure the forward voltage accurately.,
Understand Peak Inverse Voltage.,
Test a zener diode's PIV.",How to Test a Silicon Diode with a Multimeter3," The diode check function does not give enough current to find the actual forward voltage your diode will have in a circuit. To confirm that your silicon diode has the intended forward voltage (about 0.7V), set up a simple circuit to test it:Connect the positive terminal of a battery to a resistor.
Connect the other end of the resistor to the anode of the diode.
Connect the cathode to the negative terminal of the battery.
Measure the forward voltage across the diode.

, The PIV of a diode is the maximum reverse voltage the diode can withstand before it breaks down. Breakdown permanently destroys most diodes, so it is not practical to test this quantity. The exception is zener diodes, which are specifically designed to withstand excess current and regulate the voltage.


A typical silicon rectifier diodes has a PIV around 50V, but models are available that can withstand hundreds of volts.

, Zener diodes are used to maintain a specific voltage — so they aren't too useful if you don't know what that voltage is. Set up this circuit so you can identify this value:Find a variable power supply and confirm that it is turned off.
Connect the positive terminal of the power supply to a 100Ω resistor.
Connect the other end of the resistor to the cathode of the diode.
Connect the anode to the negative terminal of the power supply.
Connect the multimeter leads to measure reverse voltage across the diode (with the positive lead next to the cathode).
Set the variable power supply to its lowest setting and turn it on.
Gradually increase the power supply while watching the multimeter's voltage reading. Once the voltage stops increasing as power increases, you've found the breakdown voltage. Do not continue increasing the voltage, or the diode could be destroyed.

Determine the coil requirements of the relay.,
Find out if the control coil is diode protected.,
Assess the contact configuration of the relay.,
Test the de-energized condition of the relay contacts.,
Energize the relay.,
Check the energized condition of the relay contacts.",How to Test a Relay2," The manufacturer's part number should be listed on the case of the relay. Look up the applicable data sheet and determine the voltage and current requirements of the control coil. This also may be printed on the case of larger relays.

, A diode around the pole is often used to protect the logic circuitry from damage due to noise spikes. The diode will be shown on drawings as a triangle with a bar across one corner of the triangle. The bar will be connected to the input, or positive connection, of the control coil.

, This will also be available from the manufacturer's data sheet, or may be printed on the case of larger relays. Relays may have one or more poles, indicated in drawings by a single line switch connected to a pin of the relay.


Each pole may have a normally open (NO) and or normally closed (NC) contact. The drawings will indicate these contacts as connections with a pin on the relay.
The relay drawings will show each pole as either touching the pin, indicating a NC contact, or not touching the pin, indicating a NO contact.

, Use a digital multimeter (DMM) to test the resistance between each pole of the relay and the corresponding NC and NO contacts for that pole. All NC contacts should read 0 ohms to the corresponding pole. All NO contacts should read infinite resistance to the corresponding pole.

, Use in independent voltage source appropriate for the rating of the relay coil. If the relay coil is diode protected, make sure that the independent voltage source is connected with the proper polarity. Listen for a click when the relay is energized.

, Use a digital multimeter (DMM) to test the resistance between each pole of the relay and the corresponding NC and NO contacts for that pole. All NC contacts should read infinite resistance to the corresponding pole. All NO contacts should read 0 ohms to the corresponding pole.

Use an ohmmeter to check solid-state relays.,
Use a multi-meter in diode-test mode to confirm your findings.,
Keep SSRs cool.",How to Test a Relay3," When solid-state relays start to short, they will almost always fail. Solid-state relays should be checked with an ohmmeter across the normally open (N.O.) terminals when control power is off.The relays should be open, switched to OL, and closed (0.2 , the internal resistance of the ohmmeter) when control power is applied.

, You can further confirm that the relay is bad by taking a multi-meter, put it in diode test and checking across A1(+) and A2(-). The meter will apply a small voltage to make the semiconductor conduct and read that voltage on the screen. This will check the (typically NPN) transistor from the base(P) to the... emitter.


If its bad, the meter will read 0 or OL, but if the relay is good it will read 0.7 for a silicon transistor (which almost all of them are) or 0.5 for a germanium transistor (which are relatively rare but not unheard of).

, Solid-state relays are easy to troubleshoot, cheap to replace and last a long time if they stay cool. Typically, new relays come in DIN rail packages and block mountings.


There is also a special type of relay called an SCR that comes in two flavors for heating wires and IR lamps and ovens, usually for exquisite process temperature control. This is basically a fast switch on a much faster switch that can turn off and on, which fail often due to temperature fluctuations.

Confirm the integrity of the relay load connections.,
Apply power from a test power supply to the control circuit.,
Listen for the click.,
Determine the transition of the load connectors.,
Confirm the current carrying ability of the load connectors.",How to Test a Four Terminal Relay," The relay should not be tested while it is connected to the circuit. The relay is typically located in a place where larger electric parts are placed. In a car, this is likely a relay or fuse box. Use your fingers to unplug the relay from the socket in which it is placed.


Note the relay position. The positioning and polarity of relays and fuses should be printed on the inside of the relay box or fuse box cover. Note the position of the relay that was removed so that it may be replaced in the proper position and orientation.;
, The relay will have 4 pins; 2 will connect to the control circuit and 2 will connect to the high power load.


Identify the relay as an ISO mini type. The International Standards Organization (ISO) defines this type of relay as 1 inch (2.5 cm) square (25.4 mm square). ISO defines mini relays with the control circuit connected to pin 86 and pin 85, and the load circuit connected to pin 30 and pin 87 or 87a. There will be only 1 second load pin, 87 or 87a, not both.
Determine that the relay is an ISO micro type. The ISO defines this type of relay as 1 inch (2.5 cm) by 1 inch (2.5 cm) by 0.5 inches (25.4 mm by 25.4 mm by 12.7 mm). An ISO micro relay has the control circuit connected to pin 86 and pin 85, and the load circuit connected to pin 30 and pin 87 or 87a. There will be only 1 second load pin, 87 or 87a, not both.
Read the relay connections printed on the relay. The control circuit will be depicted as a coil of wire on the surface printing of the relay. The load circuit will be depicted as straight lines with a dot or circle on the end of one of the lines. If the 2 lines are depicted as not connecting at the circle or dot, the relay is a normally open (NO) relay. If the 2 lines are depicted as meeting at the circle or dot, the relay is a normally closed (NC) relay. It is important to know if the relay is NO or NC during further testing.
Determine if the relay is internally protected against voltage spikes. A relay with internal protection will have a diode symbol shown on the package drawing connected around the control coil. The diode symbol will be a triangle with a line attached perpendicularly to 1 of the points. The line shown on the diode symbol will indicated the positive polarity end of the diode.

, Use a digital multimeter (DMM) or analog ohmmeter to measure the resistance across the load connections of the relay. The reading should be open (infinite ohms) on an NO relay and short (0 ohms) on an NC relay. DMMs and analog ohmmeters are available in electronic parts and hobby stores.

, The voltage applied should be that of the rating of the relay. This rating will be indicated on the relay. If the relay has been determined to be voltage spike protected, positive power must be applied to the pin that connects to the positive polarity end of the relay internal diode. If the relay has been determined to not be voltage spike protected, the test power source may be connected to the control pins of the relay in either direction.

, When power is applied to the control circuit, a slight click should be heard as the relay activates.

, Use the DMM or analog ohmmeter to measure the resistance across the load connections of the relay. The reading should be short (0 ohms) on an NO relay and open (infinite ohms) on an NC relay.

, With the relay in the configuration that has the 2 load pins connected, place the test voltage on 1 of the load pins of the relay and an automotive test light on the other load pin of the relay. The automotive test light should light. Automotive test lights are available at auto parts stores and hardware stores.

Obtain a digital multimeter with ohmmeter capabilities in the range of resistance you wish to measure.,
Plug two test leads into the OHM terminals.,
It is possible to damage some sensitive circuits when taking an ohmmeter reading because there is a voltage from the internal battery applied to the Unit Under Test (UUT).,
Turn the meter on.,
To measure very high resistance (over 100,000 ohms), ensure that you are only reading the Unit Under Test.,
The accuracy for any digital device is the stated accuracy plus or minus 1 digit.,
To read low resistance accurately, some meters have a relative function.",How to Read a Digital Ohm Meter," Most multimeters cover it all except for extremely high (greater than 100 mega ohm or very precise low readings between 0 and 1 ohm, like 0.249 ohm). Many DMMs have auto ranging feature.;
, Sometimes they are separate from voltage or current terminals. Usually there are three terminals. Common, voltage/resistance, and current.

, For low ranges it is about 1.5v. For high ranges it could be 30V.

, Wait for it to reset itself. Select the resistance function and a range approximating what you expect to measure. Place each probe on both ends of the circuit. For example, if you are checking an electric fan you might put a probe on each terminal of the power cord to see if you get a low resistance when the power switch is on.

, If you are holding the probe tips and the UUT wires between your fingers the reading will be of the UUT and your body in parallel - ie. less than the UUT really is.

, If you are trying to read a 1.0 ohm on a 4 digit multimeter set to the 200 ohm range with a 1% stated accuracy you could be off 10% because of the plus or minus 1 digit. So it is important to use the lowest range that includes the resistance you are measuring.

, Short the tips of the probes by rubbing them together, and look at the reading. It will be between 0.1 and 0.5 ohm depending on your probes. Now press the relative button. The reading will go to zero. Now when you read the circuit, the reading will represent only the resistance at the probe tips. The probe wire resistance has been zeroed out.

, The unit for capacitance is the farad, which is abbreviated with a capital “F.” You may also see the Greek letter mu (µ), which looks like a lowercase “u” with a tail in front of it. (Because the farad is a large unit, most capacitors measure capacitance in microfarads; a microfarad is a millionth of a farad.)

,, Connect the positive (red) multimeter lead to the capacitor anode lead and the negative (black) lead to the capacitor cathode lead. (On most capacitors, especially electrolytic capacitors, the anode lead is longer than the cathode lead.), If the capacitance reading on the multimeter is close to the value printed on the capacitor itself, the capacitor is good. If it’s significantly less than the value printed on the capacitor, or zero, the capacitor is dead."

, Read the color of the right-most band. A gold band indicates that the actual resistance of the resistor will be within 5 percent of the value indicated by the coding. A silver band indicates that the actual resistance of the resistor will be within 10 percent of the number indicated by the coding. These values are important to calculate the variations that will occur from circuit to circuit randomly as more parts of the circuit are built.

, You should have a three digit number derived from the color bands. (Your resistor might have four bands in addition to the tolerance band, in this case just write down all four numbers.)


Change the last digit of the coded number to a number of zeros that are to be added to a base value indicated by the preceding numbers. For example, a coded number of 623 would require the addition of 3 zeros to the base value of 62, making the number 62000. If the third band had indicated that 0 zeros are to be added (a coded number of 620), then the number would become 62.

, For a 25V capacitor, you could use a voltage of 9 volts, while for a 600V capacitor, you should use a voltage of at least 400 volts. Let the capacitor charge for a few seconds. Be sure to connect the positive (red) lead from the voltage source to the positive (longer) capacitor terminal and the negative (black) lead to the negative (shorter) terminal.


The greater the discrepancy between the capacitor’s voltage rating and the voltage you’re charging it with, the longer it will take to charge. Generally, the higher voltage of the power supply you have access to, the higher the voltage ratings of the capacitors you can test with ease.,, Connect the positive(red) lead to the positive (longer) terminal and the negative (black) lead to the negative (shorter) terminal.

, This should be close to the voltage you supplied the capacitor with. If it isn’t, the capacitor is no good.

, You'll need to wire a current sense resistor into the circuit, or else use a current probe. Either should be connected to an oscilloscope.

, The peak current will be measured in amperes, while the time between pulses will be in microseconds.

, For example, if a voltage of 50 volts is delivered every 5 microseconds, this figure would be 50 times 5, or 250 volt-microseconds.

, Continuing the above example, if the peak current was 5 amperes, the inductance would be 250 volt-microseconds divided by 5 amperes, or 50 microhenries.


Although the math is simple, the setup for this method of measuring inductance is more complex than for other methods of measuring inductance.

Connect the inductor coil in series with a resistor whose resistance value is known.,
Run a current through the circuit.,
Monitor both the input voltage and the voltage where the inductor and resistor meet.,
Find the frequency of the current.,
Calculate the inductance.",How to Measure Inductance2," The resistor should be precise to within 1 percent or less. Wiring in series forces the current to pass through the resistor as well as the inductor being tested; the resistor and inductor should have 1 terminal touching.

, This is done with a function generator, which simulates currents the inductor and resistor would receive in actual use.

, Adjust the frequency until the junction voltage where the inductor and resistor meet is half of the input voltage.

, This is measured in kilohertz.

, Unlike calculating inductance from voltage and current, setting up the test is easier, but the math is more complicated. It breaks down as follows:


Multiply the resistance of the resistor by the square root of 3. If the resistor has a resistance of 100 ohms, multiplying by 1.73 (the square root of 3 to 2 decimal places), this value is 173.
Divide the result by the product of 2 times pi times the frequency. For a frequency of 20 kilohertz, 2 times 3.14 (pi to 2 decimal places) times 20 is 125.6; 173 divided by 125.6 equals, to 2 decimal places, 1.38 millihenries.
mH = (R x 1.73) / (6.28 x (Hz / 1000))
Example: given R = 100 and Hz = 20,000
mH = (100 X 1.73) / (6.28 x (20,000 / 1000)
mH = 173 / (6.28 x 20)
mH = 173 / 125.6
mH = 1.38

Wire the inductor coil in parallel with a capacitor whose capacitance is known.,
Wire the tank circuit in series with a resistor.

,
Run a current through the circuit.,
Place probes from an oscilloscope across the tank circuit.

,Sweep the function generator's frequency from its lowest to highest range.,
As you sweep, look for the tank's resonant frequency, where the oscilloscope registers the largest waveform.

,
Because an LC circuit's resonant frequency f in Hertz is f = 1/ (2 pi sqrt(L*C)), if you know the frequency f you can compute the inductance L = 1/((2 pi f)^2 * C).",How to Measure Inductance3," Wiring an inductor coil in parallel with a capacitor creates a tank circuit. Use a capacitor with a tolerance of 10 percent or less.

,, Again, this is done with a function generator.

,,,, For example, if the resonant frequency is 5000Hz, and the capacitance is 1 uF (1.0e-6 farad), the inductance is 0.001 henry, or 1000 uH."

Find out what the rating of the potentiometer is.,
Get an ohmmeter which you will set to a setting that is higher that your potentiometer’s total resistance.,
Take a closer look at the potentiometer.,
Take the probes of your ohmmeter.,
Turn the controller all the way to the other side.,
Take one of the ohmmeter’s probes off the end and put it on the wiper.",How to Test a Potentiometer," This is actually the total resistance measured in ohms and it can usually be found written on the bottom or the side.;
, For example, you can set the ohmmeter to 10000 ohms if the rating of the potentiometer is 1000 ohms.

, Locate the three tabs that should be sticking out of it. Two of those tabs are called “ends” while the third one is called a “wiper”. Most of the time, the two ends are located next to each other, while the wiper is somewhere else.

, Put them on the two ends of the potentiometer. What you see on the display should be within only a few ohms of the potentiometer’s rated resistance (see Note below). If the reading is way off, then that means that you have put one of the probes of the ohmmeter on the wiper. If you find it difficult to tell which tabs are the ends, and which tab is the wiper, try different combinations with the probes until you get a proper reading.

, Make sure to keep the probes in constant contact with the ends while doing this. The resistance should stay the same or only change very slightly.


The actual reading may not be exactly what the potentiometer is rated for. These devices typically have a tolerance of 5-10%. Tolerance may be listed on the device but not always. The reading you get should not be outside of that range (e.g. a 10,000 ohm device rated 5% should read between 9500-10500 ohms).

, Now you have to turn the controller slowly all the way to the other end and watch the ohmmeter while doing so. When you reach the end, the resistance should only be a few ohms. At the other end the value should be the maximum resistance of the potentiometer. The resistance should gradually and slowly increase as you turn the controller and there should be no sudden jumps.

Set the multimeter range.,
Connect the probes to the multimeter.,
Carefully insert the probes.,
Read the voltage.,
Remove the probes.",How to Measure Voltage1," Turn the dial to the AC side of the multimeter, then set the potential voltage range to the highest potential voltage you might test.



AC stands for ""alternating current."" Outlets in the United States use AC voltage, so you'll need to set the multimeter to measure AC voltage when testing an outlet. This side of the range will usually be labeled with an ""AV"" or ""~V.""
Standard outlet current is between 110 to 120 volts, but some heavy-duty outlets used for dryers, air conditioners, and other large equipment may have voltage between 220 and 240 volts. These outlets should be identifiable by their non-standard outlet plugs, however.You should always set the voltage range so that it can measure slightly higher than the expected amount of volts. If you set the range too low, you may end up overloading and damaging the multimeter.;
, Connect the black probe to the ""COM"" or ""-"" port and the red probe to the ""V,"" ""mAV,"" or ""+"" port.


You'll need to connect the bent banana jack end of each probe to the multimeter. The straight probe tips will be applied to the outlet.
Some multimeters may have three ports: 10A, COM, and mAV. Always plug the black probe into the COM port. Connect the red probe to mAV for low currents up to 200 mA, but connect it to the 10A port for high currents. For a standard wall outlet, use the low current (mAV) port., Grab both probe tips on the insulated portion beneath the metal pin. Insert the black probe into one of the straight outlet slots, then insert the red probe into the other.


Only grab the probes by their plastic insulator bases. Do not touch the metal tip during any part of the process.
After inserting the black probe, slowly release it. It should remain in the outlet without being held in place. If it doesn't, try inserting the black probe into the outlet again.
As soon as you insert the red probe, the multimeter should give a voltage reading.

, Read the voltage shown on the multimeter. If using a digital meter, the voltage should show on the display screen. If using an analog meter, you will need to examine the scale and identify the voltage based on where the needle lands.


In most cases, the scale should read between 108 and 121 volts.
If the voltage is higher or lower than expected, you may need to call a professional electrician to inspect the circuitry and identify any possible problems.

, Carefully grip both probes by their insulated bases and pull them straight out of the outlet.


Work carefully. Do not touch the metal tips with your bare hands and do not allow them to come into contact with one another.
After removing the probes, turn the multimeter knob down to its lowest range and switch the device off.

"
Set the multimeter range.,
Connect the probes to the meter.,
Touch the probes to the battery.,
Take the reading.,
Remove the probes.",How to Measure Voltage2," Turn the voltage dial to the DC side of the multimeter. Set the voltage range so that it is a little higher than the expected voltage.Most batteries use ""DC,"" or ""direct current,"" voltage. When measuring any battery or any device run by a battery, you'll need to switch the multimeter to this setting. It is usually labeled with a ""DC"" or ""-V.""
The correct range will vary depending on the type of battery being tested. For instance, if you're testing a standard 1.5V alkaline battery, you will need to set the multimeter to a range of 2V DC. Most automotive batteries are 12V batteries, though, so you'll need to set the multimeter to a range just above 12V DC.
Note that if you set the range too low, you run the risk of overloading the multimeter and damaging the device.

, Your multimeter should have a black probe and a red probe. Black is negative and red is positive, so you should plug the black jack into the ""COM"" or ""-"" port and the red jack into the ""V,"" ""mAV,"" or ""+"" port.


Make sure that you connect the banana jack end of each plug to the multimeter. The straight probe tips on the other end of each wire will by touched to the battery.
Some multimeters may have more than one port. In these instances, the black plug will always be connected to the COM port, but the red plug may need to be connected to the mAV port for low currents (up to 200 mA) or the 10A port for high currents. When testing most batteries, use the low current mAV port.

, Touch the black probe tip to the negative side of the battery, then touch the red probe tip to the positive side of the same battery. Hold the two in place until the multimeter displays a measurement.Make sure that you only grab the insulator base of either probe when testing the battery voltage. Do not touch the metal tips.
The multimeter should display a measurement almost instantly once the two probe tips are in place. If no measurement appears, make sure that both metal tips are placed directly over the correct terminal. Reposition as needed and try again.

, Read the voltage displayed on the multimeter. When using a digital version, the voltage should appear on a digital display screen. If you use an analog meter, however, you'll need to examine the scale and identify the position of the needle as you continue to hold the probes in place.


Don't be surprised if a new or recently charged battery has a voltage that is higher than it is labeled for. For instance, some 1.5V batteries may actually read between 1.5 and 1.6 volts. The labeled voltage usually signifies the average number of volts you can expect from the battery throughout its lifetime, not necessary the highest amount it is capable of.
If the voltage reads as ""1,"" it means that the range is too small to measure the battery. Increase the range to a higher setting and try again.
If the voltage reads as a negative value, you may have the probes connected to the wrong terminals. You will need to try again, touching the probes to the opposite terminals when you do., After you've measured the voltage, simply pull the probe tips away from the battery terminals and set them aside.


Make sure that you continue to handle only the insulated base of each probe. Avoid touching the metal tips, and avoid letting the metal tips come into contact with each other.
After setting the probes aside, turn the knob on the multimeter down to its lowest range. You can then switch the device completely off.

Purchase a multimeter.,
Prepare the amplifier to be measured.,
Set the multimeter to the appropriate mode.,
Touch the multimeter's test leads to the amplifier's speaker terminals.,
Analyze the result of your reading.",How to Measure DC Offset," A multimeter is a handheld device for measuring electrical current, resistance, or voltage. Multimeters are available in either digital or analog models, and can sport a variety of different features. The important consideration when choosing a meter to measure DC offset is the lowest available voltage range.


Because DC offset readings will be quite small (usually under 100 mV), you need a meter with a small range (sensitivity) so that the readings will register correctly. A meter with a 200 or 400 mV range is ideal, but a range of 2 V will also work.;
, To achieve an accurate DC offset reading, you need to follow a few set-up steps.


Begin by disconnecting the speakers. As an alternative, you can take the readings from the ""B"" or ""remote"" terminals and set the speaker control switch accordingly.
Set the amplifier's input selector switch to an unused position such as ""Aux."" Do not set it to ""Phono.""
Set the volume dial to minimum, the tone dials in the middle position, and the balance dial in the center.
Turn on the amplifier and let it sit for at least 10 minutes before taking a reading.

, The meter should be set to measure DC voltage (not current). Set the range of the meter to its smallest setting (200 mV is ideal); if you have an auto-ranging meter you won't need to perform this step. Make sure the test leads are plugged into the jacks used for measuring voltage.

, To measure the amp's DC offset, begin by touching the black test lead to the negative speaker terminal. Next, touch the red test lead to the positive speaker terminal. Hold both leads in place while looking at the reading on the multimeter's face. After taking the reading, reconnect the speakers and set the controls back in their desired positions.

, The ideal amount of DC offset is 0, which results from a perfectly balanced AC sine wave. In reality, an offset between 0 and 20 mV is very good. An offset between 20 and 50 mV is slightly higher than the ideal range, but the distortion caused will barely be audible. A range from 50 to 100 mV will begin to cause noticeable degradation of the audio quality, while an offset over 100 mV may cause permanent damage to your speakers.

This should be the large flip switch located above or below all the other smaller ones. It should also be labeled ""main"" or something similar. The main breaker typically has the largest amperage rating of all the breakers in the panel.

,, If there is evidence of rust, charring, discoloration, moisture, or other contamination, DO NOT proceed, and call an electrician immediately., The safety of these panels is highly debated. Research the issue, and contact an experienced electrician for advise. Decide what to do based upon the information you find., Wear insulated lineman's gloves and use insulated lineman's tools. Wear rubber-soled shoes and safety glasses, and stand on a rubber mat., If there is water or another liquid present, do not proceed. Call a licensed electrician immediately. Also, be sure that there is plenty of clearance above, below, to the sides of, and in front of the panel., Use the left hand rule when opening the panel to prevent injury in the event of an arc flash.

,, Look for signs of rust, moisture intrusion, pest intrusion, loose wires, melting, discoloration, charring, heat marking, multiple wires under one screw, aluminum wiring, wiring with damaged insulation, knob and tube wiring, strange modifications, debris, and multiple colored wires connected to each other. If ANY of these conditions are found, or if another type of strange thing is found, do not proceed.

Carefully remove insulation.,
Use only connectors rated for the type wire.,
Use correct terminal temperature ratings.,
Use terminals rated for the size of the wire(s).,
Torque all screws, terminals and lugs to specified rating.,
Use an oxide inhibitor on aluminum wires and cables.,
Trim any excess exposed wires as needed.,
Replace insulation as needed.,
Mark the conductors.",How to Connect Electrical Wire," Remove only enough as required by the connector, terminal, etc. for connection. A ""strip gauge"" is often provided near the terminal of devices (switches, outlets, etc.) and should be checked before striping insulation. Additionally, the packaging of wirenuts and other connectors usually indicate how much insulation should be removed from a wire or cable. It is very important not to nick the wire in the insulation striping process. The size of the wire is critical, and a nick can create a hot spot whenever the circuit is loaded. This resulting spot expands and contracts with each heating and cooling cycle, and over time, effectively loosens the connection. Removing too much insulation increases the likelihood of accidental contact with something other than intended. Accidental contact can result in arc flashes, shock, burns and even loss of life.
, Connectors, terminals, lugs, etc. have a rating for the type of wire material i.e.: copper (CU) or aluminum (AL) and copper clad - aluminum. The connector will bear either the ""CU"" or ""AL"" mark. A third mark, ""CU/AL"" indicates the connector is suitable for either copper or aluminum. Never mix copper and aluminum conductors in a single terminal, unless it specifically designed for the mix.

These typically are a special design used to connect an aluminum and copper wire together so that a short copper jumper or pigtail may be connected to a CU rated terminal. These were common in the 70's when aluminum wiring was used to supply 15 & 20 amp circuits in residential and some commercial structures. It was learned that aluminum wire wasn't well suited for connection to the terminals on common outlets and switches.
Use of a copper jumper connected between the screw terminal of the switch or outlet and the building's aluminum wire via special connector solved this problem. Manufacture of aluminum wire for these purposes has ceased and now aluminum wire and cable is manufactured in larger sizes for connection to an electric range, service equipment and other high current uses. Terminal ratings are for wires made of either CU (copper only) or CU/AL (copper OR aluminum but not both at the same time).

, Once the correct CU or AL terminal has been chosen, make sure the required temperature rating of the wire is met by the terminal. A wire or cable with a 90 degree Centigrade (or C) rating may have been installed to take advantage of the higher current carrying capacity or ""ampacity"" rating provided over a similar cable with only a 75 or 60 degree rated cable insulation. All the terminals to which the wire will connect must meet the 90 degree C minimum rating as well, otherwise the ampacity of the wire will be reduced. This reduction may require a larger size wire or cable to replace the original. Cost of higher temperature terminals increase - while the availability goes down., Simply stated, unless indicated otherwise, only one wire is permitted to be terminated under a terminal (such as those on bus bars, switches, outlets, etc.), unless specifically designed to connect 2 or more (such as wirenuts, split bolts, etc.). Additionally, it is not permissible to split strands of wires or cable so that they may be terminated under more than one terminal or screw. The correct sized terminal for the wire or cable to be connected must be used., All of these prerequisites are for naught if insufficient pressure is applied. Use a torque wrench if need to obtain the proper pressure. Simple terminals on switches and outlets should be made tight - but if unsure, it is better that these be over tightened than under., Commercially available inhibitors are usually sold wherever aluminum wire is offered. The packaging explains how to prepare the wire and how to apply. Typically, a freshly stripped wire need not be ""wire brushed"" unless it is oxidizing already. Oxidation of aluminum metals appears as a white or gray flaky or dusty residue on the surface. Clean with a wire bristle brush to remove the residue completely. Apply a liberal coating of oxide inhibitor over the entire surface of the exposed aluminum. Try to force it between the strands and the end of the wire. Do not leave so much inhibitor on the wire so that it will drip off. Remove enough excess inhibitor to prevent this from happening before inserting into the terminal., There is no need for a great deal of the conductor to hang out of a terminal. Any part of the stripped wire that is not touching the surface of the terminal, connector, etc. is doing nothing to help maintain conductivity of the circuit or its mechanical strength, and should be removed. Leaving just enough of the wire to be visible (up to 1/4 inch) out of any lug, terminal or split-bolt so as to allow the wire to be determined that it is connected very quickly. No stripped portion of conductors should be visible outside of wirenut type connectors. The non-conductive skirt at the open end of the wirenut provides insulation to any part of the conductor that may have been stripped slightly too much., Some connectors such a ""split bolts"" and ""burndys"" are uninsulated, and must be insulated to protect them from accidentally contacting other conductors and people. The general rule of thumb is to place at least the same amount of tape on these connectors as is on the wires and cables that enter them. Vinyl electrical tape is not very thick, so a thick rubber filler tape designed expressly for this application can save a great deal of time spent wrapping tape. Use the filler tape to provide 75% to 95% of the thickness of the wire's insulation on the connector and use the vinyl electrical tape to finish to 100% thickness. Make sure the tapes evenly cover the entire surface of all exposed metal of the connector and wires or cables., Larger cables usually only come in black jacketed insulation. It is important to identify these conductors with colored tape or paint depending on location. Painting is often done when exposed outdoors such as at a weather head for an electrical service, but tape is still very popular here too. In the U.S. use black, red, blue, identify line voltage cables, white for grounded neutrals and green for equipment grounds and bonds in 120 / 240 volt systems only. Use brown, orange and yellow for line voltage cables, gray for grounded neutral and green for equipment grounds and bonds in 480 / 277 volt systems only."

You'll save time if you can refer to your car's manual (or find the manual online), look up the location of the fuse that controls the part of the car that lost power, and check it directly. If you don't have the manual, check these common locations for a large box, or a group of exposed fuses:Most cars have one or two fuse boxes under the hood, next to the engine or battery. There may also be a fuse box inside the car, so keep looking if the fuse you're looking for isn't here, or if all the fuses here are fine.
Newer cars often have a fuse box underneath the dash in an easily accessible location. Check the ceiling of the glove box for a hinge that swings downward. You may need a flat-head screwdriver to open the lid.
Older cars often have their fuses in an open box to the left of the brake pedal or the foot-operated parking brake. It's difficult to examine the fuses closely in some models, so bring a flashlight and/or hand mirror.
Less commonly, the fuse box is located in the trunk or under the rear seat.;
, If you are checking the fuses in your home, look for a fuse box or circuit box in closets, basements, laundry rooms, or on the outside wall of the house. If you live in an apartment or shared home, the fuse box may be located in a neighbor's apartment.

, If you are checking the fuses in a central air conditioning unit or another appliance, check the user manual to find out where they are. For some appliances, you may need to shut off the power to the device before you can safely access the fuse box.

, Car fuse boxes often have a diagram on the outside or inside lid, and always in the car's user manual. This can save you a lot of time, since you can check the one fuse that protects the radio (or other nonfunctional system) instead of all 40+ fuses. Home fuse boxes are often unlabeled, but typically only have a few fuses, so it's easy to test them all


Find your car's user manual or fuse box diagram online here or with a general online search. You'll need to know the make and model of your car.

, Don't remove the fuse yet, as this can be dangerous if the power is still connected, and can cause minor problems to connected systems if you remove a still-functioning fuse. Instead, look closely at each fuse while they are in place.

, A fuse can look completely normal and still be blown (and in need of replacement), but more often than not there will be a visual sign that will guide you to the problem fuse. Fuses come in three basic forms:

Transparent cylinders (glass or plastic) have a wire running through the middle. If the wire is broken, the fuse is blown. If the whole cylinder is scorched black or brown, the fuse is blown and there may be a major short on the circuit that needs repair (especially if the replacement fuse blows after a short time).






The two-pronged chip fuses often used in cars have a U-shaped wire running between the prongs, inside the plastic. If the wire is broken, the fuse is blown, but it's often difficult to tell.






Opaque cylinders (covered by a solid metal coating) must be tested by other means.







, If checking an indoor fuse, you can turn off the main power to the house and remove the fuse to get a closer look. For any type of fuse, if you are still unsure, you can move on to the next section. If you have identified the problem fuse, skip ahead to replacing the fuse.


This step is not recommended at this stage for car fuses, since removing the wrong fuse can negatively affect idling performance, diagnostic information, or accessories., You can purchase this tool at a hardware store or electronics store. Select a ""computer safe"" model with an LED light in the handle, or with an incandescent bulb powered by a battery or power outlet. Never test car wiring with an old-style test light with an incandescent bulb that draws power from the circuit, or you could trigger the airbags and cause massive damage.Alternatively, if you have a multimeter, skip down to the instructions below to use it instead.

, Follow these steps to check the fuse with a test light:Clamp the black grounding lead to an electrically conductive object (such as anything metal).
Turn the ignition to run, or make sure the main power supply is on if testing a house fuse.
Touch the red probe near one end of the fuse, then the other. (For small two-pronged fuses, the two prongs are the two ends of the fuse.)

, If the fuse is good, the bulb in the test light will light up both times. If it does not light up on one end, the fuse is blown and needs to be replaced.If neither end lights up, there is no current running to the fuse box, or your black lead is not grounded, or the light bulb has burned out. Correct this problem and try again, or use a multimeter instead.

, Turn off the ignition to the car, or the power leading to the home fuse box. Pry the fuse out on one end, then the other. You may need tweezers or needle-nose pliers to remove the fuse, or a similar tool sometimes attached to the lid of automobile fuse boxes.


If you plan on testing more than one fuse in a car's fuse box, take a photograph first so you know exactly where each fuse goes.

, Most digital multimeters have a continuity setting, which is labeled with a series of parallel arcs: ))). Turn the dial to this setting, then place the two probes at opposite ends of the fuse. If you hear a constant beep while they are touching the fuse, the fuse is still good. If you don't hear anything, the fuse is blown.


If your multimeter has no continuity option, or you would like to double-check the result, continue on to test resistance.

, This setting looks like the Greek letter omega: Ω. The resistance setting sends a small current through the fuse, and tests how much current goes through. We don't really care about the exact resistance reading, but if the fuse is blown, we won't get any resistance reading because the current will not be able to pass through the broken wire.


If you have an analog multimeter, there are multiple Ω settings. Choose the one that says Ωx1.Old models sometimes say Rx1 instead.

, Touch the two metal probes together and look at the multimeter display. This number (or needle position) is what the multimeter currently ""thinks"" is a resistance of 0. If we get a result near this number when testing the fuse, the fuse is still good.


Your multimeter probably has a dial (analog multimeters) or a button (digital) that lets you calibrate this back to 0. You can do this if you plan on using the multimeter a lot, but it's not necessary for this task.

, Touch one probe to each end of the fuse, while looking at the display. If the display doesn't change when you touch the fuse, the fuse is blown and needs to be replaced. If the number or needle position moves to a similar position to the one you saw when both probes were touching, then the fuse is still good and can be popped back into the fuse box.

, Whenever you are removing a fuse or putting in a new one, make sure the power supply to the fuse box is off. For a car, this means turning off the ignition.

, These are available at hardware stores, electronic shops, or auto supply stores (for car fuses). Bring along your old, blown fuse so you can compare the size and other characteristics, as described below.

, Replacing a fuse with the exact same type of fuse is very important. Most importantly, check the amp rating, normally a number written on the fuse, and purchase a replacement fuse with the same rating. Each fuse is designed to blow at a specific number of amps; this is its entire purpose. If you use too low an amp rating, the fuse might blow during normal use and short the circuit. If you use too high an amp rating, the fuse won't blow during a power surge, and the less replaceable parts of the circuit will be damaged instead.


Transparent, cylindrical fuses come in two types: fast-blow (a straight wire), or slow-blow (a coiled wire). Don't put in a slow-blow unless the old fuse was also a slow-blow, or the fuse may not be able to prevent damage quickly enough., Modern fuses should pop in easily with a little pressure. Old, glass fuses sometimes need to have one end pushed in first, then the other."
"
Determine that a fuse has opened (blown) by inspecting the metal link through the glass.,
Figure out what kind of fuse needs replaced.,
As mentioned above, another method to check fuses requires a continuity tester or ohm meter.",How to Change an Electric Fuse," You may have to open a door, but you do not need to remove covers.;
,


For the screw-in type glass and type ""S"" tamperproof fuses:

If unable to visually inspect the metal link, use of a voltmeter, wiggy or neon test light should resolve the problem by following the steps below (they may also be checked via continuity test light, this procedure is detailed further below).
While holding one probe or lead of the test equipment (meter, wiggy or light) to an unpainted exterior metal part of the fusebox, touch the other probe to the metal thread of the fuse holder / fuse. This is done by pushing the probe along the outside rim of the fuse until it contacts the aluminum or copper metal in to which the fuse screws in.
If you get an indication of power (120 volts indication or lamp) this is not the fuse that has opened. Continue checking the rest of the fuses by removing the probe from the the fuse tested, and repeating the procedure for the next fuse.
A fuse that does not test to 120 volts or does not fully illuminate the lamp, is a likely candidate for replacement (meters are always preferred over test lamps as a lamp may not provide enough of a change in brilliance that can be detected by eye).
Remove the fuse in doubt by turning it counter-clockwise.
If the fuse has ceramic or plastic threads and two small copper contacts under the head of the fuse, they are type ""S"" tamper-proof fuses. These fuses are a two piece protection system consisting of a threaded insert that is installed into the fusebox (like a regular glass fuse) and the the fuse itself that is installed into the insert. The fuses and inserts have different threads for the different values of fuses. The threads are such that they prevent installing a fuse with a value other than intended to protect the circuit (it is impossible to to put any fuse other than a 15 amp type ""S"" tamperproof fuse in a 15 amp insert, etc). The type ""S"" tamperproof fuse system removes the guesswork and danger of installing the wrong value fuses.
The standard glass fuses, like the type ""S"" tamper-proof counterparts, are available in 15, 20 and 30 amps values. There are also 10 and 25 amp, but are not very common.
To properly select glass replacement fuses, the cover of the fusebox should be removed. The 15 amp fuse is to protect #14 gauge copper wire, 20 amp fuse protect #12 copper wire, and 30 amp for #10 copper wire. These are the most common wire sizes in the fuse box. The #14 is the smallest wire connected to a glass fuse and the #10 is the largest wire connected to a glass fuse. There will probably only be (2) #10 wires, (4) #12 wires and the rest #14 wires. The #14 are used for general lighting and plugs throughout your house - except for those plugs in the kitchen, dining room, clothes washer & dryer. The #12 are for plugs in the kitchen, dining room, clothes washer and specialty or dedicated appliances such as larger room air conditioners, etc.. #10 may be used to feed an electric clothes dryer, electric water heater or another small panel elsewhere - garage, etc. These are estimates - all panels and homes differ, and this should only be considered a starting point.
You will see larger wires connected to the MAIN and RANGE fuse holders, and possibly wires that connect to 2 terminals at the bottom of the fuse block. These are usually used for an electric water heater or small panel elsewhere. Don't worry if you don't see these wires.


For the cartridge fuse types:

Generally, cartridge fuses do not have any visual indicator when they open. They must be checked with a voltmeter ""in circuit"" or with an ohm meter or continuity tester ""out of circuit"".
Many old fuse boxes provide for MAIN and RANGE fuse holders. The MAIN is designed for (2) 60 amp 250 volt fuses, and the range is designed for (2) 40 amp 250 volt fuses. With the fuses and the holders still in the fusebox, touch one probe to an unpainted metal surface of the fusebox. Locate the four small holes on the fuse holder, and press the other probe into the hole until it stops. Check for power indication. Repeat procedure for remaining 3 holes for this fuse holder. The holes align with the metal caps of the fuses, and should indicate power present at ALL four holes. Any hole without a power indication corresponds to an open fuse directly behind the hole under test.
Check the orientation of the fuse holder by looking for the ON and / or OFF indicators in the middle of the short sides of the fuse holder.
Remove the fuse holder by firmly pulling it straight out.
Remove the fuse in question and replace it with a maximum of a 40 amp fuse for the RANGE fuse holder or 60 amps for the MAIN fuse holder. You must use fuses rated for 250 volts.
Return the fuse holder to the fusebox observing the orientation of the holder (if you get it wrong, simply remove it, rotate the holder 180 degrees and reinsert).



, A continuity tester is similar to a test light, but that this light has its own power source (battery) as part of the tester. It must never be connected to another power source - the way a neon test light would. Regardless of the method used (ohm meter or continuity tester), the procedure is the same, after preparing the tool for use.


Continuity Test Light and Ohm Meter Method

Set the ohm meter to Ohms (R x 1 or R x 10 scale) / Turn the continuity tester on.
Put the meter probes onto the ""Common"" and ""Ohms"" jacks on the meter. Touch the opposite ends of the probes to each other. The meter should move to zero or close to it. Find the thumb wheel on the meter marked Ohms Adjust or Zero Adjust. Move the wheel to make the needle of the meter align with 0. The continuity light is checked by touching its probes together. The light on it should illuminate.
Remove the fuse to test from the panel completely. All fuses must have a way for electricity to enter and exit. Cartridge fuses have these points at the ends of their body. They may be tested without removing them from the fuse holder. Placing the fuse or fuse in the fuse holder on a non-conductive surface, and touch a probe to each end. A zero reading on the meter or light on the continuity tester indicates a good fuse. Glass fuses have these points located at the center of the bottom of the fuse and the threaded sides (just like a light bulb). Touch the probes to these points to test the fuse. Again, we're looking for a zero reading or the continuity light to illuminate. Lastly, the type ""S"" tamperproof fuse points are the center bottom (like the glass fuses) and any copper contact point(s) on the underside of the top of the fuse.

Select the correct bender.,
Measure the desired length of the stub.,
Subtract the take-up height.,
Line the arrow mark on your bender to this measurement.,
Press down on the foot pedal to bend the conduit.,
Confirm the bend with a spirit level (recommended).",How to Bend EMT Conduit1," Make sure your bender is designed for EMT conduit of the size you are using. Even a universal bender may require attaching a shoe and/or follow bar designed for EMT.This article focuses on hand benders. If you are using a hydraulic or power bender (recommended for conduit with a nominal size over 2 inches), find instructions for your specific bender model.
Hickey benders tend to crush or kink EMT conduit. Use a bender with a curved track for the conduit to slot into.;
, A stub up bend is a 90º bend near the end of the conduit. Measure the distance on the wall from the end of the conduit to the position of the bend.

, The radius of the bend will add extra length to the bent end of your conduit. Take this into account by subtracting a certain amount from your measurement:If you are using ½"" EMT conduit, subtract 5"" (12.7 cm).
¾"" conduit: subtract 6"" (15.2 cm).
1"" conduit: subtract 8"" (20.3 cm.
1¼"" conduit: subtract 11"" (27.9 cm).

, Place your conduit on the floor. Measure from the end of the conduit to the new length you calculated, and mark the conduit at this point. Line the arrow symbol on your bender up so it points to this mark. Slot your bender onto the conduit. Make sure the bender handle is angled toward the end you measured from.


If your bender does not have an arrow symbol, you may need to find the instructions for your

, Your foot should provide most if not all of the pressure. Without pulling, use one hand to steady the handle on your bender, and the other to steady the conduit end once it rises within reach. Apply firm, constant foot pressure, as a pause could create a kink in your conduit.Bend until the end of the conduit is vertical, or very slightly past vertical.


If your conduit is 1¼"" or larger, you may need an assistant to operate the handle.

, Attach a level to the vertical length of conduit. If necessary, make small adjustments to the bend until the bubble of the level is centered. The conduit will flex back slightly after you remove the bender, so bending slightly too far will provide the best results."

Make a stub up bend.,
Measure the distance the conduit needs to fit between.,
Mark this distance on your conduit.,
Line the star symbol on the bender to this mark.,
Bend the conduit.",How to Bend EMT Conduit2," ""Back to back"" refers to a distance from the back of one 90º bend to the back of the other. In other words, this is the distance between the two parallel lines of a U bend, measuring from the outside edges. To create the first bend of the U, follow the instructions above for a stub up bend.

, Measure the distance the two bends need to fit between, such as the distance between two parallel walls., Place the bent stub end of the conduit against a wall. Measure from this wall along your conduit, to the desired length. Mark the conduit at this length using a permanent marker or pencil.

, Unlike the placement for the stub bend, the bender's handle should be pointed away from end you measured from. For bends like this, line the star symbol on your bender head up with the mark.If your bender does not have a star symbol, refer to your bender's instructions.
If the distance between the bends is too short for your bender, use the stub up system instead. In other words, turn your bender the other way, subtract the take-up distance described in the stub-up section, and line the conduit up with the arrow mark instead.

, Place the length of conduit you measured flat on the floor. Apply firm pressure on the foot pedal until the conduit bends to a 90º angle. Checking this angle with a level is highly recommended, since it's important that the two bends of the U are parallel.

Flip the conduit and bender upside down.,
Roll the conduit 180º.,
Create the second bend by hand.",How to Bend EMT Conduit3," An offset bend requires you to bend the conduit in two places at opposite angles, usually between 10 and 45 degrees. Use this to shift the conduit to avoid an obstacle or change elevation, the continue in its original direction.

, Measure the distance between the two parallel locations where the conduit will run before and after the bend. Measure at right angles, not along the bend. Always measure between two identical positions on the conduit (base-to-base, center-to-center, or top-to-top).Do not rely on the nominal diameter of your conduit, which is slightly smaller than its actual size., As a general rule, the shorter the offset distance, the smaller the angle. An offset of a few inches can use a 10º or 22.5º angle, but an offset of several feet may call for 30º or 45º.Smaller angles will ""use up"" less of your conduit, but may be more difficult to bend precisely. If your conduit layout requires precise measurements, calculate the amount of shrinkage, or additional length required for the bend:A 10º angle uses an additional 1/16"" of length per inch of offset depth.
A 22.5º angle uses 3/16"" per inch of offset depth.
A 30º angle uses ¼"" per inch.
A 45º angle uses ⅜"" per inch.
A 60º angle uses ½"" per inch.
To find the total shrinkage, multiply the offset depth in inches by the shrinkage value above.

, Find the total shrinkage using the instructions in the previous step. Add this number to the distance from the end of your conduit to the obstacle. Mark the conduit at this length.Here's an example for a conduit you plan to bend at a 30º angle to overcome a 10"" step:


The shrinkage for a 30º angle is ¼ inch per inch of rise. (See previous step.)
Multiply ¼ by 10 inches of rise: ¼ x 10"" = 2.5 inches. This is the total shrinkage.
Let's say the conduit will run from an electrical box 40 inches from the step. Add this distance to the shrinkage: 40 inches + 2.5 inches = 42.5 inches.
Measure 42.5 inches from the end of the conduit and mark it with a marker or pencil.

, Each angle has its own offset multiplier, listed below this step. Multiply this value by the offset depth to get the length between your two bends.For a 10º angle, multiply the offset depth by 5.8.
For a 22.5º angle, multiply offset depth by 2.6.
For a 30º angle, multiply by 2.
For a 45º angle, multiply by 1.4.
For a 60º angle, multiply by 1.2.
Some benders list the offset multipliers on one side of the head, directly opposite the corresponding angles on the other side. These may not match the numbers above perfectly due to rounding.

, Place the tape measure against the first mark you made, for the far bend. Measure back toward the end of the conduit, until you get to the length you calculated. Mark the conduit at this spot, the position of the near bend.Follow this example if you're having trouble with this step:


Return to the earlier example of a 30º angle up a 10"" rise.
A 30º has an offset multiplier of exactly 2. Multiply the offset depth (10"") by 2 to get 20"".
Place the tape measure against your first mark, 42.5"" from the end (calculated in the steps above).
Measure 20"" toward the end of the conduit and make another mark. This is the position of the other bend.

, Place the conduit on the floor. Line up the arrow on your bender with the mark farthest from the end you measured from. (This is the first mark you made.) Slot the bender onto the conduit, and apply steady foot pressure to bend the conduit. Watch the degree mark on the side of your bender that matches the angle you chose. Continue bending until this mark touches the horizontal portion of the conduit.Position the bender so the foot pedal is between the two marks.
For example, if you plan to bend at a 30º angle, bend until the 30º mark touches the edge of the conduit.
You can use any mark on your bender instead of the arrow, as long as you use the same mark to create the second bend. A different mark may be more convenient for bends near the end of the conduit., To prepare for the second bend, leave the bender attached to the conduit. Pick up the bender and place the handle end on the floor, leaning it against your leg to keep it stable. Slide the bender back toward you until the arrow lines up with the second mark on your conduit.

, Without taking it out of the bender, rotate the conduit exactly 180º. Sight along the conduit to make sure the bent end lies along exactly the same plane as your bender. If the bend is sticking out to one side, your conduit will not lie flat.You may lean the bent end down against the ground to support it.

, Brace the bender handle against your foot and leg. Confirm the arrow on the head still lines up with the mark you made. Grip close to the bender head and pull slowly down until the conduit touches the desired angle mark on the bender.


The farther away you hold the conduit, the less accurate the bend will be. Grip as close to the mark as you can without making the task unreasonably difficult."
"
Familiarize yourself with other bends.,
Mark the position of the center bend.,
Mark the positions of the two other bends.,
Bend the center.,
Complete the saddle bend.",How to Bend EMT Conduit4," A three-point saddle bend raises the conduit in a triangle to clear a narrow obstacle. This requires calculations and techniques described above in the offset bend method.

, The three-point saddle includes one bend to lift the conduit off the floor, a second bend to bend it down over the obstacle, and a third bend to make the conduit level with the floor again. Calculate the position of the center bend as though it were an offset. For example, conduct these calculations for a 30º–60º–30º saddle, the easiest setup to memorize:


A 30º creates ¼"" shrinkage for each inch of rise. Multiply ¼"" by the height of the obstacles in inches to find the total shrinkage.
Measure the distance from the desired position of the conduit end to the center of the obstacle.Add these two values together. Measure this length from the end of the conduit and mark it.

Note: Many benders only have a teardrop mark to show the position of a 45º saddle bend. In this case, a 22.5º–45º–22.5º saddle is the easiest type to bend.

, Calculate the distance between bends as you would an offset. Measure this distance twice, starting from the center mark and measuring in both directions.


For example, since a 30º angle has an offset multiplier of 2, a 3"" high obstacle requires bends 2 x 3"" = 6"" apart. Draw a mark 6"" to the left of the center mark, and another mark 6"" to the right of the center.
Instead of calculating this by hand, you can look up a Three-Point Saddle chart online to give you these values., Most benders have a teardrop mark used for the center of a 22.5º–45º–22.5º saddle.Others may have three notches or marks along the rim, next to a ""center bend"" mark that looks like a semicircle with an arrow at the center. These three notches correspond to 30º, 45º, and 60º angles.Line up the appropriate mark with the center mark on your conduit, and bend until the conduit touches the correct angle mark on your bender.

, Turn the conduit over and brace the handle against your foot, as you would to finish an offset bend. Rotate the conduit exactly 180º in the bender so your bend is in the correct direction. Line up the arrow mark on your bender with one of the marks on your conduit, and bend to exactly ½ the angle of the center saddle bend. Repeat for the third bend of the saddle.

Shut off your main power breaker before beginning any actual electrical work.

",How to Add a Subpanel1," Minor electrical changes generally do not need a permit, but each jurisdiction varies. In some areas, permitting is required for any type of Electrical work, no matter the size in scope or significance. This work however, would by no means ever be considered ""minor"".


When you meet with the building code representative, ask about the inspection schedule so you know when to call for a rough inspection as well as a final inspection. Many localities have part time inspectors, so if you're on a schedule you should discuss it with them first.;
, You will need light to work on your project after you shut off the electrical power to the building.

, If space is an issue, you don't need to install it next to the main panel. However, you must be able run wire through to that area. Keep in mind that a closet is not an acceptable location for a panel. The area 3 feet (0.9 m) in front of and above and below the the panel should be clear from the floor to the ceiling.


If you install your sub panel closer to the rooms you are adding power to, you will use more of the larger sub-feed cable between the two panels; but fewer smaller wires to the outlets than if you installed the sub panel close to the main panel.

Always turn the circuit breaker off first, before doing anything else. Use a non-contact voltage tester to check before moving forward.;
, To install a new electrical outlet and make the connections safely, you'll need a few basic electricians' tools. Make sure you have access to the following:


Wire strippers
Drywall knife
Drill with a wood drill bit
Pair of lineman’s pliers
Screwdriver, finishing and Philip’s head
Non-contact voltage tester

, Measure the distance off the floor to the other outlets in the building. Be aware the bottom of the cover plate is not the distance you want to measure. Turn off power in the outlet. Take off the cover plate held on by the single screw in the middle of the outlet and measure to the hole cut in the wall.

, In most homes, there are 2x4 or 2x6 studs typically at 16"" or 24"" increments along any wall. Outlets must always be attached to a stud for security and safety. Mark a space at the appropriate height, at a location between two studs.


The easiest way to locate studs if to use a ""stud finder"" available at many hardware stores. You can also try tapping the wall lightly with a hammer and moving slowly across the wall and listening closely. The wall will sound hollow for most of the taps and then sound ""solid"" when you have reached a stud.

, Check for plumbing from sinks showers or toilets on the opposite side of the wall. Be aware of any HVAC air returns or ducts.


If there is a grill high up or at the bottom of the wall where you want the outlet, you can't do it with the air return in the same wall space. Explore with a nail hole and hanger. Poke a hole and use something like a wire hanger to ""feel"" around inside the wall cavity to check.

, There are two basic ways to install a new electrical outlet, running electrical wiring from a circuit breaker to the new location, or from another outlet in the same room. Depending on where you're installing a new outlet–living space, basement, or outdoor area–access to power may vary. Find the closest and most convenient place to connect to make the job easy on yourself.

, To open up enough space to work, you'll need to cut a 12x12 piece of drywall out of the wall near the receptacle, preferably above it. You'll also need to cut a new hole, roughly the same height, at the location where you want the new outlet. This can be somewhat smaller: 2.5-in. x 2 inches (5.1 cm) to account for the new cut-in box.


To make your cuts, use a strong utility knife and make small and firm incisions over and over until you have cut through the wall material. Walls made with plaster may require you to drill holes into the corners and cut the hole with a hole saw.
You also might have to cut one other hole in between two locations depending on how far they are apart. In general, you want to have access holes every 3 feet (0.9 m) so it’s easier to thread the wires through the wall manually.

, Once you have access to the locations, get your Romex non-metallic wire. For residential jobs, the appropriate size of wire is 14/2, rated for 15 amps. Give yourself a foot to 18 inches (45.7 cm) of wire sticking out on both ends. Wire the new receptacle first and then go back and connect the new wire to the existing circuit. Cut jacket off Romex about 8 inches (20.3 cm) long.


You should use wire that is proper for the power rating of that circuit and of the same size as the wire you are connecting too. Take a sample of the existing wire with you when you go to purchase the new wire.

, After you run the wire between the two locations, make your connections and wrap the wire. Purchase the outlet from a store and connect the wires to receptacle. Inside the wire, there are three conductors, typically black, white, and green with no insulation. On the receptacle itself, there are two brass screws, two silver screws, and green screw. It's typically good practice to wrap the wire and connections with electrical tape, just to keep everything from touching. Screws and wire should all be wrapped.


The green wire should be connected to the copper wire with no insulation. Hook it around and tighten green screw down.
The white wire needs to be stripped ¾-inch off end of wire. Bend a hook on the end of the wire, put hook around one of silver screws and then tighten screw down. The other silver screw isn’t used.
The black wire goes to the brass screw. Do the same thing: strip the wire, make a hook, and tighten the screw down.

, The outlet box should be firm on the wall and not be able to be wiggled around. This is used to house the loose wires and keep them wrapped and secure for safety purposes. These are available at all home repair outlets.

, Go back to starting outlet and connect the wires. Take the existing receptacle and remove it from the wires, then match up the black wires with black, white with white, and ground with ground.


Cut an 8-inch pig-tail (stubby piece of wire) and strip off both ends 3/4s of an inch. Take all three black wires together so the ends are matched up. The end of the new wire should meet the end of the old wire, and one end of pigtail.
Get a wire nut (plastic cone) that just screws onto the wire to connect them. The three black wires should be able to connect with one wire nut, and the same goes for white and ground wires. Take the other end of the pigtail and attach it to the screws the same way as before: green goes to green, white goes silver, black goes to bronze.
Older houses might have different types of wires, so you may need to consult an electrician if yours don’t match up.

, You'll only need two screws on the device, to screw directly into the box. The outlet itself should then be screwed directly onto the box with the screws included.


Once you put the device in, fasten the wall plate using a screw and put all the wires into the receptacle to tidy up the job. Screw the cover plate onto the wall and repair any holes you made in drywall, if necessary.

, The circuit should remain on and the fuse should not pop if you've installed the wires correctly. Test the outlet with a lamp, or some other low voltage device.


If the fuse does pop, or the power doesn't work, turn the power back off and pull the connections back out to check them. It's likely a wire or two came loose in the maneuvering process, and should be reattached accordingly.
Be very careful that you turn the power back off, before you check, if there's some kind of problem. If the circuit's on, there should be power, which means that you've got to be very careful.

, Most household circuits are 15 amps, and it's a good idea to test the circuit to make sure the new circuit won't overload it. Most electricians will do this after installation, to make sure the new circuit isn't stressing the source. To do this, you'll need to use a voltage tester, connecting between the terminal screw on the breaker, and the other on the ground. Don't touch the neutral wire.


For most circuits, the maximum power available should be 1800 watts for everything on this circuit, but it's usually common to reserve about 20% in case you need to plug a high-watt appliance into the outlet. Try to keep it around 1400 watts max, to leave you a good safety margin.

Attach the hot wires (black and red or blue) to the main breaker lugs of the sub panel.
Take the time to tidy up the wires and connections so that you can easily trace them back to their breaker if the need arises in the future.

, This will ensure that the neutral and ground are connected at the main panel and not the sub panel.


The buss bar bonding jumper can be identified as a long screw or metal strap that effectively bonds the neutral buss bar to the grounded panel enclosure / ground buss bar.

, Do not interchange ground and neutral wires in the other's buss bar. Install the breakers.

,, Check to see if all the circuits are working.

, You will not pass an electrical inspection unless you complete this step.

Select the right tool for the size of the heat shrink tubing you want to expand.,
To stretch larger tubing, use a combination of two pliers to expand the tubing as shown in this illustration.,
Insert the tweezers or pliers into the tubing as far as possible.,
Pull the pliers apart slowly to open up the ends.,
Stretch the tubing only a little at a time to avoid tearing or puncturing it.

,
Close the tweezers or pliers and rotate the tubing slightly.

,
Repeat steps 2 through 5 until you have rotated the tubing enough to return to your starting point.

,
Flip the tubing to so that the other end of it fits over the tweezers or pliers, and repeat the above steps.

,
The tubing is now ready for use.

",How to Expand Heat Shrink Tubing,"
Most smaller tubing is easy to stretch with needle-nose pliers. If possible, find a pair with extended ends to accommodate longer sections of tubing.;
,


Extremely small tubing calls for tweezers with needlepoint tips, such as LTD's Tweezerman models.







, Make sure the tool used is completely closed.

, If using tweezers, use a jeweler's screwdriver to help pry the tweezers apart.

Choose your tool.,
Shut off the power.,
Discharge the capacitor carefully.,
Disconnect the capacitor.,
Set the multimeter to measure capacitance.,
Activate REL mode if present.,
Connect the leads to the capacitor's terminals.,
Wait for the result.",How to Measure Capacitance," Even cheap digital multimeters often have a capacitance setting ""–|(–."" These are good enough for basic troubleshooting, but are not typically accurate enough to rely on precise measurements. They do give accurate results for most film capacitors, since these behave more like the ideal capacitors your multimeter's calculations assume.If accuracy and precision are important, consider an LCR meter. These tools can cost several thousand US dollars, but have several reliable ways to test capacitance.


This guide focuses on multimeters. LCR meters should come with a detailed instruction manual specific to your device.
ESR meters (equivalent series resistance meters) can conduct tests on capacitors while they are in a circuit, but do not measure capacitance directly.;
, Turn off the power to the circuit. Confirm that the power is off by setting your meter to test for voltage. Place the leads on opposite sides of the circuit's power source. If the power was successfully shut off, the voltage should read zero.

, A capacitor can hold charge for several minutes after the power is disconnected, or even longer in rare cases. Connect a resistor across the capacitor terminals so the charge can drain safely. Make sure the resistor is up to the task:For small capacitors, use (at least) a 2,000Ω resistor rated for 5 watts.
Large capacitors found in appliance power supplies, camera flash circuits, and large motors can hold a dangerous or lethal amount of charge. Experienced supervision is recommended. Use a 20,000Ω, 5 watt resistor attached via 12 gauge wire rated for 600 volts.

, Testing while the capacitor is part of a circuit can give very inaccurate results, and potentially damage other components. Remove the capacitor carefully, desoldering the connection if necessary.

, Most digital multimeters use a symbol similar to –|(– to signify capacitance. Move the dial to that symbol. If several symbols share that spot on the dial, you may need to press a button to cycle between them until the capacitance symbol appears on the screen.If your tool has several capacitor settings, choose the range that fits your best guess for the capacitor's correct value. (You can read the capacitor's label to get a rough idea). If there is only one capacitor setting, your multimeter can automatically detect the range.

, If your multimeter has a REL button, press it while the test leads are separated. This will zero out the capacitance of the test leads themselves, to avoid interfering with the measurement.This is only necessary if measuring small capacitors.
On some models, this mode disables auto-ranging., Note that electrolytic capacitors (most commonly shaped like cans) are polarized, so identify the positive and negative terminals before you connect the multimeter's leads. This may not matter much for your test, but you'll certainly need to know this before using the capacitor in a circuit.Look for any of the following:A + or - next to a terminal.
If one pin is longer than the other, the long pin is the positive terminal.
A colored stripe next to a terminal is an unreliable marker, since different types of capacitor use different standards., The multimeter will send out a current to charge the capacitor, measure the voltage, then use the voltage to calculate the capacitance. This process can take several seconds, and the buttons and display screen may be slow to respond until it's finished.An ""OL"" or ""overload"" reading means the capacitance is too high for the multimeter to measure. Set the multimeter to a higher range if possible. This result can also mean the capacitor has shorted.
An auto-ranging multimeter will test the lowest range first, then increase if it hits an overload. You may see ""OL"" appear on the screen multiple times before you see the final result.

Measure the length of conduit you’ll need.,
Calculate the amount of extra conduit you will need.,
Cut the conduit to the size you need, removing burrs from the cut end of the conduit.,
Work with a bender, which is an essential of any conduit bending project.,
Slide the conduit into the bender leaving the appropriate amount past the arrow on the bending shoe.,
Pull the bender handle toward you to create the bend.,
Bend until your bender reaches the 90° mark or other desired corner angle.,
Check to make sure your bend is the right angle by either holding it up to the wall or using a level held snuggly against the front side of the pipe.,
Learn how to air bend in a pinch.,
Use the correct-sized bender for the type of conduit you're using.,
Use a level and protractor to double-check the correctness of measurements.,
On conduits with multiple bends, take your time to make sure the bends are aligned.,
Experiment with different kinds of bends.",How to Bend Conduit," Start from a corner or other orienting point, then measure from the corner to where the conduit will end (usually a converter box). Place a pencil mark on the conduit at the measurement where the corner should be.






;
, When you bend conduit, you lose length as the conduit is bent in the direction of another plane. The amount of conduit you’ll need for the corner depends on the diameter of the conduit. A ½-inch (1.27 cm) pipe requires 5 inches (12.7 cm) of extra conduit, ¾-inch (1.905 cm) conduit takes 6 inches (15.24 cm) and a 1-inch (2.54 cm) conduit pipe requires 8 inches (20.32 cm).








, Use a conduit reamer or knife to scrape the edges to get rid of any fragments, or burrs.








, The tool should fit the correct sized conduit tube that you need to use. Before you start the bending process, locate any instructions on the conduit bender that may describe how much conduit should remain past the bend to the end of the bending shoe. If there are no instructions on the bender, follow the standards (as listed above) for the size conduit you are using. As you'll see, the bender should have three or four distinctive features:









The 90° mark. This is the point at which a bent conduit has reached a right angle. It is one of the most commonly used angle marks.
Other angle marks. Common angle marks include the 10°, 22.5°, 30°, 45°, and 60°.
Stub height mark. This mark will usually list a number (like 6 inches) to use for the bender take-up.

, Set the conduit on a level, firm ground and place your foot firmly on top of the foot of the bender. The top of the pipe should come through the bender, so your foot should be able to steady it as well.








, Use a firm and steady motion to avoid kinks or crimps in the conduit. Make sure your foot and hand remain securely on the bender; any small slip in the conduit can cause an off-centered bend, and you will need to start over with a new piece of conduit.









Be aware that when you bend, you may need to overbend slightly to compensate for any spring back in the conduit. Do this slowly and carefully.

, Most benders include marks for 15°, 30° and 60° as well.








, You can also hold it to a surface you know is level to check it.








, Most of the time, you'll use your bender and the floor to bend the conduit. But sometimes, especially if you're doing a more complicated bend, like a back to back bend or an offset bend, you won't be able to use the floor as a fulcrum. If you need to use an airbend to twist your conduit, here's how:









Put the hilt of the bender on the ground. Secure it in place with both feet or another reliable anchor.
Keep the bender straight and let your body apply the pressure to the conduit. Don't try to use the bender to airbend.
Make sure the head of the bender stays rigid as the conduit bends into the cradle.

, While it's tempting to think that your bender is a one-size-fits all tool, it's not. Be prepared to use or buy a bender for each different type of conduit you need to bend. ½"" conduit, for example, shouldn't be bent using a 1"" bender.








, Don't be afraid to use a water level and protractor to measure your angles with certainty. Of course, sometimes getting the exact angle on a bend isn't important; but often, whole conduit systems will be thrown out of whack if just a single angle is off 5°.








, Be careful about creating a dog leg when you shape conduit. A dog leg is where multiple bends on a line don't line up in the same plane.Examine the alignment in all directions before bending off.








, A typical electrical job will require more than simply a 90° stub-up bend. In fact, there are dozens of different combinations of bends you can use. It's helpful to experiment with bending a couple of them. Remember that practice makes perfect!









Back to back bends. Two 90° stub up bends on opposite sides of the conduit, with both stubs moving in the same direction.
Offset bends. Almost a sidewinder pattern, this bend incorporates two 45° angles in order to shift the conduit beside an obstacle but still run in parallel with the old line.
Three- and four-point saddle bends. A variant of the offset, where the 45° bend returns back 45° after clearing an obstacle. A four-point saddle offers more clearance than a three-point saddle.

Examine the electric panel.,
Multiply the amperage by 0.8.,
Understand double-pole breakers.,
Compare this to the current on the circuit.",How to Determine Amperage of Circuit Breaker1," Each circuit breaker should have its amperage marked on the handle. This is the maximum amperage that circuit can take before the circuit breaker trips.


In the United States, standard household circuits are rated for 15 amps, or 20 amps for newer homes and high-load circuits.;
, For everyday use, it's a good idea to expose the breaker to a maximum of 80% of the rated amperage. It's fine to exceed this for short periods of time, but continuous current above this amount could trip the breaker.


Your electrical panel might have a note about the breakers operating at 100% of the rated value. If it does, you may skip this step.

, Some high-voltage devices may be wired to a double-pole circuit breaker — two standard circuit breakers sharing a handle. Do not add together the amperage of the two breakers. This circuit will still be tripped by the amperage displayed on one circuit breaker handle.

, Now you know how much amperage your circuit breaker can handle. To find out whether your circuit exceeds this amperage, continue on to the next method."
"
Determine the maximum power that will be drawn on the new circuit.,
Select the proper gauge conductor for the maximum current of the circuit.,
Purchase the correct circuit breaker.,
Run the electrical cable for the new circuit.,
Place a rubber mat or sheet of plywood (or other dry wood) in front of the service panel and stand on it while working in the panel.

,
Open the cover of the service panel and turn off the main breaker.

,
Note the location of unused circuit breaker spaces in the service panel cover.,
Remove the service panel cover.

,
Measure the voltage to verify that the power is off in the service panel.,
Choose the location in the service panel for the new circuit breaker.,
Locate a circular knockout on the top, side or bottom of the service panel box that is convenient for entry of the new circuit cable and for routing conductors inside the box to the new circuit breaker location.,
Install a cable clamp in the circular hole in the service panel box with the clamp on the outside of the box.,
Route the cable to the new cable clamp.

,
Identify the location on the cable that will extend approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) inside the cable clamp.,
Wrap electrical tape around the ends of the conductors to hold them together.,
Determine whether your service panel has separate neutral and ground bus bars.,

",How to Add a Breaker Switch," Divide the total number of watts by 120 (or 240 for a 240-Volt circuit). The result is the maximum current, in amperes (amps), for the circuit.;
,


Select a 14 AWG conductor for a maximum current up to 15 amps.
Select a 12 AWG conductor for a maximum current up to 20 amps.
Select a 10 AWG conductor for a maximum current up to 30 amps.
Select an 8 AWG conductor for a maximum current up to 50 amps.

,


You must use a circuit breaker that is approved for use in your service panel. In most cases, you must use a circuit breaker made by the same manufacturer as that of the service panel.
Select a circuit breaker with a current rating that does not exceed the rating of the circuit. For example, if a circuit is wired with a 12 AWG conductor, only use a circuit breaker rated for 20 amps or less.

, Allow for sufficient cable at the service panel to route the cable to the entry point in the box and then from that point to the farthest destination in box. As a rule of thumb, allow for a length of cable that is 2 to 3 times the height of the box.

,,, You must install the new circuit breaker to line up with a pre-punched knockout in the cover.

,, Place one probe of a voltmeter on the neutral bus bar and place the other probe on the supply bus bar (the bus bar to which the existing circuit breakers are attached). If the voltmeter does not read 0, the power in the service panel is not off and you should not proceed.

, Remove the knockout.


Use a hammer and screwdriver to bend the knockout. Grasp the edge of the knockout with pliers and bend it back and forth until it breaks loose.

, For safety reasons, select a knockout that is not in close proximity to the live service wires that connect to the main circuit breaker. Remove the knockout.

, Use a screwdriver to open the clamp as far as possible.

,, Strip off the outer jacket of the cable from this point to the end of the cable.


Use a utility knife to carefully cut down the middle of the cable jacket.
Peel the jacket apart and pull it off the conductors back to the point where you began your cut.
Cut the jacket off with a utility knife.
Remove the paper that surrounds the bare copper ground wire.

, Route the conductors through the cable clamp until 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the jacketed cable extends through the cable clamp. Tighten the cable clamp. Remove the electrical tape holding the conductor ends together.

,


Your service panel has separate neutral and ground bus bars if all of the white wires are routed to one bus bar and all of the bare (or green) ground wires are routed to another bus bar.
Your service panel does not have separate neutral and ground bus bars if the white and ground conductors are connected to only 1 bus bar.

, Cut off any excess conductor with the wire cutter. Loosen a screw in the bus bar, insert the conductor through the hole and firmly tighten the screw.

, Cut off any excess conductor. Use a wire stripper to remove approximately 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) of insulation from the end of the conductor. Loosen a screw in the bus bar, insert the wire in the hole under the screw and firmly tighten the screw.

, Cut off any excess conductor. Strip approximately 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) of insulation from the end of the conductor. Loosen the screw on the circuit breaker and insert the end of the black wire under it and then firmly tighten the screw.


If you are installing a double-pole breaker for a 240-Volt circuit, connect the black wire to either screw connector on the circuit breaker and connect the red wire to the other screw connector.

,


Set the new breaker switch to the off position.
Route the black wire that is connected to the breaker switch from the cable clamp to the location where you will install the breaker.
Hold the circuit breaker at an angle and align its connection point with the rail, clip or slot in the service panel.
Press the other end of the circuit breaker into place. Some brands will click into place; others will not. To assure that the breaker is properly installed, verify that it is level with the adjacent circuit breakers.

, Use a circuit tester or plug in an electrical appliance to test the new circuit.

Consider the bandwidth range.,
Evaluate the rise time.,
Ensure that the sample rate is 5x your circuit’s highest frequency.,
Ensure that the probes match up to the sample rate.,
Confirm your oscilloscope has enough input channels.,
Look out for versatile triggering capabilities.,
Make sure you have standard USB 2.0 ports and enough memory.,
Shop from an ISO certified vendor.,
Use compatible software.,
Be wary of PC interference.",How to Choose a USB Oscilloscope," Depending on what you use the oscilloscope for, the range of the bandwidth it can process should be the primary consideration. The reliable rule of five is something to stick to. According to this rule, the instrument’s bandwidth should be capable of measuring a maximum of five times the amount of bandwidth that you could possibly require. This will ensure that frequencies are captured up to the crucial fifth harmonic, a decisive factor in determining the shape of the signal.
, Rapid transitions can potentially be lost if rise time measures are not up to scratch. So, the faster the rise time, the higher the accuracy of measurement for those rapid transitions. The rule of five can apply here too, meaning the oscilloscope should be less than 1/5 times the fastest rise time of the signal being measured., A sample rate to an oscilloscope is a frame rate to a camera. It is the regularity with which the oscilloscope captures waveform details. The rule of five applies here too, so, your required sample rate should be five times that of your circuit’s highest frequency. Also pay attention to the minimum sample rate if your requirement is monitoring signals that change slowly and over a length of time. Remember that a faster sample rate means more memory consumed in the recording of the signal, so your device’s memory must be up to the task as well., Having the most top-of-the-line oscilloscope with the massive bandwidth and sample rates won’t help much if the probes aren’t up to the challenge as well. Because probes are the primary instruments for measurement in an oscilloscope, if they aren’t of the same grade as the rest of the device, the whole process becomes futile. So make sure your probes match up to the bandwidth and sample rate requirements for optimal performance., The more input channels your oscilloscope has, the more data it can process. Obviously, the price of the oscilloscope will increase for these higher input channel devices, but there’s no point skimping for a oscilloscope that doesn’t have enough input to carry out whatever tasks you require it for., Triggering stabilizes the display of signals to the naked eye, making for more comfortable and accurate viewing. While edge and pulse width triggering is a common offering among oscilloscopes, it is worth looking for one that offers a wider ambit and a greater versatility in terms of triggering capabilities while deciding which particular product you want to lease or purchase., When data is transferred from oscilloscope to a PC, this is done through available input solutions such as a USB port, while solutions such as PCI and LAN ports were used earlier. Time taken to complete data transfer will vary depending on the capabilities of your onboard USB port’s speed. Data storage capacity too will depend on hard disk space available, so make sure you have at least the current standard USB 2.0 ports on any PC you will use the USB oscilloscope with, and you have enough memory to support extended length data transfers., Having globally recognized certification is important as it guarantees the quality and reliability of the product to a certain degree. As TRS-RenTelco explains, “ISO/IEC 17025:2005 is becoming the main standard used by testing and calibration laboratories. There are many commonalities with the ISO 9001:2008 standard, but ISO 17025 adds the concept of competence to the equation.”So vendors that have been recognized and accredited for their quality are clearly preferable., Any hardware linkup to the PC requires compatible software for the operation to function. This means a USB oscilloscope must come bundled with matching software as well, and that software should be user friendly and easy to navigate through, for maximum comfort and speed while using the device., If your requirement is low-level signal resolution, then it is important to be wary of the interference run from the power-supply and circuit – electromagnetic noise generated from the PCs components. The measurement process must be shielded from these interferences so as to acquire a high degree of accuracy when dealing with low-level signals."

Find the wattage of a device.,
Check the voltage on the circuit.,
Divide the wattage by the voltage.,
Repeat for each device on the circuit.,
Add the amperages of devices that are always running.,
Add additional amperages.,
Measure amperage directly with a clamp multimeter (optional).",How to Determine Amperage of Circuit Breaker2," Pick any device attached to the circuit you're investigating. Find the wattage (W) listed on the data plate — usually on the back or underside of the device. This is the maximum power rating of the device, which can be used to calculate amperage.


Some devices will list the amperage directly, often labeled FLA. If it does, skip down to the next section to interpret that rating.

, For household circuits, you can usually assume your house follows the voltage standards of your country. (For example, 120V in the US, or around 230V for most of the EU.) If you think you are working with an exception, using a multimeter.

, The answer will be the amperage the device draws on your circuit. For example, a 150 watt device on a 120 volt circuit will draw 150 ÷ 120 = 1.25 amps.

, Perform the same calculation for each other device on the circuit, or at least the ones with the highest wattage. Write down each answer next to the name of the device.

, Take the continuously running devices, or the devices that run for more than a couple hours at a time. Add their amperages together. If the result is more than 80% of your circuit breaker's rated amperage, plug one of the devices into an outlet on a different circuit.

, On top of the continuous amperage, add the amperage of other devices that might be on at the same time. If any combination gets above 100% of the circuit breaker's rating, it will trip the circuit. You can solve this by moving a device to a different circuit, or by remembering not to use high-power devices at the same time.


Electrical circuits never operate perfectly. Some of the energy is lost to heat, and devices may draw more current to make up for this. Waste is low in most household circuits (below 10%), but it is still possible to trip the breaker if the amperage on paper is slightly below the breaker rating.

, A clamp multimeter (or clamp ammeter) has a pair of ""jaws"" at the top that close shut to encircle a wire. When set to measure amps, the device will display the number of amps running through that wire.To test a circuit, expose the wire leading to the load side of a circuit breaker. With the clamp multimeter set up as described, have a friend turn on other devices in the house. If the device is on the same circuit, you will see the amperage display increase.


Do not attempt this unless you have electrician's gloves and a basic understanding of electrical safety. These wires are live and can be very dangerous.

Look for the data plate.,
Check the device's voltage rating.,
Look for the FLA.,
Check the LRA.,
Take other devices into account.,
Use the MCA and MOP ratings for an air conditioning unit.",How to Determine Amperage of Circuit Breaker3," All appliances should have a data plate with electrical information. Look on the back or underside of the device, or check the product manual. The information on this plate will help you determine how many amperes the device draws, and therefore the rating you will need for the circuit breaker.


This section covers devices that list the amperage directly on the data plate, which should include all appliances with a motor. If your device only lists wattage (W), calculate the amperage from that value.
This is not an appropriate method to determine safety features to protect the motor itself.The circuit breaker protects the wiring of the electrical supply.
High-power devices such as air conditioning units and ovens are best installed by a trained electrician.

, The amperage drawn depends on the voltage of your electrical circuit. The intended voltage (V) of the device should be listed so you can confirm that it matches your electrical system. If the device can run at two different voltages, it will usually list two values like this: 110V/240V. In this example, if you were running the device on a 110 volt supply, you would only refer to the first number listed on each line.


Most electrical codes allow a ± 5% tolerance for the voltage (or slightly more).Do not run a device on a voltage supply outside this range.
Household outlets in the US and some other countries are on a 120V standard. Most of the world uses 220–240V., This is the number of amps the motor will draw at the rated horsepower. In the United States, if this device will be left on for more than three hours, the circuit breaker should be rated at 125% of this value. (Multiply the FLA by 1.25.) This allows for additional load due to other factors, mainly heat.This value may also be listed as full load amperage, running amps, rated amp, or just amps.Some circuit breakers are rated to 100% of the listed amperage, meaning you can skip the 125% calculation. This information will be clearly listed on the circuit breaker electrical panel if you have this type of breaker., The LRA, or locked rotor amps, is the amount of current drawn when the motor is not turning. This is required to start the motor, and can be much higher than the FLA.Modern circuit breakers are designed to allow this brief surge of current. If your circuit breaker is rated high enough for the FLA but still trips when the device is plugged in, it could be a faulty breaker, or just an old model. Move the device with high LRA to another circuit or have an electrician inspect your wiring.


Do not confuse this with the RLA, a value listed on air conditioner units.

, If multiple devices are running on the same circuit, add them together as follows:


If your circuit breaker is rated at 100%, just add all of the amperages together.
If your circuit breaker is rated at 80% or you do not know its rating, add the amperages of all devices running for more than three hours at a time and multiply by 1.25. Add to the result the amperage of all devices running for shorter periods of time.
In either case, if the answer exceeds the circuit breaker amperage, move a device to another circuit.

, These values are rarely listed except in North American air conditioning units. The Minimum Circuit Amperage tells you the minimum wire size necessary for safety. The Maximum Overdraft Protection is the highest circuit breaker amperage allowable. When in doubt, use the MOP value when choosing a circuit breaker to avoid unnecessary breaker tripping.These values are often surprising if you do not have HVAC experience, and are further complicated by new technologies that allow for lower amperage than MOP implies. Consider hiring a professional if you are not experienced in the area.

Determine the amperage rating for your digital multimeter.,
Select the appropriate function on your multimeter.,
Set the range on your multimeter.,
Plug the leads into the appropriate terminals.,
Run the circuit through the multimeter to measure the current.,
Turn off the breaker and use an AC current sense probe to make sure AC is off and then and only then rewire the circuit.",How to Measure Amperage," A multimeter is a small hand held device that can be used to measure voltage, resistance, and amperage. Each model will only be rated to handle a certain amount of current, and this rating needs to be adequate for the electrical system you want to test. For example, running 200 amps through a multimeter rated for 10 amps will ruin the multimeter's fuse. The amperage rating will be printed on the unit or in the owner's manual.;
, Most multimeters have functions for measuring several different quantities. To measure amperage, you need to set the function to either measure AC amperage or DC amperage, depending on the electrical system you are testing. The power source for your system will determine the type of current. For example, household power is AC, while power from a battery is DC.

, To ensure that you don't blow your device's fuse, set the maximum amperage sensitivity to well above your expected reading. You can adjust this downward if the multimeter does not read anything when hooked into your system.

, Your multimeter should come with 2 cords, each with a probe on 1 end and a lead on the other. Plug both cords into the correct terminals for measuring amperage; the owner's manual will specify the correct terminals if they are not labeled clearly.

, This is extremely dangerous and can cause electrical shock if measuring household AC or other high voltage or high amperage sources or even lower sources. Turn off all breakers before working with this and use an AC current sense probe to see if AC is absolutely off before touching any wires especially bare ones. Do not work in a wet environment on even a high humidity one. This can conduct electricity and hurt you. Wear heavy rubber gloves. Additional precautions may be necessary. Consult a real electrical workbook (not an online source) before attempting this. Assume wires can have missing insulation from accidental damage during installation or old age. Missing insulation can cause electrical shock. Always have someone ready with a cell phone who is not touching you who can call an Emergency number in case of worst case scenario. This person should also be trained in first aid and CPR. If electrical shock occurs, this person may have to remove you using some type of insulated material (a dry article of clothing for example but something else may need to be used) or else that person will also undergo shock due to the conductivity of skin and maybe some clothing (and other materials). Always consult a real electrical safety book before attempting this and know what type of signal you are dealing with. Consult a real electrical manual before attempting this about the dangers involved and how to prevent them (not an online source). Clip the wire in a single spot and strip back the insulation on both exposed ends. Secure these ends separately to the leads of the amp meter. Only do the measurement after the wires are securely attached to the amperage meter probes. Make sure these wires especially the exposed ends cannot touch you. Turn back on the breaker and adjust the meter sensitivity if no reading is produced.

, Follow the precautions outlined in step 5 and consult a real electrical book (not an online source) for safety precautions. After taking your reading, you will need to complete the broken circuit again. It is much safer to do this by buying and installing new wire rather than trying to patch the area where you cut it.

,  The measurement window will default to voltage.  We will be measuring the voltage across the resistor so the multimeter needs to be in parallel with the resistor.  For measuring amperage the multimeter would need to be in series with the circuit.  For more information, read about parallel and series circuits here.

Find the wattage rating of the bulb.,
Divide this number by one thousand.,
Estimate the number hours the bulb is on per month.,
Multiply the kilowatt use by the number of hours.,
Calculate the cost of running your light bulb.,
Save on lighting costs.,
Choose the right replacement.",How to Calculate Kilowatts Used by Light Bulbs," The wattage is often printed directly on the bulb as a number followed by a W. If you don't see it there, check the packaging the bulb was sold in. The watt is a unit of power, measuring the energy the bulb uses each second.


Ignore phrases like ""100-watt equivalent,"" which are used to compare brightness. You want the actual number of watts the bulb uses.;
, This converts the number from watts to kilowatts. An easy way to divide by one thousand is to move the decimal point three places to the left.



Example 1: A typical incandescent bulb draws 60 watts of power, or 60 / 1000 = 0.06 kilowatts.

Example 2: A typical fluorescent bulb uses 15 watts, or 15 / 1000 = 0.015 kW. This bulb only uses ¼ as much power as the bulb in example 1, since 15 / 60 = ¼.

, To calculate your utility bill, you'll need to know how much you use your bulb. Assuming you receive monthly utility bills, count up the number of hours the bulb is on in a typical month.


Example 1: Your 0.06 kW bulb is turned on for 6 hours a day, every day. In a 30-day month, that's a total of (30 days/month * 6 hrs/day) = 180 hours per month.

Example 2: Your 0.015 kW fluorescent bulb is on for 3.5 hours a day, 2 days a week. In one month, it will be on for roughly (3.5 hours/day * 2 days/wk * 4 wks/month) = 28 hours per month.

, Your energy company charges you for each ""kilowatt-hour"" (kWh), or each kilowatt of power in use for one hour. To find the kilowatt-hours your light bulb consumes per month, multiply the kilowatt use by the number of hours it's on each month.



Example 1: The incandescent bulb uses 0.06 kW of power and is on for 180 hours a month. Its energy usage is (0.06 kW * 180 hours/month) = 10.8 kilowatt-hours per month.

Example 2: The fluorescent bulb uses 0.015 kW and is on for 28 hours a month. Its energy usage is (0.015 kW * 28 hours/month) = 0.42 kilowatt-hours per month.

, Check your utility bill for the cost of each kilowatt-hour of electricity. (Average costs are roughly $0.12 per kWh in the US, or €0.20 per kWh in Europe.) Multiply this by the number of kWh your bulb uses each month to estimate how much you pay to power that bulb.



Example 1: Your power company charges 10 US cents per kWh, or $0.10. The incandescent bulb uses 10.8 kWh/month, so running it is costing you ($0.10/kWh * 10.8 kWh/mo.) = $1.08 per month.

Example 2: At the same cost of $0.10 per month, the low-use fluorescent bulb costs you ($0.10/kWh * 0.42 kWh/mo.) = $0.042 per month, or about four cents.

, Light bulbs account for about 5% of the electricity bill of the average US household.Although other energy savers will have a larger effect, replacing incandescent bulbs is always worth it in the long term:Replacing a traditional incandescent bulb with a compact fluorescent light (CFL) will typically pay for itself within 9 months. It will also last nine times as long before burning out, saving you even more money in the long run.

Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are even more efficient and have a lifespan of 50,000 hours (almost six years of constant use). Over their whole lifespan, they save about $7 US per year., Consider the following when shopping for energy-efficient lighting:Poorly made CFL bulbs can burn out quickly. The best options have an EnergyStar logo in the US, or a rating of A+ or higher on the European Union energy label.
If you're lucky, the packaging will list ""lumens,"" a measure of brightness. If not, use this estimate: a 60 watt incandescent bulb, 15 watt CFL, or 10 watt LED are all roughly the same brightness.
Look for a color descriptor. ""Warm white"" is closer to the yellow glow of an incandescent. ""Cool white"" heightens the contrast, which may feel harsh in living spaces.""Directional"" LED lights focus light on a small area instead of illuminating a whole room.

In order to test a resistor, it is important to first disconnect one lead from the circuit .. it won't matter which one.,
Next, obtain an electrical meter capable of measuring resistance.,
You will next need to determine the rated value of the resistor.,
Set your meter to an appropriate range(nearest value higher than the expected measurement), and connect the leads(polarity will not matter).

,
Compare your reading with the value determined above.,
If it is, its likely good - otherwise not.

",How to Check a Resistor,";
, This is typically called an ohm-meter, and is almost always a function of a standard multi-meter.

, With the colored band variety, you will need to look up each colored band and determine its meaning. The first two bands will be single digit numbers, followed by the third band which is a multiplier. The fourth band will be an accuracy rating for the device. For example: band1=1 band2=0 band3 = x100 band4 = 5%; would mean 1000ohms +- 5%. The ceramic and wire varieties will often be labeled in ink with a value. The carbon/metal variable resistors will not usually have a stated value labeled, but you can look for a smooth transition as adjustment is made to the wiper position.

,, It should be near the given value and within the tolerance range.

"
Know the units of measurement.,
Read the capacitance value.,
Look for a tolerance value.,
Check the voltage rating.,
Look for a + or - sign.",How to Read a Capacitor1," The base unit of capacitance is the farad (F). This value is much too large for ordinary circuits, so household capacitors are labeled with one of the following units:1 µF, uF, or mF = 1 microfarad = 10-6 farads. (Careful — in other contexts, mF is the official abbreviation for millifarads, or 10-3 farads.)
1 nF = 1 nanofarad = 10-9 farads.
1 pF, mmF, or uuF = 1 picofarad = 1 micromicrofarad = 10-12 farads.;
, Most large capacitors have a capacitance value written on the side. Slight variations are common, so look for the value that most closely matches the units above. You may need to adjust for the following:


Ignore capital letters in the units. For example, ""MF"" is just a variation on ""mf."" (It is definitely not a megafarad, even though this is the official SI abbreviation.)
Don't get thrown by ""fd."" This is just another abbreviation for farad. For example, ""mmfd"" is the same as ""mmf.""
Beware single-letter markings such as ""475m,"" usually found on smaller capacitors.See below for instructions.

, Some capacitors list a tolerance, or the maximum expected range in capacitance compared to its listed value. This isn't important in all circuits, but you may need to pay attention to this if you require a precise capacitor value. For example, a capacitor labeled ""6000uF +50%/-70%"" could actually have a capacitance as high as 6000uF + (6000 * 0.5) = 9000uF, or as low as 6000 uF - (6000uF * 0.7) = 1800uF.


If there is no percentage listed, look for a single letter after the capacitance value or on its own line. This may be code for a tolerance value, described below.

, If there is room on the body of the capacitor, the manufacturer usually lists voltage as a number followed by a V, VDC, VDCW, or WV (for ""Working Voltage"").This is the maximum voltage the capacitor is designed to handle.


1 kV = 1,000 volts.

See below if you suspect your capacitor uses a code for voltage (a single letter or one digit and one letter). If there is no symbol at all, reserve the cap for low-voltage circuits only.
If you are building an AC circuit, look for a capacitor rated specifically for VAC. Do not use a DC capacitor unless you have an in-depth knowledge of how to convert the voltage rating, and how to use that type of capacitor safely in AC applications., If you see one of these next to a terminal, the capacitor is polarized. Make sure to connect the capacitor's + end to the positive side of the circuit, or the capacitor could eventually cause a short or even explode.If there is no + or -, you can orient the capacitor either way.


Some capacitors use a colored bar or a ring-shaped depression to show polarity. Traditionally, this mark designates the - end on an aluminum electrolytic capacitor (which are usually shaped like tin cans). On tantalum electrolytic capacitors (which are very small), this mark designates the + end.(Disregard the bar if it contradicts a + or - sign, or if it is on a non-electrolytic capacitor.)

"
Write down the first two digits of the capacitance.,
Use the third digit as a zero multiplier.,
Work out the capacitance units from context.,
Read codes that contain letters instead.,
Read the tolerance code on ceramic capacitors.,
Read letter-number-letter tolerance values.,
Interpret voltage codes.,
Look up other systems.",How to Read a Capacitor2," Older capacitors are less predictable, but almost all modern examples use the EIA standard code when the capacitor is too small to write out the capacitance in full. To start, write down the first two digits, then decide what to do next based on your code:If your code starts with exactly two digits followed by a letter (e.g. 44M), the first two digits are the full capacitance code. Skip down to finding units.
If one of the first two characters is a letter, skip down to letter systems.
If the first three characters are all numbers, continue to the next step.

, The three-digit capacitance code works as follows:


If the third digit is 0 through 6, add that many zeroes to the end of the number. (For example, 453 → 45 x 103 → 45,000.)
If the third digit is 8, multiply by 0.01. (e.g. 278 → 27 x 0.01 → 0.27)
If the third digit is 9, multiply by 0.1. (e.g. 309 → 30 x 0.1 → 3.0)

, The smallest capacitors (made from ceramic, film, or tantalum) use units of picofarads (pF), equal to 10-12 farads. Larger capacitors (the cylindrical aluminum electrolyte type or the double-layer type) use units of microfarads (uF or µF), equal to 10-6 farads.A capacitor may overrule this by adding a unit after it (p for picofarad, n for nanofarad, or u for microfarad). However, if there is only one letter after the code, this is usually the tolerance code, not the unit. (P and N are uncommon tolerance codes, but they do exist.)

, If your code includes a letter as one of the first two characters, there are three possibilities:


If the letter is an R, replace it with a decimal point to get the capacitance in pF. For example, 4R1 means a capacitance of 4.1pF.If the letter is p, n, or u, this tells you the units (pico-, nano-, or microfarad). Replace this letter with a decimal point. For example, n61 means 0.61 nF, and 5u2 means 5.2 uF.A code like ""1A253"" is actually two codes. 1A tells you the voltage, and 253 tells you the capacitance as described above., Ceramic capacitors, which are usually tiny ""pancakes"" with two pins, typically list the tolerance value as one letter immediately after the three-digit capacitance value. This letter represents the tolerance of the capacitor, meaning how close the actual value of the capacitor can be expected to be to the indicated value of the capacitor. If precision is important in your circuit, translate this code as follows:B = ± 0.1 pF.
C = ± 0.25 pF.
D = ± 0.5 pF for capacitors rated below 10 pF, or ± 0.5% for capacitors above 10 pF.
F = ± 1 pF or ± 1% (same system as D above).
G = ± 2 pF or ± 2% (see above).
J = ± 5%.
K = ± 10%.
M = ± 20%.
Z = +80% / -20% (If you see no tolerance listed, assume this as the worst case scenario.)

, Many types of capacitors represent the tolerance with a more detailed three-symbol system. Interpret this as follows:The first symbol shows minimum temperature. Z = 10ºC, Y = -30ºC, X = -55ºC.
The second symbol shows maximum temperature. 2 = 45ºC, 4 = 65ºC, 5 = 85ºC, 6 = 105ºC, 7 = 125ºC.
The third symbol shows variation in capacitance across this temperature range. This ranges from the most precise, A = ±1.0%, to the least precise, V = +22.0%/-82%. R, one of the most common symbols, represents a variation of ±15%., You can look up the EIA voltage chart for a full list, but most capacitors use one of the following common codes for maximum voltage (values given for DC capacitors only):0J = 6.3V

1A = 10V

1C = 16V

1E = 25V

1H = 50V

2A = 100V

2D = 200V

2E = 250V
One letter codes are abbreviations of one of the common values above. If multiple values could apply (such as 1A or 2A), you'll need to work it out from context.
For an estimate of other, less common codes, look at the first digit. 0 covers values less than ten; 1 goes from ten to 99; 2 goes from 100 to 999; and so on.

, Old capacitors or capacitors made for specialist use may use different systems. These are not included in this article, but you can use this hints to guide your further research:


If the capacitor has one long code beginning with ""CM"" or ""DM,"" look up the U.S. military capacitor chart.If there is no code but a series of colored bands or dots, look up the capacitor color code."

Determine the watts in a power source.,
Determine amps or volts the same way.,
Determine resistor wattage.",How to Calculate Wattage1," You will need to know the amps and the volts in the power source. To determine the wattage, use a simple multiplication formula. The ampere (or amps) is the amount of electricity used. Voltage measures the force or pressure of the electricity.


The number of watts is equal to amps multiplied by volts. That's it! In other words, watt=amp X volt. Sometimes you will see this formula written as W=A X V. For example, if the current is 3 amps (3A) and the voltage is 110V, you multiply 3 by 110, to get 330W (watts). The formula is P=3A X 110V = 330 W (with P standing for power).
This is why watts are sometimes called volt-amps. Circuit breakers usually have the amps written on their handles. This is the maximum amperage that circuit can take before the circuit breaker trips. You can also determine both volts and amps by looking on the labels or in the operating manuals. You can look up common figures for standard appliances (most small appliances and lighting fixtures in homes require circuits that range from 15-20 amps and larger ones are 20 to 60.However, most counter top household appliances are rated for 120 volts and operated with 12 or less amps. Larger appliances like ranges and clothes dryers require more power and are connected to circuits that are wired to 240 volt power and may draw 20 to 40 amps depending on a number of factors. Household wiring is usually 120 or 240 volts in North America.;
, You can do the multiplication formula in reverse. For example, let’s say you have an AC 24-40 power supply. This means your power supply has 24 volts and 40 watts.The power source can supply 1.6 amps. The formula used is 40-? X 24. Thus, you would divide 40 by 24 to get 1.6.Here’s another reason you might need to do this. Let’s say you want to figure out the watts used by a ceiling fan, and the label on the fan says that the fan uses a certain number of amps. You could then find out the typical number of volts used by a ceiling fan (by calling the manufacturer or just looking online), multiply the two numbers, and generate an estimate of the wattage needed to run the ceiling fan.

, If you want to know wattage of a resistor, you will need to know the voltage (V) and the current (known as I). This is called Ohm’s law.The multiplication formula is voltage multiplied by current, expressed as W=V X I. . Sometimes you will see the formula written with a P for power.
The formula gets more complex when the power is changing over time. It involves using the time period to get the average. It’s hard to calculate, and for this kind of measurement, you should use special equipment known as a wattage meter.

Understand what fan power involves.,
Measure the air pressure.,
Measure the air speed.,
Measure the diameter.,
Determine the air flow.,
Determine the horsepower.",How to Calculate Industrial Fan Power," Fan power measures exactly how much energy a fan must receive in order to be able to produce a specific amount of air flow. Fan power is a function of both air pressure and air flow and units of horsepower is typically the measure used.;
, The very first thing you need to do is measure the fan’s total air pressure. This is measured in inches of water gauge (iwg). This is the unit of measure which is used for various fan calculations.


In order to calculate it, you must place one of the ends of a manometer where the fan inlet is. The other end of the manometer must be placed at the end of the fan outlet. Now you simply measure the difference between the liquid height on both sides of the manometer in order to measure the total pressure.

, Now that you have the total pressure, you will have to measure the air speed in feet per second. For this you will need a vane anemometer.


Place the vane anemometer at different points of the fan face, in order to take more than one velocity measurement. After you have done that, average all of those readings in order to accurately measure air speed. The recommended amount of different velocity measurements is nine, according to the University of Connecticut.

, At this point, you must accurately measure the fan diameter in feet. When you have the diameter, divide it by 2 and square the result. After doing so, multiply it by 3.14 (or pi) in order to get the fan area.

, Now that you know the fan area it is time to multiply it by the air speed of the fan. This will give you the air flow in CFM (or cubic feet per minute).

, In order to find the horsepower, multiply the air flow by the total pressure and divide the result by 6356.

Find an online calculator.,
Check your appliance.",How to Calculate Wattage2," There are many resources online that use calculators to determine watts. They will do the formula for you.Such resources typically ask you to enter the number of volts, and the number of amps. Then you are asked to hit the “calculate” button to get the watts.
Keep in mind, though, that online calculators aren’t always accurate because every appliance is going to be slightly different in its power needs.
Some online sites will give you the watts needed if you click on the appliance type, such as a television or desktop computer.Sites sometimes have charts that list the watts used by various appliances, from refrigerators to boom boxes., You can figure out how many watts an appliance needs by looking for the data plate.


Find this on the back of your appliance. It’s likely to list how many volts, amps, and watts you need to power your appliance. You might find this information stamped on the back of the appliance. Or you could find the wattage listed on the nameplate.Wattage meters plug into the appliance, and they tell you the exact amount of power that the appliance needs to run. The wattage of an appliance might vary depending on its setting. For example, a radio is going to use more watts if you turn the volume on high.

Understand why watts matter.,
Become more energy efficient.",How to Calculate Wattage3," The power in watts is the rate at which energy is generated or used. Many utility companies will bill you based on how many watts of energy you used. The watt is basically how much energy an appliance uses. Rated watts are the amount of watts needed to keep an appliance running. For example, refrigerators usually require 500 watts to keep running. You may need to know the watts in your home if you are trying to become more energy efficient, add solar panels, or use a generator.
Electrical power comes in AC and DC currents. AC means alternating current; the electrical current constantly reverses direction and is used often in homes and offices. DC means direct current, and it means the current only travels in one direction. You will find it in things like battery packs.Surge watts means the amount of watts needed to get an appliance started by igniting its motor or compressor. For example, it might take 2,000 watts to start the motor and compressor of a refrigerator.

, Watts are a basic unit of power (electric, mechanical, or thermal). The reason watts matter is because you can improve energy efficiency if you understand them.


Lower your watts, and you will improve energy efficiency and save money. Here’s an example. Let's say you are buying a light bulb, and one is 100 watts and the other is 23 watts. If the 100 Watt bulb is cheaper, you might assume it’s the better purchase. However, over time, the 23 Watt bulb will save you money.
Do simple subtraction to determine the watt difference. In this case, that is 77 watts (100-23). Utility companies will often charge you using kilowatts. To find out the number of kilowatts, take the number of watts divided by 1,000. Then take the number of kilowatts multiplied by your hours of usage. This is the kilowatt/hr. Then, take kilowatt/hr and multiply that number by the cost of your energy. This is your annual cost.
For example, let’s say you have 10 lights. They are each 100 watts. 10 X 100 = 1,000 watts. 1,000 Watts divided by 1,000 = 1 kw. Let’s say you’ve used 2,000 hours of energy. Thus, 1kw X 2,000 hours per year = 2,000 kwh. Let’s say your utility company charges you 10 cents for every kilowatt hour. You would take 2,000 kwh X .10 = $200, That's what it would cost you to use those bulbs for the year.

If the appliance is instead hard wired, simply turn the circuit breaker off.;
, In some cases you will see terminal labels that have been printed on the housing or lid of the capacitor. Capacitors which don’t have such labels don’t need them because they are non-polarized.

, You can use needle-nose pliers to make this easier. Use the pliers to terminal connector off the terminal. Make sure you don’t use the pliers to pull on the wire.

, Make sure the metal of the screwdriver is touching the two terminals – this will discharge your capacitor. In case you want to test a dual capacitor, make sure to hold the screwdriver on the “COM” labelled terminal. Then use the screwdriver to independently touch the other terminals.

, Take its two leads and touch them together in order to zero the meter.

, In case your capacitor is polarized, then you have to put the black lead on its negative terminal. In case it is a dual capacitor that you are testing, put the black lead on its “COM” terminal.

, Take a look at the reading of the ohmmeter. If the needle goes to infinite, then retreats a little bit and moves back to infinite again, then the capacitor has passed the test. The capacitor will not pass the test if the needle goes to infinite and then stays there or if the needle doesn’t move at all.

Throw the Throwie.",How to Make LED Throwies," Your disc-shaped battery has a positive side and a negative side. The negative side has less surface area than the positive side. The positive side is larger and has a (+) symbol and includes the side of the battery.;
, It probably looks like a tiny plastic bullet with two legs or leads. One lead is longer and possibly darker, this is the anode and needs to touch the positive side of the battery only. The other lead is shorter and possibly lighter, this is the cathode lead and needs to touch the negative side of the battery only. If the cathode lead touches the positive side of the battery, you will probably cause a malfunction in the LED. You can find out what color of LED by correctly attaching it to your power source, the battery. An LED is a light emitting diode, not a light bulb. The color is not determined by the plastic bullet shape, but by the semiconductor material inside the LED.

, Cut a 1"" x 7"" piece of duct tape. Holding one wire from the LED to each side of the flat battery, wrap the tape around the outside of the wires and battery. Wrap it one time around, neat and tight. The LED should come on. If it flickers, you did it wrong. Do over. You should have a portion of the tape strap hanging off to one side.

Know what to feed your plants.,
Supplementary heating maybe required to boost the grow room temperature in winter months.",How to Grow With LED Grow Lights," This may sound obvious, however, with all the opinions on the height that led grow lights have to be hung it's time to give some sound advice.


Early vegetative stage - Position the LED grow light to be approximately 300mm above plants. This ensures the minimum inter-nodal length possible and provides more inter-nodes relevant to the plants height.
Vegetative stage - The light can now be raised to between 300-600mm above the plant, the distance will be in proportion to the canopy density of the plant. Plants with a lot of leaf cover will require the light to be lower to the plant to ensure the LED grow light punches the light down to lower branches, plants with a more open canopy can have the LED grow light raised higher. Ultimately it is the grower's choice of whether he or she wants small or larger inter nodal lengths.An important point to remember is your plants light requirements , if your plants require high light levels the light should be positioned approx 300mm above the plants. If the plants require low light levels then the light will need to be positioned 600mm above the plants, maybe higher depending upon the exact amount of light required.Remember watch how your plants grow , they will tell you whether they need the light closer or further away.
Flowering, budding stage - The light can be maintained again anywhere between 300-600mm above the plant canopy. Generally speaking approximately 400mm above the canopy appears to be a favourable height for lights to be hung.;
, Watering causes some problems to those starting out with LED growing. Most watering/feeding guides are based on HPS lighting where evaporation occurs and daily watering is required to replace the evaporated water, feed, etc. from the pots (if growing in soil). The evaporation of the water/feed etc is not an issue with LED grow lights however the possibility of over watering is a very real danger.

, Plants grown under LED grow lights usually only require approximately 30% of feeding compared to HPS lighting. You would all so do well to add Cal-Mag when growing with LEDs


In hydroponic systems, less topping up of the nutrient reservoirs are required due to the reduced evaporation of the nutrients.

, Heat in the growing area is drastically reduced compared to HPS lighting. This reduces heat stress to the plants however in cold conditions a watchful eye must be kept on the temperature of the growing area.

",How to Choose the Right LED Flashlight," Will you use it for camping? Will you carry it in your car? Will you leave it at home in case of a power failure? Do you need something particularly large or small? Do you need it portable? Will you carry the light or do you want it to be able to strap on or mount to a stand?
;
, Many flashlights are available for under $10 or $20, but these are often cheaply built, and will not last as long as one that costs more than $25. Most of the very popular high-end flashlights today are priced around $50.

, How far do you need to be able to see?

, The number of LED's is usually less important than the brightness, but it's often listed. Any flashlight that's worth the money, will feature only one LED. Most cheaper lights that have multiple LED's are not very bright, and often do not offer a strong, focused beam.

, Most LEDs are very reliable, so it's often the surrounding construction that will fail first, if it's not well constructed.

, The types of flashlights sold at most major retailers are very limited, and are usually geared toward standard disposable batteries. Rechargeable Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries are a better choice. Most retailers sell these. For these types of batteries to work in an LED flashlight, the light must be a AA flashlight. A flashlight made for lithium batteries cannot use standard AA or NiMH batteries. The best lithium battery flashlights are usually only available at online retailers. Disposable lithium batteries are expensive, and don't last long in high-power flashlights. Rechargeable lithium batteries are much cheaper to operate. They are also only available through mail order.


Conventional alkaline batteries have a long shelf life but must be replaced. Alkaline batteries are also prone to leaking if left stored for long periods.
Lithium-ion batteries can be recharged with a lithium battery charger. Rechargeable lithium batteries have an extremely long shelf-life, and once charged, will hold their charge up to one year without much loss. Disposable lithium batteries, known as CR123's, can be stored up to TEN years with no possibility of leakage or degradation.
Even a rechargeable battery may someday need to be replaced. Most rechargeable batteries whether they are lithium or NiMH, can usually be charged up to 500 times before they'll no longer hold a charge.

, LED flashlights are available in a range of sizes and weights, ranging from tiny coin cell key chains to large, stand-mounted work lights.

, With them off, you can look at the consistency of the work that went into mounting them.

, Look for an even, round light, rather than an uneven distribution of light. LED flashlights generally do not have an adjustable focal length, so it's important to choose one that's right to begin with.


, Plastic is lightweight, cheap, and will not stand the test of time; aluminum is likely to be more durable. Most of the popular lights today use aircraft grade aluminum.

Determine the essential appliances in the home you cannot do without.,
List the appliances and electrical devices you plan to use, then look at their wattage or power requirement.,
Choose a wiring system.,
Install an inlet box hook up.,
Keep your family safe!,
Get your setup inspected.",How to Connect a Portable Generator to a House1," A petrol-driven generator with a rated power of about 3500W will serve for lighting, TV, fans and a fridge or freezer. The rated power is usually written on the body of the generator and it is that power the generator can deliver continuously for an average of 12 hours on a single tank of fuel.;
, A typical microwave, for instance, uses 1500 watts, while a whole circuit of lights with CFC bulbs may only require 150 watts. Refrigerators use about 1200 - 1500 watts, but have a starting capacitor which increases the wattage momentarily when the compressor starts. Televisions use less the 1000 watts, depending on the type and size, a small room fan may use about 500 watts, and so on.

, There are several different wiring systems that can be used to connect a generator to a home. The main two are discussed here. Contact your local Department of Labor and Industries, Planning Department, or Power Company to find out what is legal in your area. Do not consult the internet to find out which system is legal in your area. There are many people that are unqualified to offer advice doing just that, and the law can vary significantly between countries, states, and even cities.


Consider an interlock kit. These are fairly simple to install yourself and they are the cheapest option. However, they are illegal in many areas and can be very unsafe. They must be installed absolutely correctly. Safe installation also requires that you have several extra spaces in your existing breaker box or that you install a new one, which must be done professionally. It is also a strict requirement that you get a kit that is approved for your specific breaker box (should be made by the same company).
Consider a manual transfer switch. This is a slightly more expensive piece of equipment which will require a professional install. However, it is the only guaranteed legal option and it is accordingly the safest. This will help keep you from accidentally electrocuting someone else or even yourself.

, This hookup will go on the outside of your house and will have a recessed male connector (prongs that stick out, rather than holes you plug in to). It will connect to whichever panel system you installed inside your house. The installation should be performed by a professional, both to keep you safe and to make sure your system remains up to code. If you do not have this done by a professional, your insurance may be unable to cover your home, the city you live in could enforce a heavy fine, and you are very likely to hurt either yourself or someone else (in a hospital-if-you're-lucky kind of way).

, You will find a lot of advice and instructions offered on the internet that are unsafe and put you at risk for injury, electrocution, or serious house fire. Be sure to always check with your city specialists before doing anything that will put you or your family at risk. Some common Do Nots include:


Do not connect your generator directly to your breaker box without an approved transfer switch.
Do not connect your generator to a washing machine or dryer outlet.

, This is especially important if you do not have experience with electrical work. You want to be sure that your family stays safe and, in the event of a fire, that your insurance company cannot dispute your claim because of ""faulty wiring"".

Make sure you have the Dream Lite on hand, too!;
, Remove all three batteries before moving forward.

, Starting at the corners, pull up until you hear the top cover pop, continue to the next corner (start going long ways) and then pull up on the middle. The other side will come off with greater ease once the first side is done.


This does take a bit of muscle; don't be afraid to strong arm it, just be mindful of your fingernails.
Here's what it should look like without the cover.

, Using a Phillips head screwdriver, remove the two screws that are securing the board to the casing.


You will now be able to move the board around but be careful as some of the wires are short and won't allow you to twist too far.

, D1 is the amber LED, D2 is the green LED, and D3 is the blue LED.


This tutorial shows replacement of the blue LED (D3). You can even change up the colors to suit your child's taste.

, Place locking pliers (regular pliers will work but you will need to keep your grip) around the bulb you want to remove keeping it as close to the board as possible. You can use this to not only hold your board still but the added pressure will help pull the bulb out as you use your soldering iron to loosen it.

, Using the pliers to hold the bulb and board, carefully use the soldering iron to melt the solder around the two pins for that specific LED bulb. This may take some back-and-forth moving between the pins––do not hold the iron against the board or keep it on the solder too long or you may damage the board this way. Going back and forth will help keep the heat down.


You can use small nail clippers to trim some of the solder and pin away before using the soldering iron. This can help cut down the amount of time needed to loosen the bulb; doing this is optional.

,


Depending on the style of LED bulb you are using, you may have to trim the pins. Trim just above the little squares using wire cutters or nail clippers.
If you want to test the bulb before doing anything and have a flat 3v battery at hand, place the bulb with one pin on each side as shown in the photo. Make sure the positive pin is on the positive side. If it doesn't light, try flipping the bulb around.

, Each bulb has a positive and negative pin. In order for it to work, you must make sure you are placing the new bulb on the board correctly. To find the positive and negative pin, look at the inside of the bulb. The positive pin will have the least amount of metal inside and the negative pin will have the most.

, You can use them to slide the new bulb into. One of the openings will have + above it. Make sure to place the positive pin into that hole.

, Using electrical tape, secure the new bulb onto the board to keep it in place while soldering.


If you make the strip of tape long enough, you can then secure the board to part of the casing.
This will help keep your hands free to use the soldering iron and solder.

, Using a small amount of solder, secure the pins to the board being careful to not press the iron against the board for too long. Use as little solder as possible to keep the board clean.

, Replace the batteries and turn on the Dream Lite. Go through all of the settings to make sure the bulb is bright enough and dims with the rotate setting.

, Screw the board back in once you have verified everything is working.

, Pop the top of the casing back on. Again, this takes a bit of muscle. Start with the corners first and then the middle. Revel in your newfound skills!

Work out the maximum power level that you will require.,
Choose the most appropriate fuel.,
Ensure that the generator is suitable for powering the required electricals.,

Consider the environment in which the generator will be used.,
Balance cost and feature-richness.",How to Choose a Generator," This is done by adding up the maximum required power for each of the electricals that you will need the generator to power. Then, make sure that the generator's power rating at least matches this figure.


You can find the wattage information in your appliance's owner's manual, or on the ID plate located on the body of the machine. Make sure to consider both starting and running wattages.
Generator manufacturers generally provide two power figures for their generators: continuous/rated output, and maximum output. These figures match up to those found on your electricals. The continuous/rated output matches the running wattage, and the maximum output matches the starting wattage, which tends to be higher.
Ideally, ensure that the generator's power exceeds your requirements. You don't want to have to buy a new generator in a year's time when you buy a new, slightly more powerful appliance.;
, There are three main types that you should consider:


Petrol: the most common fuel, and easy to obtain. However, it has a comparatively short shelf life, is more flammable than other fuels, and isn't ideal for use in very cold conditions
Diesel: best suited to large generators, and only really effective when run at heavy loads. It has a lower operating cost and longer storage time than petrol, but it is also a noisy and environmentally-unfriendly fuel.
LPG (liquefied petroleum gas): cleaner and safer than both petrol and diesel. Different cylinder sizes enable different running times. However, LPG generators can be more expensive to buy, and often your best option is to pay for an LPG conversion. This would allow your generator to run on either petrol or LPG as required, which provides you with amazing flexibility.

, Regular generators provide power that fluctuates as the load changes, but high-tech power tools, appliances and electronics require smooth power to avoid damage. AVR and Inverter generators feature special electronics that ""smooth"" the power to prevent spikes and drops. If you will be powering computers or other sensitive electronics, then make sure this technology is included.


Inverter Technology provides the smoothest power, which makes it ideal for the most high-tech devices.
AVR generators still provide smooth power, but are a more cost effective option. There are also two different levels of AVR: standard and digital.

, Will it be in a sheltered area, away from potential damage? Or will be out on a building site, being knocked about and splattered with building materials? Make sure that the generator is robust enough to withstand its working conditions.

Open-frame generators are the most robust, as they are made from mostly metal with very little plastic.

, There are many features that can make your generator easier to use and more efficient to run, but they will increase the price. Features worth considering include:


Electric start. This allows you to start the generator at the push of a button, which makes it much quicker and easier to start
Switchable voltage. This allows you to power either 110v power tools or 240v household appliances and electricals as required.
EcoThrottle ensures that the output precisely matches the load. This means that less fuel is used, which saves you money, increases refuelling intervals, and protects the environment.
Circuit breakers, which protect you and your generator in the event of a fault when using the power outlets.
Handles, wheels, and other attachments, which help you to move the generator around with much more ease

Connect the heater.,

Reconnect the power.,
Test your system.",How to Add an Oil Preheater to a Generac Generator System," The parts required are a silicone heating pad, a temperature controller, and a ""soup"" can.

The heating pad can be obtained from an auto parts store, a pet store (aquarium heater) or online.  The wattage needed is low -- look for ones rated for 110VAC, about 2"" X 6"" (not very critical), and with a wattage rating of less than 20W. The cost should be about $20 to $30.
The temperature controller (i.e., thermostat) can be obtained on eBay for about $3. One rated for NC (normally closed) and about 25C (77F) to 40C (103F) is suitable. A commonly available part is the KSD301 but it has variants for many temperatures -- look for one in the lower temperature range.
Any can from your pantry will do; it should fit loosely over the existing filter. (Check your filter and choose a can accordingly.)
Three other ""parts"" are a small amount of fiberglass or similar insulation, a 2 1/2 to 3"" hose clamp, and some duct tape.;
, Once the parts are on-hand, the next step is to add the thermostat to the silicone pad heater. The heater comes with a 110V cord and socket. Separate the two wires close to the pad (a pocket knife works well) and cut the ""ground"" or neutral side of the cord. Strip about 1/4"" of insulation off each exposed wire.







The thermostat will likely come with stripped leads.

, It makes no difference which ""direction"" the thermostat is connected -- it is just a simple switch that is ""on"" below the set-point and ""off"" when it is above that point. Twist the pairs of wires together and solder the connections. (Wire ""nuts"" will probably work but are bulky and may be prone to failure from heat and vibration.  Crimp connections may work.) Wrap the connections with electrical tape or use heat-shrink tubing., A fuse is desirable for protection in case of short or other circuit failure. At 110V, a fuse of .5 Amp is suitable as that will work with heating pads up to about 25 watts. The fuse is an in-line design and is soldered into the ""hot"" side of the 110V wiring by cutting off the plug, separating the wires, stripping, and soldering. Cover the joint with electrical tape or shrink tubing., Testing of the pad can be done very carefully at this stage. The pad will get very hot very quickly and will burn if plugged into 110V! An appropriate test that is safe is to use an ohmmeter and check for a low resistance when the thermostat is cool (ice bath?) and an infinite resistance when the thermostat is warm (say 80F). In case the resistance at low temperatures is also high or infinite, recheck the connections!, The can probably will not fit perfectly over the oil filter. For the Generac system, the can should fit easily but snugly over the mount for the oil filter. You can cut some small slits in the open end of the can at roughly 90-degrees so that a hose clamp can be used to secure the heater to the mounting plate (or just the oil filter)., The silicone pad comes with a paper backing and has adhesive under that. The can used was not smooth so the pad did not adhere well., The other problem was how to attach the thermostat to the can. The solution was to wrap the pad and thermostat with high-temperature tape (duct tape is designed for this).

A perfect thermal path is not required as the temperatures that should be present will be between 60F or so and the operating temperature of the generator oil.  During normal conditions when the generator is not running, the maximum temperature should be no more than about 10F more than the thermostat specification.

, It is desirable to limit heat loss (but not critical). Wrapping the can with a layer of fiberglass batting or some similar insulation layer will provide more-than-sufficient heat retention. There is no problem with over-heating when the generator is running as the oil temperature is automatically limited.  You can put a layer of insulation over the can bottom held-on by a couple of strips of tape. The circumference of the can was then wrapped with insulation and a layer of tape applied loosely so as to not crush the insulation., The side of most Generac systems removes to provide easy access to the oil filter and battery. Once the side is removed, put the hose clamp around the open end of the can (where the slits are) and slide the whole heater and clamp over the oil filter. As noted, for at least the test system, the can fit nicely around the mount for the oil filter -- the hose clamp was tightened with a screwdriver to hold the heater over the oil filter., Usually this will require turning off all power to the home unless there is a local disconnect for just the generator., The Generac system comes with a 110V socket on the outside, but it is ""live"" only when the generator is running. To connect the heater to power it is necessary to connect the stripped wires to the N1 and Neutral wires under the generator control panel. N1 and N2 provide 240V while either N1 to Neutral or N2 to Neutral will provide 110V. Access to these connectors is under a plastic cover just above the control panel. Unless you are competent in working with high voltage wiring, this step should be done only by an electrician. There is a YouTube (""Generac Cold Weather Kit Installation"") showing this general installation., Reinstall the plastic cover over the connector box and the metal panel covering the wiring and battery. Reinstall the side panel., Turn the utility disconnect back to the ""on"" state., It will be difficult to perform a complete operational test unless the outside temperatures are below the thermostat set-point which will be true for many areas except in the summer. A primary test will be to test that the heater is operational when the generator is running. Generac systems have a manual run switch that makes it very simple to start the engine. Run the system for several minutes to make sure the hose clamp and can are secure from vibration and heat during running. Let the system cool-down and check that the heater system is still secure. Replace the side of the generator enclosure."

Install insulation.",How to Install an Exterior Door," There are a number of tools you're going to need to remove the old door and put in the new door. Make sure that you have what you need before you start trying to do this operation. If you don't have these in your house, a trip to the nearest hardware store is in order.


Leveler to make sure that everything stays level (you'll have difficulty opening your new door if it's at an angle).
Caulk to fix the insulation and framing in place.
Hammer and nails, nail set, screwdriver (depends on the nails holding your old door in place) to remove the old door and put on the new door.
Tape measure or ruler to measure the old and new doors and frames.
Insulation to make it so those winter winds don't start whipping around your door.
Wood shims to hold the door at the right level, if needed.;
, Before you start ripping your old door out of its frame you want to get the new door. The size and type will depend on your needs and the size of the door frame. You don't want to get stuck with the wrong-sized door.


Wood doors tend to have a nicer look, but they aren't as weather-resistant as fiberglass or steel doors.
Steel doors also tend to be the least expensive, while wood and fiberglass tend to be around the same price depending on the style of the door.

, There's nothing worse than getting all primed to go with your new door only to discover that it is too big or too small. You can avoid this unfortunate situation by taking measurements of the old door and applying those measurements to the new door.


To check the width you'll need to measure across the top middle and bottom from stud to stud of the old door. The stud is basically the side of the door. The smallest number is the rough estimate for the width.
For door height you're going to need to measure the middle, and both sides of the door from the top of the door to the floor. The smallest number is again going to be your rough estimate.
Measure the width of the doorjamb.
Check the measurements of the old door against the measurements of the new door you're considering. If they match up closely, then you're good to go. If not, you're going to need to consider a new door.

, This requires removing the door as well as the existing exterior trim and old insulation. Before you can remove the door and main frame, you must cut the caulking, remove the interior and exterior trim, and remove the 1×4 nailing boards around the exterior of the frame and any shims or nails sticking out of the trimmer studs. To help minimize dust during the demolition, remove the door towards the end of the process prior to extracting the main frame. Using your hammer and a nail set (or a screwdriver), remove the hinge pins and detach your old door for the hinges.For most hinges you should be able to insert a nail set into the hole at the bottom of the hinge pin and strike it upward with a hammer. Keep driving the pin upward (with the hammer) until it comes out.
Score the caulking between molding and wall in order to break the seal. With a pry bar and hammer, carefully remove molding. Pry away the doorjamb, framing, and the threshold. Now you can scrape away the old caulking.

, You need to measure the width between the side jambs, the head jamb to the seal under the old threshold, as well as the thickness of the wall. The rough opening needs to be a minimum of 1 inch (2.54cm) wider and taller than the outside of the door system you'll be installing.


Be sure that the rough opening and the subsill (the section of the floor under which the sill will rest) is level. If needed, use shims or a beveled board to level it. If the door needs to clear an especially high floor, like a thick carpet, a spacer board may be needed.

, While you're working you should periodically check with your leveler that everything is staying level. If things aren't level you might end up with a tilted door or frame, which will cause problems later on.


You particularly want to check that the hinge side is level.

, This means that you place the door where it's going to be set to make sure that everything is going to fit properly. If you find any problems at this stage (like the door doesn't fit, things aren't even) then you'll need to deal with those first., Apply two thick beads of caulk, along the front and rear edges of the subsill, where the sill will be placed. Continue applying the caulk approximately 2 inches (5.08cm) up the sides of the rough framing.


This weather-proofs the door opening.

, Place the bottom of the door first, tilting the top out toward you, then slide the door into place. It's best to work from the outside of the house when you're inserting the door into the opening.


You may want to enlist a friend to help you lift and place the door depending on its weight.
Be sure that the door is centered in the opening, and assure that the frame fits snugly into place at the bottom of the opening.

, Place shims on the hinge side of the door, behind any points where hinges will be attached to the door frame. The door will be secured to the rough opening in these areas later.



Arrange the shims and the frame assembly, on the hinge side of the door, until it is plumb in both directions. Ultimately, there should be a continuous gap of about 1/8 inch (0.3175cm) between the edge of the door and the jamb.







, After you've made all of the necessary adjustments, secure the door temporarily, using 16d finishing nails. Lightly drive the nails through the hinge jamb, near where the hinges will be installed. Don't put the nails all the way in.

, It should open and close smoothly. Sometimes pre-hung doors will have an adjustable sill, which can be useful it the door isn't quite adjusted perfectly. You want to make sure that the door doesn't scrap the floor inside your house.


Verify, from the outside, that there is even contact between the door front and the weatherstripping on the section of the frame opposite of the hinge jamb. If necessary, make adjustments by moving the jamb in or out, at the top or the bottom.






Inspect the edges of the inside face of the door. Be sure that there is a continuous gap of 1/8 inch (0.3175cm) between the door edges and the jamb, all the way around the door.







, Drive 3 inch (7.62cm) screws through the shims at the hinge sites on the hinge jamb. Secure the remaining jambs all the way around the door, always driving the screws or nails (whatever is suggested by the manufacturer) through the shims.


Place a solid shim behind the site of the lock strike.
Verify occasionally that the door assembly is remaining properly adjusted. Install the lock strike, putting the screws through the shim.

, Finish the job by installing loosely packed, fiberglass insulation around the edges of the door frame. Install interior trim, following the manufacturer's instructions. Apply paintable caulk along all of the joints and intersections of the trim and the brick-mold.Fill holes left by the screws with wood filler and allow to dry.
Wear gloves, because you do not want to get caulk on your hands.

Install the casing around the installed door.",How to Install an Interior Door," Purchase a door to fit the rough opening in the wall. Doors and door openings are generally standard sizes, generally 24-36"". The framed-in rough opening for the door is always around 2"" wider than the purchased door (not including the jamb around the door). This allows for adjustment when installing the door to achieve plumb ""level"".;
, Start by drawing a plumb line on the wall. Measure 1/2"" in from the rough opening on the hinge side of the door. Using a 6' or 4' level draw a level line down the drywall. You can also use a laser level, which may be easier and more accurate (there are many models that can attach to a wall).

, Attach 6 door installation brackets to the outside of the door jamb, the wood frame to which the door comes pre-attached. Place a bracket behind each of the three hinges. Attach the remaining three brackets on the the other side of the jamb. The first bracket should be 8"" from the top, the next bracket just above the latch stop, and the final bracket 8"" from the bottom of the door.

, Place 1/2"" blocks under the door if a carpet or hardwood is going to be installed or 1/4"" blocks if installing laminate. Never place the door directly on an unfinished floor.

, Using the plumb line on the wall, screw in the top bracket on the hinge side of the door. Then screw in the next 2 brackets using the same reference notch as the first bracket. After the 3 brackets are screwed into the wall using the same reference notch for each, the door is now level. Now check the reveal (gap between door and door jamb) when screwing in each of the final 3 brackets. Start at the top of the door and check the reveal when screwing in the top bracket. Check the reveal when screwing in the final 2 brackets. The door will now be perfectly hung and the blocks under the door can now be removed.

, The casing, also called the trim, is the strips of wood that hide the joints and some parts of the hinge. Done correctly, the trim will perfectly conceal the door installation brackets. Choose casing that compliments your style and cut it using mitered corners or other styles, depending on your preference.

Screen doors are generally sold in standard sizes, so you'll need to find out which standard size is closest to your door size. Find a screen door that comes as close as possible to your door opening at your local home improvement store.









Generally the width is fixed and the height is variable. Buy a door as close as possible to the right height, but keep in mind that some trimming may be needed. Rain caps can be installed if it's too small.;
, Most screen doors, when you buy them, will have a list of necessary tools on the packaging. Gather these tools before you begin. Things like shims, screwdrivers, power drills, rulers, and metal cutters are common.








, Generally, the handle for the screen door should be on the same side as the handle for your main door. However, if the handles will interfere with each other or if the screen door may open and hit a lamp or other object, you can have it open in the other direction.








, If you live in a wet area and your door is unprotected, you'll want to install a drip or rain cap above the door to keep water from getting in. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to install this simple protective device.








, Set the screen door into the door opening, adjusting it so that it is an equal distance from the sides and top to bottom. It should be at least 1/8"" (3.18 mm) off each side and 1/4"" (6.35 mm) off the top and bottom.









Most screen doors come with a sill expander, to help them fit better if they are too small.

, If your screen door is too big, adjust the hinge channel or sill expander by cutting them to the appropriate size. The door can also be cut to size, if it is made of particular materials (but this is not recommended).








, While dry fitting the door, mark the locations for the hinge screws using a pencil. Make sure that the door is in the correct orientation when you do this.








, Set the door on a solid surface, such as a workbench, and install the hinges at the location you marks, being sure to check that the hinges open the correct way.








, Attach the hinges into the correct place on the door jam, at the location you marked earlier. Drill 1/8"" pilot holes and then use the recommended screws to attach the door and hinges to the frame. Screw the bottom hole on the top hinge first, use a level to make sure the door is straight, and then screw in the rest of the holes.









Shims or wedges can help you to hold the door in place while you do this.

, Take out the wedges and install the screen door handle according to the manufacturer's instructions. Many screen doors will already have the handle attached.








, Try using the door, checking to see if it swings open and closed easily.








, Install the automatic door closer, following the manufacturer's instructions.

Screw the doorstop into the hole.",How to Install a Doorstop," There are 2 common types suitable for home use: hinge-mounted and fixed post (also known as wall mounted). Hinge-mounted doorstops remain out of the way and don't require drilling any holes into your wall. Fixed post doorstops require you to drill into your wall to mount them, and are best suited for heavy doors.

, Hinge-mounted doorstops consist of a small metal body, 2 rubber pads (1 of which is adjustable), and a metal ring. They are readily available at hardware stores and will fit nearly any door.

, Close the door on which you are installing the stop, and use a flat-head screwdriver to pry the hinge pin out of the top hinge. Place the tip of the screwdriver underneath the flared top of the hinge pin, and use the screwdriver as a lever to force it out.

, Align the doorstop so that the adjustable rubber pad faces the wall, and the fixed pad sits flush against the door. Hammer the hinge pin back into place.

, Twist the threaded rod attached to the adjustable pad to determine how far the door can be opened. This may require a flat-head screwdriver, or you may be able to grab the pad in your fingers and twist it.

, Fixed post doorstops consist of a short, rigid post with a rubber pad on 1 end. The other end is affixed to your wall or baseboard, usually by drilling a hole and threading the stop into the hole.;
, Using a pencil, mark the point on the baseboard that lines up with the edge of the door. Now mark a second point that is 1.5 inches (38 mm) from this point, towards the door's hinges. Be careful not to mark the point further away from the edge of the door than this, because if the doorstop is installed there it could punch a hole through a hollow-core door.

, Using a drill with a 1/8 inch (3 mm) bit, drill a hole into your baseboard where you drew the second pencil mark.

, The doorstop will have 1 side with a threaded screw protruding from it; screw this end into the hole you drilled by rotating it clockwise until it is flush with the wall.

Do your want the storm door for additional security? For ventilation or energy efficiency? Or do you simply want to create a certain look? You can purchase storm doors made from metal, wood or vinyl/plastic, depending on the look you're trying to achieve.
Decide whether you want a full view, ventilating or rollscreen storm door. Full view has a single pane of glass or a screen, ventilating has two glass panels which slide up or down to expose a screen, and rollscreen has a roll-up screen on a tensioned dowel which gives you the benefit of both full view and ventilating.You will also need to consider your budget. Standard-sized storm doors can cost anywhere from $100-$300 (vinyl or plastic doors tend to be cheaper than hard wood or metal) while custom doors can cost as much as $500.;
, Before you purchase a storm door, you will need to measure the height and width of your current door opening.


This will allow you to choose the right sized storm door from a range of standard sizes, or if your door opening has unusually tall or wide openings, you can use your measurements to order a custom storm door.
To get your measurements, measure the width of the door opening from inside trim to inside trim, and measure the height of the door opening from the threshold to the underside of the header.
Do this in three separate spots for both the width and height and take note of the smallest measurement for each, as this is the one you will be using. For more detailed instructions on how to measure for a storm door, see this article.

, Once you have purchased an appropriate storm door and are ready to install, it's time to gather your tools and materials. You will need:



Materials: Storm door unit, #8 x 1"" screws.

Tools: Power drill, hammer, hacksaw, level, screwdriver, sawhorses, spirit level, measuring tape.
Open up the box containing the storm door unit and find the instruction manual. Cross reference the list of parts on the instructions with the contents of the box to ensure nothing is missing.
As storm door installation varies slightly depending on make and model, check the instructions to see if any additional tools or materials are required.

, Before you begin, you will need to determine which side of the storm door is the hinge side.


Most storm doors will hinge on the same side as the entry door, however in some cases you will need to hinge the door on the opposite side. This may be necessary if there is an obstruction which would prevent the storm door from swinging open on one side, such as a mailbox or porch pillar.
Use a piece of duct tape to mark the hinge side of the storm door. This will save you some confusion later on.

, The drip cap (also known as a rain cap) is the top part of the storm door frame. One side is lined with fuzzy fabric strip which prevents water from leaking in behind the storm door.


Center the drip cap along the top of the door opening, pressing it tightly against the brick mold. Use a pencil to mark where the screws will go, then set the drip cap down and use your power drill to pre-drill the holes.
Reposition the drip cap, then insert a single screw on the hinge side of the door. Leave the other holes un-screwed for now -- you can secure the drip cap fully once the storm door is installed.

Note: The manufacturers of some storm door models only recommend installing the drip cap after the storm door is in place. If this is the case, you should hold off on installing the drip cap for now -- always follow the manufacturers instructions., The hinge-side z-bar is an aluminum component which attaches to the hinge-side of the storm door.


To attach it, lay the door frame on it's side, with the hinge-side facing up. Take the hinge-side z-bar and line it up along the side of the door.
Allow 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) of the z-bar to extend above the top of the door -- this ensures that the top of the door clears the drip cap upon closing.
Use your drill to screw the hinges of the z-bar into the frame of the storm door.

, Once attached, the hinge-side z-bar will usually extend beyond the bottom of the door frame. This excess will need to be removed to ensure that the door frame fits into the opening.


Take your measuring tape and measure the height of the door opening from the threshold to the bottom of the drip cap.
Use this measurement to mark the appropriate point on the hinge-side z-bar with a pencil, then use your hacksaw to cut the bar to length.

, Pick up the storm door and set in into the door opening, making sure that the top of the hinge-side z-bar is flush with the drip cap. If you like, you can use a spirit level to make sure the door is plumb.


Use your drill to secure the top-most hinge with a screw. Ensure that the door is sitting squarely in the opening, then open and close it a couple of times to make sure it swings freely.
Once you are happy with the door's position, secure the remaining hinges using the drill and screws.,


If the fuzzy-looking weather stripping is facing the exterior, the z-bar is right-side up. If it's facing the interior, the z-bar is upside down and you will need to flip it around. Use a piece of duct tape to mark the top end of the bar.
Set the z-bar aside for a moment and use your tape to measure the length of the door opening from the threshold to the underside of the drip cap. Use this measurement to mark and cut the bottom of the z-bar to size using a hacksaw.

, Press the latch-side z-bar against the latch-side of the door opening, making sure the top of the bar is pushed against the underside of the drip cap.


Close the storm door and use your measuring tape to ensure that you have a consistent 3/16"" gap between the latch-side z-bar and the storm door.
Keeping the door closed, drill a pilot hole in the top of the latch-side z-bar and secure with a screw. Repeat at the bottom and in the middle of the z-bar.
At this point you can also finish securing the drip cap.

, How you attach the handle to your storm door will vary according to type of handle provided by the manufacturer.


As a result, you will need to refer to the manufacturer's guide for specific instructions on how to install it.
On a more general note, make sure that the handle of the storm door will not hit against the handle of the entry door when the door is closed. If it does, you will need to reposition the handle.

, The expander sweep is used to close up the gap between the threshold and the bottom of the storm door.


If it's not already attached, slide the black strip of rubber (weather stripping) onto the track, then cut off any excess. Use your pliers to pinch the ends into place.
Slide the expander sweep onto the bottom of the storm door, then get inside and close the door behind you.
Adjust the sweep until it closes as much of the gap beneath the door as possible --this will provide a tighter seal, keeping rainwater out.
Pre-drill two holes, then secure the expander sweep with a screw on either side.

, Attach the closer mechanism to the inside of the storm door, following the manufacturer's instructions.


Some storm door kits will provide two closer mechanisms -- one for the bottom and one for the top of the door.
To adjust the speed of the closing mechanism, you can loosen or tighten a specific screw at the top of the closers. Test the speed by opening the door and allowing it to close on its own., The last step is to install the striker plate. A good tip for getting the alignment just right is to open the storm door and twist the lock.


Now carefully close the door until the protruding lock hits the frame. Use a pencil to mark the points where the top and bottom of the lock hit the frame.
Open the door, and use your pencil to extend these pencil marks into straight, horizontal lines which wrap around the frame. Take your striker plate and use these pencil lines to position it correctly.
Secure the striker plate in place with a number of screws, then close the storm door. Make any necessary adjustments.

It will likely need to be about 6 square feet (1.8 meters), and the bottom of the window opening will need to be no more than 44 inches (1.1 meters) off the floor.
,, You need to do this if you are cutting into a wall that is perpendicular to the floor joists above.

Make a 9-foot-wide (2.7 m) frame out of 2-by-4's, erected about 3 feet (0.9 m) from the where the window will be installed. Erect and secure vertical 2-by-4s inside the frame directly underneath the joists.

,, Use a drill bit that is long enough to go through the wall. Make sure the drill is perfectly level when it penetrates the wall., It needs to be at least 6 inches (15 cm) deeper than the bottom of where the window will be. The hole should be about 4 sq feet (1.2 sq m)., Use the pilot hole as a reference point., Cut only about 1/4 inch (cm) your first time around the lines. Then, after you have established a straight groove for the blade to cut through, make deeper cuts, until you have cut halfway through the wall.

You can rent a concrete saw. Renting a diamond blade is also recommended.
You can use a 12-inch (30 cm) blade if your wall is only 8 inches (20 cm) thick.
Wear hearing and eye protection, a dust mask, and gloves when operating the saw.
Plug the saw into a GFCI outlet.

Use the provided screws to fix the door in the hole.",How to Install a Pet Door or Dog Door1," Pet doors are sold at most retail outlets of a variety of sizes to accommodate for different animals and different door spaces. Typically, they'll be relatively simple to install, made up of only a few parts and a paper of plastic template to mark the hole you'll cut through the door. Other than the pet door kit itself, to do the job properly you'll also need:


Carpenter's level
Pencil or Sharpie marker
Drill and half-inch drill bit
Jigsaw
Screwdriver
Masking tape;
, Decide where on the door you'd like the opening to be and attach the template to the door in that location. It needs to be low enough to the ground that the animal can get through it, so shorter than the pet's legs. For the most part, pet doors will be low and to the side opposite the door handle, though it depends largely on what's on the other side of the door and how you want the pet door to look.


Use masking tape to attach the template to the door in the desired location, using your level to make sure the door is oriented straight and flush with the rest of the door. Use your pencil or marker to trace around the template to create the shape that you'll cut out to make room for the door. Remove the template and discard it.

, To get your cut started, drill completely through the door at each corner of the outline, using a half-inch drill bit. You want the hole to be big enough to maneuver your jigsaw through and cut out the space you outlined with the template.


In some cases, you may have to remove the door entirely from the hinge to cut through it properly, depending on the space and the maneuverability you need. If so, you'll have to remove the hinges from the door and lay it out on some sawhorses, probably, to make the cut. Most of the time, you should be able to leave the door on the hinges.

, If you're right-handed, the easiest way to make the cut is usually to start in the bottom left and work counter-clockwise, going from your drill-hole to drill-hole. Insert the jigsaw in the bottom left hole and turn it on.


Start making your cut across the bottom, going slowly and as smoothly as possible, from the left to the right. Don't slow down so much you start to scorch the wood. Keep it moving at a comfortable pace, but don't go so fast you bog down the motor. Let the saw do the work.

, Continue cutting until you get to the next hole you drilled in the bottom right corner. Turn your saw up and cut vertically, then cut back across to the left and down until you've removed the wood in the outline. With the right tool, it should be a snap and you should be left with a nice, neat, clean hole for the door.

, Most pet doors should come with a small ledge that you can slot through the hole, and a covering that will attach to it, sandwiching the door into the hole securely. The front side of the door frame should have a plastic flap hanging down, which will cover the hole and keep the door ""closed."" On the back side, the covering should have four holes around the perimeter, through which you'll attach the two sides using the screws provided.

, After sandwiching the frame pieces for the pet door into the hole provided, insert the screws one at a time, tightening them loosely with your fingers, before going back around to tighten them. Work your way around, tightening each screw four or five turns at a time, to clamp the two pieces together securely. Keep working until they're tight and the door won't jiggle around.

Remove the door from the hinges and lay it out.,
Trace the template onto the door in the desired location.,
Cut holes with a heavy-duty drill motor.,
Use a commercial-grade cutting jigsaw.,
Clean up the edges with a file.,
Install the door as directed.",How to Install a Pet Door or Dog Door2," The process for cutting a pet door into a metal door is essentially exactly the same as that of a wooden door, except for the tools you'll need. It'll take a lot more power to cut through a steel security door, or some other kind of metal door. Because you'll need to get the right angle on it and be safe, it's better to remove the door and lay it out in a flat position.


Remove the pins from each of the hinges in the door by removing the cap and gently tapping the pin out. Pull the door free and lay it out on two sawhorses placed a foot or two from the top and bottom of the door.

, Just as you would on a wooden door, use your level to place the template straight on the door wherever you want it to be placed. Tape it on and trace it using your marker, then remove the template and discard it.

, To get your cuts started, use a heavy-duty drill to start the holes at each corner of the template as before. With a metal door, it's a better idea to start with a small drill bit, about a quarter-inch or so, and make a pilot hole to open up a space for the larger half-inch hole.


After you've gone around and drilled a pilot hole at each corner, put a larger drill bit in the drill and go back around to open up a half-inch diameter space.

, You'll need a heavy-duty saw to cut through the metal, as well as extreme caution. Make sure you've got a heavy blade in the saw and that you go slowly, so you don't snap the blade while you're making your outline cuts. Go just as you would through a wooden door, starting in the bottom left corner and working your way around from corner-hole to corner-hole.


You'll probably need to hammer out the cut after you've run the saw around it. A few taps should do it, and the loose metal should fall out easily.

, After cutting through the metal, it's likely that the edges will be somewhat rough with burrs and little shards of metal. It's a good idea to use a file and clean up those edges to make sure the pet door fits in securely and safely, and to make sure you or the pet won't catch on any sharp metal pieces while you're working. File off especially large burrs to create a smooth edge.


You don't need to be militant, just gently work off any large burrs you notice from your cuts with the saw. Don't go around so much that you make the hole bigger.

, After the hole has been made, installing the pet door will be exactly the same. Fix both sides into the hole, sandwiching them together and fixing them into place with screws. Hand-tighten them each, one at a time, then work your way back around the screws tightening them until the door is secure and doesn't jiggle in the space.

Mark where the door will go using tape.,
Remove your screen door and lay it flat on the ground.,
Sandwich the screen between the door halves.,
Cut through the screen.,
Hammer the door halves together.,
Reinstall the screen door.",How to Install a Pet Door or Dog Door3," Take some masking tape and mark the required location by sticking tape in an ""X"" shape right on the screen door before you remove anything. This prevents you getting the screen door out and accidentally installing the dog door or pet door on the top instead of the bottom!


Pet doors or dog doors that mount in the sliding screen door are usually installed in the lower left or right corner of the screen door depending on how your patio door opens.

, Take an old rectangular piece of plywood or particle board, slightly larger than the size of the pet door or dog door, and place it underneath the screen door, right behind the spot you marked with masking tape. You will need to hammer on this board so make sure it is flat and secure.

, Take the two halves of your pet door or dog door and place one half behind the screen door and on top of your piece of wood. You may need to put several sheets of wood behind the screen door to get the pet door sandwiched between the screen and the wood so it does not move around easily. Carefully adjust the pet door or dog door frame so it is exactly where you want it. Check the manufacturers instructions to see that it is not upside down or that you have the wrong half in place. Some pet doors have locks which need to be accessible from the inside of the screen door. Check this now.

, Once the pet door or dog door is in position, there is usually a groove in the center of the pet door frame to guide your utility knife as you cut away the screen to make the door opening. Make sure the pet door frame is secure before you cut, and make sure you are cutting in the right groove according to the manufacturers instructions.

, Take the remaining half of the pet door and lay it over the half you have sandwiched between the screen door and the wood blocks. Now you have to hammer the two halves together with a rubber mallet. Hammer with firm blows all around the frame until the two halves are joined together

, You should now have a completed pet or dog door in your screen door. Stand the screen door up test the operation of the pet door. Check the magnetic lock to see if it holds the pet door closed and get your pet to test it out.

If you have a solid wood door, you can place the mail slot anywhere, but if you have a paneled door, you'll need to install it on a strong, non-paneled part of the door. Hold the mail slot at the desired height on the interior side of the door, and make a small pencil mark along the bottom of the mail slot.;
, Measure the width of your door to find the center, and then make a small pencil mark at the height you've chosen for the mail slot.

, Use a measuring tape to measure up from the bottom of the door to the center point at the height you've chosen. Now measure that same distance a few inches to left and right of the center point. The three guide marks will ensure the mail slot is level.

, Measure the width of the mail slot to find its center point and then hold the slot against the door, matching up that point with the center point you marked earlier.

, Keeping the center points of the door and the mail slot lined up, align the bottom of the mail slot with the height marks you made earlier. Then use a pencil to trace the perimeter of the slot.

, Write the measurements down.

, Mark the measurements with a pencil inside the larger outline of the slot. Connect the dots with pencil lines using a ruler.

, Starter holes are necessary to enable you to cut the hole with a jigsaw. Fit your drill with a large, flat drill bit (a paddle bit) about 30 mm wide. Drill four holes straight through the door, starting each hole just inside each corner of the flap outline. Drill until the bit begins to come out the other side of the door. Then drill through each hole from the other side of the door, and blow the sawdust out of the holes.

, Insert the jigsaw into one of the four starter holes, and carefully cut all around the penciled-in outline of the inner flap. Try to keep the saw right on the line all the way around. When you've finished, push the chunk of wood out of the door.

, Use sandpaper to make sure the inside of the hole and the edges around it are smooth.

, Precisely measure in from the edges to the center of the bolt fixtures (lugs) on the back of the mail slot, and then mark this position within the outline on the door.

, Determine the size of the bolts or that will go into the lugs--the directions included with your mail slot should have this information--and attach a twist bit (a screw-type drill bit) of this same size to your drill. Drill a hole through the door on the marks you made for the lug holes.

, Fit your drill with a flat (paddle) bit that is about the same size as the lugs on the mail slot. Position this bit at the center of each hole you made in the last step, and drill only halfway through the door. It's important to keep your hole level, so drill slowly and carefully.

,, Push the slot into the door from the outside of the door. The inner flap should fit perfectly in the hole you cut, and the bolts should go through the bolt holes all the way through the door.

, The bolts should protrude out of the door only far enough so that the nuts can be securely screwed onto them. If they protrude farther, trim them.


Mark where to cut. Press the nut flat against the door next to the bolt. Use a pencil to mark the depth of the nut on the bolt. Do this for each bolt.
Use a small hacksaw to cut through the bolt at the mark.

,, Push the draft excluder into the inner flap hole on the inside of the door, and use a drill to attach it to the door with screws.

, Can you easily slip mail through the slot? Thought so!

Light colors work anywhere, but dark colors require rooms with lots of windows and natural light. Painting a basement den a deep blue might sound relaxing but can turn the room into a dungeon!
If you're preparing a house for sale, stay with neutral colors that could match any decoration or furniture.
If you're e-savvy, take digital photographs of the rooms in question and adjust the colors with your favorite photo editing program. This will ensure you and everyone involved know exactly what the room will look like.
If you're transforming your home for yourself, live a little. Go nuts. Like a color? Be bold. If you don't like it, guess what? You can paint it again. Feeling artistic? Plan a mural. It's your place. The only person who has to like it is you (and the people who live with you!).
Complementary colors work well when adjacent rooms open to each other (try two shades of the same color for a neat effect). You can go for bold contrast when crossing a barrier (like a door).
Carefully consider the gloss level. The shiny gloss paints are easy to clean, but will make any wall blemish stand out. The flat paints will help disguise wall blemishes, but can be difficult to clean. Generally, you'll want glossier paints where there's lots of steam or cooking (baths and kitchens) and in high-traffic areas. Flatter paints are preferred for large walls and ceilings.
Consult a professional home decorator to guide you.;
, There are probably others in your life who have a vested interest in your home. Get their consensus.

, Estimate the area you'll need to cover. Measure the height and width of each wall. In the U.S., coverage estimates are given in square feet, everywhere else on the planet uses the metric system. To find the area of a given wall, simply multiply the height by the width.


Keep a detailed list you and others can make sense of like ""Living. Rm. west wall 112 sq. ft.""
Don't forget to subtract for windows and doors.
As you estimate, err on the high side (round up). It's better to have too much paint than to
run short.
Determine the coverage area for each color and estimate the number of gallons you'll need for each. For odd walls with angled ceilings, make your best guess. If you're not comfortable doing this, measure the wall at its highest height and multiply that by its width. Now subtract the lowest height from the highest height, multiply that number by the width, cut that answer in half, and finally subtract that new number from the original height by width. That should give you the wall area.Formulae:
Basic wall: F = B x H
Wall with windows: F = B x H - (winB x winH)
Wall with multiple windows: F = B x H - Wall with angled ceiling:
highH x B = a
(highH - lowH) x B = n
F = a - n/2
Wall with angled ceiling and a window: (a - n/2) - (winB x winH)


, Costs will vary greatly, depending on price and quality. Choosing mid to upper-grade paint, expect to pay in the area of $350.00 in paint alone for a 2000 sq. ft. house. Add another $100 to $200 in brushes, rollers, pans, tape, and other materials. Don't forget food, if you plan to feed your workforce. When it comes to materials, not all paints are equal. Some truly cover with one coat, some say they do but don't. Your costs will double if you have to apply two coats to everything, so buying the cheaper paint might cost more in the long run. Trust your paint professional salesman (to a certain degree) to tell you which paint to buy. You can generally go cheap on primer, expensive on top coats.

, Get a grip on the time it will take to bring the project to fruition. Plan for time to move furniture, wall prep, cut in, the painting itself, eating and breaks, and don't forget cleanup and bringing furniture back in. As you plan, err on the side of prudence. Unforeseen events will slow you down, so allow time for these. Remember, this is a multi-day project. Don't try to fit too much into a day. If you move faster than planned, great!

, If you intend to not hire a professional crew, you'll need lots of help. There are many jobs to be done. First there's the furniture moving, then wall preparation, floor covering, materials gathering and prep, cleaning, and don't forget everyone will have to eat. It can easily take a team of five people a full ten days to paint a two-story (approx 2000 sq.ft.) home. Get as many people to help as you can. If some can only come one or two days, great. Maybe others can fill in. Ensure you plan with your workforce members in mind. They'll need plenty of time to arrange days away from work. Identify a few key personnel:


The Cutters. Someone with meticulous attention to detail and a steady hand should be assigned the job of ""cutting in,"" or painting a straight edge where needed, such as along a wall where the ceiling does not get painted. Many products are available to assist, but none work as well as a person who's good at doing it freehand. Ensure this person is skilled (ask them to show you). A poor, jagged, wavy or splotched cutting-in job will jump out at you every time you walk by it. Why more than one cutter? This job is nerve-wracking and painful to hands and arms after a few days. You'll want to give this person a break after a few walls.
The Trimmers. Designate some folks to do the trim enamel on baseboards, windows and door frames. These also require careful attention.
The Coordinator. This person will care for the needs of the rest of the workforce, fetch drinks, make sandwiches, make runs to the store for last-minute needs, cook (or arrange) lunch and dinner, make phone calls, get directions, wash brushes, etc. Don't underestimate the need for this key person! When not gainfully employed, he or she can do some rolling.

The Rollers. You should actually only need a few of these, as they can cover a large area fairly quickly.
The Caulkers. Caulking and hole patching (spackling) is an important job that must be done before you begin painting (with adequate time to dry and sand).

, Seriously, empty the room. Simply moving everything to the middle of the room is not good enough. Rent a storage space and spend a day filling it up. Keep the tables and things you can put paint cans on, but everything else has got to go.

, Wash the walls, remove wallpaper, patch, spackle, seal stains, dry and sand before you attempt to paint. Now is also the time to apply painters tape for trimming, lay drop cloths, etc. You can also buy your paint at this time. Don't wait until the last minute. It can take hours to mix many gallons of all your colors. Remember that traffic triples at your home-supply and hardware stores on weekends. Buy on a weekday if possible.

, Ventilation will help things dry faster and keep the air fresh for your workforce. If dust or other airborne particles are prevalent, find another ventilation system.

, Dark colors, stains (once sealed), and previously unpainted surfaces (drywall, spackle, etc.) will need a primer coat, usually white. NOTE: most paint stores & home improvement centers will now tint primer (at no charge) to match fairly close to the color of the finished coat, that way two coats of primer need not be applied. Although not all surfaces need a prime coat, skip this step at your peril! Dark colors will likely show through the first -- or even the first couple-- topcoats of paint. Sealants and unpainted surfaces like spackle patches will absorb or repel moisture in a topcoat at a different level than the areas surrounding them. Applying a good primer coat will help even out these differences. Primer equalizes a wall to a uniform surface. It's like erasing a canvas before drawing a new picture. Although some will argue the point, you generally don't need to spend a great deal on primer or buy special primer. A cheap, 5 gallon (18.9 L) bucket of plain, flat white paint will usually do the trick and cover a large area. Give your primer at least 24 hours to dry (follow its instructions) before applying a topcoat.


Priming is compulsory if you're painting over a darker color, or on a new drywall, but it's a good idea to include this step before any paint job. A primer is necessary because it blocks any stains from bleeding through. It is also important because it prevents any blisters and paint-peeling by improving paint adhesion. Lastly, primer is a good idea as it allows complete single-coat coverage of the walls. If you want a better appearance, you can tint your primer with the final color you intend on using on the walls. Most paints today come with inbuilt primers, but an old school primer is still a better option. Before you start painting, remember to use painter's tape to cover your door frames, window sills, and any switches on the wall.

, Start with the largest or most difficult room first. Putting it off until last will make you dread getting to it. See How to Paint a Room for instructions on how to specifically paint walls and rooms. Consult the Related wikiHows below for additional help.


Using a two-inch angled brush, start by painting your corners and around the trim. You should paint a border of at least 2 or 3 inches (5.1 or 7.6 cm) from the corners, doors, and moldings. Since a paint roller won't be able to get the paint into the edges, the angled brush ensures that the paint is spread evenly on your walls.
Use a roller to paint the rest of the wall. A good method to use is the 'W method'. You start by painting a large 3 foot (0.91 m) square W on the wall. Then, without lifting the roller, you fill in the W. You can paint a wall section-by-section, and do the walls one at a time for best results. It's generally a good idea to use an extension pole for your roller instead of standing on a ladder. Make sure that neither the extension pole nor the roller has plastic handles, as plastic handles are flexible and this makes it difficult to control the painting.
While the paint is still wet, remove any painter's tape from the wall and trim. Removing it while it's dry can pull the paint off the wall, and make your effort useless.

, Ensure all your materials are cleaned and properly disposed of.

, If you plan on changing the floors, do them after the walls. You will make a mess when painting an entire house. You don't want paint on your new carpet.

, Especially if they're a volunteer workforce. Your call here, but err on the side of generosity.

Take measurements of the space.
Take notes of existing decorations and colors.
Think of any possible layouts for a decal.;
, Locate a decal that will be the best fit for your space. Use your measurements and notes about your space to help your selection.


Try to find colors that work well together.
Find the right size decal for the space.
Think about how the decals shape and design will make the space feel.
Select a decal that you will enjoy!

, Removing any dirt or oil from the surface is very important. Making a clean surface will allow the decal to adhere properly. Leaving dirt or oil behind will cause the decal to adhere to them, rather than the wall.








Remove dirt and oil for best application.
Remove dirt with a damp sponge.
Use a small amount of soap to remove oil.
Be sure the wall is dry before placing the decal.

, Double check the decal is going to look great in the place you have selected. Removing a decal is possible, but most will not be reusable. Ensure that you are satisfied with where you are considering placing the decal to avoid ruining it.








Leave the paper backing on and temporarily tape the decal to the wall.
Step back and examine how the decal fits the space.
Make any adjustments until you are happy with how it looks.

, Get your ruler and a pencil ready. Use your initial placement of the decal to help you as you draw a light guideline. This guideline will show you exactly where to place the decal when you apply it.


Hold your level flat against the wall.
Move the levels ends up or down, left or right, until the air bubble is centered.
Draw a light line on the wall, along the edge of the level, to make your guideline.

, Placing the decal requires accuracy and focus. Stick the decal as close as you can to the guideline you created for it.









Remove the covering that protects the adhesive side of the decal.
Line up the decal with your guideline.
Carefully stick the decal to the area you have selected.
Work slowly and take your time to ensure accuracy.

, Using a squeegee, smooth the surface and remove any air bubbles that may be present. Leaving air bubbles can cause an uneven finish and improper adherence to a surface.Work from the middle and move outwards.
Always push air bubbles outwards towards an edge to remove them.
Aim for as smooth a surface as you can.

, Paper backing protects the face of your decal, but now it's time to unveil your new decal. Removing the paper backing will let you see the final and full effect of the decal on your space.








Peel paper backing from decal slowly and carefully.
Dampen the paper with water if you are having trouble removing it.
If the decal pulls off with the paper backing, stop, and carefully reapply that area.

Inspect the bathroom.,
Use food coloring.,
Remove the toilet.,
Get a good sized sponge and a bucket like the kind you use for washing a car.,
The next step is to get the johnny bolts free.,
Now that the toilet is free, it is time to lift it off.,
Move the toilet out of the way and set it on some newspapers.,
Use a stick or disposable putty knife to scrape all of the remaining wax that is on the floor flange off and throw it away.,
Go to the hardware store.,
Place the new johnny-bolts into the keyhole slots in the floor flange.,
When you have the toilet lined up, slide each 2x4 out from under the toilet and its should sit down flush with the floor.,
Finger tighten the johnny bolts.,
Finally, use the Teflon tape on the toilet water supply and re-attach the supply line.",How to Know when a Wax Ring Is Bad," Determine if the Wax ring is possibly bad by inspecting the floor for water or a foul odor of sewer gas.
, If are unsure of where water is coming from you can add food coloring to the toilet tank. If the floor's water is the same color, then you likely will need to install a new wax ring., Begin by shutting off the water at the shutoff behind the toilet. Flush the toilet now. Then remove the supply line. You may want to reuse the line if it a new flexible type, but if it's an old solid draw tube type, it is easiest to cut it with a tubing cutter and replace it with a flexible type.

, Use the sponge to get the remaining water out of the tank and bowl. There is a trap built into the toilet, so be aware there may be some remaining water in the toilet even after you do this. This will be important later when you go to move the toilet.

, These are the bolts that hold the toilet down on the floor. Sometimes they can just be removed with a deep well socket, but many times they are corroded and have to be cut or broken off. There are many ways to cut these bolts, but the best way I have found is with a rotary tool or one of the new vibrating tools. Cut next to the base of the toilet, not underneath. There is a flange that the toilet bolts to underneath of the toilet. If you mess this up it has to be replaced and the part can be expensive and is a pain to change.

, This is not the easiest endeavor. You want to try to keep the toilet level so the remaining water does not come out of the trap. You can rock it forward to break it free of the wax ring, but try to lift it level.

, There will be remaining wax on the bottom of the toilet and if you set it on the floor, it'll make a mess.

, Clean the floor flange as thoroughly as you possibly can. You must now also tilt the toilet and get the underside clean.

, You need 2 new johnny bolts, a new toilet supply line if you are changing it, Teflon tape and a Neoprene floor gasket. Do not get a wax ring. Wax rings are a pain if you do not do this every day. With a wax ring, when it comes time to set the toilet to the floor, you have one chance to get it right. If everything is not lined up perfectly, you have ruined the ring and now have to go get another. The rubber gasket allows you to adjust the toilet into place until everything lines up. Make sure you don't put the gasket in upside down. It will fit the flange very well one way, and not well at all the other.

, Place the rubber gasket over the bolts. It will help to hold the bolts upright to mount the toilet. Place two 12"" long 2x4 scraps on either side of the flange. Place the toilet one these boards and lie on your stomach in front of the toilet so you can line up the toilet.

, If it does not, double check to see if your flange connection is aligned. If it is still crooked but you are sure you have a good connection you will need to use a shim under the lip of the toilet base to level the toilet after you have put some tension on the johnny-bolts.

, When you are sure that the bolts are where you want them, you can use a wrench. You can not level a toilet by tightening the johnny-bolts. Do not over-tighten them, because you can crack the toilet, but you are more likely to break the flange. See #4.

, Turn on the water and check for leaks. If there are no leaks, you are done.

Place a mirror along the wall in a narrow kitchen.,
Fake a window using a mirror.,
Add a mirror above your bed.,
Use floor length mirrors behind furniture.,
Place a mirror near or in an art display.",How to Use Mirrors to Create More Space1," If you have a narrow kitchen, it can easily feel cramped and uncomfortable. A longer mirror strategically placed along one wall can make a small kitchen feel bigger. Place a mirror running horizontally along one wall of your kitchen, keeping it above cabinets and other furniture so it's visible.You can buy a long mirror at a department store. Hang it alongside one wall in your kitchen. You will be surprised at how much bigger it looks.
A single mirror in the kitchen is usually suitable to make your space look bigger. More than one mirror may overwhelm in the kitchen.;
, Windows can often make a small room feel larger. If you have a room with only one window, you can use a mirror to create the illusion of a window in your living space.Place a mirror directly across from one window in your home.
The mirror will reflect images of outdoors, doubling the natural light in the room. It will also make the window-less wall look less closed off.

, If you have a small bedroom that's bothering you, try hanging a large mirror over your bed. Place a bigger mirror just above your headboard. If you don't have a headboard, you can simply keep the mirror a few feet up from the end of your mattress.A mirror over your bed creates a sense of depth. This can make a small bedroom feel bigger.
Keep the mirror on the wall of your bedroom and not the ceiling.

, In a small space, furniture may feel cramped or cluttered. This issue can easily be corrected by placing large mirrors just behind big pieces of furniture.Choose floor-length mirrors the same width as your furniture. Place the mirrors just behind the furniture so the top sticks out.

, Densely packed collections of paintings and objects can look cramped. Try inserting small mirrors in areas where you display artwork.If you display artwork on a shelf, use one of the drawers in the shelf to display a mirror. You can also place a standing mirror behind a piece of artwork on a mantel.
If you have paintings or other artwork hung up on a wall, hang a mirror next to the paintings as well.

Install mirror doors on your closet.,
Use a mirror backsplash.,
Add mirrors to cabinet drawers.,
Make use of mirrored tiles.",How to Use Mirrors to Create More Space2," A small closet can make you feel claustrophobic. Have mirror doors installed on your closet, as this can create the illusion of extra space.Closet doors can also create extra room in your home because you do not need to take up space with floor mirrors.
If you don't have the time or money for a full installation, you can purchase a hanging mirror at a department store and hang it over the door.

, A kitchen backsplash can be made into a mirror to make a small kitchen look larger. If you're renovating, consider a reflective back splash to make the most of your space.In addition to creating the illusion of more space, mirror back splashes are fairly easy to clean.

, If you have a tiny kitchen or bathroom, have mirrors installed on the doors of cabinets. This can be done by simply gluing mirrored tiles or small mirrors to the front of your cabinets. This will make your kitchen feel slightly more open., Mirror tiles can be purchased at most home improvement stores. You can create a mirror wall in one room by glueing or nailing mirror tiles to the wall. You can also use them in spaces that feel cramped. For example, in a small bathroom try putting up mirrored tiles adjacent to the shower."

Be strategic about where you place mirrors.,
Do not go overboard with mirrors in the kitchen.,
Avoid ceiling mirrors.",How to Use Mirrors to Create More Space3," Do not simply hang up your mirrors everywhere in your home. Always take into account what the mirror is reflecting before hanging it up. You want to use mirrors to maximize light sources and emphasize space.Mirrors should reflect a light source in order to brighten a room by creating more light. A mirror facing a blank wall will not do much to brighten your space. Instead, place a mirror across from a window or a well-lit area in your home.
You should also avoid placing mirrors in areas where they will reflect things like furniture and clutter. You do not want a mirror to make a room look more cluttered. Instead of having a mirror facing a somewhat messy desk, have it reflect a sleek mantel that only holds a few decorative items.

, One strategically placed mirror in the kitchen is enough to make the room more open. Too many mirrors can be overwhelming and even look tacky. Mirrors are not usually necessary in the kitchen, so more than one mirror may look odd to visitors.For example, if you opt for a horizontal mirror running down one wall, do not put a mirror on the opposite wall. The effect will be overwhelming.

, Ceiling mirrors are no longer in fashion. They were popular in the '70's, but many decorators find them tacky. Also, mirrors on the ceiling will not do much to create the illusion of space. Stick to hanging mirrors on the wall.Mirrors can be great in your bedroom if you want to create more space there, as well as more light. A full-length mirror near your closet can work great if it, say, reflects a window or a lamp.

Space out lights.,
Switch out the lightbulbs.,
Enhance natural light with the right drapes.,
Use battery operated lights.,
Add lamps.,
Use string lighting.",How to Brighten Up a Rental Home1," If you have additional lamps to add to your rental property, or if the property came partially furnished, spacing out lighting can go a long way to brightening the place up. If you have all your lighting concentrated in a single room, this can make the rest of the home dim.Keep lamps on opposite sides of the room so everything is brightened.
Avoid keeping all your lamps in one room. Make sure there are lamps in the living room, kitchen, and hallways.;
, Oftentimes, the lightbulbs in place in a rental are not that bright. Simply switching out all the lightbulbs can do wonders to keep your living space bright. Stop by a local department or grocery store and purchase lightbulbs with higher wattage. Replace all the lightbulbs in your rental unit with brighter ones when you get home. You will see a noticeable difference in brightness.For the brightest bulbs, go for LED bulbs. They tend to be the brightest and longest lasting bulbs. They range in wattage, so opt for higher wattage over lower wattage.There is no precise wattage that is recommended, and it depends on personal preference, but in general a higher wattage will produce a brighter light. Lightbulbs generally range from 15 to 150 watts.

, Drapes can block out natural light. Dark colored drapes can also make rooms look darker. Swapping out dark drapes for brightly colored ones can make a huge difference in your home's brightness.You can get cheap, light colored blinds at a store like Ikea.
Use these blinds to cover up dull beige or off-white blinds.
You can also ask your landlord if you can temporarily uninstall blinds in your unit. This way, you can replace dull blinds altogether.

, You can install small lamps or lights that you can attach to your walls. These lights are usually battery operated, and some come with adhesives that allow you to simply attach them to the wall.You can add these lamps to corners that get dark easily. They work great in kitchens, as you can put them near the stove or in pantries.
You can also place battery operated lights on your walls, so you can have a light hanging over a dark room.

, Lamps are a great addition to a darker apartment. You can buy lamps fairly cheap if you go to a store like Ikea or search for lamps in a thrift store. You can buy standing lamps, or lamps you can place on counters and night stands.A lamp on, say, a nightstand in the bedroom or a end table on the sofa can make for a great reading space.

, If you want as much floor space as possible, buy string lighting. Christmas lights can be strung up on your walls, allowing you to brighten your home without adding extra clutter.It may be particularly cheap to look for string lighting just after the holiday season.

Add rugs.,
Add functional décor.,
Add fresh flowers and plants.,
Position mirrors strategically to increase lighting.,
Put artwork and photographs on display.,
Try removable wallpaper.",How to Brighten Up a Rental Home2," Many rental homes have dull carpeting or floors. This can make the whole room look darker. A few colorful rugs can cover up a dull floor, brightening up the room.Some floor rugs can be quite pricey. However, there are ways to cut down on cost.
Shop at secondhand stores or discount department stores. You may also be able to find fairly cheap rugs at larger retail stores.

, If you're in a smaller rental space, adding additional decoration may add clutter. You also may not want to spend a lot of money buying brightly colored decorations to lighten up a room. However, colorful objects you use regularly can be displayed decoratively when not in use.If you have colorful dishes, set them out in a cabinet in your kitchen. This can brighten up the kitchen and, when necessary, you can simply grab a dish out of the cabinet to use.
Toiletries that come in fancy containers, such as a nice perfume, can be set out in your bathroom for decoration.
If you have vases, put them out when they're empty. A nice white vase can brighten up the room and, in the event you need to use it, it will already be sitting out.

, You can buy flowers and plants at a local greenhouse. As long as you water and care for them, plants can brighten up your home for quite awhile. Some brightly colored flowers or nice green plants set out around your home can make everything look a little brighter.If space is an issue, you can hang plants from the ceiling rather than taking up floor space.
Plants that produce vines, such as philodendron and heartleaf, do not require a lot of light to thrive.Parlor palms, Boston furs, corn plants, and prayer plants also require little light.

, Mirrors can make great decorations. When set in the right place, they reflect lighting and increase the brightness in your room. Stop by a local furniture store, supermarket, or retail show and buy a few attractive mirrors for your home.Place mirrors in front of lights. They can reflect lights back into the room, doubling the effect.
Mirrors are a great idea if you don't have a lot of floor space for extra lamps.

, Colorful artwork and photographs can easily brighten up a dull white or beige wall. If you don't have any artwork on hand, look into secondhand shops and local art shows. Buy a few colorful paintings or other pieces of art and pin them up on your wall.If a lot of your photos are still on your phone or camera, many chain drug stores have photo stations where you can print out pictures.
If you're nailing anything to the wall, make sure the lease allows you to make holes in your dry wall.

, You usually cannot paint over walls, or put up wallpaper. However, you can order removable wallpaper online or buy some at a local craft store. You can easily place strips of removable wallpaper on dull white or beige walls. This will brighten up your apartment without breaking the lease. When you're ready to move out, the wallpaper is easy to remove."

Paint old furniture in brighter shades.,
Go for glass furniture.,
Cover ugly countertops.,
Position furniture in a way that doesn't block out light.",How to Brighten Up a Rental Home3," If you have older pieces of furniture, such as furniture you got at a local thrift store, try painting it. A dull wooden chair can be painted a bright, pastel color to brighten up your apartment. The black legs on a dully colored couch can also be painted in bright colors.If you really want to get creative, try adding designs to furniture. You can apply a stencil to a chair or stool, for example.

, If you can find affordable glass furniture, this can really brighten up a dully colored room. A glass coffee table, end table, or kitchen table can really add some light to your space. In addition to this, you'll be able to see the floor though the glass. This can make your space look less cluttered., In rental kitchens, your counters may be darker colored. This can make your whole kitchen look dull. Place decorate plates or trays on countertops. You can also try an attractive cutting board made of light colored wood., Be careful when arranging a rental space. Where you put your furniture can make a huge impact on lighting. Try to keep chairs, sofas, and other items of furniture away from windows.Experiment a little as you set out furniture. Tweak your set up quite a few times until you get the right look.

Buy the right gas pipes and fittings for the job.,
Turn off the gas to your house.,
Extend your existing gas line by fitting the valves and pipe lengths you need to add a gas line that will reach your new appliance.,
Use a flexible pipe to connect the end of your new gas line to the appliance.,
Spread a mixture of 1:1 water and dish liquid over each seam in your gas line.,
Turn the gas back on by returning the valve to parallel to the incoming pipe.",How to Install a Gas Line," Most domestic gas lines use 1/2-inch (1.27 cm) through 1 1/2 inch (3.81 cm) black pipe, while large commercial projects sometimes use larger fittings up to 8 inch. You should buy a total pipe length of 6 to 12 inches (15.24 to 30.48 cm) longer than you need to account for pipe overlap and waste.;
, The valve will be at your gas meter on the side of your house and should shut off entirely with a quarter-turn. A position perpendicular to the pipe indicates a closed valve, but you should double-check by confirming that the meter is no longer moving.

Coat the threads of the pipe ends using pipe glue or tape. This is essential to establishing an airtight fit. If using tape, be sure that you wrap in a clockwise direction.
You can make your job easier by assembling some lengths of your gas line in your garage or shop, then moving them to the crawl space or wall where your gas lines run. Be wary of 90-degree bends if you do this, since those make turning the pipe to tighten it in exponentially more difficult.

, Thread it onto the end of the gas line using pipe glue or tape, just as with all the other connections. However, you will rarely need the pipe glue or tape for the final attachment to the appliance itself.

, If bubbles appear, you have a leak. Unscrew that section, strip off the pipe glue, and reattach with new sealant.

, Test your appliance to ensure the gas is flowing properly.

Remove excess penetrant using a clean, dry, lint free cloth.,
Apply non-aqueous developer.,
The evaluation should occur using the proper lighting.",How to Inspect Parts Using Dye Penetrant," Allow the part to dry. Drying can occur using a hair-dryer or in air. If air-dried, allow enough time for the cleaning agent to evaporate from the defects. This may take several hours depending on the ambient temperature and cleaning material used on the part.;
, This can be accomplished by spraying, brushing, dipping, etc. Allow the penetrant material to sit for a minimum of 10 minutes. Do not let the penetrant sit on the surface for longer than 2 hours as drying may occur. The part and penetrant should beat a temperature between 50 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

, Remove as much penetrant as possible using as many cloths as necessary. This is followed by wetting a lint free cloth with a solvent. The cloth must be damp or moist. A cloth dripping with solvent will wash the penetrant material out of the defect and make the test ineffective. Allow the solvent to dry before the next step.

, The developer usually come in a spray can and is normally white. Apply a light coating holding the can about 6 to 12 inches (15.2 to 30.5 cm) from the surface. You should see visual evidence of the metal surface showing after applying the developer. Too thick of a coat will make the test ineffective.

, Bright white light for visible dye penetrants and UV light for fluorescent type penetrants. Evaluating the results. This is the most difficult part of the testing process. Most people do not have a lot of experience with the different defect types, for example, porosity, shrink, cracks, etc.Porosity is typically round and easily defined, while shrink can look like a big blob of residual penetrant. Solvent wiping can help in determining the defect type and if the indication you are seeing is from a real defect or just an anomaly not associated with a defect. Solvent wiping is achieved by wiping the area of interest with a cloth dampened with solvent. Do not flood the area with solvent or allow solvent to run or pool on the surface as this may washout the defect and make it undetectable. As soon as the wiping occurs you can look at the indication to determine defect type

Purchase a section of wooden trellis.,
Cut the wooden wall trellis into three equal pieces, vertically.,
Reattach the pieces to form the divider.,
Weave dried plant parts, one beside other, through the frame squares.,
Put the divider up where you need it.",How to Make a Small Space Divider1," It should be of a decent height (tall enough for it to make a break in vision, and if possible, higher than the average person).;
, These pieces will be joined together again in a way that allows them to be bent or folded.

, Tie the first piece with the second piece, then tie the second piece with the third, using wire or rope.

, Add more of this material until the plants completely cover the trellis.


The dried plant parts are best when they are of the same height (or longer) as the divider you are going to make.
Live plant vines could also be used but they're trickier and you will need to place the container growing the plant down in its final place before weaving. Moreover, moving the divider is much harder when you do this, so it's best for a more ""permanent"" divider, such as for an office.
Instead of dried plant parts, you can use artificial floral items, such as long leaves, etc.

, Angle the three partitions so that the divider stands in place unaided. Plant containers or similar weighted objects can be used to prevent the divider from falling over if accidentally knocked.

Address problems with hot water supply.,
Check for leaky pipes.,
Test your toilet for leaks.,
Check the water meter to rule out leaks.,
Confirm the shut off valve is completely open.,
Inspect the Pressure Reducing Valve.,
Test your water softener.",How to Increase Water Pressure2," If only your hot water taps have low pressure, look for a problem at your water heater. Here are the most common problems:Sediment clogging the water heater or the hot water supply line. flush the tank, then hire a plumber if that doesn't work. To prevent this happening again, replace the anode rod regularly and consider Installing a water softener.
Hot water supply pipes that are too small. In most cases the pipe leading from your water heater should have at least a ¾"" (19mm) diameter.
Leaks in the valves or the tank itself. Only attempt to repair these yourself if the leak is minor and you have experience with plumbing projects., Leaks are a common cause of low pressure. Conduct a quick check for damp spots beneath pipes, especially at the main supply line. Fix any leaky pipes you encounter.


The supply line typically enters the house from the side in mild climates, or from the basement floor in cold climates.
Small damp spots may be caused by condensation. Put down a couple paper towels and come back the next day to see if they are wet. If they are, you have a problem.

, A leaky toilet mechanism fails to block the flow from the tank to the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank, and come back after an hour or two without flushing the toilet. If the food coloring has entered the bowl, your toilet needs a repair. Typically, all it needs is a new flapper or another cheap and easy fix.If you can hear your toilet running constantly, that's definitely a drain on your pressure. Learn how to fix it.

, If you still haven't found any leaks, it's time to check your water meter to confirm or deny their existence. Shut off all water in the house, then read the meter. There are two ways to check for leaks using the meter:


If the small triangular or disk-shaped dial on the meter is spinning, water is still flowing. Assuming everything is shut off properly, you have a leak.
Write down the reading, wait a couple hours without using any water, then check again. If you get a different reading, you have a leak.

, Look for the master shutoff valve near your water meter. If it's been knocked to a partially closed position, turn it back to fully open. This is rarely the problem, but it only takes a few minutes to test.

, Homes on low ground often have a PRV installed where the line enters the building. This valve, usually shaped like a bell, reduces the supply of water to a safe pressure for your building. On a typical model, you can turn the screw or knob at the top of the PRV clockwise to increase water pressure.It's best to turn this only a couple times, keeping track of the number of turns. Going too far can damage your plumbing.If adjusting the PRV doesn't make any difference, shut off the water supply and disassemble the valve. You may need to replace a part or the entire valve, or just clean the parts. Finding manufacturer instructions is recommended.
Not all homes have a PRV, especially if the city water supply is low pressure or the building is on high ground.

, If your home has a water softener installed, try setting it to ""bypass."" If the pressure improves, have someone inspect your softener for issues."

Replace old supply pipes.,
Check pipe size.,
Address poor city supply with a water pressure booster.,
Test the supply pressure yourself.",How to Increase Water Pressure3," Locate the main supply line at the side of your house, or in the basement if you live in a cold climate. If your supply pipe is silver and magnetic, with threaded fittings, it's galvanized steel. Old galvanized pipes often clog with mineral buildup or corrosion, slowing water flow. Replacing these with copper or plastic pipes may solve your problem.

, A small pipe can cause problems if it can't meet your water needs. As a rule of thumb, the supply pipe diameter should be at least ¾"" (19mm), or 1"" (25mm) if it serves a 3+ bathroom home, while ½"" (13 mm) pipes should only serve one or two fixtures.A plumber can give you a more specific recommendation based on your water use.


PEX pipes have especially thick walls, and therefore a smaller inner diameter. If you're replacing a metal pipe with PEX, use a larger size than the original., If you've always had this problem, phone your water supply company and ask for your neighborhood's ""static water pressure.""If the answer is below 30 psi (2.1 bar / 21 meters of head), the city supply could be the problem.Purchase and install a water pressure booster to address this, or continue tot he next step.



Warning: If you have corroded or clogged pipes, boosting water pressure could damage or break them.Higher supply pressures may still be inadequate for a multi-story house or a house on a hill. 60 psi (4.1 bar / 42 meters of head) should be plenty even in these situations.If your water supply comes from a well or gravity flow system, leave pressure adjustments to a professional., Find a pressure gauge that attaches to a hose bib from a hardware store. Make sure nothing in your home is using the water supply, including ice makers and running toilets. Attach the gauge to the hose bib to read the pressure.If the pressure is lower than the water service claimed, it may be an issue with the water main. Talk to your water service and/or the local water municipality to find out whether you can get them to repair it.
If you can't get the service to repair it, install a water pressure booster.
Water pressure fluctuates along with demand. Try again at a different time of day to get a more accurate sense of the range.

Find a bundle of old, unwanted vinyl records.,
Select a color of contact paper that suits your room or area.,
Measure a round section of contact paper over a record.,
Carefully peel off the backing of the contact paper and apply to each side of the first record.,
Use a long piece of thick wire, such as from a wire coat hanger, to make holes.,
Join the divider together.,
Hang the divider.,
Done.",How to Make a Small Space Divider3," The ""unwanted"" is an important part! Each record should be the same size, unless you're planning on deliberately using a big-small-big, etc. pattern. That's up to you.


The amount of records you'll need depends on how much space you are trying to cover. If you are hanging them from the ceiling to say, sofa level, count on about eight records of large size for the vertical drop, then as many of these rows of eight as you need to cover the space to be divided. This could be a lot of records, so visit the local thrift store if you haven't got that many stashed away.

, Contact paper is the best way to cover the records and make them all the same color.


Prints are also possible but bear in mind that your room decor must be matched nicely.

, This forms your template piece for records of that size. Use this to make as many circles as needed for the amount of records (one piece each side).

, Smooth out all bubbles and wrinkles so that the contact paper sits perfectly flat. Meet the edges of each side of each circle with care. Repeat for all records.

, Mark four holes at even quarter spaces around the edges of the record circle. Heat the wire at one end over a stovetop and use the hot end to piece holes through the marked spots.


Hold the wire with strong gloves, such as gardening gloves, in case it heats too much.


Repeat for each record.







, Use medium gauge wire to make ring joins between the holes, closing the wire with pliers. Cut the same lengths of wire for the entire project, although you may wish to make large rings for the top level rings, depending on the hook requirements from the hanging points.


Make rows first, according to the measurement needed for your space.
Then join the rows to form the entire hanging divider.
Ensure that the top row has rings too, so that it can be hung from the ceiling, beam or other area, with ease.

, Use planter hooks from the ceiling over the area in need of the divider, either with a piece of chain to add length or directly hang the divider straight from the hooks. It is important to have at least one helper to do this part, as hanging can be tricky.

, You now have an amazing, funky divider for your room or area."

Check the toilet for leaks by removing the top off the tank and listening very closely.",How to Find a Water Leak in Your House2," If you hear any hissing at all, try to locate where it is coming from. If you locate the area where the leak is coming from, assess it and determine if you can fix it. If you can't, then call a plumber.


If nothing is noticeable, add some food coloring and put a couple of drops in the tank (not the bowl). Wait several minutes and if you have coloring in the bowl, you have a leak in the flapper at the bottom of the tank that is allowing water to seep through. At this point you can assess if you want to do the repair yourself, or call a plumber.
If you have more toilets, go ahead and repeat the process with each toilet to make sure you don't have more than one problem.

If the toilets are fine, check the line running from the meter to the house.,
If you have the valve shut off at the house and the meter has stopped moving, then the leak is somewhere in the house.",How to Find a Water Leak in Your House3," While this may sound difficult, you can save money if you can locate the leak for the plumber.


If you know you have a shut-off valve by the house, shut it off temporarily and check the meter by removing the lid and watching the dial on top of the meter.
If you can't see the meter head, try digging around because they sometimes have dirt or grass covering the top of them. Once you locate it and the valve is turned off by the house, watch the meter to see if is turning. If it is still turning, then the leak is between the meter and the house. That is, unless you have a leaking valve, and this very common with these older bronze gate valves. Then, your leak may also be inside the house.
At this point, walk the area between the meter and the shut-off valve. Look for signs of a leak such as: soft muddy areas, grass that is greener than the rest or growing much faster than other areas. If you see such an obvious sign, call the plumber or assess if you can make a repair yourself.

, Try some other techniques to try to locate the problem.

Try to locate a leak by the house.",How to Find a Water Leak in Your House4," This will require you to locate all the hose-bibs (hose-bibs are the pipes that you hook your hoses to, in case you were unsure!). Usually an average residence has one hose-bib in the front and one in the back, but be sure to find every one that you have and listen carefully.


Once you have located them, take a screwdriver, preferably one long enough to give yourself room to work, and put the metal tip of the screwdriver directly on the metal part of the hose-bib. Put your thumb knuckle on the top of the screwdriver, and then place your knuckle on the side of your head, immediately in front of your ear. The sound will travel directly to your eardrum. The idea, here, is for the solid screwdriver to work like a stethoscope. This works for most metal valves, as well.
Listen carefully for any sound emitting from the hose-bib. If you hear anything at all, remember where it is (perhaps mark it with chalk), and go to the next one. If the sound emitted gets louder at any of the other hose-bibs, then the leak is closer to that particular unit. Note that and contact your plumber: Giving the plumber this information will save the plumber loads of time in finding the leak, which in turn saves you money.
If you survey all the hose-bibs and still find no sound, go into the house and follow the same process with the screwdriver on your house fittings such as faucets in sinks, shower valves, washer, hot water heater (be careful to avoid being scalded when working around the hot water heater). If you are still not sure, just contact the plumber.

If you've had a good experience with another professional, such as an A/C repair technician, a roofer or an electrician, try asking them for a referral.",How to Find a Good Plumber," The most basic rule is to be sure that they're licensed and carry full insurance that protects you and your neighbour's property in the event of a catastrophe.;
, You can even ask to see some of the work they have done. Read their Facebook page and twitter feed to see how they are interacting with their customers

, At the very least, this tells you they shouldn't disappear on you. Theoretically, reputable companies should last, while disreputable ones fade. But sadly, that's not always the case.

, Some companies strip their jobs back to the absolute minimum so they can come in at the lowest price, but the work won't last the longest possible time. Ask the company that is more expensive why their price is at that level, so you can determine if there is a difference.

, Is it money back? Is it limited in any way? Is it written on your bid/quote? Plumbers with great belief in their performance standards put their money where their mouth is.

, Some plumbers prefer to provide quotes only when they are in front of the job so they get it exactly and 100% right. From a plumber's and customer's perspective, there's nothing worse than saying it will cost $X to fix and get to the home, only to find that its really $Y because of some complicating factor.

, The only way this will be truly accurate is if the plumber is in front of the work., The best way to find a good plumber is to have referrals from people you trust. Ask a friend, relative, or colleague you trust for a recommendation.

, If they've been working in the industry for a while, chances are they'll have some contacts. And if you call a plumber based on a reference, be sure to let the plumber know immediately who referred you. They might even give you a discount.

, You’re required to complete high school or get your GED to enroll in vocational training and apprenticeships. People working in your school’s career center may have connections and available programs for you.


Take advantage of the resources available to you.

, Survey the available community colleges in your area. Depending on the school, you may be able to attend any state community college. Pick a school that has a program that specializes in plumbing. Some schools offer one year vocational degrees while others offer a two associate's degree.If you’re unsure about the options available, talk to your high school’s counseling services. Certain high schools have resources for advising and contacting colleges.

, Once you find a plumbing program at a trade school, technical or community college, you’ll need to sign up for classes. You'll earn a certificate that covers water supply and drainage systems, as well as piping equipment. It is not necessary to get a degree in plumbing, but many companies and state agencies prefer it.


Not all plumbers get their vocational training in this manner.

, Depending on the school you decide on, you might be able to take courses that specialize in niche areas of study. There is a major shift towards water conservation today and many businesses want plumbers who specialize in this.

, You can use formal grid paper, but you can also sketch it out on notebook paper or plain printer paper. Determine how much space you can spare for furniture and sketch out a few different ways that furniture can fit into the room. You should also factor in at least one yard (1 meter) of free space in between pieces of furniture. Anything smaller than that will make you feel as though you have to squeeze in between your furniture as you walk.

, Measure how wide your doorways are to prevent potential delivery mishaps. You do not want to purchase a piece of furniture only to discover that you cannot get it into your house.

, After determining how much space you can spare for furniture and where you want potential pieces to go, mark those spaces on the floor to get a better visual. Use painter's tape or spread out sheets of newspaper.

, If your living room will act as a daily family hangout, you will need sturdy, stain-resistant furniture, especially if your kids are still young. On the other hand, if your living room will only entertain the occasional guest, you can opt for more fragile pieces made with delicate fabrics.

, Some rooms contain built-in design elements that may help you determine the type of furniture that will look best inside the room. For instance, if you have a rustic fireplace, cabin décor may be a better option than stark modern furniture. Modern furniture may be the best option for a living room of an apartment with a view overlooking the city, however.

Some apprenticeships assign you one mentor to work with, while others offer a rotating support group of experienced plumbers. Take as much away from these figures because you won't always have them around on the job.


Most apprenticeships will pay you while working under the program.

, All apprenticeship programs require a certain amount of classwork. Subjects can range from trade mathematics, technical blueprint reading, mechanical drawing, computer science, water supply, drainage, code interpretation, and more. Certain programs will send you to local community colleges and have a member from the American Council of Education to evaluate your progress.Some programs will pay for you to go through school and give you the chance to earn an Associates in Science.

, Apprenticeship programs generally offer the most comprehensive training on becoming a plumber. They are usually administered jointly by either plumbers' unions or by non-union contractor organizations. Be prepared to put in the work while considering an apprenticeship.


Apprenticeships run 4 to 5 years beginning with basic plumbing skills and advance to more sophisticated work, covering all aspects of the trade.

Research your state’s requirements.,
Understand the factions of licenses.,
Apply for the license.,
Study for the exam.,
Get licensed.",How to Be a Plumber3," Plumbing licenses are not issued by the federal government. Each state administers a different application for becoming licensed. You’ll need to find out which government entity issues the license. Then you’ll need to figure out what education and work experience is required.


Most states use the state government to issue licenses, but some are deemed at the local level (county, city, or town) like New York.Certain states issue the license, but then some local governments set different requirements like Chicago.

, Different states and local governments will require different levels of plumbing licenses. For most metropolitan areas, you’ll be required to hold the highest level. These are some of the degrees of licenses:


Apprentice plumber does not need a license because she is in training to eventually hold a license.
Journeyman plumbing license requires at least fours years training under a master plumber.
Master plumbing license usually has the most rigorous requirements. You’ll typically already have a journeyman plumbing license as well as need letters of recommendation.Every states holds different requirements for these licenses.

, Once you consult your state's website, check over all the requirements and be sure you meet them. Some states have their applications online while others require you to fill them out by hand.


Have a record of all your past plumbing experience and have a few references for your file.

, Once you apply to the license that you’re qualified for, you’ll receive a packet of practice tests. Prepare by taking time in reviewing the practice materials and spend as much time as it takes till you understand everything.


It is best to keep your notes and textbooks from your apprenticeship to study.
Try not to cut corners and instead absorb the given material.
The exam will be anywhere from 1.5 to 4 hours depending on what license you're applying for., Once you build up your application and complete all the requirements deemed by your state, you’re ready to take the exam. Being licensed is required to work independently as a plumber.


It is important to understand the materials on the exam because your license will expire at some point. When your license expires you'll need to reapply to keep your title.

Start with the basics.,
Buy investment pieces.,
Look for high-quality, stain-resistant fabrics.,
Look for cushions made of wrapped foam.,
Test the strength of the frame.,
Coordinate your pieces.,
Know your themes.,
Opt for a loveseat instead of a sofa if you have a smaller space.,
Fill the room in with additional pieces as space allows.",How to Choose Living Room Furniture2," Most living rooms contain a sofa, armchair, side table, and coffee table. Look for these basic elements before adding extra pieces such as ottomans and additional tables.

, Look for solid furniture with sturdy wood frames and sinuous steel springs. High-quality pieces may cost a little more, but they tend to hold up better and last longer.

, Luxurious, high-quality materials will keep you feeling more comfortable and tend to last longer than cheaper fabrics. Stain-resistant fabrics are especially useful if you have young children, but they might still be a good idea even if you only plan on using the space for guests since spills and stains can happen to anyone.

, Foam is comfortable and durable. Some cushions may be filled with down, but down usually breaks and wears quickly.

, Lift one leg of the piece about six inches (15 centimeters) off the floor. If the adjacent leg has not risen as well, the frame is too flexible and too flimsy.

, Each piece of furniture in your living room should complement the others. Otherwise, your room will look chaotic and thrown together. If you have an interior design theme, such as modern or traditional, stick with pieces that fit with your theme.

, There are a number of ways to divide up interior design themes, but the main ones often include modern, contemporary, traditional, casual, and Old World.


Modern and contemporary furniture has sleek, clean lines and usually makes use of white, beige, or other neutral colors. Glass, metal, and shiny black lacquer are used more often than traditional woods.
Traditional furniture is elegant. It tends to look a little more formal and may include details like rolled arms and skirted bottoms. Colors range from ivory to rich hues of red and other colors.
Casual furniture is friendly and cozy. Many pieces make use of plaid, small prints, and other patterns.
Old World furniture combines styles from French, Spanish, and Italian designs. Rustic, antique pieces are especially appropriate, and you should look for deep, earthy colors.

, Loveseats typically provide seating for two individuals. If you have a small family or only intend to use the space for entertaining an occasional guest, a loveseat could save you space while providing you with as much as you need.

, Chests, flat-top ottomans, and extra tables or seating can add a lot to a large living room, but too many of these pieces will crowd out a smaller space.

Establish your storage needs.,
Choose the color of the nightstand.,
Determine the material you want.,
Consider durability.,
Think of how the nightstand flows with the room.,
Find a nightstand that fits your budget.,

Measure the desired height of the nightstand.,
Make sure that the nightstand can fit through doors and hallways.",How to Choose a Nightstand," Some nightstands have unique features like docking stations to charge your phone and outlets to power your electronic equipment. Other, more traditional nightstands don't have any of these features and just serve as a flat table or drawer. Determine whether your nightstand will just act as a table, or will serve a more functional purpose in your room.If you just need a nightstand to put your wallet, keys, or alarm clock, consider getting a simple nightstand with no drawers or additional features.;
, There are a variety of reasons to have a nightstand, but it's important to know what it will eventually come to hold. Large lamps may not fit on smaller nightstands, and heavier objects will need a sturdy nightstand to sit on. If you don't plan on putting much weight on your nightstand, and you intend to use it to hold your keys, cell phone, books, or wallet, then you can consider getting a lighter weight nightstand. Also, consider whether you'll be putting hot or cold beverages on your nightstand because they can create water rings or heat stains on the wood's surface.If you have hot or cold beverages often, consider getting a glass or metal alloy nightstand.

, Some nightstands have shelves while others have drawers. Determine how much storage you have in your room already and if you require more space to put things. If you do, you may want to invest in a nightstand that has bigger drawers and more storage space. If you don't need much storage, however, then your nightstand can be more simple and doesn't need to have drawers.Take a look at your room and see if you have things on the floor, or boxes piled up. If you do, it may be a sign you could use the extra storage.
If you don't have a bookshelf but read regularly, consider getting a nightstand with a drawer.

, Choose a nightstand that has colors that will compliment the room that you're putting it in. Pick a color that will either compliment or contrast the colors of the other furniture in your room. You can do this by getting a nightstand that matches the color of your sheets or headboard. If you are trying to contrast colors, choose complementary colors, or colors that sit opposite of each other on the color wheel.For instance, if you have sleek white furniture, you could go for a sleek white nightstand so that it blends in and matches the rest of your room.
If your room is mostly black, you can get a white nightstand to complement the darker tones.
If you have a plain and dull room, you can try to brighten your space with a brightly colored nightstand.

, There are rustic wood nightstands, sleek metal or glass nightstands, and contemporary style nightstands. You can either find a nightstand that matches and blends with your current furniture, or a nightstand that intentionally stands out as a unique and eye-grabbing piece of your room.If you are getting two nightstands for both sides of the bed, make sure that they match.Contemporary nightstands use smooth, clean lines and usually have a sleek finish.Nightstands can be made of wood, metal alloys, glass, or stone.

, Scenarios at home will determine how durable your nightstand has to be. For instance, if you have pets or small children, there's a greater chance of your nightstand getting bumped, scuffed, or scratched. In this case, you may want to purchase a brass or glass nightstand that is more resistant to scratches. If there isn't a high likelihood it will be damaged, you can choose a fine wood or a material that is more fragile.

, Your nightstand should look like it naturally flows with the room and belongs with other pieces of furniture. You can achieve this look by getting a nightstand that matches with other pieces of furniture in your room, like your bed frame or wardrobe. Take a look at the style of your nightstand and the style of your room and make sure that they don't clash.


For instance, if you have rustic wood furniture, a metal alloy nightstand may stick out and look tacky.
If you decorate with light and bright colors, make sure that your nightstand matches the rest of your furniture and is also bright.
If you have a black and white room, getting a pastel colored nightstand may make it stand out.

, Nightstands will differ in cost depending on the material they are made of and based on their manufacturer. Browse different nightstands and narrow down your choices to ones that you can afford. If you can't afford the type or style of the nightstand that you want, try to find an alternative made of a cheaper material.


For instance, if you can't afford a mahogany nightstand, consider downgrading to a birch and apply a darker finish on it.Average nightstands can cost anywhere from $50 to over $200., Use a tape measure to make sure that the nightstand you want to get isn't too big or too small for its intended space. Measure the width and length of the space that you plan on putting your nightstand in. Once you get your measurements, compare them with the dimensions for the nightstand that you want to get.


Leaving at least two to three inches of space around your nightstand will allow you to move around and access drawers easily.

, In addition to measuring the area that it will take up, measure the height from the top of your mattress to the bottom of the floor. You'll want to make sure that you get a nightstand that is tall enough so that you can quickly grab things on it while laying in bed.Take this measurement and compare it to the height of the nightstands that you are looking at.

, Before you purchase your nightstand, you'll want to make sure that the dimensions allow you to put it in it's intended space. You can do this by using a tape measure to measure the width of your door frames and halls and comparing it to the dimensions of the nightstand.


Sometimes you can tilt the nightstand and fit it through tight spaces.

Choose furniture with built-in storage.,
Pick high-tech pieces.,
Determine if an item can serve multiple purposes.,
Purchase pieces that are designed to be stored.,
Stock up on stools.,
Opt for classic designs in neutral tones.,
Pick paintable woods.,
Invest in quality.,
Pick pieces that can transition purposes.,
Account for your home size.,
Determine what you need.,
Take photos of what you will keep.",How to Choose Versatile Furniture for Your Home," One of the easiest ways to put your furniture to work is to select pieces with built-in storage. Bed frames, ottomans, and even sofas can all be purchased with built-in storage for anything from clothes to books, or anything else you may own.








Consider whether an item’s built-in storage will fit your needs. If, for example, you are looking for more space for your clothing, a small ottoman may not be the best solution. Instead, opt for a platform bed with storage drawers underneath.;
, Help eliminate some of the mess in your life by choosing pieces that are meant to work with contemporary technology. Look for nightstands with wireless charging capabilities, for example, to help minimize cord clutter while keeping your devices powered-up.Such pieces are especially common in modern design, from high-end boutiques to budget outlets such as Ikea.

, Some items, such as a sleeper sofa or extendable console tables, are meant to serve more than one purpose. Other pieces you may assign your own second purpose, such as doubling up a desk as a vanity. Either way, look for items that can serve multiple purposes in your home.








Multi-functional items help reduce clutter in a space. They are particularly useful when they stand in for a piece you won’t use often.
A sleeper sofa, for example, gives you regular seating and provides another bed for when you have guests, but does not take up the same space as a guest bed.

, Look for furniture that is meant to tuck away neatly when not in use. Many kitchen and dining sets are available that can store chairs within the table. Likewise, many contemporary furniture design stores and warehouses offer pieces that looks good when out, but can fold away to store.








Wall-mounted tables that fold up to function as poster frames or mirrors are popular choices for both dining spaces and desks.Furniture on wheels, such as a coffee table on casters, also makes moving and storing furniture easy.

, A well designed stool, whether a country-style ceramic piece or a modern, minimalist painted wood piece, can do a lot for just one piece. Stools can function as props on which to stand, end tables, plant holders, seats at a kitchen table, and much more. A few good stools could serve a number of changing purposes in any home.








Look for stools that are both decorative and functional. Plastic step stools may work to help reach high places, but opt for something that you would want sitting next to your sofa when you’re not standing on it.
If you have a small space, stools also have the advantage of being stackable and easily stored when not in use. Use them instead of chairs around a dining table, then tuck them aside when you’re not eating.

, If you are looking for furniture that will transition with you over multiple styles and decorating trends, look for classic furniture with clean lines and minimal embellishments. This will allow you to keep a quality piece and dress it up to meet your current aesthetic with items like throw pillows or new linens.Look for neutral colors, as well. Black, white, shades of gray, and earth tones such as brown and taupe are versatile and can transition from one style to another with just a few accessories.
Try to avoid loud colors or bold patterns for your major furniture pieces. These may become dated, and reupholstering is much more expensive than buying a few new cushions.

, Furniture made of hardwood such as oak can be painted, sanded down, and repainted to fit your ever-changing needs. Look for unfinished hardwood coffee tables, end tables, bed frames, and more to get a durable piece that can easily transition styles.Remember that pieces should be stripped and refinished every time you want to change their finish. Do not simply paint one color on top of another. This could lead to bubbling, clumping, and peeling.

, One of the best ways to keep your furniture looking good regardless of what design you choose is to invest in quality pieces. Make sure items are screwed or bolted together, instead of being held together by staples, and look for durable fabrics such as leather and canvas.Get under cushions and look closely at how a furniture piece was assembled. If it seems careless or haphazard, move onto a better quality piece.While high-quality furniture may cost more upfront, it may actually save you money in the long run, since you won’t have to repeatedly pay to replace these pieces., Look for pieces that can serve different purposes in different stages of your life. If, for example, you work in an office now but are looking to work from home, you may want to look for desks or bookcases that have built-in file storage or space for your tools of the trade., Take measurements for the rooms in which you want to place new furniture. This not only lets you know what size furniture your space will fit, it also helps you determine whether you need multi-functional items, such as an ottoman with built-in storage.Write the measurements down and bring them with you when purchasing furniture so that you can compare your room size with dimensions listed on the item cards.
You may even check to see if your local furniture store offers an online room-planner that lets you mock-up what your room will look like with new pieces.

, When you are looking for versatile pieces, it is important to not get carried away buying other items that will clutter or clash with your space. Take inventory of what new furniture pieces you want to get, make a shopping list, and stick to it. This will also allow you to see if there are multi-functional pieces that can meet more than one of your needs with a single item.When making your list, consider two main components: what are pieces you don’t have but want in your home, and what pieces in your home are currently in need of replacement.

, This is especially helpful if you are trying to stick with a particular color palette or a specific aesthetic such as mid-century modern. Take pictures of items including walls, art, and other pieces of furniture to help match your new purchases to your current home.You may also opt to bring paint swatches or fabric samples with you while shopping to make sure you get better color matches. Swatches can often be found at home improvement stores.

Take into account the chair’s purpose.,
Decide on placement.,
Look at the size.,
Pick a suitable fabric.,
Pick a chair style.,
Go for complementary colors.,
Choose a statement color or pattern.,
Work with the room’s decor.",How to Choose an Accent Chair," Think of the room in which you want to place the chair. Is it a bedroom, family room or simply a hallway? If you are planning to place the chair in a hallway it is likely to be more of a decorative piece and remain untouched. On the other hand, if you are placing the chair in the family room, you want a piece that can take a lot of wear.For example, if you have children, pets, or friends with a penchant for destruction, you'll want a chair that's durable and practical. However, if you live alone and want to make a statement, maybe you'd prefer a chair that's more artistic than practical.;
, An accent chair should make a room more inviting, not clutter it up unnecessarily and block movement. Plan out where you want the chair to go before purchasing. For example, if you are looking for some extra seating in a family room, consider adding a chair or two to face inwards and book-end a sofa. Or try placing an accent chair in a corner or next to window to create a reading nook.Knowing where you will place the chair can also help you decide on size and style in the future.

, There are many factors that can affect the size of your accent chair. Not only do you need to think about the size of the room, but also the height and width of your other furniture and the people who use it. For example, your accent chair should sit at the same height as your sofa and other chairs.


You may also want a chair with more leg room for those who are tall.

, Before choosing a fabric, it’s best to consider how the chair will be used and by whom. This will help you pick a fabric that works in the room rather than against it. For example, if you have children or pets, you may want to avoid materials like suede. While a classic for accent chairs, it’s easily stained and not very durable. Similarly, you may want to go with microfiber rather than leather. It will give you a similar look, but be far more kind to dirt and food residue.


You can also use the fabric of a chair to make it stand out from the rest of your furniture. For example, if you have mainly upholstered pieces, try a leather accent chair for a rugged contrast.

, Think about the look and shape of the chair you want in the room. For example, do you want something with a sleek silhouette or is it important to have a bigger piece with arms? If you're looking for a classic chair style, choose a roomy club chair with extra deep seats or a large wingback chair that can help balance out a room with a bigger sofa. You can even go a completely different route with a slipper chair, which is armless and sits low to the ground., One of the easiest ways to decide on a color for an accent chair is to base it off other colors already in the room. To do this, try using complementary colors on the color wheel. For example, if you have a lot of blue in the room via lamps, rugs, or paintings, then try a burnt orange-colored accent chair. Or, if you have a large chartreuse or earthy green sofa, try a deep violet for your chair., Accent chairs are meant to bring a new design element to a room. They are also easy ways to make an eye-popping statement while still remaining practical. Go for a color you love, but wouldn't use normally. For example, bold jewel-tones like jade, ruby, and sapphire always stand out with neutral tones like black, gray, or navy.You can also pick large patterns like floral prints, geometric shapes, chevron stripes, or animal prints to bring the chair to the forefront., For a put-together look, try matching the accent chair to other items in the room, either through their colors or patterns. This can be anything from pillows, lamps, and pictures to knick-knacks. For example, if you have black and white striped accent pillows on your sofa, try getting a chair that mimics the pattern with black and white lines. The chair will still stand out against your other furniture, however, it will help keep symmetry in the room by matching smaller pieces.


Or if you have a favorite art piece, pull one or two colors from there and find an accent chair in the same shades.

Measure the available space.,
Measure your furniture’s height.,
Identify your color scheme.,
Look at your existing table.,
Identify areas in need of improvement.,
Evaluate your storage needs.,
Evaluate your cleaning habits.,
Take an honest look at your lifestyle.,
Look at the surrounding furniture.",How to Choose a Coffee Table," Measure the available space, as well as the preferred space. This will let you know how much wiggle room you have if you find a table that you love, but is outside of your preferred dimensions. Having measurements beforehand will also help you avoid the frustration of having to return an item.To play around with sizing and shapes, place painter’s tape in various configurations and decide which ones you like best.;
, A good rule of thumb is to align your coffee table with the height of the couches or chairs surrounding it to avoid awkward bumping or falling. Although this rule is not hard and fast, it is a good basis to work from.Some people have found that a coffee table surface 2 inches lower than the top of the couch or chair is better for placing food and drinks on.

, Determine whether or not your room has a specific color scheme that a coffee table will need to fall into. If you have all natural colors, for instance, a bubblegum-pink table may be too jarring for the space.Although playing with color is certainly allowed, make sure you do not create a room with no cohesive color scheme, as this can make the room feel disjointed and chaotic.

, If you have a coffee table you are replacing, take a glance at what it is currently housing. Is it used to store books? Is it used as a second dining table, perhaps? Is it a catch-all for junk? Whatever the case may be, identifying what you use (or will use) your table for and how much traffic it receives on a daily basis will help you choose the correct one., If you have an existing table, identify any of its problems, and write them down. This way, when you are searching for a replacement, you’ll know what traits to avoid. If you are getting a table, not replacing one, identify what the space needs, whether that is a piece to tie the room together, or a footrest for your seating area.If your current tabletop is perpetually covered in items, you might want to invest in a coffee table with storage space.
Use your table for a few days and make a note of any irritating things you discover, such as the table being too far away to comfortably place drinks, or being low enough for children to climb on top.

, Some coffee tables come with built-in storage, such as drawers, shelves, baskets, or storage underneath the tabletop. Determine what type of storage you require, if any, and make your selection based on those needs.Storage-filled coffee tables are often great for families, as they can house art supplies and toys, keeping a room neat and tidy.

, Some materials are more high-maintenance than others. If you clean your home on a daily basis, a glass coffee table might work out well for you. If you are more of a once-monthly kind of cleaner, a sturdier material such as wood might be a better bet. If you abhor cleaning, an upholstered coffee table may be the one for you., If you have children or a lot of pets (particularly cats), you’re going to want to get a durable table made with solid wood or metal, possibly in a curved shape to avoid dangerous edges. Other materials may become broken or marred easily. Conversely, if you live alone or live with only a partner, you can shell out for more complex or delicate tables.Although you can purchase a table that does not typically suit your lifestyle, you may need to clean, repair, or replace it often.

, What colors, shapes, and lines are you usually drawn to? If you like smooth, clean lines, a simple rectangle will likely do the job best. If you are a fan of more natural edges, a slab of unfinished wood atop some simple metal feet may complete your space. Draw inspiration from the furnishings immediately surrounding the table.Don’t be afraid to play with color and texture. Although a single item of differently-colored furniture might look odd, you can find ways to tie pieces of furniture together to make them fit the room well.

Think about your personal style.,
Compare prices and read product reviews to assure quality.

",How to Buy a Drafting Table," If you have limited space, you may want to consider a smaller drawing table over a standard drafting table. If the drafting table is for an office environment, where it may be used by more than one person or subjected to more wear, you may want to purchase a heavier, more durable table. If the drafting table is for individual use in a home environment, you may want to buy a lightweight table that can be easily moved.;
, The top surface of a drafting table can be inclined to various angles. The maximum tilt angle for most tables is either 35 or 45 degrees, but some drafting tables offer steeper tilt angles.

, Some drafting tables offer adjustable heights, allowing them to be used with any chair height. Fixed-height tables typically offer a 4-post design and are normally 30 to 37 inches (76.2 to 95 cm) from the floor.

, Some drafting tables offer lockable drawers to protect your tools and other valuables. Others features provide comfort, such as optional footrest crossbars and adjustable armrests. There are also built-in rulers, slide-up pencil ledges, and other convenience features such as split-level surfaces and various types of storage.

, To blend with your home d�cor, you can choose either a traditional drafting table or one with a more modern flair. There is also a variety of materials from which to choose.

Was the table made in America by Americans?

",How to Buy a Reclaimed Wood Table," Ask the table manufacturer if they know the ‘story behind the wood’ -- was the wood originally cut from the virgin forests of America? Was it from some other forest in another country? Or did it come from an old house or barn? Where was this structure located? When was it built? Who lived there? What function did the lumber serve in its first use? Ask for this information to be written down so you can tell the ‘story’ to friends and family. Ask if the wood the table is built with comes with a ‘Certificate of Authenticity’.;
, Is the tabletop nailed or screwed firmly to the aprons? The tabletop should be attached to the aprons with clips to allow the wood to move. A table top that is rigidly attached to its base will crack as it expands and contracts with seasonal changes and subsequent changes in humidity.

, We live in a “cookie cutter world” and often times, due to the lack of skill of the table assembler*, the legs are mass produced on a duplication machine compromising the handmade appearance of old and giving the table a standard furniture store look*. A professional wood craftsman can hand turn each leg without the aid of calipers* enhancing the handmade ambiance of the table. A machine turned leg spins at a high speed and is pressed against a profile knife* that cuts the leg out in one swift operation. Each leg is the exact duplicate of the other, which is a perfect example of our “cookie cutter world”. There is something special about a hand turned leg. The gentle differences in proportion, the slight waves and dips of the craftsman’s chisel add another dimension to the overall texture of the table.

, Are the legs made from reclaimed wood? Ask if the origin of the leg and apron stock is from the same structure as the table top? If they are tapered legs, look to see if the clean cut side of the leg has been embellished to resemble the uncut faces of the old beams?

, Quality table ends include:


a.Breadboard ends - is a term that originated from early bakery breadboards. They are narrow boards (2” to 3” wide) that are applied to the end grain of the main table boards. If the breadboard ends are rigidly attached with nails or screws, they will cause the main table boards to crack. A quality table with breadboard ends is engineered to accept movement so the wood can expand and contract with the seasonal changes in humidity without cracking.
b.Square cut ends– is when the table top has been cut off square, straight and even.
c.Uneven ends – is when each board making up the tabletop is cut at random lengths giving the table a more rustic look.
d.Mountain range ends – is when the boards making up the tabletop ends are cut with slight variations in straightness, much like a primitive table top would have been.

, How are the bowtie patches made? Are they hand cut and slightly irregular giving them a handmade, more primitive farm table look? They should be the same thickness as the tabletop if expected to have any structural holding power. If the bowties are machine cut using a router and a template, they will be perfectly symmetrical and won’t look appropriate on a farm table top. This method only allows the thickness of the bowtie to be about ½” which affords little holding power. They are used more for cosmetic, decorative purposes. You will find symmetrical bowties used more on modern furniture creations.

, How are the holes in the wood filled? You do not want the holes filled with handyman type wood fills or wax crayons* that will chip away and fall out as the wood moves. Holes and cracks should be filled with quality epoxies* that can be colored as desired and will stay put with the natural expansion and contraction of the wood. If preferred, nail holes can be filled with wooden pegs* of the same vintage wood or in some cases, authentic hand forged rose head nails* that were in the boards originally.

, What types of finishes are used? Beware of wax finishes* as they may cause white marks and may get sticky in the summer time. Many table assemblers*, who do not have a finishing background or a finishing facility, use wax finish because of its simplicity. If the wax has been heavily applied, you will be able to scrape it off with your fingernail, which is not a good thing. A durable wipe on finish that finishes the wood from the inside out is far superior. This finish is in the wood and not sitting on top. This type of finish eliminates chipping, flaking and cracking. Be sure the finish is maintainable. Ask how it could be repaired in the event of a scratch? Ask if another coat of finish can be applied as part of a table maintenance program?

, A caring craftsman will be more than happy to build the farm table using wood from the client’s homestead, which adds sentimental value.

, When the bottom of a table is finished with the same number of coats as the tabletop it allows the even absorption of humidity, which prevents future warping, cupping or twisting of the wood. This also produces a hygienically safe surface. Most table bottoms found in the marketplace display raw boards still dusty from the barn or attic carrying untold micro organisms.

, Does the table have a signed and dated paper label glued to the bottom of the tabletop and/or is it branded in a way that cannot be removed? This craftsman adds his signature signet mark on the tabletop. A seemingly significant addition that could add greatly to the value of the piece as it ages.

, Confirm that the furniture maker will repair or replace structural defects or a defective finish barring misuse or abuse.

, Confirm that the furniture maker will sit down and consult with you and your interior designer about your taste and style, the style of your home and other furniture you may have in your home when you are investing in a custom piece. It is important that clients get exactly what they desire.

, A good sign of a quality farm table is if the craftsman adds a dovetailed drawer in the apron of each handmade farm table. Also, ask if the front of the drawer is made from reclaimed wood like the tabletop.

, Anyone can place a couple of boards on top of 4 legs and call it a ‘farm table’. It takes years to learn all the nuances of how to do it correctly. Beware that if table making is the person’s sideline, they may be ‘here today gone tomorrow’. Make sure furniture making is the craftsman’s full time passion and don’t be afraid to ask for references.

, If you move and cannot take the piece with you, a custom furniture maker may be able to sell it for you.

, Do they come from the same tree? Are they the same species? Were they reclaimed from the same building and/or floor? May you choose your own boards? If they do match, it means the maker took the time to ensure the uniform look of the table. Boards should be chosen with an artistic eye making sure they are symmetrical with similar age worn character from the same reclaimed building.

, All modern day tool marks made by the craftsman in the construction of the table, like the circular saw blade and jointer marks*, should be removed with a hand plane* at the same time leaving some of the tool marks from 200 years ago. If these clues to the age of the wood are preserved, it will always be possible to date the antique boards.

, When an old wood tabletop is sent through a wide belt sander*, the entire surface is removed making the table flat and even. This process cuts hours off the production time and a century or more off the face of the old wood tabletop leaving it flat, smooth and speechless. Ask the furniture maker if the table top has been processed in this manner.

, It takes an artisan with a track record to build a piece of furniture that appreciates in value over time. It also takes a company who has built a name for quality and artistry in the industry. Look at their website and go to their ‘news page’. Every time they have appeared in a significant publication, they gain credibility and value is added to their creations as more and more people begin to collect their work.

, Will you be taking home more than just a table? Wood from old structures is often home to a variety of burrowing insects. One in particular is the powder post beetle*, which can go undetected at the time of purchase only to be noticed when a little pile of dust or frass* starts to accumulate under the table. The powder post beetle is so named due to its ability to turn a post to powder (often times a table leg will do nicely). Many builders treat the wood with an insecticide (not the best method on your “green” table); however, more often nothing will be done at all, allowing these little fellows to emerge and venture throughout your home looking for that choice timber, whether part of your home or another piece of furniture. The only way to rid the wood of these pests, as well as mold spores and other living creatures, is sustained levels of heat. Stated by Carolyn Klass, Senior Extension Associate, Cornell University, in her document called ‘Powder Post Beetles’ dated April, 1986, she recommends a core temperature of 120 °F (49 °C) for 30 minutes. This is achievable through the use of a kiln or oven. Ask if the furniture you are considering has been protected from unwanted guests.

Give your shelf a personal touch with non-book items.,
Know how to group items in a visually interesting and appealing way.,
Give your shelf some texture by adding baskets.,
Stack small statues and other trinkets on top of the books.,
Layer objects in front of each other.,
Consider rearranging the shelves, if possible.Not all of the shelves have to be at the same height.",How to Decorate a Bookshelf1," Shelves don't have to be just for books. Consider leaving large gaps on each shelve, and filling the empty space in with something else from around the home. Be sure not to get carried away, however, or your shelf will look cluttered and disorganized. Here are some ideas:Add a low maintenance plant, such as a: aloe, English ivy, heart-leaf philodendron, jade plant, moth orchid, peace lily, pothos, snake plant, and spider plant.Add a fishbowl with a betta fish in it. Betta fish are colorful and low maintenance. .
If you like to collect anything, such as figurines or china, consider putting it on display on your shelf.
Place photographs and artworks in frames, and set them on your shelf.
Add something metallic for eye-catching sparkle. If you don't have anything metallic, then choose a figurine and paint it using silver, gold, or bronze spray paint.Add a mirror to create depth. You can either place the mirror against the back of the shelf, or place a small, framed mirror on top of a stack of books.;
, Try to group items in odd numbers, such as groups of three or five. Also, consider placing large and small items together. This sort of contrast will keep the eye moving around.At the same time, consider placing similar items together. For example, if you have a shell collection, try to keep them all on the same shelf.

, You can also store items inside the baskets, such as magazines, or crafting supplies, such as yarn and fabric.Baskets come in all different shapes and sizes. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Add some cube-shaped baskets that are the same height as the spaces between the shelves. Use these baskets to store items you don't want on display, such as crafting supplies or video game controls.
Use tray-shaped baskets for storing magazines; they will also make the magazines easier to see and to reach.
Use round or bowl-shaped baskets to store bulky items that you may want displayed, such as colorful, homespun yarn or potpourri.

, Tiny globes, decorative bookends, and small statues are just the right size for bookshelves, and they can help make things more interesting too., Consider placing a large, flat object towards the back of the shelf, and a smaller, bulkier object in front. This will add some depth to your bookshelf.Here are some ideas to get you started:


If you have a a photo of your family at the beach and some shells from the beach, place the photo in a frame towards the back of the shelf, and arrange the shells in front.
If you have a flat vase or decor item, place that towards the back of the shelf, and place a bulky item, such as a bust or plant, in front of it.

, If you can, carefully lift the shelf up and take it out of the bookcase. Take the pegs that the shelf was resting on out of the bookcase and put them into a different hole (most bookshelves should have holes drilled to the inside wall; if not, you will need to drill your own). Once you have the pegs in their new positions, place the shelf back onto them.


You can also create horizontal divisions in your bookshelf by cutting a spare shelf into smaller sections, and then sticking those sections inside.

Try arranging your books into categories.,
For a library-like feel, consider alphabetizing your books.,
Try grouping your books based on color.,
Make your bookshelf more interesting by stacking some books.,
Place larger books on the lower shelves and smaller books on the upper shelves.,
Consider keeping magazines in folders or baskets.,
Consider leaning a few books against each other.",How to Decorate a Bookshelf2," If you are an organized person, you might feel more comfortable by grouping your books based on category. Try devoting one shelf to each category. Here are some ideas:


Fiction
Non-Fiction, including dictionaries, research and reference materials, and textbooks.
Magazines

, You can alphabetize your books based on title, or on the author's last name. This will also make your books much easier to find.

, If you are more of a visual person, then consider organizing your books based on the color of the spine. Put all of the books with red spines together, and all of the books with blue spines together. Try to keep all of the warm colors (red, orange, and yellow) on one shelf, and all of the cool colors (green, blue, and purple) on another shelf., Books don't all have to be placed on the shelf in the traditional manner; you can also stack some books on top of each other creating small piles. This will help add some visual interest to your shelf and move the eye around., This will make your shelf appear more stable. If you keep other items on your shelves, consider grouping them the same way: larger items on the lower shelves and smaller items on the upper ones., Magazines are very floppy and flexible, and they don't stand up well on their own. Folders and baskets will keep them all together while adding visual interest to your bookshelf.

, If you have a gap between the last book and the wall of the shelf, try leaning that last book against the rest of the books. This will fill in the empty space without adding bulk. The sudden angle will also help keep the eye moving around.

Add some decorative panels to the back of your bookshelf.Measure the spaces between the shelves of your bookcase, and cut pieces of cardboard or foamboard to fit using a craft knife.,
Use ribbon to trim the edges of your bookshelf.,
Drape a flower garland or battery-operated string lights over the top of the bookshelf.,
Add some lights to the inside of the bookshelf.",How to Decorate a Bookshelf3," Spray the cardboard with some spray-on adhesive and cover it with a piece of colorful fabric. Trim off the excess fabric and turn the panel over so that the back/undecorated side is facing you. Place a square of double-sided foam tape on each corner.Pop each panel into the spaces between the shelves. Press down on the corners to make the tape stick.


You can also use drawer liner, wallpaper, or even wrapping paper. The drawer liner does not need to be glued onto the cardboard, as it already is sticky on the back.

, Choose a ribbon that is the same width as the edges of your shelves. Cut the ribbon so that it is the same length as the shelf. Apply some double-sided tape along the edges of your bookshelf where you want the ribbon to be. Press the ribbon down onto the tape.You can also use scrapbooking tape. It comes in many different colors and patterns. Stick the end of the tape onto one of the ends of the shelf, and roll it across the edge. When you get to the other end of the shelf, snip the tape off.

, You can secure them by taping the rope part to the top corners of the bookshelf. You can also drill a tiny hole into each top corner of the bookshelf and twist in a small cup-hook; the garland or lights can drape over this.


You can purchase flower garlands and battery-operated string lights at an arts and crafts store.
Most flower garlands are between six and eight feet long. You can trim them down to the width of your bookshelf using a pair of wire cutters, or you can leave the garland as it is; the ends will drape against the sides of your bookshelf.

, Purchase a set of battery-operated shelving or cabinet lights and some double-sided foam mounting tape. Peel the tape off the card and stick it to the back of the light; try to get it as centered as possible. Peel the backing off, and then press the light to the underside of the shelf.

Consider painting your shelf.,
Take out the shelves, if possible, and sand everything using 150 grit sandpaper.If you are able to remove the shelves, take them out; if you are unable to, then don't worry about it.,
Wipe the bookcase and shelves down using a dust cloth.,
Wipe the bookcase and shelves down using a magic eraser sponge.,
Paint the inside corners of the shelf using acrylic paint and an angled brush.,
Paint the rest of the shelve using a foam roller.,
Wait for the paint to dry before applying a second and third coat.,
Allow the paint to completely dry before putting the shelves back into place.,
Consider using adding designs to your bookshelf with stencils.",How to Decorate a Bookshelf4," You can paint it a single, solid color, or you can paint the inside a different color from the outside. Here are some ideas:


Liven up a plain, wood bookshelf by painting it a bright white.
Add some contrast to a white bookshelf by painting the inside a bright color, such as cyan or pink.

, Sand the entire bookcase, including the shelves, using small, circular motions. You do not need to sand away the previous finish; you are simply creating a surface for the paint and primer to grip on to.

, Be sure to vacuum the floor of your work space to get rid of any dust caused by the sanding. Any dust left in your work space may get onto the finished piece and mar the surface.

, You can purchase magic erasers in the cleaning department of a grocery store. Be sure to get a plain magic eraser, without any special additives, such as bleach.

, Use a light stroke; you can always apply a second or third coat once the paint is dry. Avoid applying too much paint all at once; this will help prevent any visible brush strokes.


Spray paint is not recommended for large projects such as this. It is more likely to cause drips and streaks than the paint that comes in a can., Apply the paint using light, even strokes. This will help prevent any drips, bubbles, and streaks. If you are planning on painting the shelf two different colors, paint the inside first and wait for the paint to dry before painting the outside.

, Refer to the instructions on the paint can for specific drying times. Some paints dry in as little as 15 minutes in between coats while others need 2 hours or more.

, Again, refer to the instructions on the can. Most paints will require 24 hours drying time. If you try to put your shelf together and use it too soon, you will risk denting the paint or causing it to go sticky.

, Choose a stencil that you like and press it against the side of your bookshelf. If the stencil is not already sticky on the back, then tape it to the shelf using painters tape. Paint over the stencil using acrylic paint in a contrasting color and a foam roller. Remove the stencil and move it to the next spot you want to have the design.

Measure your space.,
Determine the style you’re looking for.,
Keep color in mind.,
Consider your lifestyle.,
Pay attention to quality.,
Don’t buy all your furniture at once.,
Avoid 0% financing.,
Don’t be afraid to haggle.,
Look into buying used.,
Look into buying floor models.",How to Buy Furniture," Start out on the right foot by measuring your room and the ideal size of the furniture you’re looking for. Although you may think that you can just ‘eye’ it, you may end up making a colossal purchasing mistake and buying something much too large or too small. When you have your exact measurements, you’ll be more focused in your search and less likely to purchase something that won’t really work.;
, In recent years, more styles of furniture have been available than ever before. Whether you’re looking for something modern, traditional, antique, or unique, there’s something on the market for you. When you’re out shopping, though, it can be easy to be persuaded by a salesperson to buy something outside of your typical style. Therefore, go shopping with a specific look in mind. You’ll be able to easily sort out what works and what doesn’t, and make narrowing down your options much easier.

, Although bright colors and fun patterns may sound great in theory, you should look for colors and patterns that will stand the test of time. When you are in the market for furniture, look for items that will last you many years and won’t need replacing - especially with color. Choose a good neutral tone for the majority of your furniture, and then opt to have one or two pieces in a color or pattern you enjoy. This way, you’ll stand a better chance of still loving your furniture years down the road as your style changes.

, Although you may have always wanted an antique cream velvet couch, if you are the proud owner of several pets and a few children, that couch probably won’t last long. Be sure to buy high quality furniture that will be used the most often, and lower quality (if you are trying to save money) on items that will get less use. Look for fabric that will stand up to a busy household if necessary, and pay attention to your color choices as well., If you’re heading to Ikea, you are probably focused on low prices more than high quality. If, however, you are investing in a solid piece(s) of furniture you hope to last many years, then you should pay close attention to the quality. Wood furniture comes in three makes: solid, veneer, and plywood/particleboard. Solid wood is what you want; it may cost a bit more but, as the name suggest, it is 100% good quality, solid wood. Veneer is a core of plywood coated in higher quality wood, while plywood is compressed sawdust and wood bits. If you’re looking for upholstered furniture, check the quality of the springs in the base, the substance of the stuffing, and the structure of the support system.


If you can, look for sofas with a fifth leg in the center to give better support.
Hardwoods come from deciduous trees, while softwoods come from coniferous trees; the name has no bearing on the actual hardness or softness of the wood.
If the furniture squeaks or makes noise, it’s not very good quality and should be avoided.
If the furniture is primarily assembled with nails and glue, avoid it. Screws and dowels are the best for good quality furniture.
Price doesn’t always dictate the quality of an item of furniture, so make sure to check it out thoroughly before committing to purchasing., A common mistake of zealous new home owners is to purchase all your furniture in a single sitting. Unfortunately, this could cause two problems: you pay a higher price for bulk furniture when you think you’re paying less, and you may purchase something that you don’t truly love just to fill your space. Spread out your furniture purchases over the course of several months. Unless you know the price of each individual piece of furniture you’re getting, don’t fall for the trap of buying a whole set for a single rate; break it down to see if it’s truly fair first.

, Furniture companies will often advertise 0% financing as an incentive to bring in customers, but what you may or may not know is that they tack the interest they would normally charge onto the floor price. Therefore, you think you’re getting a good deal when you’re really paying the same amount (or more) as you normally would for the same piece of furniture. Although you can find good deals with 0% financing offered, don’t let that be the main guide in judging and selecting furniture to add to your home.

, Although it is uncomfortable for many people to haggle in a store setting, furniture is one of the common goods that can be haggled for. Furniture stores greatly increase the price on furniture to make a profit, so you don’t have to settle for the advertised price. If you’re good, you should be able to knock off 10%-20% on the original price, while the supplier will still make a profit. If you’re not comfortable about haggling for the price, try haggling for free add-ons like delivery, set up, or additional décor items.

, Used furniture doesn’t necessarily mean it is poor quality, it just means that someone no longer is interested in owning it. Look for used furniture online in your area and in local thrift and antique stores. You’ll likely be able to find something that’s good quality, albeit a bit worn, for a much lower price than you would in a department store. Keep in mind that even if the used furniture isn’t in the best shape, you can update and clean it up a bit on your own at home.

, Floor model furniture is that that is placed out for buyers to test and admire before purchasing. As a result, it may have mild wear and tear, but is typically in good shape. The best part about purchasing floor models? You can often get them for 50% off the advertised price. Ask a salesperson about the floor models available for sale, or just point one out that you really love and start haggling."

Dry the aluminum off immediately.",How to Clean Hammered Aluminum1," Because aluminum is soft, choose a non-abrasive dish detergent such as Dawn. Spread a squirt of the detergent over the aluminum, enough to use to scrub out stains. During regular use, hammered aluminum can be cleaned like any metal dishware.Alternatives to dish detergent include an orange cleaner, lemon juice, or a degreaser such as Dawn Power Dissolver.;
, Warm water will loosen up stains such as those from food left on dishware. You don’t need the water to be hot. Submerge the aluminum item in the water.

, Again, the brush must be soft or else it will leave scratches. Choose a sponge, non-abrasive pad, a soft-bristled scrub brush, or old toothbrush. Scrub the surface of the aluminum and most stains will come off.Don’t use steel wool or else the aluminum will gain small scratches.

, If the stains are still present or when using an alternative detergent such as orange cleaner, allow the aluminum item to sit in warm water. Leave it alone for about five minutes. The warm water should make it easier to scrub or wipe away the stains.Five minutes is often enough to clear off debris while minimizing water exposure, but for stubborn stains you can try soaking it for 30 minutes.

, Place the aluminum item under warm, running water. Make sure all the cleaner is rinsed off the surface.

, Use a soft cloth to remove all the moisture. Make sure all the water is gone so none of it sits on the metal and causes stains."

, As you are shopping, talk to the sales associates about how the furniture is made. You want to make sure you are buying high quality bamboo.


Make sure you are buying authentic bamboo, and not a fake substitute or a bamboo copy.
Ask where the bamboo was grown, and where the furniture was made. Many artisans in small communities and emerging nations have been making bamboo products for many generations and can usually be counted on to provide a standard of high quality and sustainable methods.

, If you are buying bamboo for ecological reasons, you will want to make sure that glue is non-toxic.

,, This preserves the bamboo in an ecologically friendly way.

, Sit on chairs and stools, place accent items on bookshelves and test how easy it is to move around smaller pieces.

, While you will not get to look at or touch it in person, you can find larger selections and lower prices on discount retailer sites such as Overstock and Amazon. There are also numerous retailers such as The Original Bamboo Factory which specialize in bamboo furniture.


Read customer reviews when you shop online. Find out what other customers and users like and do not like about different pieces you are considering.

, Because the material is sturdy and durable, it should remain in good condition for a long time. Check out eBay or Craigslist to see if any bamboo furniture is available, or shop at yard sales and antique shops.

, Find out if you are able to return your bamboo furniture if you do not like it once you get it home, or it breaks after you purchase it.

Fold the rug in half and carry it outside.,
Shake the rug out.,
Hang the rug with the non-shag side facing out.,
Beat the rug with a broom handle or rug beater.",How to Clean a Shag Rug1," For rugs that are small enough to be carried by one or two people, fold them in half or roll them up and carry them outside. You don’t want to let all of the trapped dirt loose in your home. Take the rug into the yard or at least onto the porch.


As you gather the rug up and carry it outside, be careful not to drop debris from it onto the floor.;
, For light rugs, give them a good shake up and down to release as much of the dirt as you can. Dirt gets trapped until the shag, but it’s not always held tight in the rug. Shaking the rug will allow a lot of the dirt to fly out of the rug.Be sure to shake it with the wind blowing away from you and not to shake the dust out around other people.
For larger rugs, have someone help you by holding onto one of the corners. Then you can shake the rug together to release the dirt.

, After giving the rug a good shake, hang it over a porch railing, a fence, or on a clothesline. Be sure to hang it so that the shag is folded against itself and the smooth underside is outward.If you have nothing to hang the rug on, you can have someone hold it as long as you are extra careful.

, Take the handle of a broom or mop, a long stick, or a sturdy rug beater and hit both sides of the rug. Hit the rug hard enough to shake debris loose. Once you stop noticing dust fly from the rug, it is clean enough. Give it a brief final shake and place it back in your house.It is a good idea to wear a mask over your mouth and nose, especially if you have allergies, to avoid breathing too much of the dust flying out of the rug.
Beat rugs once or twice a week depending on whether or not they are in high traffic areas. Rugs that don’t get walked on often can be cleaned every two weeks.

"
"
Flip the rug upside down so the shag is against the floor.,
Run the vacuum over the underside.,
Vacuum the floor beneath the rug.,
Use a brush or upholstery attachment to vacuum the rug.",How to Clean a Shag Rug2," On a hard floor, flip the run facedown so that the backing is exposed. Never run a vacuum on the shag part of the rug with a standard powerhead, as it can damage the fibers of the rug., Move your vacuum slowly back and forth in straight lines going across the width of the rug. The sucking mechanism will remove a lot of dirt while the beater bar of the vacuum will knock more dirt loose onto the floor. Vacuum a second time lengthwise, crossing your first set of passes.Vacuuming the underside of the rug works because dirt settles down past the fibers into the base layer or backing of the rug.
Vacuum your rug once a week to keep it in good condition. Rugs kept in rooms where people rarely walk can be vacuumed every two weeks.

, Roll the rug up and set it aside. Then run your vacuum over the floor area where the rug was lying. This will pick up any dirt and debris that was shaken out of the rug onto the floor.If you don’t want to run your vacuum on your hard floor, use a broom and dust pan to pick up any dirt remaining on the floor.

, Lay the rug out again, this time with the shag side up. Using the vacuum’s hose with a brush or upholstery attachment, brush straight lines up and down the rug. This will remove any dirt or debris that was loosened during the first vacuuming stage. Brush the carpet gently and do not brush in circles."
"
Dab spills with a dry microfiber cloth.,
Wipe the spill with a damp paper towel or alcohol-free wipes.,
Clean tough stains with vinegar.,
Consult a professional for heavier stains.",How to Clean a Shag Rug3," The most important thing is to clean spills up immediately to stop them from soaking deep into the rug. Use a white cloth so no color is transferred onto the rug. Dab at the spill to soak up as much as you can, but don’t rub it because this spreads it around.A microfiber cloth works well to avoid transferring lint or fibers onto the rug.

, After you soak up the majority of the spilled liquid, dab at the spill with a wet cloth. Baby wipes work well, or you can use a wet paper towel or wet clean cloth. Use lukewarm water as hot water can shrink some fibers.Rinse the cloth and continue dabbing at the spill to pull up as much of it as possible.

, If dabbing the spill with a dry and wet cloth does not sufficiently clean the spill, mix equal parts warm (not hot) water and vinegar (½ cup or 120 ml each is a good amount). Wet a cloth with the solution and massage it into the rug pulling up the stain.Wipe the vinegar mixture gently on a corner of the rug first to make sure it will not fade the colors of the rug. Don’t use this if you can tell that it visibly affects the fibers of the rug.
Rinse the cloth and re-wet it as many times as necessary, but don’t over-wet the rug, and give it plenty of time to dry in a well-ventilated room.
This type of treatment usually works well on water-based stains like soda, some juices, and some pet stains.

, If cleaning stains gently with water and vinegar is not enough to get them up, have your rug professionally cleaned. Traditional carpet cleaners are often too harsh for natural-fiber shag rugs. If you spill something like ink or wine that causes a bad stain, call a professional who is skilled at treating heavy stains.


Professional cleaning is typically reserved for Oriental, Persian, or other hand-woven rugs that are significantly valuable. Weigh the cost of professional cleaning against the value of the rug itself.

Make the best use of your space.,
Stick with a neutral color scheme.,
Keep furnishings simple.,
Replace tired pieces.",How to Choose Rustic Chic Home Decor1," Before you get too eager to shop for new pieces, scan the room you’re planning on decorating. Take note of its size, layout, flooring, walkways, doors, windows, cabinets and other features. The rustic furnishings you pick out should be appropriate for the specific look of each room so that the new atmosphere feels like a natural extension.Some pieces will look better in certain places than others. Whenever you’re picking out your decor, trust your instincts when deciding where in your home or room it should go.
If you could use a fresh set of eyes, seek out the professional opinion of an interior designer.;
, Rustic chic decor is by definition muted and minimal. Forget about bright colors, elaborate patterns or gleaming burnished fixtures. Instead, focus on monochromatic pieces in complementary hues and materials. This basic setting will act as a blank canvas so that you can add personality later by using smaller decorations.Appliances and fixtures in dark, plain shades will go with a wider range of items.
Vary your tones between rooms. The sun room will benefit from light shades like pine and cream, while the bedroom or study can be done in dark grays, browns and blacks with splashes of color., Simplistic items are wonderful on their own, but too many of them can easily start to look busy. Resist the urge to incorporate more and more into a room. Get a few essential pieces, like a maple coffee table or a rich brown leather loveseat, and let them speak for themselves.Limiting the number of pieces in a given room also helps maximize your space.
A room full of items in all the same style or shade can quickly become monotonous.

, If you’re having trouble planning an updated layout for the room or deciding on the perfect spot for new decorations, one good place to start would be getting furniture and accessories that you don’t want anymore. Dull, uninteresting items can be sold, donated or discarded to make room for fresh finds. Assuming you’re not ready to part with a particular piece just yet, you could also have it reupholstered and appreciate it from a new perspective.Sometimes even small changes can make a big difference. You might not have to totally overhaul your living space in order to breathe new life into it.
Give your old furniture a new home in another room, or store it until you find another use for it.

Show off natural wood finishes.,
Accent with aged metals.,
Incorporate elements of nature.,
Finish with gorgeous quaint accessories.",How to Choose Rustic Chic Home Decor2," Wood is the ultimate staple of rustic chic style. It’s sturdy, idyllic and, best of all, goes with everything. Oak, cedar, mahogany and walnut are all excellent choices for wood furnishings. To complete the rustic aesthetic, look for pieces with attractive staining, irregular angles and other unique touches like bits of preserved bark.You can find almost every major piece of furniture for your household in one type of wood or another.
Choose paints and stains that don’t distract from the innate beauty of the wood.

, On the flipside of sleek, contemporary styles, old-fashioned metals, such as wrought iron, copper and even artificially-rusted tin can instantly give your surroundings an air of dignified antiquity. Because of their shabby chic characteristics, raw and distressed metals are best used sparingly to offset woods and other finishes.Lamps, bookends and table legs are good places to weave in metal accents.
Use vintage metal containers in the kitchen in place of traditional ceramic jars.

, When it comes time to cover the walls or fill up blank space, take cues from the great outdoors. Accentuate end tables and alcoves with decorations made from stone, fur or even faux ivory or tortoise shell. Your living space will have just the right amount of wildness while still looking like it leapt off the pages of a storybook.If you live near scenic surroundings, switch to a more “exposed” layout with uncovered windows and natural lighting to bring a glimpse of the outside in.Make sure you’re buying from humane sources. Imitation fur and other materials look like the real thing, but are both ethical and sustainable.

, Put the finishing touches on a room with the same types of items you would ordinarily use to ornament your home, but with a twist—here is where unique fabrics and designs will come into play. Smaller accessories are also the best place to work fanciful designs into the room’s furnishings.Instead of ordinary throw blankets and pillowcases, go with more eye-catching variations like Navajo or wove saddle blankets and beadwork pillows.
A beeswax candle or wind-up clock will make for a tasteful nightstand display, while blown glass bowls and vases can be substituted for a lifeless dining room centerpiece.

Visit your local furniture store.,
Go thrift shopping.,
Distress plain pieces.,
Repurpose old items.",How to Choose Rustic Chic Home Decor3," There’s no need to venture all the way to the Alaskan frontier or remote outposts of the Rockies in order to find good looking accoutrements. The rustic look is in, so it shouldn’t be hard to track down a few things that suit your preferences at major home goods stores. You’ll have the most luck when shopping for bigger items like tables, chairs and bedding in these places.


Chain stores like Crate and Barrel, Hobby Lobby and Pottery Barn specialize in rustic home decor.Furniture outlets tend to charge more, so if you don’t like the idea of paying as much, thrift stores and DIY distressing techniques may be the way to go.

, It’s not uncommon to stumble upon forgotten treasures at secondhand stores and vintage boutiques. These are often items that you can’t find anywhere else, and you’re guaranteed a good deal. If you’re remodeling on a budget or looking for one-of-a-kind pieces, a thrift store may be your best bet.Many old pieces will be ready to display in your home as-is.
Be sure to check beck regularly, as store inventories change constantly.

, Rather than scouring various stores and shops for wares with the right rustic vibe, buy furniture and accessories new and modify them yourself at home. Distressing furniture is fast, fun and could hardly be easier. All you need are a few basic tools like paint thinner, sandpaper and specialty paints and brushes. When you’re finished, you’ll have a collection of items that are truly one-of-a-kind.Painted wood furniture can be weathered to expose the beautiful grain underneath, and metal objects can be strategically rusted or painted over with a matte finish.Change out the hardware on any dressers or cabinets you happen to come across to customize their appearance.

, For those little extra touches, look no further than your own attic or garage. Most homes are loaded with scraps of materials that are infinitely useful if applied correctly. For instance, you could use a roll of butcher’s twine to wrap drawer pulls and cabinet handles, wire lanterns for indoor lighting or frame an assortment of old fishing hooks to make wall art that’s anything but commonplace. With a few innovative ideas, you’ll start seeing your junk drawer in a whole new light!If you have a certain item that you want to use but it doesn’t quite go with the rest of your furnishings, try painting, sanding or distressing it to make it a better visual fit.Get creative! As your own personal interior decorator, you’re only limited by the scope of your imagination.

Choose which rooms to decorate.,
Pick a color scheme.,
Add seasonal decorations.,
Use small touches to drive winter home.,
Choose decorations that transition from season to season.",How to Choose Winter Interior Decor1," If you have the budget, time, and inclination to overhaul your home entirely, feel free to go wild. If not, however, prioritize rooms that see the most use. Don’t waste time and money on, say, your bedroom, which hardly anyone but you will see. Instead, focus on areas like your:Living room
Family room
Dining room
Kitchen
Bathroom(s);
, If you’re a purist, bring the outside in with seasonal colors that emphasize cold. If, on the other hand, you want to make your home a comfy hideaway from the elements, go the opposite route with warm colors. There’s no right or wrong, so follow your instincts and please your own taste.


Cold color schemes include white paired with either blue, burgundy, emerald, gray, plum, or silver.Warm colors also include white, as well as browns, reds, and yellows.To find colors that match your paint, furniture, and other decor, use online color palettes like , If you celebrate Christmas, you’re probably already starting the winter off by decorating for that. But whether or not you celebrate that holiday, search the aisles or online for decorations that don’t tie directly into the holiday. Use these to decorate your home throughout the winter season, even after you’ve packed all the Santa stuff away.Items to look for include figurines, framed pictures, snow globes, wreaths, and garland.
Neutral designs include snowmen, sleighs, winter villages, and bare or snow-covered evergreens.

, Again, if you want to go hog-wild about it, feel free to make your home a winter wonderland with any number of appropriately themed decorations. But if time, budget, and space is limited, use them wisely. Consider:


Choosing one fanciful item to stand out as a seasonal centerpiece in a given area, like a model winter village to top a mantelpiece, bureau, or window seat.Replacing everyday items with seasonally decorated ones, like dish- or hand towels, salt and pepper shakers, and placemats.
Investing in seasonal pillow cases, blankets, comforters, and/or even sofa- and armchair covers to quickly punch up areas like bedrooms, living rooms, and dens., Between school and holidays, both fall and winter can be busy times of year, so plan ahead to minimize work. As you decorate for each season and/or holiday, use items that will still be appropriate as you roll over to the next so you can minimize work. For instance:Red, yellow, orange, and brown scream autumn when bunched together, but each is a warm color that can help make your winter home more inviting. Say you decorated your living room with throw pillows in all four colors for fall. Simply take away the yellow and orange ones and leave the red and brown pillows.
Hanging wreaths with bare branches is a popular way to decorate for both fall and winter. Simply swap the autumn leaves with more winter-appropriate flair like holly leaves, oranges, or leaves painted in cool colors like blue or silver.
Evergreen garland and pine cones are Christmas favorites, but on their own they work just as well for the whole winter.

Provide literal warmth with fire.,
Set out candles.,
Add throws to seating areas.,
Change your curtains.",How to Choose Winter Interior Decor2," If your house has one, use your fireplace! Rearrange the furniture to make the hearth the centerpiece of that room. Make a blazing fire a daily, nightly, or weekly ritual with your loved ones.If your fireplace is inoperable, stack some bright firewood in the rack anyway to suggest the idea of a nice warm fire.

, Whether or not you have a fireplace, light candles to add the flickering glow of flames to your home. Choose candlesticks or holders that enhance the winter theme either by color, design, or both. Enhance the effect by burning scented candles that fill the house with pleasing smells that highlight the season.Gold or brass candlesticks provide warm colors and reflective surfaces, enhancing the light and suggestion of warmth.
Mugs, bowls, and jars filled with readymade candles and decorated with seasonal designs are also widely available.Popular scents for winter include cinnamon, cloves, oranges, pine cones, and various types of wood.
Alternatively, you can also use LED candles if you’re worried about fire risks or forbidden to use candles.

, Drape throw blankets over the backs of your couches and armchairs. Arrange throw pillows in the corners of each one, too. If you have an accent chair, pile extras on the seat so family, roommates, and guests can help themselves as needed. Don’t be mingy with them; the more, the better!Choose neutral-colored throw pillows and blankets to use year-round. This way, you can easily dress up each seating area with just a couple of new winter-themed blankets and/or pillows.

, Make an instant dramatic change to your home by hanging curtains selected especially for winter. Choose whichever color or design highlights the season best for your tastes, but favor thick, heavy fabrics to suggest more warmth and protection from the cold outside.For the best insulation, choose thermal curtains, which are designed to prevent heat from escaping while also blocking drafts from the windows.If you miss the sunlight in winter and still want to let it in without keeping the drapes shut all day, you can also find thermal-backed vertical blinds that allow more light to pass through with minimal heat loss.

Determine the best spaces to layer rugs.,
Select your rugs.,
Lay out your rugs.",How to Choose Winter Interior Decor3," Assess how much visibility the floor area receives in each room. Favor open areas over small, cramped ones. Use layered rugs where they will stand out and be noticed, rather than areas where furniture blocks them from view.Larger rooms like the living room or den are generally ideal for this. Depending on the square footage and the amount of furniture inside, master bedrooms can also be a likely candidate.
Layered rugs can also be used in smaller spaces with little or no furniture, like hallways or bathrooms. However, expect rugs to possibly wear out faster here due to concentrated foot traffic.
The dining room, however, is poorly suited for layered rugs, regardless of how much open space or visibility it enjoys. Here, they are more likely to interfere with the movement of the chairs to your table, while the table itself obstructs them from view when seated.

, Maybe you’re buying both at once, or perhaps you’re trying to pair a new rug with one that you already own. Either way, make sure the base rug and accent rug complement each other. Make your selections according to:Size: whether you’re choosing an accent rug, base rug, or both, aim to have at least one foot (30.5 cm) of the base rug revealed along each side of the accent rug. With the base rug, always err on the side of too big if you’re unsure of how large a rug you should select.

Supporting role versus starring role: favor neutral rugs for your base. Let the accent rug shine by choosing a base rug that won’t upstage it. At the same time, make life easier by going with a base rug that can be used year-round while you switch accent rugs by season.

Contrast: make the accent rug pop out even more by pairing it with a base rug that contrasts it. Use color, pile height, shape, texture, or a combination of these features to make your selections more eye-catching.

, For areas like hallways or bathrooms without furniture, simply center the rugs in the open floor space. In more heavily furnished rooms, use your rugs to define specific spaces within that room, such as a sitting area in your living room, or the desk area in your home office. This may take a little trial-and-error depending on the sizes of your rugs, the open space available, and the surrounding furniture. For example:One rule of thumb is to cover at least two feet (61 cm) of both rugs with the furniture surrounding it. Let’s say your rug is being placed at the foot of a single 3-seat sofa in the living room, with no other surrounding furniture. As long as you’re happy with the amount of rug visible, this should be fine.
Now let’s say you’re framing the rugs with an L-shaped couch. Covering two feet on either side of the base rug may look fine, but doing the same to a small accent rug may not. Here, you may want to pull the accent rug out from underneath on one or both sides..
Now say that you also have a coffee table to go with your L-shaped couch. If it’s solid wood (as opposed to glass and see-through), you may wish to pull either the accent rug or both rugs further out from underneath the couch so they are more visible.

Mix patterns.,
Choose a variety of textures.,
Pick bold, bright colors.",How to Choose Bohemian Style Home Decor1," One way to achieve the bohemian look in your home is to mix patterns. It’s okay that it doesn’t match. Choose patterns that you like and put them together with no care to having them match perfectly.You may want to choose a color base, like red or blue, and only choose patterns that have that base color.
Choosing different kinds of patterns may help reduce any clashing. Two mismatched florals may look worse than a floral placed next to a southwest pattern.;
, Another way to achieve the bohemian style is to have cotton alongside satin, faux fur, corduroy, and flannel. Try different textures on different items, or try mixing textures on the same item.

For example, you may have a cotton comforter, satin pillows, and a faux fur throw blanket. You may also use pillows and blankets made from satin, corduroy, faux fur, and cotton.
Choose chairs, sofas, and ottomans with different textured materials.
Consider mixing textures on rugs, wall tapestries, and curtains.

, One of the keys to bohemian decor is the color scheme. Bold, bright colors of any shade can complement a bohemian room. Common colors are rusted red, deep orange, gold, brown, electric blue, deep purples, and pinks.You can choose one base color, or a few complimentary colors to start with.
With bohemian decor, you can really choose any colors you want.

You may want to choose an accent color not prominent in the patterns to bring out the subtle colors.You may also want to choose accent pillows with patterns.

, Bold, excessive accessories and items help build the bohemian look. This means you can pile cushions on the sofa or on your bed, add lots of decorative pieces to the walls and on shelves, and put up multi-colored curtains and bedding. Cover your entire floor with rugs or place house plants on every surface. The options are unlimited, and you can have fun with your choices.Drape tapestries from the ceiling or around your bed to make a canopy or place them over chairs and dresses.You can even choose to repurpose pieces as accents. For example, you may use a window pane or a rug as a wall decoration.
Stack your jewelry on your dresser for a bohemian decorative flair.

, Bohemian chic furniture is quirky and unique. This can be anything. A canopy bed, a chaise lounge, or an antique headboard can accent any bohemian decorated room. As you shop, look for interesting pieces.For example, you may find an antique looking dresser or armoire that has painted details or a distressed desk and chair.
Use ottomans with interesting fabrics, like velvet, satin, or corduroy.
You can look for pieces at antique shops, thrift stores, and garage sales. You may be able to find bohemian pieces to buy in stores.

, Empty walls are the opposite of a bohemian decor. Cover your walls in vivid tapestries, artworks, and wooden wall art. Don't worry about cluttered walls or matching the decor. The bohemian ideal is to express your artistic side.For example, you may hang up a wall tapestry with a teal background with pink and yellow geometric patterns, prints of famous artworks, framed album covers, wooden wall art bought at local art fairs, and interesting wall hangings found at a thrift store.
You may consider doing a collage on a wall of postcards, magazine cutouts, art prints, posters, and anything else you enjoy looking at.

, The bohemian look is accented by soft, warm light. This is achieved by unique lamps and candles around the room. Look for lamps in interesting shapes, shades with unique patterns and bold colors, different textures like satin or silk, and even beading hanging from the shade.Consider hanging lighting from the ceiling or putting up globes.

Add bohemian window treatments and rugs.",How to Choose Bohemian Style Home Decor3," bohemian style includes interesting furniture. You can get this look by painting your own furniture. Turn a boring table or dresser into a bohemian piece by painting it a bright color and adding accents to it.For example, you may color the base of the dressed one color and paint each drawer a different accent color. Take a table and paint a geometric pattern on it. Take a chair, paint it, and add accents on the slats and the seat.

, Bohemian-inspired rooms are very cluttered. They have many different pieces of furniture, including tables, chairs, and chests. Everything is next to one another, cramped, and overflowing with knick knacks, blankets, pillows, and rugs.Don’t be afraid to put more furniture, accessories, and accents in the room.

, Rugs are an essential part of bohemian decor. You can add one rug in a bright design, or you can cover your entire floor in mix matched patterned rugs. Long flowing curtains in bold designs or made of textures like satin, silk, or lace finish off the bohemian look.You may combine a window treatment and bed canopy by using part of the canopy around the windows.
Beading also makes a very bohemian window treatment.

Determine your budget.,
Familiarize yourself with the different types of indoor water fountains.,
Consider practicality.,
Assess the space.,
Look into the variety of options for your indoor water fountain.,
Shop for indoor water fountains.",How to Buy Indoor Water Fountains," Indoor water features can cost anywhere from tens of dollars to several thousands of dollars.;
,


Tabletop fountains are relatively small, portable and convenient for those who don't have a large space to devote to a fountain and/or who may want the option of experimenting with the placement of an indoor water fountain. They come in a wide variety of shapes and visual aesthetics, and are considerably less expensive than other fountain varieties.
Floor fountains are freestanding indoor water features that do not require installation and, therefore, can be moved. They come in a variety of sizes, and are generally the shape of an upstanding rectangle.
Wall fountains are the most expensive of the indoor water fountains. They come in the form of flat, rectangular panels, and must be firmly mounted to a structural wall.

, If you have pets or small children, then it may not be practical to purchase floor or table indoor water features. You also need to consider traffic flow and furnishings when determining which type of fountain is best suited for you and your lifestyle. For example, it may not be a good idea to place a table fountain on the same desk that houses a personal computer, and a narrow hallway may not be ideal for a large floor fountain.

, The type and size of the space you are filling will be 1 of the biggest determinants of which indoor water fountain you choose.


Consider the purpose of your fountain. A focal point fountain should be large and dominant in the space, as a large wall panel would be, whereas an understated trickling effect can be accomplished with a small table fountain.
The indoor water fountain you choose should be relatively proportionate to the space it is to occupy. It should not overwhelm the area, nor should it disappear into its surroundings.
Keep in mind the design aesthetic of your interior space and choose a complimentary fountain. For example, if your space is full of copper accents, then you may want to forego indoor water features made of aluminum in favor of copper models.

, It is possible to purchase fountains with lights, water-purification systems, self-cleaning capabilities, jets that propel water at different pressures for different effects and 5-year pump warranties.

, Explore a variety of sources and compare prices in order to find a fountain that best suits your lifestyle, interior space and budget.


Home improvement stores and chain retailers carry a variety of less-expensive, ready-made indoor water features.
Browse the Internet for businesses that specialize in selling hand-made, custom-made and ready-made water fountains at both retail and discount prices.
Consider purchasing a custom-made indoor water fountain through an artisan or a retailer who specializes in handmade fountains.

Decorate with plush, inviting furniture.,
Use items that imitate nature.,
Avoid too many sharp edges.,
Account for lighting.,
Install a water feature.",How to Choose Soothing Home Decor1," Hard, spartan furniture can look uninviting from the very first glance. Furniture that is elegant, well upholstered, and luxuriously stuffed will make you, your family, and visiting friends want to sit down and relax.Some examples of plush furniture might include things like comfy upholstered chairs, well-stuffed couches, inviting love seats, fluffy ottomans, and so on.
These kinds of items can sometimes be expensive. If you're not ready to make this purchase, buy soft, cozy throw pillows to add to your furniture.
Many pieces of gently used furniture can be bought at a fraction of the price at secondhand stores, though you might have to patiently search these for these until they come in stock.;
, As appealing as sleek, futuristic designs can be, natural features encourage happiness, comfort, and well-being.To accomplish this, add some houseplants or a living wall to your home. Some other ideas for adding a natural vibe to your living space include:


Choosing wood-accented furnishings and decorations, especially dark colored wood. This will create a warm feel while adding contrast to the room.Art from natural scenes can also add to the organic atmosphere of a room. Art can sometimes be pricey; find inexpensive art at secondhand stores and thrift shops.

, Sharp edges give a clean, geometric, well defined impression to a room. It's only natural for the furniture of your room to have some edges, but too many of these can make a room feel aggressive, in a manner of speaking.


Furniture with flowing lines and rounded edges can really soften the character of a room and make it feel more relaxed.
Some examples of furniture without sharp edges might include rounded edged bookshelves, seating with softened edges (like couches and chairs that don't come to a point at the edges), coffee tables with blunted edges, and so on., Natural light has a direct positive effect on your mood.Use curtains that decorate your windows without cutting off too much natural light. Add mirrors to a room to encourage the spread of natural light throughout the space.


The ""temperature"" of lighting refers to its tone. Light that is very white is said to have a ""cool"" temperature, while light that is somewhat orange is said to be ""warm.""
Light that is too cool can make a room feel stark or clinical. Use warm temperature lighting to cozy up rooms you are decorating.

, Water is associated with a sense of calmness, clarity, and meditation.You can bring these feelings into your home when decorating by adding a water feature, like a small bubbling fountain or a trickling water wall.


If buying a brand new water feature is outside your budget, you might opt for a noisemaker that can make water effects or even a CD with water sounds playing in the background.
Similar to the regular, metrical noises water makes, the sound of ticking can also have a calming effect. If this is true for you, a clock may be a soothing alternative to a water feature."

Utilize cool tones in your color scheme.,
Tone down bright colors according to your taste.,
Accentuate a soft, open feel with pastel colors.,
Create depth in your color scheme.",How to Choose Soothing Home Decor2," Cool tones are green, blue, and violet. These colors, and shades of these, generally promote a soothing feeling. By choosing one of these colors for the base of your color scheme, you can replicate this soothing effect. Avoid overusing too many cool tones, otherwise your room may feel cold and lifeless.Use green as a base if, in addition to a soothing impression, you also want to convey a sense of rejuvenation or growth.
Blue, when used as your base color, will add a light and refreshing feeling, especially lighter shades of blue. Darker shades communicate a calm sense of dignity.
Violet is the warmest of the cool tones, giving it a vital feeling. It also carries the impression of serenity. Avoid overusing violet to prevent its warmth from detracting from its serene aspect., Bright colors carry a sense of energy. Using bright colors is a good way to balance cool tones so that the overall effect isn't cold and drab. However, you may need to tone down some bright colors to prevent them from throwing off the balance of your color scheme.


When painting, you can soften colors that are too vibrant by adding a little white to them or dull them with some black. Be sure you only mix together the same kinds of paint. Different brands/types of paint may be impossible to mix due to their ingredients.
For example, you can create a cool, refreshing atmosphere with a base of cyan, dark blue, and black. Accent these with beige and a muted red. The red should give this color scheme an upbeat feel., Whereas bright colors can be softened with the addition of small amounts of white, adding a substantial amount of white creates a ""washed out"" effect in a color. This is the basis of pastel colors.


These soft colors create a wide open effect that's useful in smaller spaces. Pastels also impart a comfortable and airy atmosphere.For example, in a child's play room, you might use a pastel blue as the primary color to give the sense of being under a soft blue sky, and then combine this with pastel green to add a vital feeling to the color scheme.

, Neutral colors, like white, gray, and black work with most other colors, when used as accents, and are great for adding definition to your color scheme. Earth tones, like beige, brown, and shades of umber and ochre are also sometimes considered neutral colors.


Earth tones tend to add sense of warmth to a color scheme. Beyond this, the natural sense evoked by these colors can bring with them a feeling of tranquility."

Balance design choices with lighting.,
Integrate your design with its intended function.,
Coordinate with the existing features of your home.",How to Choose Soothing Home Decor3," Rooms that have good lighting will clearly reveal the colors used in it. For this reason, bright rooms might need to be toned down a little with darker colors. Soft, light colors, however, work better for darker rooms.The direction the windows in the room face also can have an effect on lighting. For example, if a room only receives evening light, this will generally be deeper in color and have a golden tint. This can give colors a muted tone.
Shadows may be cast by trees or outdoor features into the space you are decorating. Generally, you can expect shadows to have a darkening effect on your color scheme. Use lighter cool tones in this case.

, Matching your decorating choices to suit the function of a place can make them feel more fitting. For example, even though red isn't traditionally considered soothing, it stimulates appetite, making it an excellent color to add to restaurants, dining rooms, and so on.Green and shades of this color are great for sitting rooms, family spaces, and even offices.
The natural, soft feeling given from earth tones make these a strong choice for places like bedrooms or rooms without windows.
Dark colors, like blacks, grays, and earth tones can add definition to a room without becoming distracting. These are great colors to use in an office or reading room.

, You'll likely have to plan your interior decorating around some existing features of your home. For example, re-flooring your home might not be an option, so you'll have to make design choices that match well with your current flooring. Other features you may have to integrate with your design include:


Cabinetry, wall color, fixtures (includes outlets, sink fixtures, door knobs, and so on), countertops, sills, and more."

",How to Repair a Concrete Floor," The illustrations in this article show a repair where a slab reinforcing bar was too near the surface, and the concrete cracked. Other possible problems may include the following.


Ridges or humps left by the finishers.
Expansion or contraction cracks. Properly installed concrete should have joints that prevent this unsightly cracking. For a 4-inch thick slab, joints should be spaced 8 to 12 feet apart. If jointing is not sufficient, or improperly placed, cracks can occur. Typically these cracks are not structural and only need to be repaired for aesthetic purposes.
Debris like chunks of wood floating out of the concrete while it is still plastic (wet).
Damage caused by heavy objects being dropped on the slab before it is cured.
Surface scaling caused by improper finishing or freezing temperatures during curing. Scaling is when parts of the concrete surface flake away.;
, This may include bumps, depressions, or ridges. Small areas of shallow surface irregularities may be concealed with a floor leveling compound, rather than chipping out and replacing the actual concrete.

, For small jobs, a chipping hammer will be all you need, but larger repairs are much easier with an electric chipping hammer or even a jack hammer. Professionals also use grinding machines to prep the surface for repairs.

, This will allow the new material to have a solid surface to adhere to. A wire brush is a good choice for this step. A stiff bristled broom or paintbrush will also work. Depending on the age and condition of the concrete chemical cleaning may be required, it is best to consult a pro.

, Mix the dry ingredients first, using a proportion of 1 part Portland Cement (type I or II) to 2 1/2 parts clean masonry sand.

, Note that some bonding agents are applied directly to the area to be patched, like glue, so follow the instructions on the manufacturer's label.

, Do not flood the area, but make sure all surfaces are dampened, to assist in adhering the new cement mixture, as well as keeping the mixture from drying too quickly. Dry surfaces simply draw the moisture from the cement mixture too quickly, and will cause it to shrink, and ultimately, to crack.

, Place the mixture into, or on the patch location, and work it into the space forcefully with the trowel to force out any air bubbles.

, Allow it to dry and become stiff for an hour or so, depending on humidity and temperature.

, This will flatten and smooth the surface, and cause cement paste to rise to the surface. Very large, deep areas may be floated with a magnesium float to bring more cement paste up. This paste is the material that forms the surface of the finished slab.

, At this point, you may need to splash a little water on the surface to slow the drying, as well as making the finishing process somewhat easier. Use the edge of your trowel to shave, or scrape off any of your cement mixture which has spread to the adjacent, finished surface. Another good choice for patching materials are hydraulic cements. They usually set up in less than 30 min.

Avoid plastic.,
Be discerning with fabrics.,
Favor sustainable non-toxic materials.",How to Choose Eco‐Friendly Home Decor1," If you’re concerned about the environment, treat plastic as your #1 enemy. Whether you’re looking for a new lamp, flooring, or furniture, scratch any products made from this material off your list. Expect plastic to have wide-ranging consequences on the environment. For instance:The chemicals in plastic are poisonous to wildlife. This is a particular threat to marine life, which are more likely to ingest plastic.
Plastic debris in oceans and waterways provides transport for both plants and animals. This can introduce invasive species to new environments with devastating results.
Plastic can endure for centuries or even millennia with prolonged negative effects on the environment.
Nearly 10% of all oil production is devoted to the manufacturing of plastics.;
, Any time that you use fabric to touch up your home decor (such as with curtains, bedding, throw pillows, or rugs), check which materials are used. Expect some fabrics to be non-biodegradable. Additionally, be aware that some are highly consumptive of energy during production and/or otherwise harmful to the environment in less obvious ways (such as utilizing pesticides during production).Fabrics with negative impacts on the environment include non-organic cotton, nylon, polyester, rayon, and non-organic wool.
Sustainable fabrics include bamboo, organic cotton, hemp, linen, and organic wool.Also be aware that dyes, bleach, and formaldehyde are often used in the production of fabrics, which should also be avoided.

, Whenever you purchase new home decor, consider both the before and after for each product. Choose materials that cause minimal negative impact on the environment both in terms of production and future impact, like wood, metal, and glass. Whether you’re looking to paint a room, carpet a floor, or just buy a picture frame, research your options and become an informed consumer.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency provides an extensive guide to eco-friendly choices for your home at https://www.epa.gov/greenerproducts/identify-greener-products-and-services.
Recycled materials (such as plastic lumber) are also a popular choice, since they often use relatively little energy to make without bringing any new harmful materials into existence.

Cure the concrete.,
Seal the concrete.",How to Finish Concrete," If you are unfamiliar with pouring concrete, follow the linked instructions to ensure you do so correctly. Be ready to move on to the next steps as soon as you pour.;
, Many modern concrete mixes do not need to be compressed, or ""tamped"", before finishing, and tamping the wrong mix can weaken the slab.Confirm your decision with a professional before tamping.


If you do decide to tamp, simply press the concrete down using any variety of tamping tool (hand, rolling, etc.).

, Find the straightest lumber 2x4 you can find and place it across the barriers holding the concrete in place, or ""forms"". The 2x4 should extend at least a foot past the forms in each direction. This object is referred to as a screed board.

, Using the technique described below, move the 2x4 down the forms to remove excess concrete.Use a sawing motion to pull and push the 2x4 across the concrete as you move it down the length of the forms. This sawing motion helps prevent tearing as you level the surface.
Tilt the leading edge slightly away from the direction of travel to create a thin cutting edge where the screed board meets the concrete.
Keep at least a 1 inch (2.5cm) hump of concrete in front of the edge at all times. This will fill any holes in the concrete's surface.
Pour and level in stages for larger projects.
At the end of the slab, push the excess concrete against the forms for easy removal with later tools.

, The bull float is a flat, long-handled tool used to flatten minor ridges and holes, as well as embed aggregate particles further into the concrete, bringing the smoother ""cream"" consistency concrete to the surface for better finishing.Move the bull float back and forth across the slab, perpendicular to the direction you moved the leveling board. (In other words, move the bull float between the two forms the 2x4 was resting on.)
Slightly lift the leading edge to create a smaller cutting edge of contact, lifting the tool toward you when pushing and away from you while pulling. Don't overdo it; the edge of the tool should remain level with the concrete.
Try to finish this process before any ""bleed water"" leaks out onto the concrete's surface., A darby is a short-handled tool that serves the same purpose as a bull float for smaller projects.A ""power float"" or ""helicopter"" is a powered tool used on large projects.


Move the darby back and forth in overlapping arcs until the whole surface has been covered twice.
A power float requires two people to place it carefully onto the slab, but only one to operate it. It takes a little practice to work properly, so stay near the center of the slab while you're learning to avoid damaging the concrete's edge., An edging tool is designed to create level edges and corners next to the form, where your larger bull float or darby is less accurate. This will create more durable edges as well as improve the concrete's appearance.Use a back-and-forth motion in a 1- to 2-ft. (0.3–0.6m) area before moving on to the next. As with previous tools, lift the leading edge of the tool.
Don't press too deeply into the concrete; this can create impressions that are difficult to remove.

, These are called control joints and direct the concrete's inevitable cracking in such a way that appearance and functionality are minimally affected. These should cut 25% of the way through the concrete's depth.The distance between joints should be no more than 24 times the thickness of the slab.If you are working in the imperial system, calculate this by doubling the thickness of your slab in inches and using that measurement as feet. (For instance, a 4"" (10 cm) slab should have joints no more than 8' (2.4m) apart.)
Every inside corner of your slab and every corner that touches a building or step should have a control joint extending from it, as these are common cracking locations.Use a straightedge or snap line to lightly mark the joints before cutting and keep your tool straight as you cut.
A grooving tool works well for most projects. If your concrete has already started to dry and crack, use a dry-cut saw that can cut to the desired depth. For extra large projects, use a long-handled marking tool.

, It takes experience to learn the correct timing for concrete, since its drying speed depends on many factors such as the characteristics of the mix and the local temperature and humidity. Here are the basic details:


As the concrete sets, excess ""bleed water"" will rise to the surface. Wait until this water has evaporated and the wet shine of the concrete has started to disappear.
If the concrete is still quite wet and forms ridges when you move on to the next step, wait longer.
If the concrete becomes too hard and dry to finish properly, throw additional water onto its surface. This is a last resort as it will result in weakness and scaling in the final slab.

, If you are coloring your concrete using a powder that adds color to the top layer, apply this in the amount specified on the label while the concrete still has a full wet shine. It will still require a little more drying before you proceed to the next stage.


Only use on horizontal surfaces and with proper safety equipment to avoid inhalation., This is the final smoothing, bringing the more consistent ""cream"" of the concrete to the surface for a level, durable finish. Different materials will provide different effects:Magnesium floats are very popular among professionals, since they are lightweight and excellent at opening up the concrete's pores for evaporation.
Aluminum floats are very similar to magnesium, but somewhat heavier and stronger (and so a little more difficult to handle).
Wooden floats (redwood or hardwood) are cheap but wear out quickly. They create a rough fuzzy surface useful for very stiff concrete or if using colored hardeners (which need to be mixed in with the rougher tool).
Laminated-canvas resin floats are used for the same purposes as wood but are a much more durable (and expensive) tool.
As before, lift the leading edge slightly and make shallow flat motions across the surface.

, Many people skip troweling if they plan to broom, as it only results in minor improvement in that scenario. Troweling without brooming results in a very slick surface (unsafe for surfaces that will get wet) and may cause fine cracks to develop called ""crazing"".Use a magnesium trowel in much the same way you used previous finishing tools. You can create a very smooth finish by passing over the slab two or three times, waiting for the concrete to dry slightly between passes and lifting the leading edge a little more each time.Steel trowels can also be used, but inexpert timing could cause the steel to trap water inside the concrete and damage it.Troweling too deep or troweling ""air-entrained"" concrete mixes can release the concrete's air bubbles and prevent it from setting correctly.
Larger troweling tools (or other long-handled finishing tools) are sometimes referred to as ""fresnos"".These are handy for reaching the center of large slabs. Alternatively, use a hand trowel but kneel on wooden boards when you need to be on the slab to prevent leaving deep impressions.

, Most people end with a broom finish to create a non-slip surface. You can do this with or without a preceding trowel finish.


Use a medium stiff or stiffer shop broom (the wide rectangular kind). The bristles should be stiff enough to leave noticeable marks, and the concrete should be soft enough to be shaped by them but hard enough to retain them (not sinking back together).
Dip the broom into a bucket of water, then shake off the excess (not onto the concrete).
Drag the broom gently over the concrete in segments. Overlap the previous segment to ensure full coverage.
If the surface is intended to drain, create the grooves in the direction liquids are supposed to flow., The final drying process of concrete takes several weeks, and if ""cured"" at the correct rate minimizes the chance of later damage.


The simplest method is to wet the concrete's surface and cover it with plastic sheeting. Weigh down the sheet's edges with heavy objects.
There are many other ways to keep the concrete wet, but these tend to require more water or maintenance than plastic.Concrete curing chemicals are often used for professional jobs. These come in many varieties, so consult someone familiar with your concrete mix for advice on selecting one.Begin curing as soon as possible. Once begun, keep off foot traffic for 24 hours, light vehicles such as bicycles for 1 week, and car traffic for 2 weeks. Complete curing takes at least 30 days, and longer at the corners and edges., After the concrete has cured for at least a month, use a concrete sealer to make it resistant to liquid damage and easy to clean.Clean the slab well before applying sealant.
Apply thinly to avoid puddles. If needed, wait a couple hours (or as the label instructs you), then apply a second layer perpendicular to the first.
Allow sealant to dry completely before walking over or placing anything onto the concrete. Wait three days before allowing vehicle traffic.

Shop for durability.,
Shop locally.,
Favor used products.,
Repurpose old items.,
Utilize nature.,
Choose paint colors that will last.",How to Choose Eco‐Friendly Home Decor2," Whether you’re picking out new furniture, redoing your floors, or painting your bedroom room a new color, think long-term. Recognize that constantly updating or replacing your decor will have negative consequences on the environment, even if you’re using eco-friendly materials. Avoid impulse shopping or immediately going with what seems like the cheapest option. Instead, make choices that will satisfy your tastes for years to come and invest in decor that will last a long time. For example:Say you want a new armchair, but your current budget is limited. Although you may be tempted to go with the cheapest option available, wait it out and save more money for a future purchase, since a cheaply constructed chair will likely break down in a shorter amount of time. This will increase your footprint with physical waste plus more energy consumption through production and transportation.

, Between globalization and online shopping, the marketplace for decor is as wide as the world. However, keep in mind that the farther a product has to travel, the larger your footprint is due to the energy consumed during transportation. Although there may be great deals out there from far-flung sources, prioritize local ones to minimize the amount of pollution and lost resources that transportation causes. Apply this mindset not only to local vendors, but their sources as well. For instance:If you’re buying new wooden flooring from a store just down the street, the amount of distance your flooring has to travel from store to home is next to nil. However, if the store gets their timber from half a world away, shopping at a store one town over may be preferable if they get their timber from sources closer to home.

, Remember that even with sustainable materials, the act of production creates pollution and uses up finite resources. Reduce your contribution to this unfortunate effect by using secondhand items to furnish and decorate your home. Visit thrift stores, yard sales, and flea markets. Utilize the internet to find items for sale (or even freebies) through social media and online classifieds. Ask friends, family, and neighbors to let you know when they plan on getting rid of any items that you might want or need.Don’t let pride get in the way. Keep your eyes peeled for items being tossed out with other people’s garbage. Find out your sanitation department’s schedules for bulk pick-up in your area and go cruising. If you live near a college town, take advantage of the fact that many rental leases expire at the same time of year, which means the streets may be lined with discarded furniture and items.

, Eliminate the environmental impact of both production and transportation. Use items that you already have to fill new roles as part of your home decor. There is no limit to the DIY projects that can transform one object into another. You can do anything from:Make a new ottoman out of a plastic milk crate.
Transform empty tea, cookie, or popcorn tins as flower pots, pencil jars, candleholders, or umbrella stands.
Use an old door as a tabletop for a new coffee table.

, Decorate your home with plants and indoor potted trees. Not only are these sustainable decor choices, but they can improve the overall health of your household. Use these to combat toxic pollutants like formaldehyde that items like cleaning products and furniture components can introduce to your home.In addition to live plants, consider other natural materials that can be incorporated into eye-catching decorations, like:Pinecones
Stones
Antlers
Driftwood

, In addition to seeking out toxic-free paints, lower your footprint even more by carefully considering which colors to use. Remember that even your toxic-free paint will still create pollution and use up resources through production and transportation. So, when deciding which color to paint a room, consider how much sunlight that rooms receive. Even if you have your heart set on a dark color, go with a lighter shade if it receives a lot. This way any fading will be less noticeable, which means each paint job will last longer."

Utilize daylight.,
Make smart choices with electric lighting.,
Make your windows energy-efficient.",How to Choose Eco‐Friendly Home Decor3," Let the sun light your home for you rather than rely on electric lighting during the daytime. If possible, install skylights for increased lighting. Switch your solid outside doors to ones with paned glass. Leave your blinds and curtains opening between sunrise and sunset. If privacy is a concern, use other home decor to maximize the natural light while partially blocking the sun with sheer or wooden blinds. For instance, you could: as:Use light colors to paint your walls.
Add mirrors and other reflective or shiny surfaces to each room.
Keep your windows clear of any furniture that would block the light.

, For bulbs, use CFL (compact fluorescent light) or LED (light-emitting diode) bulbs rather than incandescent ones, since these two types last much longer and add up to less waste.With fixtures, install or keep as many as you need in order to see comfortably, but seek out ways to avoid excessive lighting. For example:If your ceiling fan holds four or five light bulbs, but only two or three are needed to light the space, remove the unnecessary ones.
Give yourself some options by, say, providing a table- or standing lamp in a room with track lighting so you can alternate between the two depending on your needs.
Invest in some solar-powered lamps to keep near windows and other sources of natural light.

, Replace your existing windows with ones that have been treated to reflect heat, so hot air stays outside in the summer and your heated air stays inside during the winter.If this isn’t possible, caulk your windows and add weather-stripping to reduce leakage. Add storm windows for additional insulation. Keep the temperature inside your home as consistent as possible to minimize active use of your heating and a/c units.Give your windows extra help by choosing thermal-backed curtains and blinds. Although this may contradict the tip about keeping curtains open for sunlight, keep them closed for more insulation during extreme temperatures, since your heating and cooling units use more energy than a couple light bulbs.

,
Place 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) plywood or 2x12 lumber along the path spaced for the concrete truck wheels to travel on if the subgrade is not packed sufficiently to support this heavy load without creating ruts, or damaging reinforcing bars or wire.

,

Clean up your tools, find a recliner, and hope the Tylenol will help you out of bed the next day.",How to Finish a Large Span of Concrete,"]]Set your forms. These need to be set to the correct grade, braced securely, and aligned correctly.;
, Normally, the straight-edge for ""screeding"", or levelling off the plastic concrete, should be less than 16 feet (4.9 m), unless you have lots of people to ""pull"" the excess concrete from in front as you progress down the length of the placement. 12 feet (3.7 m) is a more reasonable width for 2 persons working the screed board, and one person raking the higher concrete in front of the screed.

, This is a guide to keep the screed at the correct height so that the concrete finishes off flat. It can be a 2x2 board, or a 1 1⁄2 to 2 inch (3.8 to 5.1 cm) metal pipe set on top of stakes, that can be removed from the concrete after the first section is placed. With 2X2 lumber, simply cut 2X2 stakes long enough to be driven snugly into the soil beneath the form. The pipe screed can be screwed to small metal or wood stakes in a similar fashion, using a string line stretched tightly across the outside form boards to keep it at the correct elevation.

,,, You will need to cut the joints into the slab in sections if the process of placing the concrete takes long enough so that the material begins setting up before you are finished placing your concrete. This will usually apply only to exposed concrete like driveways and patios, interior slabs that are covered with carpet or other flooring may not require control joints.

,, Measure the width and length, and multiply these measurements to get the area, then multiply the area times the decimal measurement of depth in the same measuring system, either feet or meters. If using meters, this will give you the cubic volume in meters, if you use feet, divide the result by 27 and you will have the volume in cubic yards, the unit by which ready mixed concrete is sold in the USA.

, You will need at least 3 able persons to assist with the placement of your concrete. This includes 2 persons to pull the screed board, and one to operate the concrete shoot, placing the material in a uniform depth ahead of the screed.

, Inclement weather can make it almost impossible to finish the concrete correctly. Temperatures below 40 degrees (F) are generally considered too cold for this operation, and by no means should the concrete be placed if there is a possibility of the mix freezing before it cures. Rain, especially heavy downpours can wash away the cement paste leaving nothing but gravel and sand on the concrete's surface.

, For a simply broom or sack finished driveway, you will need an edger, jointer, bullfloat with 10 feet (3.0 m) of handles, magnesium or wood hand floats, a straight edge board, shovels, and 1 or 2 ""come-alongs"". A come-along is like a wide flat hoe with a wooden or fiberglass handle, used to rake and pull the plastic concrete ahead of the screed board to the correct height. For hard trowelled finished concrete, it would probably benefit you to rent a power trowel, but these are heavy and powerful machines, so use common sense where this applies.

, Large ""pours"", or placements, may take hours and several truckloads of material, so schedule accordingly, allowing yourself time to complete the job before dark.

, Normally, a concrete truck's discharge chute will reach about 10–12 feet (3.0–3.7 m) from the nearest wheel, so it is possible to place a 16 foot (4.9 m) wide slab from the outside of the forms.

, If you are doing a non-specification placement, get the driver to adjust the slump to about 5 or 6 inches (12.7 or 15.2 cm) by adding water. Keep in mind that the more water you add, the less structural strength the finished concrete will have, due to chemical processes in the hydration of the materials, but trying to make a large placement with inexperienced people is difficult enough with ""wet"" concrete.

, Have the driver of the truck pull forward slowly while he discharges to keep from piling up large quantities of concrete that has to be pulled down the form. The discharging concrete should not accumulate more than a few feet ahead of the screed board at any time.

, It often helps to tilt the screed board back about 10 to 15 degrees as you pull it, and some finishers prefer to ""saw"" the board back and forth across the concrete to close up small voids in the surface.

, Because the material is plastic, if you allow it to build up in front of your board, it will flow underneath it, leaving the product high behind the screed.

, This is done with a concrete jointer, an inexpensive wood handled tool available from hardware stores and home improvement warehouses.

, If you have left a path for the truck to back down through your pour, you will have to stop the truck long enough to quickly set the end form in place and stake it down.

, Pull out the pipe or floating screeds. If the weather is fairly cool, or you have placed the concrete too plastic, it may sag somewhat along the edges, but it should maintain grade close enough to the edge to ""wet screed"", or use the concrete to hold the straight edge to grade. If will not hold grade, you will have to leave the floating screed in place until the placement is complete, then walk in the wet concrete and pull it out, filling the little trench or depression in with shovels full of concrete as you go.
, The person holding the straight edge on top of the adjacent wet concrete will need to just allow it to ""float"" or skim across the top of that material.

, This may mean having an extra person working behind the crew who is doing the placement. This is especially true in hot, dry weather, or on dry, porous material which allows the concrete to begin to set much more quickly. The bull float is pushed across the surface of the wet concrete with the front edge tilted up, (by holding the handle down) and pulled back with the back edge tilted up (by holding the handle high). Tilt the float just enough going each way so that the leading, or forward to travel direction edge doesn't dig into the wet concrete. Spraying a mist of water on the concrete's surface will help ease the float across it.

,,, If the slab is not going to be exposed to high temperatures, hot sun, or dry winds, curing is optional. Many people will argue this point, but without engineering specifications and design requirements, there is no absolute ""requirement"" for curing the concrete.

, If you are a weekend warrior type concrete finisher, you may think twice about contracting your next large pour.

Scoop some concrete mix from the bag into the bucket mold.,
Fill a large pitcher with water to mix with the concrete.,
Slowly pour the water into the dry concrete.",How to Make a Concrete Stool1," To open the bag, Cut with scissors along the top of the paper.


Keep the thickness in mind as you pour in the concrete mix––the stool cannot be too thick or it may be top heavy and topple over (especially if you're making a tall stool). Filling to about a third or quarter of the bucket should be ample for a good stool.
Unused powdered concrete mixture should be tightly sealed and kept in a dry, cool place where moisture cannot get to it.;
, It’s better to slowly add and mix water into concrete, so if hosing in the water, use a carefully controlled nozzle to ensure a slow addition of water rather than a fierce blast.

, As you pour the water into the concrete, use a sturdy stick or paint stirrer to combine the mixture into a smooth paste.


Also follow any instructions provided on the concrete packaging.

Always pour acid into water, not the reverse.",How to Acid Etch Concrete," Before you start your etching, you'll want to make sure you have enough of a suitable acid to complete your project — having to run out to the hardware store in the middle of your etching project is a serious pain. Muriatic acid (also called hydrochloric acid) is the most common type of acid used for this project. It's difficult to say exactly how much acid any given project will need because the acid is usually sold in varying strengths. In very general terms, 1⁄4 gallon (0.9 L) of acid (when properly diluted) will cover about 50-70 square feet of concrete (about 4.5-6.5 square meters).Other suitable acids for etching include phosphoric acid and sulfamic acid. The latter is an especially good choice for first-timers because it is much less caustic and dangerous than the other acids.If you're unsure of whether you have the right type of acid, check the label on its packaging — most suitable products will mention that they can be used for concrete etching purposes.;
, To begin, remove any any all furniture, vehicles, and other obstructions from the area you intend to treat. Etching acids can permanently damage common objects if allowed to remain in contact with them for even short periods of time, so have them well out of the way by the time you start your project.


You'll also want to give the area a good sweeping to remove accumulated dust, dirt, or grime. The acid needs to be able to touch every part of the concrete's surface to react properly with it. Even small pieces of debris can interfere with the reaction, potentially causing an uneven etching.

, If you're etching concrete in your garage or on your driveway, there's a chance that there may be oil or grease stains on the driveway from your vehicle. Etching acids can't penetrate through oily substances, which means that any concrete under an oil stain will go un-etched. To remove oil and grease stains, try scrubbing with a commercial degreasing product — these are available from most home improvement stores for fairly cheap.


Alternatively, try using ordinary laundry detergent. Most detergents are formulated to dissolve oil and grease, making them perfect for degreasing your concrete surface.

, When your concrete is perfectly clean and clear, use a hose with a sprayer attachment to wet the entire surface of the concrete. Spread the water evenly across the surface until all of the concrete is wet but no standing water remains. The concrete should stay at this level of wetness until the acid is applied.


If you'll be etching up to any adjacent walls or other surfaces, be sure to also wet the bottom inch or so to minimize the possibility of direct contact with the acid.

, Add clean, clear water to a plastic bucket. Very carefully pour your acid in, being sure not to cause any spills or splashes. Don't use a metal container — acid can corrode many metals, leading to the possible destruction of the container.



Always pour acid into water. Never pour water into acid. If acid splashes back into your face, it can lead to disfiguring injuries or even blindness.
From this point forward, you'll want to observe basic acid safety measures. Wear long sleeves, gloves, eye protection, and, if necessary, a face mask to protect against any fumes. For more information, see the safety section below.

, Most 3:1 or 4:1 mixtures of acid will be a suitable strength for etching concrete. However, before you pour your mixture on to the floor, it's a very wise idea to test it on a small, unimportant area of the concrete (like a spot that would normally be covered by furniture or tool boxes) to make sure it works. Pour about 1/2 cup directly on to the concrete. If it's strong enough, it should immediately begin to bubble and react.


If you don't immediately see bubbles, your mixture probably isn't strong enough. Consider carefully adding more acid.

, Rather than pour all of the acid onto one spot of the floor, which can leave some of the acid spent by the time it reaches the far corners of the concrete, use a plastic sprayer or watering can. This ensures a more even application. Immediately after spraying, use a squeegee to manually distribute so that the whole floor receives an even coating. You may also use a floor machine to scrub the floor and distribute the acid.


The floor needs to stay wet the entire time you are acid etching. Don't let the acid dry on the floor — if you need to, hose down areas that are drying out.

, When you're sure that your acid has been evenly applied, simply step away from the floor and wait for it to stop bubbling. Usually, this will take about 2-15 minutes.As the acid reacts with the floor, it will open up small, porous holes in the concrete, making it much more accepting of your intended sealant.


Inspect the surface as the acid works. You want the acid to be reacting evenly and uniformly across the surface. If there are spots where the acid isn't reacting, this can be a sign that an unnoticed grease stain or sealant was present on the concrete. In this case, you may need to use a mechanical solution, like a grinder, to finish etching the concrete., Check your acid's label — many will require using a special neutralizing solution to stop the reaction of the acid, while some others may ""time out"" on their own. For acids that require a neutralizing solution, mix the neutralizer and distribute it throughout the floor according to the instructions on the packaging. Usually, you'll need to spray the neutralizer and scrub with a squeegee or use the floor machine to ensure the entire surface has been neutralized.


For a general, all-purpose acid neutralizer, try mixing 1 cup of baking soda in 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water, then mixing until it dissolves., At this point, your concrete should have a clean, freshly-etched appearance. You're now ready to clean up. Use a broom or squeegee to gather the rinse water into one area, then suck it up with a shop vacuum. Read packaging instructions for how to properly dispose of your acid — you may have to add more baking soda to further neutralize it before pouring it down the drain.


Alternatively, if you're working in a garage, you may be able to simply rinse your neutralized solution directly out of the garage and into a drain. Check your local regulations before doing this — you don't want to break the law or hurt the environment.

, Many acid etching projects are carried out to prepare a concrete floor for the application of a synthetic epoxy or sealant. These sorts of products give the concrete a professional-looking sheen and also resist water, grease, oil, and other common spills, making the floor easy to maintain. In addition, using an anti-skid additive in your sealant can give your garage or driveway surface the traction your vehicle needs to securely grip it in rain or snow., Adding a stain or pigment to the concrete after etching is a great way to make it more visually attractive. For some interior spaces, stained concrete can give a clean, elegant, modern look to the room. Even some outdoor spaces, like patios, can use stained concrete to great effect.

, Concrete can also be painted fairly easily with brushes, rollers, or sprayers. Though it's a little less common to paint a concrete floor than it is to paint a concrete wall or ceiling, some decorators can create breathtaking interior spaces with the help of painted concrete floors. For painted concrete floors, generally, low-sheen, matte paints are used — otherwise, the floor can appear oddly shiny or ""wet""., Many sidewalks, driveways, and other exterior concrete surfaces can be given an appealing sparkling quality by adding metal chips flakes before sealing or during the etching process. Even some interior spaces (especially public or commercial ones) can benefit from this type of treatment — for instance, sparkling concrete floors are sometimes used in shopping malls and airport corridors to give a lively look.

, All acids (but especially the strong ones used for concrete etching) should be handled with care. If splashed onto the body, caustic acid can cause painful chemical burns. Worse still, acid can cause permanent blindness and disfigurement if splashed into the face and eyes. Because of this, it's important to always wear protective gear when working with acid, even if you're very experienced. Below are the sorts of protective clothing you should wear to protect yourself:


Chemical safety glasses or goggles with face shield
Gloves
Long sleeves
Close-toed shoes

, Strong acids like muriatic acid can give off harmful vapors. If breathed, these fumes can cause chemical burns in the mouth and throat. Though rare, it's technically possible to seriously hurt or even kill yourself by breathing acid vapors. For these reasons, you'll want to ensure that your work area is well-ventilated at all times. For instance, you'll probably want to open any adjacent windows and use a fan to keep air continually circulating into and out of your work area.


If the acid's fumes are strong, use a breathing mask with acid vapor cartridges to prevent injury.

, This is a hugely important basic rule of acid safety. Whenever you pour and mix acid and water, you always pour the acid into the water. You never pour the water into the acid. If you pour either liquid too quickly, you can cause the liquid in the container to splash back into you. If this liquid is mostly water, you'll probably be fine. However, if it's mostly acid, you can be in serious trouble. Always observe this simple rule when working with acid.


It may be helpful to keep a second bucket or plastic container with you while you work. If you accidentally pour acid into the first container first, you can pour water into the second container and then transfer the acid to it to easily correct for your error.

Choose a unifying theme.,
Focus on a neutral color palette.,
Add accent pieces.,
Choose a focal point.,

A large painting
A unique table
Two retro mod chairs
A wall decal
Full-length book shelves
An ornate mirror

,
Get rid of dated details.,
Avoid clutter.,

Decorative shelves should ideally not be crammed with items.",How to Fake Expensive Decor1," A well-coordinated room will look expensive even if the décor is cheap. Choose a theme that will tie together your room. This will help you look for inexpensive pieces while making it seem as though you paid an interior decorator. Rooms that seem confused, cluttered, and mismatched have the look of poverty rather than luxury even if the pieces are lovely.

For example:

A beach-themed room would have pictures of the ocean, shell decorations, and a blue-green palette.
A rustic, woodsy theme would have wood detailing, paintings of landscapes, and an earthy palette.
Industrial themes use repurposed items, steel accents, and sharp edges to give the room a more modern edge. Gray, brick red, and black are popular colors.

Minimalism is a popular and trendy design scheme where you use as few pieces as possible to decorate your room. Simple furniture and white or neutral colors will make the room look as though it is featured in a magazine, but the style is inexpensive to recreate.;
, Stick with white or light neutral shades, such as brown or gray, for the base color. Your walls and larger furniture pieces should belong to this color scheme. For example, you might have beige walls with white doors and gray furniture. Your décor will stand out against neutral colors more, which will make them seem more prominent. Some neutral colors you can mix and match include:


Gray
Slate Blue
Taupe
Soft yellow
Off-white shades like ivory and cream
Coffee brown
Tan
Beige

, Accent pieces are small decorative items that contrast with your neutral color scheme. They are usually either brightly colored or patterned. Accent pieces can be easily and cheaply be replaced if you ever change your style. Make sure all of your accent pieces are the same color for maximum effect. Some items you might consider for accents include:


Vases
Pillows
Blanket
Frames
Ottoman
Tablecloth
Flowers
Striped, dotted, or chevron patterned objects

, A focal point is a piece of furniture, art, or object that is the primary decoration in the room. Having one grand piece will draw attention to it, making it seem important and pricey. A room in which there is no clear focus tends to feel cheap.,, The key to making your décor seem expensive is to follow modern trends. To help your room remain stylish and cool, you should reduce the dated elements of its décor.Some common out-of-style elements include:


Vertical window blinds
Formica tables
Clear plastic furniture
Furniture painted to resemble marble or stone
Broken decor such as torn posters, cracked vases, or splintered wood. (In general--unless it is part of ""the look"" such as a vintage poster, crackle glazed vase, or reclaimed barn wood coffee table.)

, Ironically, having less decor in a room makes the overall impression that of luxury--not a room that is filled with furniture and decorative items. Limit how many decorative pieces you put out. This creates the impression that you spent more on a few, expensive items instead of buying many cheaper items. When placing your decorative items around the room, keep a little bit of space between each item., It's tempting to fill that space with stuff. Instead, only fill 1/2 to 3/4 of the space, leaving some empty space.
Keep your surfaces, such as coffee tables, counters, and TV stands mostly clear.

Choose only one or two items to place on these surfaces.
For example, you might keep a lamp on a side table with a single picture frame but nothing else.


If in doubt, remove. Try taking out a piece of furniture. See what happens if the coffee table is simply moved to the family room. Or see what happens if you remove throw pillows. You may find that less is more.

Use the garden hoe bottom to smooth and level the bottom of the stool, if necessary.,
Add the stool legs.,
Allow the concrete to set.",How to Make a Concrete Stool2," The concrete will most likely be smoothed already but use the tool if needed.


, Strategically place the legs inside the concrete, making sure you add the legs while the concrete is still wet and can absorb the legs. If necessary, hold the legs in place while the concrete sets.


Check that the leg ends are all aligned evenly, to avoid a wobbly stool!

, This can take up to 20 hours (see the packaging instructions). The concrete must be completely set before you remove the stool structure from the bucket.

"
Tear the bucket away from the dried concrete.,
Turn the stool right side up so that it stands on its legs.,
Make any adjustments if needed (such as cutting down uneven legs, etc.).,
Sand around the concrete base of the stool with the sandpaper.,
You now have a chic concrete stool.


",How to Make a Concrete Stool3," Bend the sides of the bucket outwards so that the concrete begins to loosen.

, Now you can see how it works.

You might also like to add non-slip bases to the bottom of the legs. Ask at the hardware store for appropriate additions.

, This will smooth and shape the seat.

Build a wall out of the broken pieces.",How to Break Up Concrete," Always call the local utility company to make sure there are underground utilities beneath the concrete. Hire a professional if there are: Digging above a utility line like gas or electric is very dangerous.;
, Concrete removal creates hazardous dust and sharp fragments, so protect yourself and coworkers with safety goggles, dust masks or respirators, steel toe or other heavy boots, thick gloves, and thick clothing that covers arms and legs.If you're going to be using power tools, especially a jackhammer, use ear protection.







, This will cause a possible slipping and tripping hazard, and will make it difficult to see your work, but in some situations it could be worthwhile.


If you don't use plastic sheeting, protect any nearby windows and breakable objects with plywood sheets to protect the glass from concrete fragments.







, Whether you're using a sledgehammer or jackhammer, you may need to pry apart the pieces of concrete as you break them apart.This job will be much quicker if you have one person breaking apart the concrete and one person following along and prying the pieces apart.







, If your concrete is 4"" (10cm) thick or less, try using a sledgehammer.


Start at a corner or edge where possible. Keep in mind that the lateral strength of concrete increases with thicker cross sections. You may find that undermining, or removing soil from beneath the slab will help you it break away more easily.






Use the pry bar to pull apart the chunks of concrete after you break them apart.






If after ten minutes you've failed to make significant cracks or you are exhausted, you may want to try a demolition hammer.







, An 60 pound breaker should be sufficient for most home jobs. Only rent a heavy duty pneumatic jackhammer for extremely difficult concrete.


Only use a chisel point bit to break up concrete. This concentrates force for the best results.






Let the weight of the machine do the job; it's not necessary to add force by pushing down. Forcing the bit will cause damage to the machine and possibly wedge the bit.






If the concrete doesn't crack immediately, stop hammering and move over a few inches. More hammering could get the drill bit stuck and you would have to waste a lot of time pulling it out again.






Break pieces 2–3 inches (5–8cm) away from each other to minimize chances of a stuck drill bit.






Use the pry bar to pull apart chunks of concrete after you crack them apart.







, You may encounter supports inside the concrete after you start cutting. Deal with them as you go to separate the chunks of concrete:


If the concrete is held together by wire mesh, you'll need bolt cutters to snip it apart. Large welded wire fabric will require bolt cutters, but number 10 wire can be cut with side cutting pliers.






Metal reinforcing bars will take much longer to cut apart. Use a reciprocating saw or an angle grinder with a cutoff blade.







, If chunks of concrete remain locked together, making it hard to break the surrounding area, clear the surrounding rubble and use a heavy mattock to pry them apart:Swing the pointed end into the crack between the two chunks and pry it apart.
Once the crack is wide enough, switch to the larger flat end and pry fully apart.
Pry up the opposite side of each chunk if they still won't budge.

, If you are looking for a broken water or drain line, and you can locate the general area you suspect the problem to be in, you can save a lot of work and expense. Here are some things to look for:


For plumbing problems, try to determine the location and depth of the underground pipes. Look for an outdoor faucet or sewer cap.
For water problems, look for areas where water is either bubbling up through cracks in the concrete, or seeping out around the edges of the slab.
For electrical lines, you may find you have to locate the conduit outside the slab area and dig up a length of it to determine where the rest of it runs.
For other types of repairs, or for installing new utilities that require excavating a ditch through an area paved with concrete, you may have to research construction plans to determine where to begin.

, You may wish to measure distances from the slab's edge to make an even, parallel hole for less visible repairs. Use a pencil or chalk to mark off the location.

, If you are digging toward a specific line or pipe, shut off the power or water before you begin. You don't want to risk electrocution or other dangers.


Always call the utility company to find out the location of power lines and other dangerous items before beginning projects that involve digging.

, Rent a cutoff or demolition saw for use on concrete. Cut the line evenly to create a clean edge when your work is complete. If you are searching for a broken water pipe,you may have to enlarge the hole after the initial break is done.


Be very cautious while sawing. These saws are powerful and can cause a fatal injury. Always wear a respirator or face mask to protect against dust and follow the instructions carefully. For any application where it is possible, use a wet cut saw and keep enough flow of water to prevent air born dust and damage to the saw blade.

, Use a heavy duty hammer drill or a breaking chisel attachment in a rotary hammer to chip the concrete next to the line you sawed.


Tilt the chisel so the side you will be removing cracks loose, not the side you're keeping.

, Using the same tool, work the area around the cut, penetrating deeper each time until you've reached the bottom of the slab. This is the hardest part of the job, since the pieces you break off cannot come free until there is a space for them to drop into.


You may need to leave tightly wedged pieces of concrete until the adjacent concrete is broken and removed.

, Once a gap has been created between the concrete you're removing and the concrete that's staying, chip further with the same tool to widen it to at least 3 inches (8 cm), or enough to fully remove the broken pieces.


Keep your chisel point slanted toward the beginning hole while you work around, so it doesn't try to penetrate straight down without breaking a section of concrete free. If it is allowed to go too deep, the bit will become lodged in its hole and will be difficult to remove.
If a bit is truly stuck, you may need to use a new drill bit to break the concrete around it and free it.

, Once there is a wide enough gap to avoid damaging the concrete you wish to keep, you can use the methods detailed for removing a whole slab.


Use a pry bar as you go for the quickest and most effective results.
Do not use a jackhammer or similar power tool if you are near a water pipe, electrical line, or similar item.
Remove the broken chunks and bits of concrete from the hole as it becomes larger, so subsequent pieces have plenty of room to drop in without becoming wedged. This will also make it easier to spot pipes and electrical wires.
Use bolt cutters to snip reinforcing mesh and an angle grinder to cut through rebar.

, Once all the concrete is removed, chip the vertical walls of the hole to make them smooth and even. This will ensure a stronger repair (or a more attractive edge if you don't plan on replacing the concrete).

, If you're trying to find a damage utility such as a water pipe, look for signs as you go to help you locate the pipe (such as water puddles or stains). Once you find the pipe, you may need to continue breaking concrete along its length to find the damaged section.


Avoid hitting cast iron or PVC pipes with the breaking hammer, as these are brittle and can easily sustain further damage.

, If you have a large hole in your yard, such as following a repair, use some of the rubble to fill it back again. Cover any pipes or other objects with soil first to avoid damaging them.

, Move the rubble to a larger disposal container using only a very heavy duty wheelbarrow. Concrete is very heavy and will break light wheelbarrows.


Do not overload the wheelbarrow. Taking more trips with smaller loads is much more sustainable.
Consider renting a power wheelbarrow., If you want to get rid of a large amount of concrete, this is your best bet. Many disposal companies have a reduced rate for disposing of clean broken concrete that can be recycled or used for rip rap.


Ask in advance how full you can load it, or you'll be forced to take the excess out or pay them to do so., Be careful — your truck will not carry as much concrete as you think. Use a powerful pickup truck and do not fill the entire bed.


You can also use a utility trailer for your truck, but be especially cautious loading in that case. A too-heavy trailer will smash into your truck or spill when you attempt to stop.
In some locations, only landfills that accept ""C&D"" (Construction and Demolition) materials will accept concrete, and the fees may be pricey.
Building supply companies may take your old concrete for free if you call them in advance and agree to deliver it yourself.

, Or reuse it to raise a flower bed, create a footpath, or even create urban grunge decoration.

Visit thrift stores.,
Shop online.,
Search online for less expensive replicas.,
Print out your own art.,
Repurpose items.",How to Fake Expensive Decor2," Thrift stores, charity shops, consignments, estate sales, and antique stores will often have old vintage items that are much cheaper than new. This is a great way to get inexpensive but quality items, such as wooden tables or embroidered chairs.


Old wooden furniture can always be repainted. If you find a piece that is chipped or faded, you can paint it to match your color palette.
You may find interesting and unusual décor in these stores. These will seem expensive because they are unique. For example, you might find a lunchbox from the 60s with old superheroes on it, or you might discover an antique milk pail that you can use for flowers.

, Websites like eBay, Craigslist, and Gumtree allow people to sell their old furniture and décor. Search through these sites to see if you can snag a deal. It may take a little while to find the perfect deal, but you may be able to score a truly expensive piece for very little money., If there is a more expensive piece that you have your eye on, you might be able to find a cheaper replica online. Search for words that are associated with the original piece.


For example, you might type, “cheap crystal chandelier” to see what pops up.

, If you can’t afford originals of art, you can buy prints from the internet. If the artwork is in the public domain, you can even print out your own copy at a print shop, and frame it yourself. This is a great way to get quality reproductions of famous art pieces in your own home without paying a fortune.


When sending the work to the print shop, make sure you send an HD copy so that you get the best image possible.
You can also tear out images from an old calendar and frame them. This is a great way to reuse an old calendar, and the images are all professional quality., You might find interesting pieces of décor that can be used for different purposes than intended. These pieces can be a focal point for your room if you choose. Transform your old furniture, or keep an eye out for things that can become tables, wall hangings, or accent pieces.You might:


Use an old luggage trunk as a coffee table
Hang antique dinner plates on the wallDrape an old quilt over a chair
Frame vintage fashion magazines
Make shelves out of old wooden planks

Repaint frames.",How to Fake Expensive Decor3," Floor-to-ceiling length bookshelves may seem expensive, but you can replicate the effect without purchasing high-end custom furniture. Measure your wall. Instead of building one giant bookcase, purchase four identical smaller bookcases that will fit in that space. Place two side by side for the base, and stack the other two on top. Be sure to bolt all four bookcases to the wall for stability., An easy way to add a customized twist to an old bookcase is to wallpaper the back of the shelves. Find a wallpaper that matches your theme or color scheme. Cut the wallpaper to size of the backing of each shelf. Paste it on using wallpaper paste. Let it dry before you put items back on the shelves.If you are using the bookcase to display decorative objects like vases or figurines, you might want to choose a solid color for the wallpaper, so that more attention is drawn to your collection.
If you are just using the shelves for books, you can choose a bold pattern, such as chevron stripes, polka dots, or a floral design. This will make the shelves an accent piece in their own right.

, Small ceramic tiles are great for decorating the backsplash of kitchens or bathrooms, but decorated tiles are expensive. Plain white ceramic tiles, on the other hand, can be cheap.With a little time and effort, you can turn tiles into something stunning and extravagant.


Find a stencil of a design you like, such as a fleur-de-lis or a bird. Press the stencil down on the tile, and paint over the design. Let the tile dry, and you have an easy, beautiful tile. You can then adhere it to the wall using tile mastic.
Good places for painted tile backsplashes include underneath cabinets or above a countertop. Do not paint the tiles on your floor or along your shower or bath. Too much water damage can ruin the paint., Fresh flowers are beautiful, but they can become costly. Instead, look for convincing fake flowers. Put together your own centerpiece, and arrange them in an inexpensive vase. You have an easy, reusable centerpiece.


Go for flowers that look as close to real as possible. You might even be able to find ones that also feel soft and natural. Your guests probably will not know the difference.
You can swap out flowers for each season and event, reusing the same flowers every year. Friends probably will not notice, but it will make it seem as though you are constantly updating your centerpiece.
Artificial flowers can easily become dusty. If so they do not look luxurious. Also, this can be problematic for allergy sufferers and asthmatics

, Vases are easy to find, and they can be relatively inexpensive. To help jazz up an empty vase, you can fill it with some small items. This will add a touch of character to your décor without costing a ton of money. Some things you can fill it with include:


Potpourri
Shells
Pieces of coral
Marbles
Buttons
Sticks
Wine corks, Nice picture frames can be expensive, but you can manage a high quality look without paying a lot of money. Find inexpensive picture frames at a dollar store, craft store, or thrift store. Paint the frames with a color or design that pleases you.Gold and silver paint are easy to find if you want a more distinguished shade.
You can add words as you like such as “Sisters” or “Friends Forever.” This will make it seem personalized.
Painting designs on your frames gives them a unique look. You can paint stripes, dots, or other easy geometric shapes.

Make sure to study the content that will be on the test sufficiently before registering for the test.Questions on the NHIE cover safety topics including, roof drainage, exterior doors and windows, driveways, landscaping, balconies, support structures, wiring and electrical, and plumbing.
The test is four hours long and has around 200 questions.

, The NHIE is required if you want to practice in 29 states including places like California, New York, Florida, and Texas. Register for the exam by visiting homeinspectionexam.org.Remember to check if this license is required in your state before paying for it.
In most states the exam costs $225.
Even if passing the exam is not required in your state you should take it anyway, as passing the test is a good indicator of whether you're ready to be a home inspector.

, Once you've registered for the exam online, you'll likely be given a physical location and date that you'll have to take the test. Make sure to get plenty of rest the night before the test and study leading up to it.


If you fail your initial exam, you can retake the exam in 30 days if you pay another fee.

, Look on search engines and job boards for home inspecting job opportunities. Once you have the required certification and education, and have shadowed another home inspector, apply for the job. Companies are looking for clean-cut, organized, and dependable people. Follow the guidelines for a good interview and be sure to communicate effectively and show up on time.


You can also use any available networking connections and ask around to see which companies are looking for new employees.
When on the interview remember to emphasize your construction, regulation, and inspection knowledge.
A drawback from working for a firm is that they will typically take a 40-60% cut of your inspection fee., If you don't want to work at a firm and already have some experience under your belt, you can start your own business. Home inspection businesses don't have a lot of need for human capital if you're the only one that will inspect the homes. To start your own home inspection company, you'll need a reliable vehicle, a computer and a minimum of $25,000 in working capital for overhead items.


Consider incorporating your business to protect yourself from bankruptcy if your company fails.
A large initial cost that you'll have to invest in is business insurance.
Other potential costs include marketing and advertising, tools, association dues, and office space.

, A home inspection franchise will give you the initial tools and contacts that are required to land clients and start making money. Marketing and advertising is also usually covered in the form of logos and other promotional materials. Also, they will have methods that have been proven to be profitable in the past, as well as additional support if you're unsure what to do as a business owner. While the cost of a franchise can sometimes be costly, it may be worth the cost if you have limited experience.


Initial costs, including an initial franchise fee, can cost anywhere up to $40,000 and more.Remember to read the Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) before purchasing any franchise.
Popular home inspection franchises that you can purchase include Ameri-Spec Inspection Services, Home Team, WIN, and A Pro.

, A home inspectors group will provide you a wealth of knowledge in the form of distance education and classroom training. The top organizations for home inspectors in the U.S. include the NAHI (The National Association of Home Inspectors) and the ASHI (The American Society of Home Inspectors). Both of these organizations have a significant number of members who work professionally as home inspectors. In addition to the education, you'll also be able to attend chapter meetings and workshops to talk about inspection and regulation., Some states require you dedicate hours towards an apprenticeship before you can become a certified home inspector. Even if your state doesn't require this, shadowing and working under a seasoned home inspector will give you insight and skills on how you should inspect homes. If you're part of a home inspector association, talk to veteran inspectors and ask if you can be an apprentice under them. If you aren't in an organization contact different firms and see if there is anyone available to take you under their wing.Being an apprentice will also give you hands-on training.
You can ask by saying something like, ""I really respect the great work you do and all your experience. I'm looking for someone who could guide me and show me the ropes. Do you think I could work with you for a little bit?""

, Look for regional meetings and seminars that you can attend to stay current and accurate. Many chapters of home inspection organizations will often put on educational events and workshops for existing inspectors.Also, you can use the time around your peers to network with other inspectors.


Follow up with people that you meet at educational workshops and training by calling them on the phone or shooting them an email.
In some states, like Oregon, you have to complete some continuing education classes to keep your home inspection license up to date."

Safety first!,
Have the right tools for the job.,
Educate yourself.,
Be open to new approaches.,
Allow enough time.,
Have a good work ethic.,
Clean up.,
Celebrate when it's over!",How to Be a Handyman," You want to be a handyman, not a dead man. Consider, for example, that many of the warnings that appear in manuals, on labels or on tools are rooted in someone else's misfortune or stupidity. Be sure to read and heed them. Putting safety first is your first step in doing the job right and presenting a professional image - even if it's just to yourself. ""Safety first"" will mean different things in different situations, but some basic rules apply to nearly every job. For example, a well-lit workspace is fundamental. It will help you see otherwise hidden or obscure dangers. You're also not likely to do well a job that you can't see well.;
, The first tools you need are those that make the job safe, such as a face-mask or respirator when working with insulation or toxic dust. Using the wrong tool (e.g., a shaky chair instead of a stable ladder) or using a tool improperly invites injury to yourself and can compromise the quality of the job you're doing. Get the right tools and use them the right way. Never buy a tool you don't need, but always buy (or rent or borrow) the tool required by the job. This makes for a simple solution to the question ""What tools should I have?"" It's the tools that you need to do the job safely and correctly.

, Learn all you can before starting a job. Go on-line (see below for helpful links). Go to the library. Read the instructions/the manual. Find people who have done that type of job and ask what they did right and what they would do differently if they knew then what they know now. Check with your local government's building permits office re any needed permits or other requirements. Just as ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"", an hour of education is worth a day of doing it over.

, Never assume that you know the best way to do anything: arrogant people are closed to learning. Be open to ideas and insights from any source - including a spouse, a child, and a customer once you get to that point. The less experienced they are, the more likely it is that you'll hear something you would never have considered.

, The time you think the job will take is likely based more on your fond hopes than unforgiving reality. Jobs often involve complications that appear only once you're underway. On those rare and splendid occasions when the job goes faster than planned, you won't think that you misjudged - you'll be too absorbed in contemplating your genius. Having planned enough time, be sure to take it. Carpenters say, e.g., to ""measure twice and cut once."" What that really means is take the time to carefully measure.

, A job worth doing is worth doing well. It's also a requirement, as with the electrical code mandate that all work be done ""in a workmanlike manner."" Your name is going to be on that job, literally or figuratively, so make a good name for yourself. A good work ethic applies to every aspect and every stage of a job, and it always appears in the final results. For example, when hanging a framed picture on the middle of a wall, don't ""gaze and guess"" at the center point of the wall -- use a tape measure and pencil to mark it. If you're replacing a light switch, use a level to align the switch when tightening the screws so as to avoid a lopsided look once the cover plate is attached.

, The job's not over until the dirt is swept up, the tools cleaned and put away, and the trash removed. This is a hallmark of a real pro. Plan ahead to ease that clean-up by, e.g., using drop-cloths, clearing the work area of objects that may get dirty, sealing-off the work area to prevent dust from spreading, or using fans to ventilate airborne dust out the window.

, You've done your best and your best deserves a pat on the back, even if it's from your own arm twisted over your shoulder. Was the job absolutely perfect? That's rarely the case. The point is, you did what amounts to a hand-made job, and hand-made is bound to have slight imperfections. So don't obsess or slam yourself for what may be apparent only to yourself. Also, ""celebrate when it's over"" implies not celebrating (with intoxicants) while you're working, which brings us back to the opening and most important point: Safety First!

Accumulate work experience in residential construction.,
Consider pursuing formal education.,
Incorporate your home improvement business.,
Obtain your builder's license if required.,
Obtain your first few clients.,
Build your home improvement business gradually.",How to Become a Home Improvement Contractor," As a home improvement contractor, you'll be expected to handle every aspect of a homeowner's renovation project. The best preparation for this expectation is to accumulate experience working in construction. Options include working as a carpenter for a large general contractor and working as an assistant to an established home improvement contractor. Aim to earn at least 5 years of relevant work experience before trying to start your own business.;
, Educational programs in construction are varied and widely available. Completing a certificate or degree program in a field related to residential construction will improve your credentials, give you additional experience, and help you network with other people in the field. Anything from a technical diploma or certificate in a building trade to a bachelor's degree in construction management will prove useful.


When enrolled in classes, consider taking courses in business administration as well. Classes in accounting, marketing, finance, and entrepreneurship will vastly improve your understanding of what it takes to make a business thrive.

, Formally creating a business is a fairly straightforward process, usually involving filing articles of incorporation with your state and paying a fee. The limited liability company, or LLC, is an ideal structure for small businesses like home improvement contracting. This structure protects your personal assets as well as providing a favorable tax impact.

, Many jurisdictions require home improvement contractors to obtain and regularly renew builder's licenses. This license can be obtained through the licensing board of your state (or sometimes your city, county, or other jurisdiction). Obtaining this license often requires completion of an exam on construction and business law.

, Marketing your fledgling home improvement business to those first few clients can be a challenging endeavor. Take steps to make your business known in the local area, such as taking out ads in newspapers and phone books. Consider mailing coupons or flyers to some past clients you may have worked with in a prior construction job. Once you have obtained your first few customers, encourage them to recommend you to friends (offering a discount might be a worthwhile enticement) and write reviews on websites such as Yelp.

, Maintaining a base of loyal customers will become easier with time if you perform quality work. Growing your business may mean hiring additional laborers, implementing new accounting or project management software, and building relationships with subcontractors.

Research your project on the internet and in the library and bookstore.,
Before starting any large project, call the local building department and talk with an inspector.,
Draw your project to scale on ¼-in.,
Keep the construction details as simple as possible to avoid mistakes and unanticipated problems.,
Buy or rent all the tools you need – it’s counterproductive to attempt a major project with second-rate equipment.,
Get all the materials you need before starting your job to avoid time-wasting trips to the home center - and arrange for deliveries when possible.,
Find sources for good advice at the local hardware store or lumberyard.,
Investigate local lumberyards and suppliers that cater to contractors.,
Make a list of everything you're doing and work out the sequence of steps.,
If you have to remove the only toilet in your house to re-tile, plan your work so you can reinstall it temporarily at the end of each day – all you need is a fresh wax ring and a few shims.,
If possible, break your job down into small sections and finish each one before moving on.,
If you’re following a guide or how-to book, detailed how-to instructions may not be completely clear on the first or second reading, but they'll start to make sense when you get more involved in the job.

,
There are two parts to every job – the satisfying rough work when you knock walls down or nail up big 4 x 8 sheets, and the sometimes frustrating finish work where you may spend hours on a few square inches.,
Buy extra materials and make practice cuts first when you do finish work.",How to Succeed at Any Home Improvement Project," How-to magazines maintain easily searchable archives of years of past articles. Manufacturers’ web sites are also a gold mine of information, with pages of advice and troubleshooting and downloadable installation and repair manuals. Most companies also have 800 numbers for product questions. Find several sources of information for your project. Look closely at how-to photos and illustrations for useful information not made clear in the text.;
, Most provide handouts on code requirements for common projects and are happy to answer questions. For large projects you will need to pull a permit and have your work inspected, but it’s money well spent to have experts check over your work. Homeowners are generally allowed to do any kind of work on their house (if it's residential property) as long as you submit a clear set of plans and have the work inspected. Also, if you’re digging holes, call the local utility company and have them scan for buried utility lines (a free service).

, graph paper. This helps with the design process, clarifies the construction details and makes it easier to compile a list of materials. It's also usually required for a permit. Draw a side view, a top view and a front view. Use a ¼-in. (one square) = 1-ft. scale, with larger details as needed for clarity. Use a standard ruler with 1/16-in. markings to draw the lines and be as accurate as possible, identifying each part. Making a scaled plan organizes your thinking and saves major mistakes during construction.

, Projects in how-to magazines and books illustrate standard, code-approved construction practices that can be adapted to fit a variety of situations. Organize your projects around basic building code requirements and intended function and the design will fall into place.

, Good tools – compound miter saws, pneumatic nailers are two perfect examples – save hours of frustration and make jobs look better with a lot less effort. The basic hand tools that you need are: 25-ft. tape measure, hammer, 4-in-1 screwdriver, adjustable wrench and large channel-lock pliers, razor knife, square, 4-ft. level, wire-stripping pliers, pry bar, caulk gun and wire tester. Basic power tools are: drill, circular saw, jigsaw, miter saw, power sander, sawzall, 12-gauge extension cords and, if possible, a compressor and a few nail guns. The total cost for a set of good-quality hand and power tools is around $2,000, but with that investment you can do almost anything.

, If you’re working from a how-to article, the material list will show everything you need. Otherwise, make a list of materials based on your plan. Special order items like windows and doors can take several weeks to get and are usually non-returnable, so triple check measurements.

, The quality of advice from clerks working the aisles at big home centers can be uneven, and for a major project you need people who really know what they're talking about. Ask the more experienced people working at the contractor’s desk for advice. Hardware and paint stores also usually have a few really knowledgeable people. Catch them on a slow day (not Saturday morning) then ask them about your project and let them talk.

, They’re staffed with experienced people who can answer questions and give advice on complicated technical issues, and although the prices might be slightly higher, product choices and service are usually better because they specialize in one area, they're used to dealing with large jobs, and they’re set up to make contractors’ lives easy and profitable. Most are happy to sell to the general public (call first to be sure). A full-service lumberyard can quickly translate your plans into a complete materials and price list, size load-bearing beams, calculate material quantities for you, set up deliveries by phone and even pick up returns.

, This will help you remember, for instance, that rough wiring and plumbing come before insulation and that natural woodwork should be stained before installation but not nailed up until after the walls are painted.

, If you’re building an addition, frame it and close it in before you knock out any existing exterior walls. Staging work in the right sequence is a major part of a contractor’s job, but mostly it just requires common sense.

, This will keep a large job from feeling overwhelming. A good trick to keep the momentum going is to accomplish at least one task on the job every day, even if it’s just putting a few screws in.

,, Finish work can be more mentally and emotionally demanding, but avoid cutting corners - one bad-looking miter joint can make a whole job look shabby.

, Be aware that some materials should be cut from the top to reduce splintering and checking, while others should be cut from the bottom. How-to websites will tell you which is which, and recommend what tool(s) to use and how to proceed. Corners, for example, are almost never exactly 45 degrees. Make initial cuts slightly long, then check the fit and trim it. Get tips from a “finish carpentry” search at how-to magazine web sites. Measure everything twice, and check your tape measure to make sure the hooked metal end isn’t bent or jammed – either of which might cause all your cuts to be 1/16-in. off.

Add shrubs and plants and keep your grass well groomed.If you don't have enough of a front yard, or any yard at all, then add plant pots with plenty of flowering shrubs.
Make sure that your front doorway, lighting, and any other features are all in good condition.;
, In the summer months a landscaped yard is an extra space to spend time in. Groom your yard; add some native trees, if you have the room, and some flowering shrubs.You don't have to spend too much money. Just bring your yard up to the standards of the neighborhood and show off its potential.To get the most bang for your buck, try to make sure you grass is in good condition – with no obvious dry/dead patches. And add some shrubs or flowers in the front where they will be the most visible.

, Even if you have a large yard, a deck is appealing and improves the value of a home. If you don't have a yard, then a deck offers a space to enjoy the outdoors.


Try to make sure that the deck addition matches the rest of the existing house for added value and aesthetic appeal., Cleaning the outside of your home will make it look much nicer and will add value to your home. One option for cleaning home exteriors is to use a pressure washer which sprays water at an incredibly high velocity and works well to clean exterior surfaces.


Another option for cleaning the outside of your home is to use a hand-pump garden sprayer filled with a mixture of water and oxygen bleach (not chlorine bleach). Simply spray it on, let it soak for ten minutes, and then rinse it off with water from the garden hose. Some people prefer this method over power washing because the high intensity water spray from the pressure washer can get in cracks where it doesn’t belong, can kill plants and other landscaping, and can erode wood and siding over time.To deep clean the interior of your home, make sure you focus on things like dusting the baseboards and ceiling fans, changing the air filters, scrubbing the grout in your showers, and cleaning out the fireplace if you have one.

, Not only should your kitchen have new quality wooden cabinets, countertops and flooring, but it should be spacious and have lots of convenient storage space.Opt for a high-end stone counter if your budget allows, but make sure that the materials you use are comparable for the type of home you have.
Many buyers want all stainless steel appliances, gas top stove, and a refrigerator with the ice and water functions in the door. These are the most important appliance updates to make if you are able to afford it.
Include as many amenities as your space will allow, such as a breakfast bar and the latest appliances.

, This is especially important for the ""en suite,"" if you have one. Like kitchens, bathrooms are often a big selling point. Even the smallest upgrade can count for big points with potential buyers.Consider adding a whirlpool or spa tub in your master suite bathroom.
Additionally, double sinks, separate multiple jet showers and a separate toilet room are all value adding features.
Update your water pipes if necessary, but remember that this won’t add much value to your home since buyers expect that things like this will be in working condition., Adding new or updating the old light fixtures in your home can add a great deal of value. Most new homebuyers want houses that feel bright and sunny, so having adequate indoor lighting is valuable.Adding recessed lighting in the kitchen is especially helpful in increasing the value of your home.

, Simply adding a fresh coat of paint can liven up any room. Make sure you carefully paint the edges and trim if you do the painting yourself. A poor paint job will probably look worse than the existing paint.Try to pick neutral colors that most potential buyers will find attractive so that you don’t have to paint over it if you ever decide to sell your house.

, If you have hardwood flooring, take full advantage of it. Real hardwood flooring can increase your home’s value substantially, especially if you have it throughout your home.New carpeting or high quality laminate flooring are also options. Opt for natural colors and materials that go with everything.
Finish the flooring (whether it is carpet, laminate, or hardwood) so that it is in prime condition and add throw rugs for a little color and warmth if it gets cold in the winter.

, Open up some rooms so that you have more of an open plan space. Create a spacious feel to your home by knocking down a few walls. Discuss your options with an accredited contractor before making any drastic decisions.Make sure that you take into account which walls secure the foundation before making plans, and work around it. You can add an attractive pillar if it's secure enough and fits the character of your home.

, If you have an unfinished basement, consider finishing it and creating an extra room. This will always add value to a home, so the investment will be worth it. You can even keep it simple by just finishing the walls and carpeting the floor.Adding livable floor space to your home will almost always add value to the home.

, If you have an attic with useable space, you should maximize its potential and utilize the space whenever possible. Work around any existing ducts and machinery to maximize the area you can use for this project.This might include finishing an unfinished attic (adding sheetrock and flooring) so that it creates an entirely new room in your home.
Or you may just want to add insulation and partial flooring to your existing attic space so that it adds a separate storage option in your home.

If you are just starting out, you may want to acquire tools slowly, as you need them. You'll spread out the expense and keep the clutter under control if you do.;
, A workshop is ideal, but even a good sized shelf in a utility closet will do. You will also need a work surface, such as a table or workbench, on which to perform repairs.

, The scope of the material should depend on your willingness to tackle various jobs and the kinds of jobs you wish to perform first. Start with a general guide. Then, as you need them, look up or purchase guides covering appliances, door hardware, plumbing, electrical, air conditioning, flooring, painting, exterior trim, roofing, and other specific topics.


Try your local library, especially for projects that you may only have to address once or twice in the course of your home repairs.

, You can attend a two to four hour class and learn the basics for installing various products, such as ceramic tile or light fixtures. These classes are usually taught on basic levels, and give detailed lists of supplies and tools required for each one.


Your local trade school, community college, or adult education program may also have home repair classes. Look around and see what you find.

, If you hire someone to tackle a repair job that you think is too much for you, watch how they do it, providing they don't object. If you are helpful and pass a tool to them, or hold something while they work on it, they may be inclined to share a little of their knowledge and tips with you. Take care not to get in their way; you may run up the bill if they are paid by the hour.

, If you need help with something, often you will find someone with experience, and learning from their experience will make your job easier and reduce the potential for mistakes.

, A great price on a ladder or saw is no bargain if the tool fails, and can even be dangerous. Great close-out stores are everywhere, and often they offer professional grade tools at a fraction of their usual price, but make sure what you're getting is suitable.


Are you buying a tool or part that needs to perform well and last a long time? If so, consider it an investment and be willing to pay for quality up front.
Remember that you can also save money by using something for a long time, installing it correctly for yourself, and by not buying things you don't really need.
Price does not always mean quality. A $20 faucet may serve perfectly well if you don't mind a basic appearance. A $300 faucet probably includes a markup for a brand name and designer styling. Product reviews and ratings can help you determine what's worth paying extra.

, A screwdriver or wrench may seem innocent enough, but even these harmless looking items have led to trips to the Emergency Room when used carelessly.

, Do not plug a three-pronged (grounded) tool into a non-grounded receptacle with an adapter. The ground wire in the circuit is there for a reason, and a dangerous situation can occur if you do this.

, If you change out a plumbing or electrical fixture this week, chances are you will be doing maintenance on it again someday. Remembering the mistakes you make the first time will help avoid them in the future, and knowing where you purchased an item, and when, may help you with warranty issues or finding parts for future repairs.


Keep a file folder just for warranties and product manuals.
Take digital photos. While you have the wall cut open or the trench dug, take photos of your project. They will help you remember later how things went together, where pipes, wires, or other hidden items went, and so on.

Keep a notebook where you record your home repairs, and date your entries.

, Do not assume that an unplugged appliance is harmless. Some have electric motors equipped with start and run capacitors that can hold a charge long after the cord is pulled. Old televisions were serious hazards at one time, since they contained high voltage high discharge capacitors that would hold a dangerous electrical charge indefinitely, even after being disassembled or ending up in a landfill.

, If you turn the water off to the hot water heater, turn off the power supply or gas to it also, to protect it from overheating.

,]]Watch around the house for problems before they occur. Good maintenance can prevent many home repairs. Routine maintenance can include lubricating door locks and hinges, cleaning drain lines in the bathroom and kitchen sink, vacuuming the refrigerator coils and air conditioning coils, fixing plumbing leaks as soon as you find them, and watching for loose or broken shingles.


Broken shingles are a good example of preventive maintenance. They can be repaired or replaced easily and simply, but once water gets under them, roof decking can begin to rot, attic insulation becomes wet and moldy, and ceilings can be stained or damaged.

, Hopefully most car owners change their oil, oil filter, air filter, and spark plugs, but many people don't realize their air conditioning system and furnace have electric motors that need occasional lubrication, or that the hot water heater should be drained and deposits flushed out every few years. Simple maintenance, which the average homeowner can learn to do, will prevent the need to do major, and expensive, home repairs later.

, Often, you may buy a six inch piece of PVC pipe to repair a leak, when you can buy a ten foot piece for much less priced per foot. If you can store it conveniently, it will last for years and possibly save you a trip to the hardware store if you have another plumbing problem later. Glue, caulk, paint, and other solvent-based products have a short shelf life, and can be hazardous to store in your home, so buy only the amount you need of a single task.

, Having a dozen spare fuses will do you no good if you cannot find them when the lights go out.

, If you have doubts your repair is going to work, or have spent an afternoon trying to get it just right, and can't seem to do it, swallow your pride, and get help. Everyone bites off more than they can chew from time to time.

, Having the water or electricity off for hours while you look for the right part will not make you popular with the other residents in your home.

, Even though they are only there to sell the item you need, many are a wealth of information on replacing, installing, fitting, or finishing the products they sell, and sometimes they will even loan a tool for a particular job.

, If you find buying parts to repair a coffee maker or toaster is more than the price of a new one, don't make that mistake again. Televisions are notorious for excessive repair costs, compared to purchasing a new one.

, If you have a place to store it, often something you have replaced will have usable parts for the next project. An example would be a power supply cord. If you burn up a saw, you may use the cord from it on another power tool later on.

, If you are going to buy parts for home repair projects, you will have better luck if you know the correct name. Reading articles about the type of repair you are doing, or looking at repair manuals will help. Asking your brother-in-law who is all thumbs, and being told it is a ""whatchamacallit"" usually will not.


If you're still lost, try taking in a part that you want to replace or a photo of the part.

, Think of failures or mishaps as part of the tuition to the school of home repair. Remember, even master plumbers have leaks or crossed threads on pipes and fittings.

, The meter is often held in position by one of several methods:


A thin metal ring with a slot and tab. The ring has a shoulder along both sides of its length that engages the a lip on the edge of the meter and the rim of the meter socket or enclosure; and holds the meter securely into the socket. Once the ring's tab has been passed through the slot, a seal is placed on it to indicate tampering.
A thick metal ring with a special locked enclosure around the retaining hardware, that prevents unauthorized persons from removing the ring and meter.
The meter enclosure cover itself; which holds the lip of the meter and holds it in place in the meter enclosure. The cover will employ a simple seal or special locked enclosure over the retaining hardware that allows for the opening of the cover (and meter removal) similar to the previous two examples.
Some other arrangement specific to the requirements of the local power company in your area. These types can not be covered by this wiki at this time.

, Those meters secured with a simple seal - whether through a slot & tab on a thin metal ring around the meter or on the meter enclosure cover itself - will be the type that will allow removal of the meter. Those meters secured with thick rings / special locked enclosures, etc. will not be able to be removed without causing severe damage to the meter or enclosure and significant risk of shock, burns, fire or electrocution. This wiki is unable provide instructions to bypass this type of security hardware. The only safe remedy is to contact the local utility for removal.

, If the meter is secured with a simple seal and you have determined that you can remove it, notify the utility. This is often done by a phone call to their customer service department. You may be asked why you need to remove the meter, how long it is expected to be removed, etc. If you determine that you are unable to remove the meter, you can schedule to have an authorized employee to do this for you at this time.

, This will remove the load on the meter and will prevent destructive arcing and burning as the meter is withdrawn from the meter enclosure and when reinstalled, later. Note: switching circuit breakers to off and removing of fuses from the electrical panel will not remove power from the meter or enclosure.


Switch ALL branch circuit breakers (typically all single and double pole types from 15 amps ~ 60 amps) handles to OFF, then locate the Service Disconnect Switch (the largest value circuit breaker) in the electrical panel; and move the handle to OFF, too.
Remove fuses. Unscrew all fuses 2-3 full turns or more. Pull cartridge type fuses out completely and note the location of each for proper re-installation later.

, The meter should not be spinning, running or advancing at this point. If it is, there is still a panel connected somewhere. Check garages, out buildings, etc. and remove the load as described above. Ideally, the load should be fully disconnected before continuing. Keep in mind: Even though the meter isn't advancing because load has been shed; it does not mean the power is off! There is still electricity being provided by the utility, through the meter and into the electric panel - waiting to be used.

, Use of a simple pair of wire cutters should be able to cut through the seal for removal. Watch out for sharp edges while removing the seal.

, Do not stand on earth, concrete, vegetation, asphalt, etc. as these will conduct electricity.

, Lift the slot off the tab and spread the ring to remove it completely. The cover type will lift up or have screws to remove. If a lift type, push the meter upward slightly to allow the cover to clear the meter as it swings up. Be aware that behind the cover lies energized parts. Do not put your fingers where you cannot see them or behind the cover while removing it.

, Do not use pressure near the base, nor reach behind the meter or into the enclosure - a steady up / down rocking while pulling will allow the meter to become free.

, Since the meter is owned by the utility, you are liable for its loss. The meter enclosure should not be left unattended without first securing a reliable ""dead front"" to prevent accidental contact with live parts by people or other accidental conductors.

, This is performed in the reverse order - except that the meter must be checked to be sure it is oriented right-side up; have its contact blades properly aligned with the enclosure's contact jaws and have steady pressure applied to its front while ""rocking"" in.

Test your line.",How to Install a Residential Telephone Jack," Keep in mind that you’ll be running phone wires from the old phone jack to the new spot you choose.


Assess your room and think about the best path for the phone wires. If you need a new phone jack on the opposite side of the room from your existing jack, will it be possible to run the wires along your baseboards? You’ll want to keep your wires neat, so have a plan in mind when you make your choice.
If you want to install a new wall mounted phone, it’s best to choose a spot a few feet above your existing phone jack. This way, you won’t have to run unsightly wires across your room.;
, Measure the distance from the old jack to the spot where the new one will be installed. Include the entire path that the telephone wire will travel: the distance from the old jack to the baseboard, around the perimeter of the room, and from the baseboard to the new jack’s location. Go to the hardware store and purchase the amount of wire you will need. If your new jack is going to be located several feet from the old one, you should also buy fasteners that are made for keeping the wire in place along walls and baseboards.

, Baseboard jacks or wall jacks that house the phone wires in a small box, rather than inside the wall, are the easiest phone jacks to install when you’re looking for a jack for a new location. These types of jacks are simply affixed to your baseboard or wall, with minimal drilling required.

, After you’ve gone outside to your NID and disconnected your phone line in preparation for your task, it’s time to begin the installation of your new jack. Some jacks come with adhesive backing and simple mounting instructions. Others may need to be screwed into the wall. Depending on the type of wall you have, this may be accomplished either with a screwdriver and a bit of muscle or with a small drill.


Ensure that your jack is not installed at a crooked angle by using a level to help you line up the jack with your floor or baseboard. Make small pencil marks in the places where you’ll be screwing or drilling holes.

, Open the casing, or unscrew the plating, on the old jack. Loosen the screws that secure the red, green, yellow and black telephone wires. As necessary, trim damage from the old wires and strip the insulation from the tips. Strip the insulation from the tips of the new wires, too. Twist the tips of the new wires with the tips of the old wires according to color: red to red, green to green, yellow to yellow, and black to black. Replace the twisted portions of the wires under the screws in the jack, and tighten the screws. Thread the new wire through the hole in the phone jack casing, and screw the casing back to the wall.









If the hole in the phone jack casing is too small, or if it’s difficult to thread the wires through, it may be necessary to drill or cut a larger hole for this step.

, Using the path you mapped out in your original plan, run the new wire to the new jack. If you are running the wire along baseboards or up walls, use the fasteners you bought at the hardware store to secure it neatly in place.

, After you’ve run the wire from the old jack to the new jack, trim the excess wire so that you have a manageable coil. Strip the insulation from the tips of the four wires. Loosen the screws on the back of the new jack, and affix the red, green, yellow, and black wires in their correct color-coded places. Tighten the screws.








, If you’re using an external jack, there will be space inside the jack to coil the remaining wire. Place the cover on the jack and screw it on.








, Return to the NID box and reconnect your phone line. Go back inside and test it by plugging in your phone or DSL cable. If you have a dial tone and your internet works, your task is complete.








, Most phone jacks cost about $3.00 to $5.00 and are available at hardware stores. Find a jack that best fits your needs, whether it’s a simple flush plate, a wall mount jack, or a baseboard jack. Jacks come in several different shapes and colors, and you’ll probably want to choose one that blends in well with your room’s décor.
If you’re replacing an old jack that needs repairing, the simplest choice is a new jack with the same size and shape as the old one. For example, if your old jack is a standard rectangular wall plate, it will be easiest to install a new jack that looks very similar. This way you won’t have to drill a new hole in your wall to accommodate a new jack size.






If you plan to attach your telephone to the wall, make sure you buy a wall mount jack, rather than a flush jack. A wall mount jack juts out from the wall, providing a structure on which to mount your telephone. A flush jack lies flat against the wall, allowing you to plug in your phone, but not mount it.






Baseboard jacks are small plastic or metal boxes that are affixed to your baseboard, with the jack opening on the bottom edge of the box. If you’re concerned about aesthetics, this may be a more discreet option than a wall plate.






If you’re planning on using the jack for both a DSL internet connection and a phone line, choose a jack with two openings, often called a duplex jack, so that you can run two separate lines.







, The NID is a device installed by the phone company that connects your home’s electrical wiring to your telephone network. It’s a gray box that is usually mounted on the outside of your house. When you’re ready to install your new jack, it’s important to disconnect your phone line so you aren’t working with a live wire. The electrical current that runs through phone lines is not strong, but it could still give you a small shock if you aren’t careful.


The NID has two sides: one for the phone company, and one for customers. Open the side that’s intended for customers (the phone company’s side is usually locked) and unplug the test jack. Now your phone line is disconnected from the outside network.
If you’re working with an older interface box without a test jack, disconnect your phone line by detaching the wires, making sure to remember which wire goes where so you’ll be able to reattach them when your job is complete.

, Use a screwdriver to unscrew the old jack, whether it’s a wall mount or a flush jack. Carefully pull the casing away from the wall, and you will find that the jack is attached to your home’s wiring with wires of four different colors: red, green, yellow, and black. Each wire is secured behind a screw. Use a screwdriver to loosen the screws, unsecure the four wires from behind them, and pull the old jack from the wall.


If your jack is the type that is a rectangular box attached to a plate on the wall with notches, use a flathead screwdriver to pop off the top part of the case, and proceed to loosen the screws and remove the wires. Unscrew the plating and remove this from the wall as well.

, If you’re replacing a jack that has been around for a long time, the four wires might need to be trimmed and stripped before you attach them to the new jack. If the exposed parts of the wires look old or brittle, use a wire cutter to trim off the damaged portions, no more than about ½” to ¾” (1.25 to 2 cm). Now use the wire cutter or a utility knife to gently strip the insulation from the tips of the wires so they may be connected to the new jack.

, Turn the new jack over and loosen the four screws on the back. Connect each wire to the correct section of the jack, marked by color; there will be a spot for the red, green, yellow, and black wires. Secure the wires by tightening each screw.

, Push the wires into the wall and position the jack over the hole. Line the jack’s screw holes with the holes made by the old jack. Place the new screws in the screw holes and use a screwdriver to secure the new jack to the wall. Depending on the type of jack you have, you may have a cover case that should be secured onto the wall piece to complete the process.


Some types of jacks come with adhesive backing in addition to screws. You may use this to secure the jack to the wall, but it isn’t strictly necessary.

, Return to the NID on the outside of your house. Open the box and plug the test jack back in. If your NID doesn’t have a test plug, reconnect the wires you previously disconnected, making sure to screw them in securely.

, Plug your telephone or DSL cable into your newly installed jack. Your phone should have a dial tone, and your internet connection should work now (as long as your computer is correctly set up for a DSL connection.


If the phone line does not seem to be working, you may need to unscrew the new jack and make sure the wires are connected to the proper places and correctly screwed in. If further electrical work is required, make sure to go back to the NID and disconnect the phone line again before manipulating the wires.

Increase your closet space.,
Set up a modest study.,
Add onto the room.,
Create a tasteful art display.,
Make room for your appliances.",How to Create Storage Around Staircases2," Most newer homes are designed to include some kind of coat closet beneath the main staircase. If your home is lacking this feature, it may be just what you need to reduce clutter and maximize your storage potential. These types of closets don’t even have to be very big—with just a few square feet, you’ll have more than enough room to stow a card table, backup toiletries or some unwieldy cleaning supplies.Use extra closet space to supplement your wardrobe or keep accessories like shoes, hats, belts and ties organized.
If you like to cook, closets near the kitchen can function as storerooms for dry ingredients and utensils., Make the most of a deep recess or the area under a flight of floating stairs by moving in a desk and a few other compact pieces for a basic home office setup. This will give you an out-of-the-way place to pay bills, read over work-related documents or do homework. Don’t forget to include a lamp, desktop organizer and a charging station for your laptop or phone.Lay out a futon and some pillows to create a cozy reading nook.Hang a memo board, calendar or set of filing trays on the walls of an alcove.

, You can usually extend a given room by three to four feet by opening up the area below a staircase. That’s enough territory to set up a drafting table or put in a mini bar. By using every available inch of the room, you’ll be able to free up useful storage space elsewhere.Transform a few extra feet of floor space into a pet area, complete with beds, toys and food and water dishes.
A vanity mirror and narrow countertop can serve as a quaint powder room., Even if you can’t cram in a whole lot, you can still reinvent a small space to enhance the look of your home.

Mount elevating wall racks.",How to Create Storage Around Staircases3," Some staircases are plagued by too much awkward negative space. Turn a negative into a positive by filling these spaces with freestanding cabinets, trunks or cubbies that can house clutter. Every corner presents a possibility.Tall, vertical cabinets can be just the right size to position around cramped stairways.Go shopping for attractive storage containers that suit your home’s design sensibilities.

, Place a bench at the top or foot of the stairs to give weary house guests somewhere to sit. Reserve enough room beneath the bench to slide in a few separate containers for boots, jackets, scarves and other items that people tend to discard when they first come in. Alternatively, you could accompany smaller seats with end tables that provide a place to lay wallets, keys, papers and other paraphernalia.Look for settees, ottomans and similar pieces that double as storage compartments.
Combining your seating and storage will also help you keep up with everyone’s individual belongings.

, There’s no need to make extensive renovations to your home in order to seize on smart storage opportunities. Footwear can be tucked away in a minimalistic shoe rack or cubby right in the foyer, where they’ll remain neat and orderly rather than accumulating in the living room or muddying up the kitchen.Establish a new house rule that dirty shoes must be removed and put away upon entry.
If you have pets, put the rack above floor level to keep shoes out of reach.

, Imagine waking up in the morning and having your coat, purse, umbrella and car keys all held out to you on your way down the stairs. You can make it a reality by putting up a series of hooks and hangers at various heights on the wall alongside the main staircase. Mounted racks are inexpensive, unobtrusive and allow you to keep all your most frequently reached-for items together in plain sight.Hang a separate rack for each member of the household so that everyone has a place to put their things.

Notice if you smell gas.,
Use a carbon monoxide or gas detector.,
Spray liquid gas detector or soapy water on a pipe or appliance.,
Check your gas appliances.,
Verify that pilot lights on your appliances are burning strong.,
Look for soot or scorch marks.,
Ventilate the area.,
Discontinue use of appliances and electrical devices.,
Leave the building.,
Call a professional.",How to Tell if You Have Fixed a Gas Leak," The smell of gas is one of the best indications that you haven’t successfully fixed a gas leak. While you might not always be able to smell a leak, you should pay attention to see if you do notice the smell of leaking gas.


Gas smells like Sulphur or “rotten eggs.”
The smell of gas is made by mercaptan, an additive that is intended to help humans smell it.
Shut off the master gas switch for your home and consider calling a professional if you smell gas. The gas main switch will be located next to your meter -- usually on the side of your home.;
, Carbon monoxide detectors and gas detectors are normally used to alert people to gas leaks in their homes and businesses. While most detectors are stationary devices meant to detect an accumulation of carbon monoxide or other fumes, you can purchase portable detectors.


Position your stationary carbon monoxide detector near the repair you’ve made.
If you have a portable detector, move it near (within several inches) to the repair.
If there is a gas buildup near the detector, it will sound an alarm., This works because the detector solution or soapy water will bubble due to the force of the leaking gas. Ultimately, this is a simple and effective way to find out if you’ve successfully fixed a gas leak.


Commercially produced gas leak detector is specially formulated to stick to tight connections.
If you want to create your own solution, try mixing a few drops of dish soap into a cup of water and spraying it onto the gas connection.
If the solution bubbles, you likely failed to repair the leak.
Gas detector may be available at your local home improvement store, specialty stores, or online., If you’ve worked to fix an appliance, the best indication that you have not been successful is if the appliance doesn’t work. However, make sure to take a few precautions before turning on an appliance you’ve just fixed:


Try to detect gas before turning it on by smelling, using a gas detector spray, or an electronic gas detector before powering your appliances on.
Make sure the room is ventilated and has had time to air out before working an appliance.
Call a licensed professional if you’ve failed to fix a leak., One of the best indications of an on-going gas leak is a weak pilot light. A weak pilot light may indicate low gas flow. In this event, your fix did not work.


The pilot light should always be a blue transparent color.
An orange or red pilot light is an indication of problems.
If the pilot light turns off repeatedly, it is likely not getting enough gas and there may be a leak., If you have not fixed a leak, you may be able to spot soot or scorches on the outside of the appliance. Most of the time, these indications will be near the pilot light or connecting gas line.


Scorch marks may be brown or black.
Soot may be very fine and whitish grey., Both before and after you attempt to fix a gas leak, you need to make sure that the area is well-ventilated. If the area is not well-ventilated, you may have a potentially dangerous accumulation of gas.


Open windows and doors.
Allow an area to air out before re-entering it or turning on any appliances., If you have any doubt that you’ve fixed the gas leak, you should not engage in any activity that could result in a gas explosion. This is important, as any fire or electronic activity could potentially ignite accumulated gas. Refrain from:


Lighting matches or lighters.
Operating electrical switches.
Using telephones.
Answering your cell phone or using other portable electronic devices., The second you suspect there is an ongoing gas leak, you should vacate the building at once. This is important, as gas leaks can quickly turn into gas explosions. In addition, you might also be overcome by the gas and lose consciousness.


After exiting the building, stay at least 100 feet away.
If safe, and if you know where it is, locate the gas shut off valve and turn off the gas for the premises., After exiting the building, you should call a professional to properly fix the gas leak. A professional will be able to quickly locate the source of the leak, fix it, and prevent harm to property or people.


Call your gas company if you suspect the leak in your home or business is linked to a larger leak in their system.
Inform the professional of any steps you’ve taken to fix the gas leak. If you’ve turned the main gas switch off, shut off gas to an appliance, added piping, or changed any substantial part of your gas system, they need to know.
If you have an uncontrolled gas leak in your home or business, call local authorities immediately. For example, call 911 in the United States."

Familiarize yourself with the layout.,
For outlets, all the wires will attach to the outlets.,
Attach the neutrals (white) to the two side screws that are on the same side as the ground (green) screw.,
If you come to an outlet box that only has three wires in it (not six), it means you've reached the end of the circuit.",How to Do Common Electrical Repairs," Every outlet box in your home will usually have at least 3 wires in it: A hot, a neutral and a ground. In the case of a switch that controls a ceiling fan or overhead light, for instance, will have a feed (3 wires) and an out (3 more wires going to the fan). The 2 neutrals (white in the US, generally blue elsewhere) will be wire-nutted together, and the 2 grounds (bare or green, sometimes stripped with yellow) will be wire-nutted together. The two remaining hots will attach to the switch itself (the feed hot on the bottom, and the out hot on the top).;
, A regular two socket outlet will have 5 screws behind it. Two will be for the neutral (white), two will be for the hots (black) and one for the ground (green).

, The hots will attach to the remaining two screws.

, Simply follow the same rules described above for attaching the wires.

"
Ensure that the wire/wires you're going to be dealing with are not powered.,
Locate the knock out stamping (KO) sized to fit the desired connector (or fitting).,
Find the point of attachment for this KO.,
Twist the KO back and forth with fingers or pliers to fully remove.,
Locate the next KO ring point of attachment.,
Insert the blade of the screwdriver into the opening as shown so that the tip just extends beyond the opening.,
Repeat the previous step in such a way the the tip will press the other portion of the KO ring into the box similar as shown.

,
Press the blade against the wall, between it and KO ring to pry it further inward - enough to grab the edge with pliers.

,
Twist and rock the KO ring back and forth with the pliers only as much as needed to fatigue the point of attachment.,
Continue removing KO rings until the correct size opening is achieved.

,
Remove the locknut from the connector.

,
Insert the connector into the opening from the outside of the box.

,
Spin the locknut onto the connector.

,
Hold the connector in place to keep screws accessible while hand tightening the locknut.

,
Tighten fully by placing the blade of the screwdriver in a ""valley"" of the locknut, and rap sharply with pliers or hammer.

,
Insert the wire, cable or pipe into the connector and secure with screws supplied on the connector body.

","How to Remove a ""Knock Out"" from an Electrical Box"," Switch off all suspect breakers and use a suitable meter or tester to ensure that power is off - reducing the chance of shock or burns.;
, There will likely be several KOs of different sizes on more than one surface from which to choose. Pick the one that will be easiest to connect the cable or pipe.

, The single size KOs and smallest of multiple KOs are generally secured in a single location. Press the edge of a screwdriver against the inner-most KO's stamped edge, away from this point of attachment, and press (or rap sharply if needed) to push the KO away from the wall of the box.

, The smallest KO is usually a 3/8"" or 1/2"" trade size opening. Most modern connectors require a minimum 1/2"" trade size opening. If this is the size of the KO removed and the connector to be installed, skip head to step 10; otherwise continue to increase to the next step KO size.

, The second ring of KO is much smaller and may be attached to yet a third (or more) KO ring. These KO rings are also often secured by two (or more) points of attachment. They will require slightly more effort and patience to remove without damaging any additional KO rings that are larger than needed. An over-sized opening will not support the connector without additional expense.

, The tip should be as far away as possible from the point of attachment. The blade should not extend beyond the the outer edge of the inner ring. Gently pry the screwdriver's tip into the box. Only the inner ring of the KO should bend inward.

,,, Soon, the KO ring will simply break away. Excessive force could damage any additional KO ring - rendering the opening too large to support the connector.

Check the magnets.,
Secure the sides row by row.,
Insert wood tacks through each hook and loop strip.,
Test the Magic Mesh screen.",How to Install a Magic Mesh," Wipe away any dirt or debris from the surface you plan to adhere the Magic Mesh onto.


Grime can prevent the adhesive hook and loop strips from sticking to the door frame.
Quickly wiping the door frame with a slightly damp rag or disinfectant wipe should remove most of the dirt. Allow the frame to air dry naturally before installing the Magic Mesh screen.;
, Make sure that the screen will not interfere with the door as it opens.


If your door opens inward, you should install the Magic Mesh on the outside of the door frame.
Conversely, install the Magic Mesh on the inside of the door frame if your door opens outward.
When installing a Magic Mesh screen over a sliding door, make sure that you attach it to the stationary door., Use a measuring tape to measure the height of the door frame. Mark this measurement down for future reference.


You will need to use this measurement to determine how high you must hang the screen. If the screen is longer than the height of your door frame, you will need to install the screen so that the top edge lands above the frame. Otherwise, the screen may drag on the floor.

, Use a measuring tape to measure the width of your door frame.


Mark this measurement down, then divide the measurement in half. Write that distance down, as well.
When installing the screen over a sliding door, the opening should be 36 inches (91.4 cm) or larger. For non-sliding doors, the width of the door frame must not be smaller than the width of the full Magic Mesh screen.

, Measure out half of the total door width along the top frame. Use a pencil to lightly mark this center point directly on the upper door frame.


This point must lie at the exact center of the upper door frame.
You will start at this center point when installing the Magic Mesh screen panels.

, Spread out the Magic Mesh, laying it over the ground or another large, flat surface.


Keep the two screen panels side by side. When joined together, these two panels will become one screen. The connecting magnets of both screens should be aligned to the center of the overall screen.
The gap between the magnets and the trim will appear larger at the top end of the screen and smaller at the bottom end of the screen. Additionally, the bottom edge is slightly “ruffled” or “scrunched.”, The magnets of each panel should form pairs with one another. Go down the entire lengthwise center of the panel, checking each magnet pair to make sure that the magnets of each pair attract one another.


If one magnet pair works correctly, the others should also work. It is still best to check each pair separately, though, since a manufacturing error could have resulted in magnet pairs that don't match up.
Note that you will need to separate the magnets of each pair before installing the screen.

, Peel the backing off the soft side of each hook and loop strip, then apply the exposed adhesive to directly to the back of the Magic Mesh screen.


The screen should come with 12 adhesive hook and loop strips when you purchase it. These are the strips you need to use.
Attach the strips to the side of the screen that will face the door. Make sure that each strip sticks to the screen securely.
Position the strips in a precise manner. Starting with the screen panel lying to your left (panel A):Place strip A1 along the upper edge, placing it as close to the center as possible.
Place strip A2 along the center of the upper edge.
Place strip A3 in the outer, upper corner.
Place strip A4 one-quarter of the way down the outer vertical edge.
Place strip A5 three-quarters of the way down the outer vertical edge.
Place strip A6 in the bottom outer corner.


Mirror the same placement on the second panel (panel B) using the remaining six strips (B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6).

, Remove the backing from the other side of strip A1. Press the exposed adhesive onto the door frame, positioning it so that the inner edge of the panel lines up with the center mark previously made on your door frame.


Press and hold the adhesive strip for at least 30 seconds to ensure a secure fit.
Double-check to make sure that the screen is high enough to prevent the bottom edge from dragging on the ground. To preserve the integrity of the adhesive, you should verify the correct height before sticking the strip to the door frame. Removing the strip and placing it elsewhere can cause some of the adhesive to wear away.

, Remove the backing from the other sides of strips A2 and A3 and press them both in place along the top frame of the door.


Press and hold each strip in place for at least 30 seconds.
Make sure that the top edge of the Magic Mesh screen panel is horizontal and parallel to the door frame.
After adhering the top edge of panel A, this panel should remain in place during the remainder of the installation.

, Remove the backing from the other side of strip B1 to reveal the adhesive. Press this adhesive side onto the door frame on the opposite side of the center mark.


Press and hold the strip for at least 30 seconds.
The center edge of this panel (B) should lie directly next to the center edge of the first panel (A). The two edges may even overlap slightly.
Make sure that the height of panel B is the same as the height of panel A.

, As with panel A, remove the backing from strips B2 and B3, then press the newly exposed adhesive sides of both strips onto the top of the door frame.


Press and hold for 30 seconds.
The top edge of this panel must be horizontal, parallel to the door frame, and even with the first panel.
Adhering the top edge of panel B should prevent the panel from falling down during the remainder of the installation.

, Work your way down the vertical center of the overall screen, snapping the magnets in each magnet set together.


If the screen panels have been hung evenly, the magnets of each set should connect properly and completely. The magnets should also be aligned along the vertical center of the door.
If the magnets of each pair fail to connect, the Magic Mesh screen will not close properly after installation.

, Peel the backings off the remaining hook and loop strips, then press the newly exposed adhesive sides of each strip to the door frame.


Work down both sides simultaneously.

Adhere strips A4 and B4.

Then, work on strips A5 and B5.
Finally, adhere strips A6 and B6.


Press on each strip for at least 30 seconds, or until secure.
By working in rows like this, you can ensure that the magnet pairs stay together and prevent the panels from splitting too far apart.

, For added security, you should tack the installed screen to the door frame using wood tacks.


Note that this step is only optional, but it is highly recommended.
These wood tacks should be included when you purchase the Magic Mesh kit. You should have a total of 12 wood tacks.
Simply press one wood tack into the center of each hook and loop strip placed around the perimeter of your overall screen. You should be able to use your thumb to install the tacks, but if that doesn't work, you could gently tap on each tack with a hammer.
Only use the wood tacks on wood frames or wood molding. Do not use them on any surface not made of wood.

, The Magic Mesh screen is now installed. Test it out by walking through the center of the screen several times.


The magnet pairs should split apart as you walk through them and close back together once you leave the doorway.
If the screen does not work as designed, you may need to reinstall it, moving the panels closer or further apart as necessary.

Make sure the property matches the correct criteria.,
Consider the distance the nearest electrical post is from the property as this can be prove costly.,
If the electric supply is current, visit the main office of EDP (Energias de Portugal) to sign up to a new contract.,
Once you have signed the contract you can elect whether to have the electricity bills paid by direct debit with the bills being sent to your Portuguese address.",How to Get Electricity Connected to Your Property in Portugal," Make any repairs necessary.


The Portuguese government, in conjunction with EDP, (Energias de Portugal), have implemented rules governing the new connections of mains electricity to private, habitations as well as commercial properties to ensure all safety regulations are met.
If a property (habitation) has never had a mains electricity supply and is deemed to be in a sub habitable condition, then the electricity supply will not be connected until the property matches the correct criteria.
In the case of ruins and ruined property, this will mean submitting a planning application to the local council to make the structural repairs necessary bringing the property up to a habitable condition. This includes a full new electrical system, installation of water inlet and egress pipes, creation of a septic tank, wiring for telephone and broadband capabilities and installation of pipe work for mains gas as well as any structural work which needs to be carried out.
All of which collectively must meet the building regulations standard laid down by the government. Only after all of this is done, the work approved and the electricity system has been installed and signed off by a registered electrician will the electric company give a connection with a definitive electric metre.;
, Electrical posts are sited 100 meters (328.1 ft) apart and although you can get the electric metre sited at the edge of your boundary bringing the supply to it can be expensive. To have a post installed by the electric company will cost around 1,000 euros per post. If the nearest post is on the opposite side of the road from your property you will have to have a new post installed to ensure there is enough clearance room beneath for high sided vehicles to pass beneath.

, You will need your identity documents and your fiscal card as well as some proof you are the new owner of the property (ideally a copy of the Escritura). Then the staff within the office will create a new contract for you with a start date for the electricity supply to be changed into your name. When visiting EDP it is advisable to read the existing metre as this will speed up the process.

, However EDP have also introduced an online billing procedure which can be useful if your property is a holiday home.

Nail the stopper to the door frame.",How to Install a Door Jamb," Break out the tape measure. You’ll need to know how wide your door frame is so the jamb fits in it. Hold the tape measure up to the top of the door frame. Note the measurement and save it for later., Take your tape measure to one side of the door frame. Note the length and mark this on one piece of wood. If you have level ground, this measurement will be the same for the other side. Most likely they’ll be different, so measure the other side of the frame and mark its length on another piece of wood. Don’t forget to also measure the top part of the frame for the smaller piece of wood.Remember to account for ground clearance. You’ll need to know how thick the material under the door will be. Take off an extra ¾ of an inch (1.9 cm) off the jambs for an interior door. Take off an extra ¼ of an inch (.64 cm) for exterior doors., Suit up with safety gear, including gloves and a visor, before turning on your circular saw. Thin the pieces of wood so they fit within the frame. Follow up by cutting their length according to the measurements you took earlier., Lay one of the longer pieces of wood on its side. Attach the shorter piece to one end of the longer piece. Get your nail gun and hold it square on the outside of the area where the wood meets. Add the nails to secure the pieces together. Align the other piece of wood on the opposite side and attach it the same way., Haul your newly-cut wood up into the frame. Since you measured, it should fit in there well. Align the left side against the wall and see if it appears level. Double-check this with a level., Before attaching the jamb to the frame, place wood strips (shims) under it. Figure out where you need to place the shims to level the hinge side from top to bottom. Get these strips from the home improvement store. Slip them between the jamb and frame as needed.Always start with the side where the door will attach to the hinges.

, You can hold the jamb in place by lightly hammering in a few nails. Place the door inside the jamb. The door needs to fit comfortably inside the jamb. Look for the gap between the door and jamb to be one-eighth of an inch (.32 cm) on all sides. Add or remove shimming so the door fits. When you’re sure the measurements are correct, remove the door., Get your nail gun again. Make sure the jamb is even against the wall and frame. Begin securing it with nails from top to bottom. Be sure to put a nail through each shim to hold them in place.Weather strips are a good way of hiding screw marks. Screws make exterior doors stronger and more adjustable. Drill a hole in the jamb before adding the screws, then attach the weather strips over them., Move onto the top side. First, hold your level up to the jamb. If it doesn’t appear level, add some shims to even it out. Finish by nailing the jamb to the frame. Repeat this with the side opposite the hinges., The shims will have their ends sticking out of the jamb. Go ahead and take your utility knife or other woodcarving knife to them. Cut off the ends so the shims are hidden behind the frame., Screw the hinges onto the correct side of the jamb. Unless you are installing a prehung door, you’ll need to trace the outline of the hinges on the jamb and cut an indentation using a router or utility knife. Place the door in the jamb and fasten it to the hinges. Make sure it’s tight and opening in the right direction.It’s ideal to do this first so you can gauge how much space you have for the door stops and align them properly behind the hinges.

, The door stopper (also called stop molding) can be bought pre-cut or fashioned out of wood strips. You will need to measure out how wide the stopper needs to be so that the pieces on each side of the door frame fit together. The moulding goes behind the hinges and rests in the middle of the jamb. Measure it against the jamb until you’re sure it’s the right thickness.The stop molding is thin. When cutting it yourself, you only need strips of wood about one or two inches (two to five cm) wide.

, Start with the top part. Measure all the way across the jamb. Keep in mind the thickness of the moulding. Leave that amount of space available where the top part will run into the left and right stopper pieces. Mark these spots on the jamb in pencil. Now measure the amount of wood needed from top to bottom of both the left and right sides of the jamb., Use a saw or a utility knife to trim the wood to the required length. You’ll have a shorter piece for the top of the door and two longer pieces for the sides., Get your nail gun one more time. Start with the top side. Keep the stopper pieces even and centered in the jamb. Nail the shorter piece to the frame. Nail the other pieces to the sides. When you’re done, the closed door should rest inside the jamb."

A transistor is basically 2 diodes that share one end.,
Transistors may operate by junctions or field effects, but both come in two basic types.",How to Test a Transistor1," The shared end is called the base and the other 2 ends are called the emitter and collector.


The collector accepts an input current from the circuit, but it can't send the current through the transistor until allowed to by the base.
The emitter sends a current out into the circuit, but only if the base allows the collector to pass the current through the transistor to the emitter.
The base acts like a gate. When a small current is applied to the base, the gate opens and a large current can flow from the collector to the emitter.;
,


An NPN transistor uses a positive semiconductor material (P-type) for the base and negative semiconductor material (N-type) for the collector and emitter. On a circuit diagram, an NPN transistor shows an emitter with the arrow pointing out (""Never Points iN"" aids remembering).
A PNP transistor uses an N-type material for the base and P-type material for the emitter and collector. The PNP transistor show an emitter with the arrow pointing in (""Points In Permanently"" is the memorizer).

,, Read the display on the multimeter and note whether the resistance is high or low.

, The display should give the same reading as when you touched the probe to the emitter.

,, Compare the reading on the multimeter's display to the readings you got previously.


If the previous readings were both high and the current readings are both low, the transistor is good.
If the previous readings were both low and the current readings are both high, the transistor is good.
If both readings you receive with the red probe are not the same, both readings with the black probe are not the same, or the readings don't change when switching probes, the transistor is bad.

If the display shows high resistance when each of the leads are touched, you have found the base (and you have a good NPN transistor).
If the display shows 2 different readings for the other 2 leads, clamp the black probe to another lead and repeat the test.
After clamping the black probe to each of the 3 leads, if you don't get the same high resistance reading when touching the other 2 leads with the red probe, you either have a bad transistor or a PNP transistor.

Note the components used in that circuit and the reference voltage position.,
Start the analysis of the circuit.,
Analyse the circuit for the positive half cycle of the input voltage.,
Analyse the circuit for the negative half cycle of the input voltage.,
Become familiar with the input and output waveforms, as shown in the figure.,
Solve any clipping circuits problem.",How to Understand Basic Diode Clipping Circuits," Make a note of the cathode and anode connections of the diode with respect to input signal and reference voltage (Vref). Compare the voltage of Vref with Vm (or Vpeak) and -Vm (or -Vpeak) and make a note.;
, Since the given input is a AC voltage, analysis must be carried out in two separate steps: one for positive half cycle and another one for negative half cycle.

, During this cycle the anode of the diode is connected to input through resistor R and the cathode of the diode to Vref. The diode will be forward biased only if the anode of the diode is more positive than the cathode and reverse biased when anode is less positive than cathode; therefore as the input voltage increases from 0 volts to Vref the diode will be in the reverse biased state and hence the output follows the input. However, when the input voltage exceeds Vref, the diode will be a short circuit. Now the output side contains only Vref and hence we get a straight line of magnitude Vref in the output waveform, until the input voltage becomes less than the Vref in the same cycle, because after this point diode will be in reverse biased state and hence output follows the input.

, During this cycle the anode is connected to input through resistor R and cathode to Vref. Since cathode is more positive than the anode, the diode (ideal) will be reverse biased in the entire negative half cycle, hence it will be a open circuit. Since the diode is open is open, the circuit is incomplete and no current flows through the circuit, whatever you apply at the input side simply appears at the output side without modification. Therefore entire negative cycle simply appears at the output.

, Observe the clipped off portion in the positive cycle, since the clipped off portion is in the positive X-axis the circuit is also called positive clipping circuit.

, The good to way to start is, just interchange the position of the diode and a resistor and repeat the same steps.

Remove the old chimes.,
Connect the wires to the new chimes.,
Secure the new chimes into position.,
Restore power, and test the doorbell.",How to Install a Doorbell," Make sure that circuits that supply electricity to the old doorbell and chime are turned off. To make sure, use a circuit tester to check for the presence of any power in the device.;
, Remove the cover and use the screwdriver to detach the old switch from the wall. Pull the detached switch away from the wall and expose the wiring running from the back of the wall plate and into the hole behind the plate. Wrap the wires with a short length of electrical tape, and apply a section of the sticky tape surface to the edge of the open hole to prevent the wires from sliding back into the wall.

, Remove the cover from the new button, and thread the wires through the base of the unit. Wrap the ends of each of the wires to the positive and negative terminals, and use the screwdriver to secure the wires into position

, Use the screws provided to secure the plate into position, and then slide the cover over the device until it snaps into position.

, Remove the cover from the chimes, and use the screwdriver to detach the device from the wall or ceiling where it is mounted. Label the wires for where they're meant to go (transformer, back door, front door, etc.) with some painter's tape. After pulling the chimes away from the surface, detach the wires and use a piece of electrical tape to secure them to the area surrounding the hole.

, Remove the cover from the chimes, and run the wires through the guide channel to the terminals. Wrap the ends of the wires around the appropriate terminals (using the labels you made earlier as a guide), and screw the holding screws into position.

, Place the new chimes over the hole and use the screws provided to attach the device to the wall or ceiling. Once the chime plate is secured, fit the cover over the device and gently push until it snaps into place.

, Use the circuit tester to make sure the current is flowing through the system properly. Then push the doorbell. If the chimes function properly, the task is complete.


If it doesn't work, check that you attached the wires to the correct terminals. If it still doesn't work, call an electrician because you're problem isn't with your bell: your wiring is broken!

Practice on junk components.",How to Solder Electronics," For soldering electrical components into printed circuit boards, the best soldering irons are Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) safe, temperature-controlled, high-power irons. These will let you solder for hours, and are good for complex amateur radio projects. For simple kits, an inexpensive pencil iron will do just fine.


Use a fixed power soldering iron, 25W for small jobs, and 100W for larger jobs with heavy cabling.
If possible, variable temperature irons are available, which will make for the safest treatment of the boards. The tip temperature can be controlled to suit the size of the job.;
, The most common solder alloy used in electronics is 60% tin and 40% lead, sometimes notated as 60/40. This alloy is recommended if you are new to soldering, though it is somewhat hazardous, requiring proper ventilation, breathing protection, or a soldering iron with a vacuum attachment.


Various lead-free alloys are becoming popular recently. These require higher soldering temperatures and do not ""wet"" as well as Tin-Lead alloys. However they are safer and can be more effective. 96.5 % tin to 3.5% silver is the most successful and will produce a joint with less electrical resistance than any tin-lead alloy.
Both lead and lead-free formulations are available online at places like solderdirect.com and in your local Radioshack or Home Depot store.

, Flux is an additive in solder that facilitates the soldering process by removing and preventing oxidation and by improving the wetting characteristics of the liquid solder. There are different types of flux cores available for solder wire.


Rosin is most commonly used by hobbyists. After soldering, it leaves a brown, sticky residue which is non-corrosive and non-conductive, but can be cleaned if desired with isopropyl alcohol. There are different grades of Rosin flux, the most commonly used is ""RMA"" (Rosin Mildly Activated).
No-clean flux leaves a clear residue after soldering, which is non-corrosive and non-conductive. This flux is designed to be left on the solder joint and surrounding areas.
Water-soluble flux usually has a higher activity that leaves a residue which must be cleaned with water. The residue is corrosive and may also damage the board or components if not cleaned correctly after use.

, Mostly, electrical soldering deals with ""through-hole"" components, which are pressed into printed circuit boards (PCBs). Through-hole components have leads (wires or tabs) that pass through a hole in the board and are soldered to the pad of metal plating around the hole. The hole may be ""plated through"" or not.


Soldering other electrical items such as wires or lugs, have slightly different techniques, but the general principles of operating the solder and iron are the same.

, Electrical components are usually quite small, and you'll need tongs, needle-nosed pliers, or tweezers to hold them in place while you operate the soldering iron and negotiate the solder. It can be a balancing act.


Some kind of clamp or stand is usually best to hold the board in place while you solder the components.

, Select the correct component by checking it's type and value carefully. With resistors, check their color code. Bend leads correctly, if necessary, being careful not to exceed the stress specs, and clinch leads to fit the board.

, Always solder in a well-ventilated area, using breathing and eye protection. Make sure to prop up the iron when it is on but not in use. Irons can start fires quite easily by burning into your workbench.


Seven to twelve inches of space should be between the electronic components and your face, or it may jump into your eyes. Solder may splatter.

, Melt a small blob of solder on end of the soldering iron. This process is called tinning and it helps to improve heat flow from the iron to the lead and pad, keeping the board safe from the heat.









Carefully place the tip (with the blob) onto the interface of the lead and pad. The tip or blob must touch both the lead and the pad.
The tip of the soldering iron should not be touching the nonmetallic pad area of the PCB, or any of the fibreglass area surrounding. This area can be damaged by excessive heat.

, Flux from the solder wire is only active for about one second maximum after melting onto the joint as it is slowly burned off by heat. The lead and pad should be heated enough for the solder to melt not the connection point. The molten solder should ""cling"" to the pad and lead together by way of surface tension. This is commonly referred to as wetting.









If the solder does not melt onto the area, the most likely cause is insufficient heat has been transferred to it, or the surface needs to be cleaned of grease or dirt.

, No more than a drop or two of solder should be necessary for each joint, though it will vary slightly for different components. The correct amount of solder is determined by:









On plated-PCBs, you should stop feeding when a solid concave fillet can be seen around the joint.
On non-plated PCBs, you want to stop feeding when the solder forms a flat fillet.
Too much solder will form a bulbous joint with a convex shape, while too little solder will form a concave joint.

, Unfortunately, it's quite easy to damage a component or the board with too much heat. For the most part, however, you can keep the components and the board safe by moving swiftly. Keep a finger on the board nearby to ensure that it doesn't get too hot.


Try to err on the side of irons that are slightly less powerful than you think you might need. Use a 30 watt iron and practice soldering quickly so as to avoid excessive heating.
If working with a double-sided circuit board check both sides for good solder joints. A good joint will look shiny and cone shaped. if it looks frosty and dull then it is a cold joint.

, Some components (diodes, transistors, etc.) are quite susceptible to heat damage and require a small aluminum heat-sink clipped on to their leads on the opposite side of the PCB. Small aluminum heat sinks can be purchased through electronics supply houses. Hemostats (small) can also be used.

, After a proper application of solder, the solder will be shiny and not dull. Visible indications are the best way to know if your solder joint is good. The solder needs to melt with the surface of the electronic components, rather than the tip of the soldering iron. This way, when the solder cools, it forms an alloy with the surface of the metal.


The solder joint should coat the surface of the component evenly, not too much such that it forms a glob, nor too little such that it does not completely coat the surface.

, Burnt flux, rosin from the core of the solder, or plastic sheaths from wires may all burn onto the soldering iron. Such contaminants prevent the formation of a clean alloy between the electronic components. This is undesirable, because it raises the electrical resistance and also reduces the mechanical strength of the solder joint. A clean tip is shiny all the way around, without burnt gunk on it.


Clean the iron in between each component that you solder. Use a damp sponge or steel wool to clean it thoroughly. Tip thinner may also be used.

, This cooling should only take five to ten seconds. If the components are too hot to handle, use needle nose pliers, or a tool called helping hands which consists of two alligator clips attached to a little articulated stand. If you watch carefully, the cooling solder will settle right before your eyes.

, It's important to practice on throwaway stuff before you move straight to trying to solder something important. Gather some old junk boars and burnt out components from a junked radio or other electronic device to practice on.


Nobody is perfect, not even the professionals. Don't be ashamed to repeat a bit of soldering work. It will save you time in troubleshooting later.

Read schematics in the pattern that you would read text.,
Understand the electronic language.,
Find the correlation to all real parts.,
Determine the circuit tasks performed by the active devices.,
Evaluate what the circuit does.",How to Read Schematics," With rare exceptions, schematics should be read left to right and top to bottom. The signal being generated or used by the circuit will flow in this direction. The user can follow the same path that the signal uses to understand what the signal does or how it is being modified.;
, There will be a variety of schematic symbols on the schematic that represent real world devices and wires. A basic understanding of these symbols is required to read a schematic. Lists of the symbols are readily available on the Internet.


Understand ground. Ground is represented by either a triangle pointing down or a set of parallel lines that become shorter as they appear below each other, in effect representing the inner area of the triangle pointing down. Ground is a common reference point that schematics use to show the overall unity of the various functions of the circuit. It does not refer to the actual ground of the earth.
Learn that a line represents a wire. Wires are used to connect the devices together. All points along the wire are identical and connected. Wires may cross each other on a schematic, but that does not necessarily mean that they connect. If they do not connect, one will be shown looping around the other in a semicircle. If they do connect, they will cross and a dot will be seen at the point where the lines cross.
Learn that a resistor is represented by a zigzag shape. Resistors act to impede the flow of the circuit to an extent determined by the resistance value used. They are used to scale and shape the signal.
Understand Ohm's Law. The voltage drop across a resistor is equal to the current flowing through it times the value of the resistor (V=IR). This allows the classic use of resistor to divide down a voltage. If a voltage source is applied to two consecutive resistors of the same value, the voltage created at the point between the two resistors will be half of the original voltage applied.
Learn that capacitors are represented by two parallel lines. Capacitors are used to condition rapidly changing signals, as opposed to the static or slower changing signals that are conditioned by resistors. The traditional use of capacitors in modern circuits is to draw noise, which is inherently a rapidly changing signal, away from the signal of interest and drain it away to ground.
Understand the non standard symbols. The non standard symbols will be of a geometric shape, usually a rectangle, with a device indicator number in or beside the shape. The indicator number should be Uxx. Wherever a wire contacts the device, there will be a number indicated at the connection point. This number is the pin number of the device.

, Refer to the bill of materials for the circuit to find the values of capacitors and resistors, and the manufacturers and manufacturer's part numbers of the active devices.

, To determine the circuit tasks, acquire and read the manufacturer's data sheet for each individual device.

, Based on the schematic, decide what parts of the circuit are performing what functions. This will help you determine the performance function of the entire circuit.

Calculate the total charge.,
Find the charge in each capacitor.,
Calculate the voltage across each capacitor.,
Draw and label each capacitor with its charge and voltage.",How to Solve Capacitor Circuits2," A series circuit has only one loop with no branching paths. Capacitors in the circuit are arranged in order within the same loop. 

, Given the voltage and capacitor values for each, find the total capacitance. To calculate the total capacitance in a series circuit, use the formula 1CT=1C1+1C2+1C3{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{C_{T}}}={\frac {1}{C_{1}}}+{\frac {1}{C_{2}}}+{\frac {1}{C_{3}}}}.   

For example: A series circuit has three different capacitors of value C1 = 2F, C2 = 3F, C3 = 6F. Plug in to the formula 1CT=12+13+16{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{C_{T}}}={\frac {1}{2}}+{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{6}}} and solve for CT. Adding the fraction and taking the inverse, CT = 1F.


, The total charge in a circuit depends on the total voltage and the total capacitance in a circuit. This relationship is given by the equation Q=CV{\displaystyle Q=CV}.  

For example: The circuit has a total capacitance of 1 F and total voltage of 10 V. Plug in the given to the equation and solve for Q: Q=1∗10=10C{\displaystyle Q=1*10=10C}


, For a series circuit, charge across each capacitor is the same and equal to the total charge in the circuit. 

For example: The total charge in the circuit is 10 C. Then the charge in C1 is 10 C, C2 is 10 C and C1 is 10C.


, Rearranging the equation Q=CV{\displaystyle Q=CV} to V=Q/C{\displaystyle V=Q/C}, the voltage across each capacitor can be calculated.  

For Example: The charge is 10 C for all capacitors and capacitance values are 2 F, 3 F and 6 F respectively.

Voltage across first capacitor is V1 = Q1/C1 = 10/2 = 5V

Voltage across second capacitor is V2 = Q2/C2 = 10/3 = 3.3V

Voltage across third capacitor is V3 = Q3/C3 = 10/6 = 1.7 V

Note that the sum of individual voltage equals the total voltage in the series circuit. 


, Once the voltage and charge in each capacitor is calculated, the circuit is solved. Label these information in the circuit drawing to keep everything organized.  .

, The sum of all the capacitance value in a parallel circuit equals to the total capacitance in the circuit. This is given by the equation CT=C1+C2+C3. .

For example: A parallel circuit has three capacitors of value: C1 = 2F, C2 = 3F, C3 = 6F. Then the total capacitance, CT is 2+3+6 = 11 F.


, The total charge in a circuit depends on the total voltage and the total capacitance in a circuit. This relationship is given by the equation Q=CV{\displaystyle Q=CV}. 

For example: The circuit has a total capacitance of 11 F and total voltage of 10 V. Plug in the givens to the equation: Q = 11*10 = 110 C.


, In a parallel circuit, the voltage across each capacitor is the same and equal to the total voltage in the circuit. 

For example: The total voltage in the circuit is 10 V. Then the voltage across V1 is 10 V, V2 is 10 V and V3 is 10 V. 


, Once the voltage is identified for each capacitor with a known capacitance value, the charge in each capacitor can be found using the equation Q=CV{\displaystyle Q=CV}. 

For example: The voltage across all the capacitors is 10V and the capacitance value are 2F, 3F and 6F respectively.

Charge in first capacitor is Q1 = C1*V1 = 2*10 = 20 C.

Charge in first capacitor is Q2 = C2*V2 = 3*10 = 30 C.

Paint or finish as desired.",How to Hang a Prehung Door," Analyze your experience level. If you aren't a skilled builder, a pre-hung door may be easier to install because they come weather tight and gap free. There are two other things to consider:


Determine if there's a door frame where you want to put the door. If there's an open area for the door, rather than a frame, it will be easier to use a pre-hung door unit.
Consider the condition of an existing door frame. If it is damaged or in poor condition, you might want to remove the door frame and use a pre-hung door.;
, This guide will likely have a few words you're not incredibly familiar with. Here's what you'll find in your prehung door kit:


Hinges
Latchbolt and lockset bore (part of the doorknob)
Latch jamb and head jamb (the frame of the door that supports it)
Casing (the trim)
Mortise for strike plate (where the lock goes into the wall)

There are a few terms that will also be used that are a part of your house. These are the header (the part of the wall framing above the door), the king stud (the stud in the wall that supports the header), and the trimmer (the stud in the wall that is next to the jamb).



, The pre-hung door will come with long sides on the frame. This will allow you to cut each side of the door frame according to how level the floor is.


Cut the sides of the door frame if the floor isn't even. If the floor isn't level, one side of the frame will be shorter than the other to fit with the floor. This will not be noticeable after the door is in place.

, If it's not, install wooden shims between the rough opening and the door frame. A shim is a thin, tapered piece of wood that is used to fill in the gaps in the door frame. Using shims avoids the necessity for rebuilding the door opening to fit the pre-hung door.


Use shims on the side of the door with the hinges to remove the gaps between the trimmer stud and the door frame. The door should be square. Have another person hold the pre-hung door in place while you install wooden shims where necessary.
Ensure the door frame is flush with the wall.
Hammer a few large finish nails into the frame on the hinge side of the door. Make sure the nails go through the frame and into the shims and trimmer.
Leave part of the nails out, not hammering them all the way into the frame until you are sure the door is plumb.

, To shim is to wedge a thing into an area for purposes of measuring or centering. Here's what you need to do:


On the hinge jamb (the upright support of the door by the hinge), measure from the bottom of the jamb to the center of each hinge. On the hinge-side of the trimmer (likely on the left), measure up from the floor and mark the hinge locations.
Tack the plumb bob to the top of the hinge-side trimmer. Then, measure the gap between the string and the trimmer where each hinge is located. Place overlapping shims where the gap between the two is the smallest.
Make the shims 1/8"" thick (.3 cm), and tack them with a finish nail. Measure the gap between the new shims and the plumb bob string.
Place overlapping shims at the bottom two hinge locations on either side. Adjust each pair's thickness until the gap between shims and string is the same as the gap of the first pair.
Nail each pair of shims to the trimmer and cut off the ends with a utility knife; this is so they don't come out past the drywall.

, Take the door and lift it into the opening. Then, push the hinge jamb tight against the shims that are tacked to the trimmers. With 8d finish nails in hand, here's how you progress:


Take an 8d nail and tack it through the face of the hinge-side casing 3"" (7.5 cm) below the miter and into the trimmer stud. Using a level against the face of the casing, adjust the jamb until it's plumb.
If the wall is set correctly and the casing rests flush against it, drive 8d finish nails through it at the other two hinge locations as well.
If the wall is out of plumb and the casing is not resting correctly against it, shim behind the casing at the hinge locations to make the door plumb.
Nail through the casing and shims and into the trimmer stud, securing the door. It's also a good idea to get rid of any gaps between the casing and the wall with tapered wooden wedges.

, This is the horizontal gap between the head jamb and the top of the door. It needs to be 1/8 to 3/16"" (.15-.3 cm) wide and uniform from all angles.


If you need to, adjust this gap by pushing up the head casing. Drive an 8d nail through the face of the latch-side casing and into the trimmer stud, near the top of the door, to set everything in place.
Don't forget to check the vertical reveal between the door and jamb on the latch side, too. It should be about as thick as a nickel. Grab the casing and move the jamb by hand to adjust.
Swing the door open and close to see if its leading edge, the one that rests against the stop, clears the jamb by a consistent 1/8"" on all sides.
Drive finish nails every 16 inches through the latch-side casing and into the trimmer to set the reveal at the appropriate width. Leave the heads sticking out slightly so they can be set and puttied later. Make sure everything is consistent.

, To keep the jamb where you want it, slip a pair of shims between the main jamb on the latch side and the trimmer, which is near the top of the door opening. When they are just touching the back of the jamb and not adding pressure on it, nail them to the trimmer with more 8d finish nails.


You'll want to nail additional pairs of shims a few inches above the base of this jamb and above and below the strike plate, too. Without these shims, the jamb could flex, moving out of place.

, On the hinge jamb, remove the center screw from the top hinge and instead use a screw that's long enough to drive into the trimmer stud at least 1 inch. This will keep the door from sagging and binding.


If the long screws don't match the ones that came with the hinges and door, you can install them behind the hinge leaf so they're not visible.

, On the outside of your door, there will be a split jamb – it's the one in two pieces. To attach it, start at the bottom and carefully push the edge of it into the groove of the main jamb. With both hands, tap the two pieces together.


Nail the door casing to the wall on both sides of each miter, in addition to every 18 inches along the casing.
Once they're together, you'll want them to stay that way. Drive more 8d finish nails through the stop and into the trimmers. You'll need one nail at each hinge location, one through the shims near the top and bottom of the latch jamb, and one just above and below the striker.
Be sure not to nail into the head jamb.

, The door is up – now all that's left is the small hardware additions. To assemble the latch:


Fasten the strike plate to the mortise in the latch jamb with the screws provided in your kit. If the plate is bigger than the mortise, put the plate on the jamb, outline it, and chisel it to the shape of the outline.
Slip the latch bolt into its bore and fasten the plate into the mortise on the door's edge with the appropriate screws. If the mortise is too tight, adjust its size just like you did the strike plate.
Fit the doorknobs to both sides of the latch bolt. Once you're done with that, insert and tighten the connecting screws that hold the knobs together. Test out the knobs and make sure they're secure.
Close the door and listen for it to latch. If the door rattles, bend the prong on the strike plate just a little toward the stop. If the latch doesn't catch this time, bend the prong away from the stop. Once you find the right arrangement, tighten all the screws.

, Step away from the door to look at it, measure it and determine if it's plumb all the way around the frame. There should be a 1/8"" (.32 cm) opening all the way around the door frame.

, To make your door look sleek and like it was installed by a professional, hide the nail heads with putty. It is commercially available in many shades – you should be able to find one that matches your door.


Once applied, smooth it out with a scraper or the blunt edge of a knife. It should be in line with the door and not bulge out.

, Now that your door is up and installed, the rest is merely aesthetic. Paint or finish the door however you like – just be sure to use tape around the casing and jambs.

Preheat the soldering iron.,
Clean the tip of your soldering iron.,
Locate the terminals of the components to be removed.,
Place the desoldering braid on flexible circuit board.,
Melt the solder using heated iron.,
Remove the solder iron and desolder braid.,
Take off other legs of the electronic component.",How to Remove Electronic Components from a Flexible Circuit Board," In order to melt the solder, preheat a soldering iron (25W or 30W capacity, not more that that) for approximately five to ten minutes.;
, While the iron is heating, clean its tip with the help of a wet sponge. Wipe the sponge two or three times in order to thoroughly clean the tip.

, In this step, you will need to locate or roughly mark the components that you need to take off the flex PCB and identify their terminals.

, From a spool of desoldering braid, unroll approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) and place it on the board in such a way that its tip is pressed over the solder and one leg of the electronic component on the PCB.

, Place the tip of the heated solder iron on top of the desoldering braid in such a way that it will cause melting of the solder around the electronic component that is to be removed. The melted solder will get wicked into the braid and the leg of component will come off of the circuit board.

, As soon as the solder gets absorbed in the desoldering braid, you need to take the iron and braid away from the flexible circuit board to avoid undesired melting of solder surrounding other components.

, In order to remove the component completely, repeat steps 5 and 6 and take off other legs of the component. Once the component is completely free, let it cool for some time and then lift it off the board. If the electronic component is very small in size, then you can use a fork or tweezers (forceps) to pick it off the board.

Break apart the caulking on the trim of the door.,
Remove any trim surrounding the door frame.,
Remove any nails or screws attaching the door frame to the studs of the wall.,
Once the nails and screws have been removed, close the door and tip it back toward the direction in which you removed the trim.",How to Install a Door1," Do this by gently slicing through it with the corner of a chisel, moving around the length of the door frame. This way, less paint is stretched or removed along with the trim.






;
, You can do this carefully with a hammer and chisel. Wedge your chisel between the trim and the wall. Next, gently hammer the chisel into position. Finally, move the chisel back and forth to loosen the trim. Set aside the trim, either for re-application later or for discarding.









Take extra care in removing the trim if you're going to be re-using the trim after installing the door. Cracked or broken trim will make for a less professional-looking door in the end.

, A hacksaw, chisel, and hammer may be necessary to completely detach the nails and screws from their moorings on the studs.








, The door should fall easily through the opening. Having a friend or family member nearby to help you with this step is recommended, especially if the door and frame are heavy.








"
"
Start by checking your rough opening.,
Prep the door for installation.",How to Install a Door2," This is the width and height of the measurements between the rough framing. Rough openings need to be 2 inches (5 cm) wider and 2 1/2 inches (5.7 cm) taller than the actual door size you will be installing. If it's too big or small you will need to correct it; otherwise it will make for a difficult installation.









For example, if you are installing a 30 inch (76 cm) wide door you will need a 32 inch (81 cm) wide rough opening. A normal sized door, 80 inches (200 cm) in height, would need an 82-1/2 inch (~209 cm) tall opening.

, Remove any packing or shipping bands that are still attached to the door. Sleeves on the sides of doors should also be removed. Remove the lock brace from the side of the door; failure to do this now will result in a whole lot of hassle later.








"
"
Use a bracket system for efficient hanging of doors.,
Using a 4- or 6 foot (1.2 - 1.8 m) level, draw a vertical plumb line on the drywall 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) in from the rough opening.,
Screw three brackets to back of door frame, beside the hinges.,
Screw the other three brackets on the latch side of the door.,
Place 1/2"" (1.27 cm) blocks on the bottom of the floor for carpet, and 1/4"" (0.635 cm) blocks for vinyl or laminate.,
Starting at the top hinge, match up one of the lines on the bracket with the level line drawn at the beginning.








,
Screw the door to the wall using the drywall screws provided.,
Next, check the clearance between the frame and the door on the top and knob side.,
Starting at the top again and working down, continue screwing the screws into the your brackets on the latch side.,
Install any trim over top of the brackets.",How to Install a Door3," Brackets leave doors hanging very true. They are easy to install with one person and will could your time installing time in half. Brackets will also allow you to easily adjust the door clearances, should you need to.








, This line must be on the hinge side and in the room the door swings into.









Make sure that the vertical line is both straight and level. A straight line that is not level with the bottom of the floor will leave a door that doesn't swing true.

, Using the 1/2” (1.27 cm) screws provided, install brackets beside each hinge, making sure that they're even with the edge of the door frame.









Getting the brackets right next to the hinges is extremely important. The hinges are the pressure points of the door, and improperly installed brackets that are out of line with the hinges will eventually cause the door to fall out of plumb.

, Start 8” (20 cm) down from the top, and then once again 1” (2.5 cm) above the latch hole, and a final bracket 6"" to 8” (15 to 20 cm) up from the bottom of the door. The final bracket, if there is one, is recommended for the top, on doors 30” and wider. The door is now ready to insert in the rough opening.








, Never place the door directly on the bottom of the floor.








,, Work your way down the hinge side of the door, starting at the top, and making sure to use the same line for each of the three hinge brackets.








, Take care to make sure they are equal. It's easier to unscrew the drywall screws at this point than after the final screws are already embedded in the drywall.








, Keep the clearance between the frame and door equal as you screw the door to the wall with the drywall screws.








, Most trim will have hollowed out backside, which will both allow the brackets to fit underneath and conceal them. If your trim doesn't have a hollowed out backside, you may need to hammer the brackets into the drywall just a little.

Place three shims at the location of each hinge on the inner part of the door.








,
Drill a pilot hole through the doorstop and the shims, and then hammer in a nail into the upper shim in order to hold the door into place.








,
Check that the door is completely straight and plump with a 6 foot (182 cm) level.,
Drill pilot holes through the doorstop and shims at the middle and lower shims.,
Line up three more shims on the latch side of the wall, directly across from the shims on the hinge side.,
Drill pilot holes through the doorstop and shims at the upper, middle, and lower shims on the latch side.,
Put shims into two locations at the top of the door frame.,
Pre-drill eight pilot holes at each of the shim locations on the narrow side of the jamb.,
Sink the heads of the nails completely into the jamb using a nail set.,
Replace the hinge screws with 2-1/2"" (6.35 cm) screws to add more stability and balance.








,
Break off any portion of the shims that are protruding from the door jamb.,
Install any trim over the door frame.",How to Install a Door4,",, This part is all about using the level to test whether your placement is straight and level. If it's not, you'll need to adjust the shims in order to get a straight fit.









Place a level along the hinge side jamb, checking to see that it's straight. If it's not, adjust the middle and lower shims until the level indicates the jamb is straight.
Once completed, place the level at the jamb, checking to see that it's level. If it's not, adjust the jamb and the shims until the level indicates that it's level.

, Then, hammer in nails through the pilot holes at the shims, anchoring the jamb to the wall.








, Make sure that they are as level as possible with the shims on the hinge side.








, Finish the process by hammering in nails at the pilot holes, checking all the while that the jamb is still straight and level.








, Drill pilot holes into the shims at the top of the door frame and then secure them with one nail each. Check to see that the door and the door frame are evenly spaced.








, After drilling, hammer in eight nails at each of these locations, securing the inner jamb to the wall.








, You don't want the heads of nails interfering with the swing of the door.








,, Break off either with a hammer or a balled-up fist. File or sand down any small, jagged pieces that may be tougher to get at with a larger implement.








, Use the old trim, if desired, saved from the old door frame, or install new trim to match your new door.

Understand the basic diode clipping circuits completely.,
Examine the output waveform for the above circuit.,
Transfer characteristics must be analysed for positive and negative input voltages.,
Analyse the circuit for negative input voltages.,
Analyse the circuit for positive input voltages.,
Draw the transfer characteristics.",How to Draw the Transfer Characteristics for a Basic Diode Clipping Circuit," Drawing the transfer characteristics for the circuit becomes easy, if you understand the circuit completely and able to get it's output waveform.;
, Understand the output waveform of the circuit. Observe the Vref (reference voltage) line, which is in the positive X axis in the input waveform, also observe that above the Vref line, the output gets limited to Vref in the output waveform.

, Since transfer characteristics is defined as the plot of Vinp (input voltage) versus Vout (output voltage), input voltage may be positive, negative or zero.


Therefore, start the analysis for both types of inputs. Make a note of the output voltage obtained for the corresponding input voltage. Plotting becomes easy if you start analyzing the circuit from the negative input voltages (however, you can also start analysing from positive input voltages).

, When the negative input voltage is applied to the circuit, diode (Ideal) becomes reverse biased. Hence, the circuit becomes open and no current flows through the circuit.


Therefore, the output voltage at any point simply follows the input voltage at that point, without any modification. Plotting the graph of Vinp versus Vout in this condition results in a graph of straight line having a slope (defined as tan θ = Δ Vout/Δ Vinp) of 1 because, as Vinp changes, Vout also changes, but the amount of change in Vinp and Vout are equal at any point, as the output follows the input. Therefore Δ Vout = Δ Vinp = a (some value), now the value of tan θ = a/a=1, and hence θ = 45'.

, For the positive input voltages less than the Vref, the diode (Ideal) is reverse biased. Therefore, the circuit becomes open and no current flows through the circuit.


In this condition, the input applied is simply reflected as output without modification. The graph is a straight line originating from the origin, having an angle of 45' with the X-axis (or Y-axis). When the input voltage exceeds the Vref, the diode (Ideal) becomes forward biased and hence it is a short circuit.

The output will be equal to the magnitude of Vref. Hence, you can get a graph of a straight line from Vref point, which is parallel to the X-axis. The slope of this line is zero because, as Vinp changes, Vout does not change, but it remains constant to Vref. That is, the value of Δ Vout= Vref - Vref= 0 and the value of Δ Vinp= Vinp2 - Vinp1= b (some value). Therefore tan θ = 0/b = 0.



, After analysing the circuit for positive and negative input voltages completely, plot the graph. Transfer characteristics for the above circuit is as shown in the figure. Observe the slope of that graph for Vinp less than Vref and more than Vref.

Find a standard Ethernet cable you don't use for anything.,
Towards one end of the cable, cut open a slit a few inches long.,
Peel back and remove the cable casing.,
Cut the green, orange, white-green and the white-orange.,
With the wires cut, work now one-by-one.,
On Side ""A"" we will call it, connect the green stripped end to the orange stripped end on Side ""B"".,
You now have one step of your crossover wire completed.,
Just as we connected the orange and green wires for one side of our crossover cable, lets now repeat the process with the final two wires.,
On Side ""A"", join the green-white wire to the orange-white wire on Side ""B"".,
Join the remaining wires.,
Clean the cable up.,
Admire your new, home made crossover cable!

",How to Make a Crossover Cable from One Standard Ethernet Cable," With this guide, you will be able to use a long 100 feet (30.5 m). cable, or a shorter size, whatever your needs require.;
, Be careful not to damage the wiring inside the cable or cut yourself.

, This will leave the inner wiring exposed. Examine how the wiring is twisted together and note the colors of the wires. For this project, we will be cutting the colored wires (green, orange, white-green, white-orange) and leaving the other wires in place as usual.

, The other wires will be left as-is.

,


First, strip the orange wire on both cut sides down. (approx. 1/4 or 1/2 inch)






After both ends of the orange wire has been stripped, strip both ends of the green wire down. (approx. 1/4 or 1/2 inch)







, Twist the wires together, and mend with electrical or another kind of tape. If you have a soldering iron, you can optionally solder the leads together.

, Lets continue on.

,


Start by stripping the green-white wires. (once again, approx. 1/4 or 1/2 inch)






Repeat the wire stripping on orange-white wires. (once again, approx. 1/4 or 1/2 inch)







, Twist the wires together and fix with tape. Again, if you prefer, you can solder the wires together as opposed to twisting them together.

, Join the orange-white wire on Side ""A"", with the green-white wire on Side ""B"". Fashion the wires with tape or solder.

,


Note the direction that the wiring in the cable case is twisting.






Holding the cable in your hands, twist the cable in the same way as the internal wiring is twisted.






Keep the wire twisted, and close it up with tape or shrink-wrap.

Screw a bulb into a bulb holder.,
Remove about an inch of wire covering from each end of two copper wires.,
Connect the positive lead.,
Connect the negative lead.,
Light the bulb.",How to Make a Circuit1," A bulb holder is a device made to hold a light bulb. It also has two terminals. One is for a positive lead and the other is for a negative lead. This allows you to pass a current through the light bulb in the holder. Be sure to use a low powered light bulb (e.g. something in the range of 1-10 volts)., You should use two different colored copper wires. This will help you differentiate between the positive and negative lead. Use a knife or wire strippers to cut an inch of the wire insulation (the colored part) off of each end of both wires. This exposes the copper wire underneath., Generally, red wire is used to connect the positive end. One side of the red wire will connect to one side of the bulb holder. The other side of the red wire should touch the positive lead on the battery., Black wire is usually used to connect the negative end. Again, one end of the wire should touch the terminal on the bulb holder (not the same terminal as the positive wire). The other end of the wire can be left unattached until you are ready to light the bulb., Touch the unattached end of the negative (black) wire to the negative terminal on the battery. This completes the circuit and allows electricity to flow. The electricity is forced to flow through the light bulb, which causes the bulb to light up.

Set the power pack.,
Connect the light.,
Adjust the voltage.",How to Make a Circuit2," The power pack should be on a flat, level surface. Plug the power pack into an outlet. This will provide a steady supply of power to your circuit. Plug the wire leads into the power pack., Screw the light into a bulb holder. Then connect each lead from the power pack to one of the terminals on the bulb holder. Once both leads are connected, the light will light up.If the light does not light up, check that the leads are well connected and the power pack is plugged in and turned on.

, You can turn a dial on your power pack to cause the voltage to fluctuate. Doing this can demonstrate how the brightness of the light changes as a result of higher or lower voltages. The light should get dimmer as the voltage goes down, and brighter as the voltage goes up."

Cut one wire lead.,
Attach the lead wire from the battery to the switch.,
Attach the lead wire from the switch to the bulb.,
Toggle the switch.",How to Make a Circuit3," Remove power from the circuit before cutting any leads. It does not matter if you cut the positive or negative lead. You can use a pair of wire cutters to cut the lead anywhere in the circuit. The switch will provide control of the circuit no matter where it is located.It is dangerous to cut into a live wire (one with power on it). Always disconnect the circuit before cutting leads.

, Once you have cut one of the lead wires, you can attach it to the switch. The switch will have two simple terminals. Attach the lead wire coming from the battery to one of these terminals., The second piece of wire should be attached to the bulb holder terminal. Attach this piece of wire to the second terminal on the switch. This will again complete the circuit., As you flip the switch on and off, it will open (break) and close (complete) the circuit. This will either prevent or allow electricity to flow. When the circuit is open, the light will be off. When the circuit is closed, the light will turn on."

Memorize a mnemonic for resistors.",How to Identify Resistors1,";
, These are sometimes followed by a gap, then an additional color band.

, The colors on the first 2 or 3 bands correspond to numbers from 0 to 9, which represent the significant digits of the resistor's ohmic value. The last band gives the multiplier. For example, a resistor with brown, green and green bands is rated at 15 mega-ohms (15,000,000 ohms). The code is as follows:


Black: 0 significant digit, multiplier of 1
Brown: 1 significant digit, multiplier of 10
Red: 2 significant digit, multiplier of 100
Orange: 3 significant digit, multiplier of 1,000 (kilo)
Yellow: 4 significant digit, multiplier of 10,000 (10 kilo)
Green: 5 significant digit, multiplier of 100,000 (mega)
Blue: 6 significant digit, multiplier of 1,000,000 (10 mega)
Violet: 7 significant digit
Gray: 8 significant digit
White: 9 significant digit
Gold: multiplier of 1/10
Silver: multiplier of 1/100

, This represents the tolerance of the resistor. If there is no color band, the tolerance is 20 percent. Most resistors have no band, a silver band or a gold band, but you may find resistors with other colors. The tolerance color code is as follows:

,,,,,,,,,, Several exist, so choose the one that you won't forget. Remember that the first color is black, and afterward each first letter corresponds to a color in order from 0 to 9. Some popular mnemonic devices include:


""Bad beer rots our young guts but vodka goes well.""
""Bright boys rave over young girls but veto getting wed.""

Check to see if there is a letter ""R"" within the numeric code.",How to Identify Resistors2," Some resistors have contact plates on the bottom.

, The first 2 or 3 represent the significant digits and the last indicates the number of 0s that should follow. For example, a resistor reading 1252 indicates a rating of 12,500 ohms or 1.25 kilo-ohms.

,,,,,,,,,,, This indicates a very small resistor, and the letter takes the place of a decimal point. For instance, a 5R5 resistor is rated at 5.5 ohms.

Look for the capacitor.,
Disconnect the capacitor from the system, if it is not permanently installed.,
Touch a device to the capacitor leads for several seconds.",How to Discharge a Capacitor," Don't let your unprotected hands near anything involved.;
, Alternating current will flow through a capacitor until the source of the current is removed. That current can add to the shock you'll get if you mishandle the capacitor, and may keep recharging it.

, Most capacitors are constructed of 2 conductive plates separated by an insulating plate; more complex capacitors feature multiple layers of metalized plastic. Big capacitors, the kind most likely to be dangerous, are usually cylindrical and look roughly like battery cells.

, This may prevent damage to the circuitry the capacitor was connected to when you discharge it.


If it is removable, it is probably very large and potentially very dangerous.

, Doing this will provide a path for the electricity to go and discharge the capacitor. You can use a 5- to 10-watt resistor, voltmeter, test light or ordinary light bulb.

Using a meter or light will show the progress of the discharging, either with a digital display or a progressively dimming bulb.

Determine whether or not the wall you've chosen for pocket door installation is a good candidate.,
Verify that the wall doesn't have any electrical wiring or pipes running through it.,
Replace the existing header.,
Remove pieces of the wallboard using a wood-cutting blade.,
Remove the existing door by pulling off the molding.,
Tip the saw blade down to cut shallowly into the drywall and remove it from between the studs.,
Remove the header using a reciprocating saw.,
Determine the height of the header by adding 3 1/4 inches (8.26 cm) to the length of the new door, and then add the height of the soleplate, which will only be necessary if the floor is carpeted.,
Cut the stud tops to this determined length to support the new header.,
Install the new header using nails or screws and then cut and install the soleplate to the floor.

,
Finish the installation of your new pocket door according to the manufacturer's instructions.

",How to Frame a Pocket Door," The wall needs to be wide enough to accommodate twice the door's width, plus 1 inch (2.54cm). You'll also need to know whether or not the wall is load-bearing. You can determine this by the wall's placement in the house.


Generally, load-bearing walls will be in a central location, and they will be perpendicular to the floor joists. If you have a basement, you can easily identify a load-bearing wall by checking the direction of the joists in the ceiling of the basement.
If you're installing a pocket door in a load-bearing wall, you may need temporary ceiling support while you replace the existing header. This might mean consulting a professional contractor.;
, Look for switches or electric outlets on the wall. Use a stud finder with a wire-finding feature, which should be available and affordable at most hardware stores, to check for electrical wiring. If you have attic and basement access, wiring can usually be rerouted. However, if you find pipes in the wall, this usually means that you can't put a pocket door there.

, Use a reciprocating saw with a metal-cutting blade to cut through the nails in order to remove the door jamb.

, Be careful to keep the cut shallow. Take out the section of drywall which is above the door in order to frame the new header.


Use a section of 2 by 4 (5.08 by 10.16cm) as the new header. This will need to be 1 inch (2.54 cm) more than twice the length of the pre-existing header, since it will need to span the distance of the entire rough opening.
When you're replacing a header in a load-bearing wall, it is recommended that you use 2 by 12's (5.08 by 30.48 cm) for the new header.
Be sure that your saw is safety-rated for wood containing nails. Tilt the door out of the opening.

, This will create a gap, which you can use to access the shims. Saw through the cluster of nails surrounding the shims.

, Remove the drywall from above the header leaving a margin of about 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62cm) of drywall under the ceiling.

, Cut away the studs making enough room for the pocket door's framing. Cut the nails joining the studs to the soleplate (the piece of framing which runs along the bottom of the wall).

,


Generally, a 1 by 4 (2.54 by 10.16cm) plate will enable the door to clear the carpeting without cutting it. If there is no carpet, the brackets of most door kits can be installed directly into the floor.

, Measure the rough opening and put the new stud in at the same distance as the stud which is in the opposite side.

Attach any cripple studs.",How to Frame a Doorway," Since doors come in so many different dimensions, you’ll first have to decide the type of door you want to install. Most doors are going to be 30” or 32” wide and 80” tall; however, this is far from universal.Choosing a door will allow you to make all of the proper measurements for the doorway.


If you haven’t decided on an exact style of door, at least decide on an exact size, so you can get started on the doorway. Write down the dimension of the door size you decide on for reference.;
, If you’re deciding where the door will go while framing the rest of the wall, then you can easily insert the doorway into the wall framing. Walls typically have studs placed every 16” in the top plate and bottom plate that frames the way. Decide on the location of your door in the wall and skip the studs that would block the door while still maintaining the 16” gaps on either side., In place of the missing studs around the doorway, you’ll insert what are called king studs. These are regular studs, but instead of the normal 16” apart, they go directly on either side of the doorframe. The distance between your king studs will be the width of the door you chose as well as an additional 5”.If 5” seems like a lot, it’s because another stud called a trimmer stud will be inserted on each side between the king studs and the door as well., Measure this space by placing the king stud and trimmer stud measurements together and marking the space where each stud begins and ends on both the top and bottom wall frame plates. Mark the space for the king stud with a K and the trimmer stud with a T for easy reference., If your wall frame already has a bottom plate running the entire length, you’ll have to remove the portion that would block the door. Use the exterior edge of your mark for the trimmer stud on the bottom plate where the trimmer stud ends and the doorway begins.Only cut halfway through for now to give the frame continued stability while you finish the rest of the doorway., The header goes above the doorway to provide additional support to the doorway since it doesn’t have the regular distribution of wall studs. The header goes directly between the king studs, so the length needs to be the same door-width-plus-5” measurement that you used to place the king studs. Since the bottom of the header marks the top of the doorframe, you need to measure the vertical placement by taking the height of the door and adding 2” for jambs and flooring.For example, if you have an 80” door, then you’d mark the placement of the bottom of header on the king stud 82” from the bottom (not the top) of the bottom wall plate.Notice that the header width measurement does not include the trimmer studs. That’s because the trimmer studs actually attach to the bottom of the header and not the top wall plate. To picture it, the king stud and trimmer stud will form an L around each side of the header with the king stud as the vertical line and the trimmer stud as the horizontal line. Since your trimmer studs will attach to the bottom wall plate on the bottom and header on top, they should be 80.5” long for an 80” door (the 82” height from the bottom of the header minus the 1.5” width of the bottom plate since planed 2x4s are actually 1.5” wide).

, The header is actually comprised of two boards (either 2x4 or 2x6) with a 0.5” piece of plywood or OSB board sandwiched between them. Measure each board to the door-width-plus-5” specification and cut them evenly.The 0.5” piece of plywood or OSB board is simple to explain. Each planed 2x4 wall stud is actually 1.5”x3.5”, so the depth of the doorframe is 3.5”. However, sandwiching two of those planed 2x4s (or 2x6s) together only creates a 3” deep header. The additional 0.5” board is to make the header flush with the rest of the doorframe.

, Nail the three boards together perfectly aligned to ensure that they fit snugly between the king studs. Use 12D nails to assemble the header., If the space between your header and the top plate of the wall frame has a gap, then you can measure that gap and cut short lengths of 2x4 called cripples to add additional support between the header and top plate., Since you previously marked the height of the bottom of the header on the king studs, you can now line the header up with those marks and nail it to the king studs. Use at least four 12D nails on each side., Using the marks on the top and bottom wall plates where you previously placed a K for the king studs, attach the plates to the king studs.Again, use 12D nails.


Make sure that each connection is flush and perfectly perpendicular as you go.
If you are building the frame for the entire wall while framing the doorway, then this is also the point where you will install the rest of the wall studs.

, Now that the header, king studs, and bottom wall plate are together, you can install the trimmer studs. If you have not yet cut the trimmer studs, double check your measurement by measuring from the bottom of the header board to the top of the bottom wall plate. Using 12D nails, nail the trimmer studs from the bottom of the wall plate as well as to the king studs.When nailing to the king studs, nail from the trimmer stud into the king stud, so that in the event of any protruding nails, they’re inside the wall rather than inside the doorframe., Your half cuts in the bottom wall plate should now be flush with the edge of the trimmer studs. Finish cutting away this portion of the bottom wall plate so that the space remains flush with the trimmer studs.

, Now that you have the rest of the doorway framed, you can attach any last cripple studs if you had a gap between your header and wall top plate."

Decide whether to buy a frame or build one.,
Know what lumber to purchase.,
Determine the size of the door.,
Determine the size of the door opening.,
Cut the studs and sill plate to the width required.,
Cut the door header.",How to Frame a Door Opening1," Building your own door frame can save some money, provided you have the time, skills and tools to do the job correctly. If you are uncertain, it is usually much easier to buy a pre-made door frame assembly or prehung door unit. Usually such pre-made products are not much more expensive, and will save you time and potential headaches.

, Determine the size of the framing members in the wall you are framing the door in. Wood studs are most often 2x4 nominal size, but 2x6 and other size studs are also used in residential framing. You can purchase the lumber you need at a lumberyard or home improvement warehouse store.









In terms of the best type of wood to use for the frame, feel free to choose lumber based on aesthetics rather than strength. Interior doors and frames are not exposed to the same harsh elements as exterior ones, so your main concern should be picking a type of wood that you like and which goes well with the door you're planning to hang on it.
Common wood types used for interior frames are:

Alder
Fir
Birch
Pine (the most popular)



, Normal, single interior doors are 22"" - 42"" wide and 6' 8"" tall. Take into consideration what types and sizes of items you will be placing in the room. For example if the door leads to a laundry area, make sure the door will be large enough to fit a washer and dryer through, and preferably 36"" wide.








, The size of the door opening will vary depending on the size of the door you plan to install. A typical door opening is 2 inches (5.1 cm) wider than the door size being installed to allow for the thickness of the jamb material and shims to plumb the jamb.









Measure your door carefully and cut the opening to fit using a reciprocating saw.
Make the opening the width of the door plus 2 inches (5.1 cm), and if additional studs are needed, a space for these, as well.

, Never cut a wall top plate! The boards secured in an upright position along the sides of the frame are referred to as studs., and are used to support the wall. The board that transverses the top of the studs is called the top plate.









To make the studs, measure the height of the door to be installed. Cut 2x4s to the height of the door plus 1 1/2 inches (5.1 cm) to allow room for the top of the frame and allowance for leveling the jamb.
To make the door header, cut 2x4s to the width of the original opening.
A ""king stud"" is one that runs continuously from the top plate (usually a double plate) to the bottom plate.
The ""jack stud"" is nailed to the king stud, but it's shorter as it supports the door header.

, To make the door header (the top of the door frame), cut two 2x4s to the same length as the width of the original opening and nail them securely together. 








You will need to add 1/2"" of plywood between the 2x4's to get the right wall thickness of 3-1/2"". This is the nominal size of a 2x4.

Remove the sole plate.",How to Frame a Door Opening2," Nail the top plate through the ceiling into the ceiling joists or blocking using 12D nails.







, Nail the sole plate to the floor, driving the nails into the floor joists or blocking.









Don't nail the sole plate to the floor between the jack stud locations because this portion of the plate will be removed before the door is installed.
Use Tapcon screws (or other appropriate fastener) to insert the sole plate., Use 12D nails to nail the king studs in place. Drive the nails at an angle to make a toe-nailed joint, or you can attach the studs with metal connectors.







, Position the jack studs against the inside of the king studs, and nail them in place.







, Take two 2x4s that are cut to a length that equals the width of the original door opening. Use them to make a header that will sit above the door. Once in position, nail these header pieces together to secure. The header should fit between the king studs and sit snugly atop the jack studs.







, Measure and cut one (or two depending on the width of your door) studs to fit between the header and the top plate. This is a cripple stud. Use a toenail to secure the cripple studs to both the header below them and to the plate above them.







, Saw through the 2x4 sole plate at the inside edges of the jack studs. Remove the cut portion of the plate.

Check to see if the screws in the hinge plate are tight.,
Lift the door by grasping both handles and gently putting upward pressure.,
Examine the door and the doorjamb to determine where the door is rubbing.,
Swing the door back and forth to see if it is rubbing against the carpet or making marks on the floor.

,
Mark the door with a pencil at the spot that it rubs.

,

Apply masking tape to the door before cutting or sanding.,
Use sandpaper, a belt sander, or circular saw to remove the area where the door rubs.,
Rehang the door, and check for rubbing.,
Remove the tape.

,
Touch up the door with paint, stain, or varnish if needed.

",How to Fix a Rubbing Door," Give them a little twist with a ratcheting screwdriver.;
, Check to see if this relieves the rubbing. If it does, tighten the hinge screws with a ratcheting screwdriver. You may use a drill with a screwdriver head attachment, but you need to be careful not to overdrive the screws and break or strip them.

, Look for paint that has been worn away by the door. Use a stepladder to look at the top of the door.

,,, You may need someone to help you catch the door.

, This will help reduce the chance of the face of the door chipping.

, Sandpaper can be used for small rubbing problems, while the belt sander or circular saw are ideal for more extreme door-sticking issues. Be careful not to cut the door too deep or too far. Interior doors are often hollow with only 1 inch (2.54 cm) of wood to stabilize the door. Do not remove more than 1/4 to 1/2 of an inch (.64 to 1.27 cm) of wood. If your door is a solid wood door, you have more leeway in regards to how much wood you can remove.

, You may have to remove the door several times to keep it from rubbing; however, this is better than taking too much off.

Choose material for weather stripping your windows.,
Clean the surfaces of your window with soap and water to get rid of any dirt or grime.,
Cut the weather stripping material in lengths of approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) longer than the height of your window sash.,
Place 1 end of the window strip behind the window sash.,
Peel the tape from the back of the adhesive, and press it firmly into place behind the window sash.

,
Measure the length of the horizontal part of the window where it meets the ledge, and cut a section of the weather stripping to match that length.

,

,
Inspect the window thoroughly, and look for any gaps in the weather stripping.,
Measure the outside perimeter of the window, and cut 4 strips that match the length of each side.,
Remove the adhesive tape, and again press the weather stripping firmly into place along the outside perimeter of the window.

",How to Fix a Drafty Window," According to most experts, self-adhesive weather stripping is the best option. It is easy to install and is the most effective at keeping cold air out.;
, This will help the adhesive stick better and longer to the window.

, This process is called ""sealing the channel.""

, Repeat this until you have covered the upper and lower sash channels.

,,,, Pay attention to the top of the upper sash, the vertical portion of the window frame that make up the windows sides, and the bottom of the lower sash and sill. Cut and place weather stripping on any areas that are not covered.

, Refer to your window manufacturer's installation guide for exact instructions on how to apply. If you do not have these instructions, many can be found online.

Check your strike plate.,
Check the hinges.,
Adjust the hinge.",How to Fix a Door1," The strike plate, or metal piece on the jam where the door latches, might be placed too low or too high. This should always be the first thing you check when identifying a door that's not closing correctly. Look for marks on the strike plate that show the latch going above or below the hole. If you see these marks, use a metal file to file down the hole of the strike plate to make it lower or higher so that the latch can go in.;
, If that wasn't your problem, then the problem is probably with your hinges. They are probably uneven, with one being too far in or out from the jam. Close the door as much as possible and look for uneven lines. The gaps all around the door should be the same all the way across (along the hinge line, at the top of the door, bottom of the door, and on the side of the door with the latch).

, The easiest option is the just adjust the center hinge, but you'll probably want to adjust either the top or the bottom hinge depending on the situation, since this should have the most impact. No matter which hinge you need to fix, the process is the same. Unscrew that hinge so that you can access the jam behind it. Cut a piece of milk carton or thin cardboard to the shape of the hinge recess and place it there. Return the hinge flap and screw it into place.


Usually, if there's a gap on the top latch side, you'll need to adjust the bottom hinge. If the door is bumping up against the top latch side of the jam, you'll need to adjust the top hinge.

"

Gather your tools.,
Remove the center hinge pin.,
Place your paper.,
Reinsert the pin.,
Test the door.,
Adjust as necessary.",How to Fix a Door2," You'll need a hammer, a screwdriver, and a strip of paper.

, Place the screwdriver at the bottom of the hinge pin and use the hammer to tap the bottom of the hinge pin until it comes up out of the hinge.

, Fold your strip of paper until it is about .5-1 cm wide, and just a bit longer than the hinge. Place the paper in the hinge pinhole and fold the top down just a bit so that the paper stays in place.

, Put the pin back in the hinge. This may take some hammer tapping.

, Test to see if the door now stays open when you open it. The paper should make the hinge tighter, keeping the door where you place it.

, If one piece of paper doesn't work, you might need two. You may also need to put paper in the other hinges as well. Experiment until you get your door working the way you want.

Get some gun oil.,
Remove the hinge pins one at a time.,
Apply the oil.,
Replace the pin.,
Continue until all the hinges are oiled.",How to Fix a Door3," You can use other greases and oils too, but those are not usually intended for metal and result in the metal of the hinge degrading over time. Gun oil is best, since it is designed for use on metal.

, You want to avoid having to take the door completely off the hinges, so just remove one hinge pin at a time and don't remove it the whole way. You just need access to the first inch or two. Do this by tapping the bottom of the pin with a screwdriver and hammer until the pin pops up.


You may need a helper or something to prop up the door with if it becomes unstable with the hinges partway out.

, With part of the hinge pin exposed, brush on a little of the gun oil with an old paintbrush or a cloth. It doesn't take much, so don't make a mess!

, Tap the hinge pin back into place and work the door back and forth so that the oil works its way down. Clean up any extra with a piece of tissue.

, Do each of the hinges in turn until they're all fixed.

Cut the edges.,
Add a support.,
Fill with spray foam insulation.,
Spackle the remaining hole.,
Sand the surface.,
Paint the surface.",How to Fix a Door4," These instructions are for a hollow core door, although you can adjust them to patch solid wood doors with small chips. For a hollow door, use a sharp utility knife to cut the rough edges of the hole so that it has a clean edge which is beveled towards you.

, Crumple some paper or place another supporting material just below the hole of the door. This will keep the filler material from dripping down the inside of the door.

, Purchase some aerosol foam insulation. Only one can should be needed. Fill the hole completely and continue until there is a bubble of foam extending out of the hole as well. When it's dry, use the utility knife to cut off the material outside the door by placing the blade flush with the door's surface and cutting downward.


The low-expansion foam will work best for this purpose but it's possible to use another kind if your choices are limited.

, Generously apply Spackle to the remaining hole area. Once it's applied, use a putty knife wider than the hold itself to remove the excess.

, Once it's dry, sand down the surface until it's smooth using 100 grit sandpaper.

, Paint the surface of the door and it should look brand new! Giving the whole thing a base coat and then single top coat will create the most uniform appearance but it's necessary.

Before anything else, the old door must be removed. Depending on your hinges and whether or not you want to reuse them, there are two possible approaches to this


If you don't want to reuse the old hinges, or if they don't have removable pins, you'll need to not only unscrews the door from the hinges, but also the hinges from the frame.
If you have hinges with removable pins and you want to reuse them, you can save yourself some steps later by just removing the pins that hold the hinges together. This will allow you to remove the door but leave one part of the hinges attached to the door frame. Start with the top hinge and work your way down. Then, take the door down and remove the hinge parts that are affixed to it.
If the pin won't come out easily, tap it gentle from below with a hammer and screwdriver.;
, Using a measuring tape, measure the height and width of the inside edge of the door opening and saddle board.


If the doorway is in place where there is a transition between different types of flooring and the floor is of two different heights, measure the high side, as this may necessitate trimming the bottom of the door more.If the old door was a good fit, you may find it easier to measure the door itself.

, Find a door you like that is close in size to your opening. You will be trimming the door, so you don't need to worry about it being exactly the right size.

, Use a pencil to apply the measurements equally on both sides of the door so as not to take too much off one side. Repeat this process for the top and bottom.


Doing all the trimming on one side is is bad practice and may result in the door looking wider on one side than the other.
A good rule of thumb would be to allow a 2mm gap on the two sides and top and allow a gap of 8mm between the saddle board and the bottom of the door.If you think the door you bought is already a perfect fit, you can ""dry fit"" the door, standing it up in the space. It should fit as specified above, except that that the large gap will be at the top.

, Score your pencil marks with a utility knife to prevent the wood from splintering. Then, use a circular saw and cut off the excess wood, using a straightedge to guide the saw.Placing tape over the cut line can also reduce splintering.If removing less than 3/16 of an inch, use a hand plane rather than a circular saw.
Bevel the edges of the door two to three degrees where it hits the stop so the door will clear the jamb smoothly., Place the door into the frame and see if it fits. Remember there should be a gap of 2mm (about the width of a nickel) around the sides and top and a gap of 8mm on the bottom.


An easy way to check the top and bottom is to sit the door on the floor. The gap at the top should now be 10mm (2mm top+8mm bottom). If the door does not meet these requirements the further planing is required.

, If using new hinges, check to see if they will fit in the spaces where the old hinges were. If they don't, rest them so the bottom lines up with the old hinge mortises (recesses), and mark the door frame along the top of the hinge.Then, chisel out the additional space to widen your hinge mortises.

, The easiest way to do do this, if the old door was a good fit, is to lay the new door on top of the old door so the edges are flush. Then, line up a combination square with the old door's hinge mortises and transfer their locations to the new door, marking the edges with a utility knife.Remember that the barrel/pivot of the hinge is on the pull side of the door. If you are replacing an old door you should refit the hinges so they are facing the same way as the old one.
If the old door was not a good fit or is too different in size from the new door, place the new door in the frame and use shims around the edges to set it in place. Then, using the mortises in the frame, mark the door where the hinge mortises will need to be made in order to line up.The advantage of this method is that you can also mark the latch-hole at this point for easier installation of the doorknob.

, Lay a protective pad on the floor and support the door on its side. Then carefully extract the surplus wood from the door until you have reached the required thickness.First, hold the chisel vertically and tap it with a hammer to outline the edges of the mortise. Then, make a series of closely spaced cuts that are about as deep as the thickness of the hinge. Finally, hold the chisel at a low angle with its beveled face flat against the wood and lightly tap the chisel with the hammer, chipping away the wood in small pieces., Create a mortise for the plate around the latch on your door using the technique described above. Then, use a drill to make the necessary holes for installation of your doorknob/door handle and lock.This process will vary somewhat based on the doorknob you are installing. Follow the instructions that came with your door handle.

, Set the hinge into the mortise and use and centering punch to make starting divots for the screws. Then, screw the hinges to the door and ensure the hinges and the screw heads are flush.If you are using hinges with removable pins, you can take the hinge apart and just attach one side to the door. In this case, attach the other side of the hinge to the door frame, and proceed to the next step. Otherwise, skip to step two of the next section.

, If you are using hinges with removable pins and already have half of the hinge affixed to the door frame, interlace the knuckles of the two sides of each of the hinges and put the pins back in place once they are aligned.This will be much easier if you have assistant who can replace the pins.
Check to see if the door is swinging smoothly. If so, proceed to the final step.

, If your hinges don't come apart, your next step will be to support the door at a right angle to the frame. Place shims beneath it so that it reaches the proper height for the hinges to line up with the frame mortises.If the holes on the new hinge line up with the holes that were used to mount the old door, you can just screw the hinges to the frame. If not, you'll need to make divots in the frame with a center punch.
It's a good idea to start by only driving in one screw per hinge. Then you can check to see if the door swings easily. If so, drive in the other screws. If not, remove the screws and adjust the position of the hinges as necessary., If your door is swinging easily, it is now time to install your doorknob/handle and lock. This process will vary depending on the door handle you've chosen. Refer to the instructions that came with your doorknob.

Determine what kind of window or door you're dealing with; building codes in your area will likely require tempered glass in your storm windows and doors, but you may be able to use regular pane glass for inside (not storm) windows and doors.,
Remove the window from the casing if possible; take the door with the broken window off the hinges.,
Dispose of the broken glass.,
Remove any remaining old caulk with the putty knife.,
Carefully measure the width and length of the opening for the window.,
Go to your friendly neighborhood hardware store or home center and have them cut the glass.,
Insert the glass into the frame.,
Find the spots where the old glazier points were and put in new ones.

,
Prepare the glazing compound.,
Using the flat edge of the glaziers tool or putty knife, scoop off a section of putty from your hand and spread it into the ""shelf"" area at any point; best not to start in a corner.,
Corners.,
Once you've finished caulking the window, allow it to cure at least a day before cleaning up any spillage on the glass.,
Congratulations!",How to Fix a Broken Window in a Wooden Frame," Be sure to check local codes.;
, Replacing the glass is far easier if the window/door is laying flat on the work surface and is clamped down, caulked side of window facing up. If this isn't possible, you can replace the glass in place; make sure you have a solid footing and are at eye level with the upper third of the pane.

,


Wear protective gloves and remove the broken glass. Put it in a cardboard box or sturdy paper bag.

When all the glass is out of the frame, tape the box/bag up for disposal and mark it clearly ""Broken Glass."" Place the box/bag wherever your trash pickup might be.

Use a vacuum to clean up any small shards.

, You may need to heat it up with a heat gun to get it completely loose. Also remove any of the old glazier's points from the broken pane; it's a good idea to save them in case they're a different size from the modern points. Use the metal brush to get the surface as clean as possible.


Optional step: carefully brush linseed oil on the surfaces that will be holding the caulk. This extends the life of your caulk job, but it takes a day or more to dry, so plan your time accordingly.

,


Measure at both top and bottom to see if the window is plumb. If the shape of the window isn't square or rectangular, make a paper template.

There is a very narrow shelf-type area that the glass lays on; there may also be one side, usually the top, slotted to receive the glass. Remember, you're measuring where the glass lays, not the visual opening.

, The replacement glass should fit on the ""shelf"" from side to side and top to bottom fairly snugly, but to allow for expansion and contraction, have the glass cut up to 1/8"" (.31 cm) smaller on the top and one side.

,


With the frame secured to a flat surface and the bottom of the window closest to you, hold the glass at a slight angle top to bottom.

Guide the whole pane slowly on the ""shelves"" and work toward the top. When you're just about there, carefully lay the glass almost flat, then guide it as you slide it into the groove at the top of the window. You may need to use one hand on top of the glass, the other on the bottom.

,,


Open the compound can and put a lump about half the size of a tennis ball (use more when you get the hang of it) into your left hand (right if you're left handed).

Work it until it's soft and warm. You may have to replenish the supply in your hand more than once, depending on the size of the window.

, Using the knife or tool at an angle, smooth the putty along the shelf.
Be sure that the putty doesn't show from the other side of the window, that is, the width of your putty shouldn't be greater than the shelf width. Continue spreading and smoothing until the sides are covered.

, These can be tricky. Just remember that water will slide down the window and the caulking will guide the water away from the glass. You want the corners to be mitered, but smoothly mitered. Use the angled end of the glaziers tool.

, You'll need to wait up to a week for the putty to cure enough to hold paint.

, You've now saved yourself about five times the cost of having the glass replaced by a professional.

Remove the old doors.,
Remove the old tracks.,
Clean up the area.,
Install a floor liner.,
Measure the space for the doors.,
Buy doors.,
Cut the tracks to size.,
Install the top track.,
Install the bottom track, if needed.,
Fit the rear sliding door.,
Fit the front sliding door.,
Adjust the rollers.",How to Fit Sliding Wardrobe Doors," If you want to install completely new sliding doors, then start by removing the old doors and tracks. Lift up on the old doors until the rollers come off the track. Angle them toward you as you lower the top guide away from the top track.






;
, Unscrew the old tracks and pry them off if necessary. For wooden tracks coated with paint, use a utility knife at the edge of the track. This will stop the adjacent paint from potentially peeling up with the track.







, Remove any leftover debris. Precision measurements are essential for proper installation.








, If the closet space has carpeting or a rug that sits right next to the door, you should install a floor liner.These inexpensive liners fit beneath the bottom track. They keep carpeting or rugs from binding the door rollers.









If you decide to install a floor liner beneath the bottom track, set it in place before you measure to ensure accurate measurements.

, Before you even buy doors, measure the space because not all doors are created equal. Take a horizontal measurement from the edge of the left wall to the edge of the right wall. Take a vertical measurement from the floor (or liner) up to the top of the space.








Since the height from one end of the closet to the other can differ, take the height measurement at the middle and each end of the opening. Use the smallest of the measurements.
Measure twice and write the measurements down to take with you.
If the top of your closet space has a fascia (a decorative, overhanging accent piece), then make sure you take your measurement behind the fascia where you will install the track.If you have an existing track system that’s in good shape, be sure that it will work with the new doors.

, Using your measurements, buy doors for the space. Most door sets come with corresponding tracks (typically made of aluminum) that you can cut to size. The actual rollers on the doors typically have an adjustable screw to change the lift of the roller. Look at the variance figures on the doors to ensure they’ll fit your space.









The combined width of the doors should equal the width of the space plus approximately 1”. This will give the doors 1/2” of overlap, ensuring you do not end up with a gap between the doors.If you buy tracks separately from the doors, remember that most tracks come sized for 1-3/8” thick doors.Thicker doors may need special-sized tracks.

, You will likely need to trim the tracks that come with the doors down to size. Measure twice and cut once to ensure you don’t cut too much off the tracks.









The width of the closet opening can vary from top to bottom, so measure the width at both spots to ensure you cut each track to the proper length.Most tracks are aluminum. You can easily make the cut with a hacksaw or any type of electrical saw. If using an electric saw, always wait until the blade is spinning before cutting metal. , Since the rollers on the doors do not align perfectly with the guide on the top track, you must install the top track slightly farther back on most doors. This adjustment is tiny—approximately 5/16”.The exact adjustment will vary based on your chosen doors, so follow the instructions with your doors carefully when screwing the top track into place.








, Most sliding doors don’t have a bottom track. If they do, though, first set your bottom track in place. Then use the pre-drilled holes to screw the track down to the floor. If your space has carpeting over a concrete slab, then put a piece of masking tape on the carpet before setting down the track. Mark the tape by poking a pen or pencil through the pre-drilled hole. Then use the marking on the tape to drill your pilot hole through the carpet into the slab before screwing the track down.








Be careful if you’re drilling through carpet. The drill bit can easily catch and unwind carpet loops. In fact, it’s smart to cut out a small section of the carpet slightly bigger than the bit.

, Since the doors will overlap slightly, you will need to fit the rear door before the front door. To install, lift the top of the door into the rear track guide at a slight angle, and then tilt the bottom into place. Ensure that the rollers properly align in the rear bottom track.







, Once you have the rear door in place, use the same process as in the previous step to install the front door.








, The rollers at the bottom of each door typically have an adjustable screw to slightly raise the door. Adjust the door height to raise the door, which will give a bit more clearance for the rollers and keep the wheels from binding with carpet.








Some designs will snap the rollers into place along the track as you adjust the height screw.Other sliding door designs may have a small switch on the roller assembly that locks the roller into the bottom track.Follow the directions on your specific doors.

Consider whether an air-tight door is suitable for your needs.,
Understand what air-tight doors can provide for your home.,
Consider where it is best to place air-tight doors in your home.",How to Decide Whether to Use Airtight Doors in Your Home," An air-tight door though is not a very recent or novel concept, its importance has enhanced due to the changes in the environmental conditions. With growing noise and air pollution becoming a regular part of our daily life, an air-tight door can also reduce noise levels.
, As already stated above, an air-tight door can prevent dust and smoke from coming in, and can serve as an air trap. Some other uses are as follows:

Thermal insulation: Air-tight doors are ideal thermal insulators for any room because they do not let the outside prevailing temperature affect the inside temperature.
Water penetration: Using air-tight doors can stop water from entering, thereby preventing many common problems arising due to the penetration of water, such as mold, fungus, insects, etc.
Acoustic silencing: The peace usually needed for concentration and sleep can be marred by the growing amount of noise in the atmosphere, finding its way into our rooms even though the normal doors are shut. When the doors are air-tight, once the door is closed, nothing can hamper the peace and work can progress in a very silent manner.
Smoke and air resistant: Air-tight doors have the ability to resist smoke and air from outsides and help maintain freshness inside.

,

Use to keep air-conditioning constant inside, so use in rooms that receive the benefits of cooling or heating that is circulated; this will help to keep an even temperature maintained
Use for the study, for a work-from-home space, for bedrooms
Use to keep the noise of the games room or playroom from the rest of the house!

Begin at a practical starting point.,
Remove any old caulk from around the window frames.,
Prepare the surface of the windows.,
Place the tube in the caulk gun.,
Cut the tip of the tube.,
Press the tip firmly against one corner of the window and apply caulk to the next corner in a continuous bead, just thick enough to fill the gap.,
Use an object to smooth over the sealant and remove excess caulk.,
Allow the caulk to dry for at least 24 hours.",How to Caulk Windows," How many windows need to be caulked? Is there damage to the window casings that also may prevent a good seal? Determine how many windows need to be worked on and how much time each one will require before you begin this project. For reasons that will become clear, timing is important. You must have a sense of how long this project will take.






;
, If you don't already have one, you will need a caulking gun (a tool that pushes the caulk out of its tube). You may also need materials to repair your window frames if they are rotting (if wooden) or damaged. However, the biggest decision you need to make regarding materials pertains to the type of caulk you choose.There are a number of varieties, and each has attributes that make it suitable for certain situations.








Acrylic latex caulk is not responsive to temperature changes--i.e., it will not flex or expand as it clings to the bonded materials. It is also not as durable in moist environments. It can be painted over, but in most places it is really not suitable as a caulk for window frames.
Siliconized latex caulks have better adhesive properties than acrylics. The best quality siliconized latex caulks are also used as sealants in bathrooms because of the resistance to moisture. Like acrylic latex caulks, siliconized latex products can be painted over.
Silicone caulk (different from siliconized latex) is considered one of the most durable caulks available. It is used as a sealant in a wide variety of places, and is especially noted for its water resistance. However, it does not seal as well to wood, and certain varieties even encourage metal corrosion. If you do have difficulties with it, you may be out of luck after you have applied it; it is very difficult to remove. Also, most varieties cannot be painted over.Polyurethane caulks are considered to be high-quality outdoor sealants, and especially good at sealing together surfaces of different types (such as metal and wood or wood and glass). It is considered relatively easy to work with, but if used outdoors they must be painted over because polyurethanes are not ultra-violet resistant and could break down in the sun. They also are one of the more expensive varieties, and that may be significant if you have a large number of windows to caulk., If you are caulking or recaulking all of the window frames of your house, understand that it is a substantial project. It is also one that requires the right weather conditions. Exterior caulk should be applied when the temperature is at least 45 °F (7 °C), and it is also best if the humidity is low. The caulk may take 24 hours or more to dry, and wild temperature swings or rainstorms can ruin a hard day's work.







, Choose a window that is safely accessible on the ground floor then move on to the upper levels where you may need to climb a ladder.








, You will get the best possible seal by creating two clean surfaces for the new caulk to attach itself. After the largest pieces are removed, use a putty knife to remove any remaining bits of the material.








, Repair any rotted wood or damage on or around the window before applying caulk. Remove any dirt, debris, and old paint that will hinder adhesion. Wash the area, but make sure it is dry before caulk is applied.








, Pull the notched rod back. Place the tip of the tube in the yoke. Turn the rod so that the notching mechanism engages. Squeeze the handle just enough to move the plunger cup securely against the end of the tube, inside the cylinder.







, Cut it at a 45 degree angle about a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) back from the tip. Use a slender nail to break the seal inside the tip.







, Press the release mechanism to stop the flow of caulk. Continue around all 4 sides.








, This process is referred to as ""tooling."" Some people use a popsicle stick or a rag over their finger (some also advocate use of an exposed finger, but that is inadvisable for certain varieties of caulk).







, Though a ""skin"" will develop before it has fully hardened, the caulk may still be unstable and should be left alone. As long as it gets a chance to dry in place, your project will be a success.

Determine the placement of your valance.,
Nail four L-brackets onto the wall.,
Make holes in the valance for the brad fasteners.,
Secure the valance to the brackets using brad fasteners.",How to Create Window Valances from Cardboard Boxes," Most valances are about 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) tall and 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) deep.If you have a curtain rod, you may want to make the valance 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) deep instead. The valance can be the same width as your window (including the outer edges) of the molding or a few inches wider., Unless your box already matches the dimensions of your desired valance, you will need to cut a box apart at the corners and flatten it into a large sheet. Use a box cutter to slice through the tape at the bottom of your box, then down one of the corners. This should allow you to unfold and spread the box flat.

, You will need a total of three rectangles: a front panel and two side panels. Try to draw everything on a box face/panel and not across a corner or seam. Here are the pieces you need to cut:


Use the width and height to draw the front panel.
Use the height and depth to draw the two side panels.

, Use a metal ruler or straight edge to help you cut the rectangles. This will give you a straighter line and more professional-looking finish., Set the front panel down in front of you. Place the top panel right above it, long edges touching. Place the two side panels to either side of the front panel. Lay down long strips of duct tape or packaging tape across the seams.

, Flip the valance over so that you can't see the tape anymore. Fold one of the side panels towards you until it is at a 90-degree angle to the front panel. Run a thick line of hot glue along the seam, then hold the panel until the glue sets. Repeat for the other side.


The hot glue will help the valance hold its shape.

, Measure the entire length of your valance, including the side panels, and add 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) Measure the height of your valance and add 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) as well. Cut a rectangle out of fabric according to those measurements. You will need the extra fabric so that you can wrap it over the edges of te valance., You don't need to add any batting, but it will give your valance a nicer finish. Cut some batting or felt to fit your valance. It needs to be the same length as your valance (including the side panels) and 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) taller.


If you are using contact paper, it is not recommended that you add the batting.

, Place your valance on top of the batting, making sure that there is 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) to the top and bottom. Wrap the edges of the batting over the top edge of your valance and glue it in place. Repeat for the bottom.You are not wrapping anything over the side edges of the side panels. This way, the valance will be flush against the wall.
You can use fabric glue or hot glue for this step. If you choose to use hot glue, work 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) at a time so that the glue doesn't set too fast.

, Turn your fabric over so that the wrong side is facing you. Place your valance on top, batting-side-down. Make sure that the valance is centered, with 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of fabric to the top and bottom., Brush some glue onto the top edge of the valance, right next to the batting. Fold the fabric over the top edge and into the glue. Continue gluing the fabric down across the top edge of the valance, then do the bottom edge., By now, the top and bottom edges of your fabric should be wrapped over the top and bottom edges of your valance. You should have about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of fabric sticking out over the side edges of you valance. Choose a side to start with, then fold the corners down, like wrapping a present., Apply some more glue to the back of the valance, right next to the batting. Keeping the corners folded, wrap the fabric over the side edge of the valance, and press it into the glue.When you are done, fold and wrap the other side edge of the valance as well.

, Have someone hold the valance against the wall for you, then make a small mark to either side of the valance. Make sure that you are making the marks on the inside of the valance and not on the outside.

, Make sure that the edge of the bracket is aligned with the marks that you made. You will only need two bracket on each side of your window, one set for the top of your valance, and another for the bottom., Because of how thin cardboard is, you won't be able to nail it to the L-brackets. Place the valance over the L-brackets and make a mark through the screw holes with a pen or pencil. Remove the valance, then use a skewer to poke holes into the valance. Be sure to poke through the fabric., Place the valance over the brackets once more. Insert a brad through one of the holes in the valance. Spread the prongs out over the bracket. Repeat with the remaining brads and bracket holes.Try to use heavy-duty upholstery brads. Craft grade brads may not be strong or long enough.

Rinse off dirt and debris with clean water.,
Create a cleaning mixture with non-detergent soap and warm water.,
Wipe down the surface with a microfiber towel.,
Rinse the surface thoroughly with clean water.,
Dry the surface completely with a soft absorbent cloth.",How to Clean Vinyl Windows1," Vinyl windows can be easily scratched and discolored, so caution is needed when cleaning them. Use fresh, clean water to rinse off any loose particles and dirt from the surface by gently pouring water from a pitcher or wringing it out of a clean wet rag. Avoid wiping debris-covered windows without rinsing them first.To avoid scratching, you should also remove any rings, bracelets and watches you’re wearing before you begin. These can puncture the vinyl.Avoid cleaning the glass in direct sunlight.;
, Mix together ¼ cup (30 milliliters) of mild, non-detergent soap (such as Woolite, Dreft or Murphy Oil Soap) and a gallon (3.79 liters) of warm water in a large bucket.Never use alcohol or ammonia based products, Windex, dishwashing detergents or any other cleaning products that contain abrasive chemicals.
If used, these substances will damage the vinyl (and most likely void your warranty, as well)., Dip a microfiber towel into the bucket of cleaning solution, then wring it out. Wipe the surface with the microfiber cloth, working from left to right (or right to left) consistently. As you wipe, use very little pressure to avoid scratching. Work quickly; don’t allow the cleaning solution to sit on the surface for any longer than necessary.Never use paper towels, household sponges or other abrasive cloths to wipe down the panel. These materials will scratch the surface., After wiping the panels down with the cleaning mixture, take a clean microfiber cloth and soak it with fresh, clean water. Wipe the surface down thoroughly to rinse away the cleaning solution. Work from left to right (or right to left) consistently as you rinse the surface.Never use a high pressure nozzle to rinse off your windows., To prevent water spots from developing, use another lint-free cloth to dry the surface thoroughly. Make sure you use a soft absorbent cloth or towel to avoid scratching the panels."

Attach the blocks to the doorway.",How to Arch a Doorway," If your home has more than 1 visible doorway, you should consider the effect if only 1 is arched. For a more uniformed pattern, think about converting all of the doorways into arches. Decide the type of arch you want to construct.
, Determine the right tools necessary for the job to be completed. A drill and reciprocal saw are essential. Gather everything together in 1 place in order to save time and money by avoiding return trips to the home improvement store. Make a list of every item you'll need.

Consult with the interior design specialist at the home improvement store. They should be available to help you with invaluable information on how to arch a doorway.
Decide between making an arched doorway from scratch, or installing a pre-built arched doorway kit, which could make the project easier, but also be more expensive.
Most pre-built arched doorway kits are made of wood, or a wood composite material. Starting from scratch, dry wall and framing lumber can be used.

, Clear the surrounding area of any furniture, wall décor, or rugs. Lay plastic sheeting down to prevent debris and paint from getting on the floor or nearby walls. Keep in mind that construction in the general area may produce dust. Cover any vents and furnishings before beginning the arch., Whether you are constructing the doorway arch from scratch or installing a kit, the framing is essentially the part underneath that keeps the arch intact. The frame can be elaborate, with successive parts that are different sizes. This is because the arch is thicker in some parts than others.

The easiest method of building a doorway arch frame is to use 2 triangular blocks that are squared at the top and side, and curved on the underside for the span of the arch.
Using a reciprocal saw, cut a curve out of a wood plank or plywood, about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. Use this as a template, and cut more as needed for the thickness of the doorway.
Glue together, side by side with carpenter's wood glue, aligning all pieces. Clamp tightly and allow to dry according to glue manufacturer's specifications. Repeat for the opposite side of doorway.

, After the glue has dried, fit 1 block into the top of the doorway. With a variable speed drill and screws, attach the block. Be sure the block is straight and snug in the top corner. Leave enough space to ensure the drywall covering is flush with the front of the doorway opening. Attach opposite block.

Finish out with drywall according to standard procedures. Match paint and clean up work area.

, Draw a diagram of a shelving unit with approximately 4 to 5 shelves, depending upon your preference.

If you believe there will not be space in your room for 5.5 inch (14 cm) shelves, you can make them more shallow. This will still give the effect of a bookshelf, but may only be suitable for knick knacks instead of books.
You will need to account for the fact that your top shelf pieces must be the exact width of the door, while your shelves will need to be 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) skinnier to account for 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) plywood on each side. Subtract 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) from the side shelf panels to account for the same measurement.

, Buy 2 to 3 sheets of 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) plywood. One home improvement source recommends using birch veneer plywood., You will need a work table and an outlet for a circular saw., When using a saw, you will need safety goggles and a breathing mask.

Use a long metal straight edge as you cut with a circular saw to ensure that the edges are uniform and straight., You will need to cut 4 or 5 shelves that are 5.5 inches (14 cm) across. Cut them to the right width first, before cutting them to the right length.

Remember to use your metal straight edge after you measure your width to keep your saw blade straight.

, It will also give the bookcase more support at the bottom., You will need 2 top frame pieces and 2 side frame pieces. Once you have used up the second piece of plywood, move on to the third piece., Attach a work stop to your craft table that is exactly the shelf width away from the blade. You will pull a piece of plywood across the saw's platform and it will automatically stop at the correct measurement, avoiding shelves of different widths.

A work stop is usually drilled into a work table with screws to secure it. You can find a work stop at a hardware store. Make sure to measure the shelf's width 3 times to ensure an accurate measurement.

, Then, cut the top and bottom shelf pieces to the right length."

Measure across the circular hole at its widest point, i.e. start at the bottom of the hole and pull the tape until you hit the top of the hole. There’s your diameter. Write down the number of inches that you see on a small notepad for reference.;
, The backset is space between your bore hole and the door's edge.Typically this is either 2 3/8 or 2 ¾ inches. Place your measuring tape on the center of the hole and pull it till you hit the door’s edge. Note this measurement on a notepad or post-it note.

, Start measuring at the left edge of the door until you reach the door's right edge. Note this measurement. Interior doors are often around 1 3/8 inches (3.5 cm) thick.Exterior doors usually measure about 1 3/4 inches (5 cm) thick. Make sure the door you will be placing the doorknob on is of average thickness; otherwise, you will need to purchase special hardware.

, Generally, locksets fall into two main categories: mortise and cylindrical. The former has a rectangular body that will glide into a similarly shaped pocket. The latter has a rotund body that slips into a bore hole and connects with the latch bolt. Mortise locksets are generally found in warehouses and industrial sites. Cylindrical locksets are used in a wider range of domestic,residential spaces than mortise locksets.There are also electronic locks, which function through the use of an electric current.You would generally use an electronic door knob for the exterior of your house. Generally, you can choose between a keypad or a key opening.

, These are usually used for rooms that do not need to be locked or closets. You would generally use a passage knob for storage and laundry rooms. For example, if you have a room in your basement that you use to store your stuff, you might use a passage knob for that door. Remember, these usually do not lock. In fact, they do not have keyed cylinders or locking mechanisms. , Privacy knobs are generally used for bedrooms and bathrooms. Privacy knobs have a locking mechanism located on the inside of the room. The main goal of a privacy knob is to prevent outside access. Sometimes these knobs have a button you can push located on the section of the doorknob that would be inside the room. You will probably also receive a pin or specialized key that can open the door from the outside.

, A “dummy” knob is a knob that does not have a formal function. It exists mainly for decorative purposes. It can be difficult to tell it apart from a door knob with a formal function.Dummy knobs are placed on the surface of doors, and do not penetrate the door. Dummy knobs are often used for closets and cabinets. For example, you might get a dummy knob for a wardrobe closet in your house or for double doors.

, This doorknob is placed on the outside of a door. You would generally use this for the entryway to your house. This doorknob has a locking mechanism called a deadbolt. A deadbolt uses a throw bolt that is pushed into the door jamb to solidly lock a door. The type of dead bolt you should choose will depend on how secure you want your door to be.


Buy a single cylinder deadbolt. This type of deadbolt’s usage will depend on the doorknob. You would open this doorknob with a key on the outside and a thumb turn on the inside. This is less secure than a double-cylinder because if there is an open window next to the door, you can reach in and open the door from the outside.
Buy a double cylinder deadbolt. This type of deadbolt is unlocked with a key on both sides. It cannot be opened by a robber who breaks your window and tries to open your door from the inside., Perhaps your doorknob is going to be used for your storage room, and you want a utilitarian design. Maybe, you may want a beautiful doorknob for every room of your house. Either way, you need to verify that you are choosing a style that matches the doorknob’s function. So avoid ornate styles that might impede a doorknob’s functionality. Conversely, you may want to go with a more decorative design for a knob that will be seen often.

, When you begin searching through doorknob listings or glancing at doorknobs in the store, you will probably notice that each doorknob has a distinct finish. Common doorknob finishes are white metal, brass, iron, bronze, satin nickel, chrome, and oil-rubbed bronze. Choosing a finish will depend on both aesthetic taste and location. For example, you may want to go with chrome bathroom doorknob because it is easy to clean.

, Once you have an idea of what you are looking for, shop for doorknobs in retailers that carry them. Try major chain stores such as Lowe's and Home Depot, or department stores such as Walmart and Sears. Check online for larger selections – the best prices are also often online. Search online retailers such as Amazon and eBay for new and used doorknobs. These sites will often offer free shipping and special deals. Check your local hardware store as well.

, Make sure you are able to return or exchange your doorknob if you do not like it, or if it does not fit your door. Ask if a warranty is included in the price.

Select the preferred number attachment type.,
Mark the position.",How to Attach Door Numbers1," You can choose between screw-on or adhesive numbers. It is a good idea to match them with other fittings already on the door, such as the doorknob and a postal flap.

, You can fit the door numbers anywhere you like, but it is standard to fit them in the centre of the door, halfway between the (Yale) lock and the top of the door.


It is recommended to measure the distance between the lock and the top of the door. From this point, mark the halfway point, then find the horizontal centre point of the door and make a mark where the two points cross.

Find the sagging door’s cause.,
See if the door and frame are level.,
Check and tighten all hinge screws.",How to Adjust a Sagging Door1," Inspect the door from inside, or the side from where you can see the hinges. Locate the gaps and where the door is tight. It’s common in sagging doors for the hinge side at the bottom to be tighter against the frame. The opposite side, or strike side, is often gapped at the top and tight where the door meets the sill., Use a bubble level and carpenter’s square to determine if the door frame itself is level. Hold the bubble level against the door jamb’s left and right sides and top, and check to see if the bubble settles between the viewer’s two lines. You can hold the carpenter’s square, or steel square, to the door jamb’s four corners to determine if they deviate from 90 degrees.


You might find that the door is level, but the frame is off square. If the frame is out of square, you might have other problems, like a shifted wall or settling foundation.
In this situation, you might find planing to be your only solution., With the door open, and starting with the top, see if the hinges and screws are still tightly embedded in the door and jamb. Use a screwdriver, not a drill, to tighten all the screws, but take care not to overtighten them. If the screws give your driver resistance and the hinges are securely in place, they’re tight. Overtightening could strip the holes or push the door further out of alignment.

Also, consider whether this will go on a bedroom, bathroom or closet. Should it have a privacy lock? If you have lever-style handles and a locking handle, you will need to get a right- or left-handed handle appropriate to the door direction. Buy a doorknob with a pawl the same length as the one you are replacing.
, Twist counterclockwise to remove., The handles will come loose, so be prepared for both sides to fall.,,,, On this one, you can replace the face plate by prying it off with a flat-blade screwdriver.

Look for and fill stripped holes.,
Replace short hinge screws with longer ones.,
Add shims between the hinge and the doorjamb.,
Mortise the door hinge.",How to Adjust a Sagging Door2," If you find a stripped hole, place a doorstop under the open door to hold the temporary drop of the weight. Remove the hinge with the stripped hole by removing the screws holding it in place from the door jamb and frame, and if necessary, from the door’s face. Dip an appropriately sized dowel into carpenter's glue and insert it into the hole – you can find these at any large hardware store. When the glue dries, predrill a hole with an appropriately sized bit, then replace the hinge and its screws., If you’ve gone through a basic check and tightened hinges, but your door still sags, your screws might not be long enough. Remove a screw from the top hinge. If it’s not 2 1/2 to 3 inches long, the screw won’t be able to reach the wall stud through the jamb and the door’s weight won’t be fully supported. Remove the old screws and pre-drill into the jamb and wall stud before replacing them with longer ones.Check the level of the door after replacing each screw.
When the longer screw catches the wall stud, it should pull the door inward. Make sure not to over-tighten.

, Make shims with thin pieces of cardboard, wood, or playing cards to fit between the hinge and jamb and help align the hinge and door. Remove the appropriate hinge, often the top hinge, and trace and cut out its shape from your shim material. Use the thinnest materials possible so you can add layers to the hinge mortise one at a time until the door is level again.You might have to install shims on more than one hinge. This technique involves some guess and check work. Adding or subtracting shims until the door is square might be necessary after each shim adjustment.

, Alternatively, you can also “mortise” one or more of the hinges. For this, you’ll need to score an outline around your hinge before removing it. Then, once you’ve taken off the hinge, you’ll carve out a deeper new pocket with a chisel.First, score the outline of the hinges you want to mortise with a utility knife. Remove the hinges.
Take the chisel and position it on the scored line perpendicular to the door jamb. Lightly tap the chisel to deepen the scoring a bit. Do the same around the whole perimeter.
Once you’ve finished the perimeter, use the chisel to make a series of cuts about 1/8 inch apart. The mortise depth will depend in part on how much the door sags. You want to adjust it so the hinge is mounted flush with the door.
Last, hold the chisel flat and tap it to clear out the waste. Replace the hinge

"
"
Scribe the door.,
Remove the door.,
Sand or plane the scribed edge.,
Refinish and repaint the sanded edge.",How to Adjust a Sagging Door3," If you’ve tightened or replaced screws, filled stripped holes, and tried shims, but the door still sags, you’ll have to plane or sand. Scribing, or marking, the door will give you the line at which you stop removing wood by planing or sanding. First, use a carpenter’s compass to draw a line an 1/8 inch from the edge on the side of the door that rubs against the jamb. Trace the line with masking or painter’s tape to make it more visible.A carpenter’s compass is the easiest tool to use, and is inexpensive. If one’s not handy, use a pencil and straightedge.
Fix the masking tape to inside of the line you marked off: for example, if you scribed the left side of the door, fix the tape to the right side of the line.

, You don’t need to bother with unscrewing the hinges from the door face. You’ll be sanding or planning the strike edge rather than the hinge, so just pop the hinge pins and remove the door. Take the door to an open area, like a garage, and store it on a level surface, like sawhorses or a worktable.

, Using a belt sander is a great option. For the first 1/16 inch, use an 80-grit sanding belt. Keep the sander moving so you don’t wear a hole in one spot. Switch to 150-grit for the second half, then a 120-grit belt when you’ve gotten to the line in order to smooth it out.Remember, the humidity that causes the door to swell and stick at the bottom may disappear and leave the door too short during dry spells. Don’t remove too much of the door.
You might reattach the door and find you haven’t planed enough, in which case you’ll have to repeat the process one or more times. Remember you can take away more door but you cannot put back what you’ve already removed, so sand carefully.
If you’re sanding the latch edge of the door, be sure to first remove the latch hardware. You may have to use a sharp chisel to dig out the latch hole so it doesn’t protrude from the door after planing. If it sticks out a bit, you can often sand or plane it down in place., When you’ve determined that the door has been properly planed, remember to refinish and repaint the raw edge. Don’t do so until you’re sure you’ve finished sanding. A coat of varnish and paint will help prevent moisture from penetrating the wood, so you’ll be far less likely to have to fix a sag in the future.

Sand the door.,
Test the final touches on a hidden area.,
Stain the door with a grey or dark wood stain.,
Treat the door with steel wool and vinegar.,
Imitate old, worn paint.,
Apply protective finish (optional).",How to Antique a Door1," Remove the doorknob and any other screwed-on attachments. This will allow you to lay the door flat and apply paint evenly. Set aside the hardware so you can restore it after the process is done.






;
, Antiquing a door while it's attached to the wall makes the project harder than it needs to be. Lay the door over a large work table in a well-ventilated room or outside. Cover the floor with a drop cloth to catch spills.








, If you have a wooden door and are aiming for a rustic, weathered look, you can intentionally damage the wood surface. Try the following distressing methods:








Lay a screw on its side and lightly hammer it into the wood.
To imitate severe worm holes, hammer several screws through the end of a plank. Whack the plank against the door so the screw ends dent the wood.
Scratch grooves with a screwdriver or pry bar.
Create a random pattern of damage by bashing the door with a chain.

, Sand through old finishes to reveal bare wood. Even if the wood is unfinished, sand to remove burrs and create a paint-ready surface. Start with medium-grit sandpaper, then move on to fine-grit sandpaper.









If the door is painted, sand lightly to wear through patches of paint, while leaving the rest on. This makes it look like the paint has worn away over the years.
Sand the corners and edges a little extra, to round them slightly as though they'd been heavily used.

, The steps below describe three options for a weathered, old-fashioned door: wood glaze, vinegar, or paint. You'll only need to use one of these approaches. Their effect can vary based on the type of door you have, so it's best to test them out on a low corner of the door first.









Alternatively, test them on scrap lumber of the same type as the door.

, Mimic the appearance of weathered outdoor furniture with wood stain. Apply it as follows:









Brush the stain over the door. Cover it evenly if the door is new. Cover just the lighter spots of wood if the door is partially painted or weathered already.Immediately wipe it with a dry cloth to rub it into the wood and remove the excess.
Buff with a second cloth if necessary to work the stain into crevices.

, Alternatively, try this homemade weathering agent to turn the wood grey and flecked with black. While this won't weaken the door, keep in mind that this does cause irreversible surface damage.If this is what you're going for, treat the wood as follows:








Rip a piece of 0000 steel wool into shreds.
Place it in a glass bottle of white vinegar. Set aside for 24 hours somewhere where the smell won't bother anyone.
Once the steel wool is dissolved, brush it over the door. Let dry for about 24 hours.
Sand lightly for a more even grey.

, You may prefer the look of old, painted material to bare wood. In order to make a fresh coat of paint look old, you'll need either a wood glaze or a crackle medium. Here's a description of the two approaches:

Wood glaze can be used to leave scratchy streaks over existing paint. Paint the door and let dry. Dip an old, straggly brush in the stain and wipe most of it off. Lightly drag the bristles over the paint to leave streaks along edges and places where the door might have been damaged.












A crackle medium causes the paint over it to shrink together and leave wiggly cracks, revealing wood or undercoats beneath.Check the label for timing instructions, as some crackle mediums must be left on for an hour or more before painting the wood.














, You can leave the door unprotected for a more rustic look, but may not appreciate the real weathering and grime buildup. If you want to protect the wood, use a clear satin finish. This will make the door shiny and reflective, but won't cover up your careful distressing.

, First, close the door so the hinge opens flat, allowing better access. Then, use a small screwdriver to force the pins out of your hinge.You may only need a screwdriver to accomplish this task, but if the pin is stuck, tap the back of your screwdriver with a hammer to pop it free.
If you don't have a screwdriver the right size on hand, you might try using a nail pushed through the bottom of the hinge., The shape of your door and the material it's made from can make handling a door by yourself cumbersome, difficult, or dangerous. Especially if you are painting a metal door, which can be extremely heavy.


Once the pins have been pulled free from all hinges, remove the door from its frame with your helper.

, Make sure the area you will be painting is well ventilated, clear of obstacles, and properly covered with drop cloths or newspaper in case of drips or splatter.Laying your door atop sawhorses with the side you intend on working face up will make the sanding and priming process easier on yourself.


You can lay the door on the floor, if necessary, but this can dirty your door or accidentally cause damage.
To prevent your door from sticking or freshly applied paint from becoming damaged by your sawhorse, you may want to use cardboard to pad the tops of your horses.Sanding and painting bent over might also cause back pain.

Finished.








",How to Antique a Door2," Take off the doorknob and any other hardware. For a real antique look, you can replace these with brass. Either way, set them aside so you can work on the door itself.








, Lay the door on a sturdy horizontal surface. Sand with medium-grit, then fine-grit sandpaper to get it ready for painting. If the door has any old finish, sand through it to the bare wood.








, Start with one or two base coats of latex paint. This will only be visible through the final coats of paint. Most people choose an ivory, yellow or orange color to imitate the highlights of mahogany or other expensive woods.









Let the paint dry according to instructions between coats and before moving on to the next step.
Work in a well-ventilated area, over a drop cloth.

, Tape around the edge of the first door panel you'll be working on. Think of each panel as a separate piece of wood, with its own grain pattern. Push the tape down firmly to prevent paint bleeding underneath it.







, Mix one part latex paint, one part latex glaze, and one part water.Use a darker wood shade than you did for the base coat, to create contrast.








, This thin paint/glaze mixture allows you to create the appearance of fine fabric, with the lighter highlights showing through. Brush it lightly over the panel, then drag a wide brush through it to create long, straight lines.









Let dry before you continue. You may paint other areas of the door while you wait, but make sure not to tape over wet paint.

, Wood glaze is the easiest way to achieve a classy antique look. Choose a tinted glaze with a rich wood tone. Mix it with water according to the instructions, then brush it lightly over the door. Immediately wipe off excess with a dry cloth.








Additional applications can be used to highlight crevices and detail work if desired.Create custom tints by mixing latex paint with your glaze.
Let the glaze dry, then paint on a clear satin finish.

, Alternatively, apply a second coat of strié mix with a darker tint. Pull a wood-graining tool over this lightly, rocking it back and forth. This creates a wood grain pattern that reveals the two lighter coats underneath.]









Use the edges of the tool next to the knots to create a different type of wood grain next to the knots.
Sweep a dry brush over any portions of the grain that are too dark.
Vary the direction of the wood grain in different parts of the door for a more natural appearance.

, Once the door is dry, apply a clear finish to protect it.

Use the smart straw, if available.,
Hold the nozzle an inch (2 cm) from the hinge.,
Spray the WD-40 in quick bursts.,
Wipe away the excess WD-40.",How to Apply WD‐40 to Door Hinges1," Like any other aerosol spray, WD-40 distributes its contents as a kind of cone-shaped cloud. With the smart straw in place, however, you’ll be able to emit WD-40 in a thin precision stream. This is ideal for applying WD-40 to a door hinge.The smart straw is a long red tube that, in its undeployed state, remains snug against the WD-40 cannister.
If your WD-40 comes with a smart straw, snap it into place by pulling up on the gray base of the red tube. This base is located near the top of the WD-40 canister.;
, With the WD-40 smart straw in place, position the canister so that the end of the tube is about one inch (two centimeters) from the door hinge to which you wish to apply WD-40. If you’re using a WD-40 canister that doesn’t have a smart straw, identify the location of the actuator orifice (the place from which the WD-40 issues) and aim it toward the door hinge. The actuator orifice should be one inch (two centimeters) from the door hinge you wish to apply WD-40 to., Once you’ve positioned the smart straw or actuator orifice appropriately, you’re ready to apply the WD-40 to the door hinge. WD-40 canisters emit their contents quite quickly, so do not hold the actuator down for prolonged periods. Instead, press down on the actuator using your index finger, then release it quickly. WD-40 will leave the canister. Apply the WD-40 in quick bursts, moving from the top of the door hinge to the bottom., Clean the door hinge off. Applying WD-40 to your door hinges will cause them to attract dust and turn black.After applying WD-40 to the door hinge, wipe it clean by dipping a microfiber cloth in some hot, soapy water. Wring it out, then wipe the door hinge with the cloth. To prevent rust, wipe the hinge down with a dry microfiber cloth."

Examine the window.,
Loosen any paint that is sealing the window shut.,
Insert a putty knife between the window and the frame.,
Hammer the edge of the window to break the seal created by paint.,
Push on the window with your hands.,
Force the window up with a pry bar.",How to Open a Stuck Window1," Look at both sides of the window, interior and exterior.


Make sure it is a window that is meant to be opened. Some new office and home windows are not meant to be opened. If there are no hinges or the window is a single pane with nowhere to slide, it likely does not open.
Make sure that the window is not nailed or screwed shut for security or energy conservation reasons.
Make sure any locks are disengaged.
Look to see if the window frame has been recently painted.
Decide which direction the window is supposed to open: up, outward or sideways.;
, Removing dried paint that collected between the window and frame will free the window and allow it to be opened.Use a razor knife to cut along the edge of the window and the frame. Cut across all four sides of the window. You may need to check the exterior of the window in addition to the inside to make sure that it isn’t painted shut on both sides.

, Wriggle the knife back and forth to loosen any dried paint between the window and the frame. Go around the entire edge of the window to loosen all sides., Use a wood block to cushion the blows from the hammer and prevent making dents in the wood of the window. Be careful to hit gently so as not to break the window. Hammer the wood portion of the window and not the glass.

, Try to loosen the window one side at a time.


Push each corner to see if there is any movement.
Press on the window gently to open it a little at a time.

, Place a small block of wood on the window frame to give your pry bar more leverage. Gently force the window up with the pry bar.


Reposition the pry bar along the bottom edge of the window to lift both sides of the window.
Using a pry bar may damage the wood of the window or window frame, use this method very carefully as a last resort.

Remove or tape around the edges of fixtures.,
Sand the door lightly.,
Clean your door, if necessary.Your door may have accumulated some dust or grit in the sanding process.,
Repeat sanding and cleaning on both sides.,
Prime your door.,
Allow your primer to rest.,
Prime the reverse side of your door.",How to Paint Doors2," To ensure your doorknobs don't get primed or painted during this process, you should remove handles and any other features, like clothes hooks, from your door.If you do not plan on removing these from your door, you might:


Prevent hardware from being painted by taping around the edges of fixtures, or even taping the entire fixture.

, Use fine grit sandpaper, between 180 and 220-grit, while stripping old, flaking paint and smoothing rough edges.A power sander or coarse sandpaper might cause scoring in your door, leaving unsightly notches or lines in its surface.

, Take a clean rag or paper towel and wipe your door free of any dust, dirt, or grime.


Do not use water. If water soaks into the material of your door, it can have a negative effect on how the primer and paint bond to the surface., By tackling your door one side at a time, you accomplish two goals at once. Your careful attention to one side at a time will help ensure evenness and consistency for the whole door. This will help you achieve a professional looking finished product.

, Primer helps to prepare the surface of your door for the actual coat of paint. Some surfaces, especially those that are rough or absorbent, can be difficult or expensive to paint if unprimed.You'll certainly want to prime your door if:


Your surface is unfinished.
Your door is made of bare or stained wood.
You want to paint the door a color lighter than its current color., The specific brand of primer that you bought should have instructions for how long you should let your primer dry before applying paint. Follow these directions for best results, but when in doubt, allow 48 hours to pass before applying your paint.

, But first, you should give it a once over to make sure that it is clean. Dirt or dust that might have been on your sawhorses could have rubbed off on your door. Using a clean rag or paper towel, wipe any dust or grit off the door before priming.


Be sure not to get your door wet. Wetness on the door can prevent your primer and paint from bonding with its surface."
"
Prepare to use your roller.,
Paint panels with your roller.A small roller should help you work quickly while still providing enough maneuverability to get as much of the edges as you can.,
Use your roller to paint the crossbar.Generally, you should follow the direction of the bar for the best effect.,
Paint the border of your door.Move your roller in an up and down motion to paint the left and right sides of your door.,
Add finishing touches using your paintbrush.,
Allow the paint to dry.",How to Paint Doors3," Rollers are intended to cover a large area with paint efficiently. To cut down on the time you spend painting, put a moderate amount of paint in your tray. Then:


Place your roller into the trough of your tray until it is half saturated with paint.
Roll it on the groves to remove excess paint.
Do this several times to thoroughly wet the nap of your roller.
Apply enough paint so the roller is wet through but not dripping. Now you're ready to roll!, The panels are the inner shapes carved into the door, and should be focused on first.


Use moderate force when rolling; pressing too hard can cause paint to bead along the outer edge of your roller.
Dip your paintbrush into your paint can and use the tip of it to get any narrow spaces in the paneling your roller cannot reach.
Use your brush to smooth any heavy areas or dribbles. Do this by wiping free excess paint on the inner lip of your paint can, wiping the excess paint off the door, and wiping the excess paint back onto the inner lip.
Be especially vigilant for buildup in corner and edges.

, When painting a vertical bar or brace, use vertical motions with your roller. The opposite should be done for horizontal bars.

, Then, using a left-to-right motion, paint the top and bottom borders.


When painting edges with a roller, extra paint caught in the nap of your roller sometimes squeezes out, causing a run line or thick area.
Keep your eyes peeled and a brush handy to correct run lines or thick areas.

, Your paintbrush will allow you to paint difficult areas of your door with much greater detail and control. Use your brush to clean up edges where paint has collected and smooth out any unevenness in the paint.


If painting a wooden door, paint with the grain, which is the direction the wood appears to flow in., The directions on your paint can should indicate how long you should let your paint dry before adding a second coat, but if you are unsure how long you should wait:


Wait 30 minutes for light coats and thinner paints.
Wait four hours for thicker coats and medium thickness paints.
Wait more than four hours for especially thick paints."
"
Paint the reverse side of your door.,
Apply a second layer of paint.A second layer of paint can help bring out the luster in your paint, and can be especially useful at covering up any bleed through from your primer.,
Allow the door to dry completely.Now that both coats have been applied, you should inspect the door for any errant drips or thick spots.,
Lift the door back into its original position.",How to Paint Doors4," Now that the topside of your door is painted and dry, you should flip the door and repeat the painting process on the other side. This time, you should be mindful of:


Edges, where excess paint might drip from your roller and dribble onto the other side.
Gaps in the wood. Some panels or wooden doors are constructed with some space or looseness where two pieces of wood form a seam. Paint these sections lightly with a paintbrush to prevent buildup on the opposite side.

, Make sure that your paint is completely dry before applying the second coat.

, Use your paintbrush to smooth these out, and then consult your paint can to find the recommended wait time till dry.


Set an alarm so that you can check your door to see if it's done drying. If the paint is wet, damn, or feels poorly bonded, reset your timer and wait another 30 minutes. Do this until the paint feels dry.
Depending on the quality of your paint and door, you may want to sand very lightly with fine grit sandpaper between coats., You may need a helper to do this, especially if the door is heavy or cumbersome. But now that you're satisfied with the paint job and the paint has fully dried on both sides, you can reinstall your door. With your helper:


Slide the door into place so that the door hinge slots into the wall hinge.
Have your helper hold the door steady while you reinsert hinge pins.
Use a hammer or the handle of your screwdriver to tap stubborn pins into place.
Check the levelness of your door, if having difficulties. Holding the door at even a slight angle can make it impossible to reinsert hinge pins.

Locate the actuator orifice.,
Aim the nozzle at the door hinge.,
Spray the WD-40 on the door hinge.,
Open and close your door several times.",How to Apply WD‐40 to Door Hinges2," The actuator orifice is the hole from which WD-40 leaves the WD-40 cannister. If you WD-40 canister is equipped with a smart straw (a long movable red tube), the actuator orifice will be a round yellow circle on the top of the cannister’s actuator (the button you press down to utilize the WD-40). In other WD-40 canisters, however, the actuator orifice is a round black dot on the top of the cannister’s actuator., Point the WD-40’s actuator orifice toward your automobile’s door hinge. The actuator orifice should be about one inch (two centimeters) from the door hinge., When you’re ready, place your index finger over the actuator. Squeeze the actuator in a series of quick bursts across the surface of the vehicle’s door hinge. You can move from left to right, or from right to left across the hinge.If you have access to two door hinges, be sure to coat them both.

, In order to adequately coat the internal portion of the hinge with WD-40, you’ll need to open and then close the door a few times. This ensures that it will lubricate the entire hinge mechanism."
"
Rub soap on the door hinge.,
Smear petroleum jelly over the hinge pin.,
Coat the hinge pin with paraffin wax.",How to Apply WD‐40 to Door Hinges3," You can use either liquid soap or bar soap. If using liquid soap, squirt a bit onto a sponge, then wipe the sponge across the surface of the door hinge. If using bar soap, apply the bar of soap directly to the hinge, especially the joints around which the hinge turns., Dab a clean paper towel in a tub of petroleum jelly. Remove the hinge pin from the door by placing the pointed end of a nail at the bottom of the door hinge, then tapping the nail gently upward with a hammer. The hinge pin will come out the top of the hinge. Wipe the hinge pin with the paper towel, then slide it back into the hinge., Light some paraffin candles. After an hour or so, remove the hinge pin on the squeaky hinge by placing the pointed end of a nail beneath the squeaky hinge, then tapping the nail gently upward with a hammer. Slide the hinge pin from the top of the hinge. Blow out the candle, then dip the hinge pin in the melted wax. After it’s well-covered in wax, slip it back into the hinge.You can wear rubber gloves during this process if you don’t want to get wax on your hands.

Rub the end of a candle along the channel where the window opens.,
Remove moisture from the window frame.,
Use a wood block and hammer to widen the window channel.,
Spray a lubricant such as WD-40 along the edge of the window.,
Open the window repeatedly.",How to Open a Stuck Window2," Spread wax from the bottom of a candle into the window channel. The wax will help allow the window to slide up and down and prevent future sticking., Wood may swell due to humidity causing windows to become stuck. Drying out the wood may help the window open more easily.Run a hair dryer along the edges of the window frame for several minutes. After drying the wood, try opening the window.
Place a dehumidifier in a room with stuck windows. Lowering the humidity in the room should help reduce the swelling of the window frames.

, If the window is in a wooden frame, place a wood block along the channel where the window opens and hammer it gently to depress the wood. Make the channel wider to allow the window to move more freely.

, Be careful when using spray lubricants as they may discolor some surfaces or damage some types of paint.


If the window opens outward on hinges, spray the hinges with the lubricant for smoother operation.

, After you get the window to open one time, open and close it several times to loosen the action of the window. If it still sticks, check the frame to ensure that it isn’t warped or damaged from water.


Window frames with severe water damage may need to be replaced entirely.

Remove the window stops.,
Unscrew any hardware on the sash.,
Tilt the top of the bottom section of the window inward.,
Smooth the edges of the sash.,
Remove the upper sash.,
Sand the edges of the upper sash.,
Sand the track inside the window frame.,
Replace the window sashes.",How to Open a Stuck Window3," The stop is a small piece of trim in the window frame that holds the movable sash in place. Examine the stop to determine how it is attached to the window frame.Use a utility knife to remove any paint that is sealing the stop to the window frame.
Remove any screws that are holding the sash in place.
Gently pry the stop out using a flathead screwdriver or paint scraper.
Be careful when removing the stops as they can snap easily. You may need to purchase a replacement stop to reinstall the window.

, Remove the locks or latches used to close the window. Check for any additional hardware from curtains or other additions that may be attached to the window sash or frame.

, Remove the bottom sash first by leaning it in to the inside of the house. As you lean it inward, pay attention to the ropes connecting the window to the pulley inside the frame.Remove the rope from one side of the window by pulling the knot down and out from the side of the window sash.
Remove the other rope from the other side in the same manner.

, Once the sash is removed, sand the edges to remove any paint or swollen wood causing the window to stick. Make sure to sand evenly to avoid creating additional bumps or uneven surfaces which may cause additional sticking issues.

, In double hung windows the upper sash can be removed as well. Remove any paint that is sealing the window shut to be able to move the sash.Use a razor knife to cut around the edges of the window.
Slide the upper sash down to reveal the pulleys in the side of the window jamb.
Pull the right side of the window in to free it from the jamb.
Remove the rope connecting the sash to the pulley inside the window frame and jamb.
Pull the left side of the window out and remove the rope.

, Check the edges of the sash for any paint or warped wood. Sand the sash smooth to allow for better operation.

, Remove any dried paint that has built up along the window sash with a scraper and sand the track smooth.

, Reverse the steps used to remove the window sashes to put them back in place.


Attach the ropes to the upper sash and slip it in place one side at a time.
Attach the ropes to the lower sash and place the bottom half in first. Push the upper half in place.
Slide the window stop back in place and attach it with screws or finish nails.

Grab a coin.,
Open the door slightly.,
Insert the coin into the upper hinge.,
Secure the coin with tape, if necessary.,
Try a coin in the lower hinge if this does not work.",How to Hold a Door Open with a Coin1," Canadian/US Quarter or 20/50 Euro Cents work well. Avoid using small coins like pennies or dimes as they do not have enough surface area to hold the door open. You may need more than one coin if you're unable to jam the door open with a single coin.


If you're in another country like Australia or South Korea, use the largest and thickest coin possible.;
, To start, open the door slightly. Open it just enough that you can fit a coin between the edge of the door near the hinges and the door frame. You may want to have someone hold the door open for you. It can be difficult to hold the door open on your own, and you do not want to prop the door open with another object. If the door is propped open too wide, it may be difficult to properly insert the coin.

, To start, you'll want to insert one coin in the door's upper hinge. Take your coin and position it just below the top hinge of the door.Place the coin between the edge of the door and the door frame. About half the coin should be between the door and frame.
Move the coin upward slightly and push it into the door's hinge. Let the door close. With luck, the door should be propped open just slightly to the point you can push the door open without during the handle.

, If your door's hinge is wider, the coin may slip out. Therefore, you may need to secure coin in the door frame with a piece of tape. Go for masking tape or duct tape over scotch tape, as these types of tape tend to be stronger. Push the coin back between the door and door frame, and slide it into the hinge. Once the coin's in place, tape it down with a strip of tape.

, Depending on the build of your door, this method may not work. If you're unsuccessful, you can try securing a coin in the bottom hinge as well. Follow the same method as you did when placing a coin in the top hinge. If this still does not work, you should try another method. No method will work on every type of door.

"
"
Identify the strike plate.,
Tape a coin over the door's strike plate.,
Add more coins to the striker plate if you're unsuccessful.",How to Hold a Door Open with a Coin2," You can also hold a door open with a coin using the door's striker plate. First, identify the strike plate on your door. The strike plate is the metal part of your door affixed to the door jamb. It is found on the side of the door, near the doorknob. The strike plate usually has bolts installed to hold it to the edge of your door. It's main purpose is to prevent friction as the door opens and closes. If you place coins over the striker plate, they may prevent the door from swinging closed.

, Take your coin and place it somewhere on the strike plate. It does not matter where you place coin. Just make sure the coin is somewhere on the metallic strike plate. Use thick tape, like masking tape or duct tape.


You may want to place the coin over the door's latch. This can hold the door handle at an open angle, allowing you to push the door open and closed without turning the knob. This will also prevent the door from locking.
However, placing the coin on the door latch may not hold the door open. Depending on the gap between your door and door frame, it may just allow you to push the door open and closed.

, One coin may not be enough to successfully hold your door open. If there's a larger gap between your door and door frame, a single coin may not be thick enough. If one coin does not work, tape another over the first coin. You may have to add quite a few coins before your door is successfully propped open with coins.

"
"
Do not prop a door open around children.,
Make sure animals will not get out if a door is propped open.,
Use a conventional door stop or bigger objects on a larger door.",How to Hold a Door Open with a Coin3," You want to be careful when propping doors open if you live with young children. A door could swing open and closed fast if a child fell or pushed on it. This could cause injury. If you need to prop a door open, do so only when your children are secured elsewhere., If you have pets, do not leave a door propped open unless you're supervising them. A larger dog could push a propped door open and get loose. Make sure to secure animals in another room before propping a door open with a coin.

, A heavier door will be unlikely to be propped open by a coin. The force of a heavy door can easily dislodge a coin doorstop, even one that is carefully taped down. If you need to hold open a larger door, use a bigger object like a chair or cinderblock. You can also purchase a door stop at a local hardware store.

Measure the space.,
Shop around for standing dividers.,
Arrange the dividers around the water heater.,
Paint the dividers, if desired.,
Rearrange as desired.",How to Hide a Water Heater1," Use a tape measure or measuring stick to measure the width, depth, and height of the area you want to hide.


Measure the height of the space from floor to ceiling and the height of the water heater itself. Keep in mind that that divider you use must be at least as tall as the water heater but slightly shorter than the height of the ceiling. If the divider matches the height of the ceiling exactly, you won't be able to set it in place or move it around easily enough to be functional.
Measure how far the water heater extends out from the wall (depth) and how wide the water heater is from side to side (width). Add 4 inches (10 cm) to both measurements to provide a little extra space in between the heater and the divider.;
, There are multiple options you can consider. The best choice will depend on your budget and the dimensions of each option.


The simplest option would be a decorative folding screen. These can be expensive, however, so this option is not the most budget-friendly.Budget-friendly options include plain bi-fold doors, large standing wooden shutters, and hinged metal pegboard. You can leave these options as they are or decorate them so that they are more aesthetically pleasing.Regardless of the option you choose, make sure that the height of the divider is high enough to cover your water heater and that the divider can fold in a way that will cover both the width and depth of the water heater separately. You may need to buy more than one divider, depending on the total dimensions of your space.

, Open the dividers and arrange them around the water heater. Adjust the folds as needed to hide the water heater from sight.


With the divider standing straight, position one edge near the wall behind the heater. Extend the divider outward and bend it in so that one side of the heater is completely covered by one or more panels.
If necessary, bend the other edge of the divider back toward the wall, making sure that both the front and other side of the heater are hidden by one or more panels.

, If you are using bi-fold doors, wooden shutters, or plain wooden screens, you may want to paint the dividers to make them appear more decorative.


Place cardboard or plastic sheets underneath the divider before you paint.
You can save time by painting the divider after standing it in place around your water heater, but if you're afraid of splattering paint everywhere, you can remove it temporarily and paint the divider elsewhere.
Choose a latex paint that fits in with the rest of your décor. The paint can have either a gloss or matte finish.
Another option would be to use chalkboard paint on flat panels. Since you can write on surfaces painted with chalkboard paint, using it on your divider can make the structure more functional.
Use a roller to paint all flat parts of the divider. If there are separate slats along the front, you may need to use a brush to paint those.
Allow the paint to dry completely before touching or moving the divider again., Take a step back and look at your divider. Adjust it as desired to improve the overall appearance of the space.


Once you finish making your desired adjustments, the project is finished.

, Coolant systems that are not in the right proportion will lead to overheating due to freezing. Have the car's coolant system flushed in the fall before the first freeze. You also need to check the system for leaks and install fresh coolant.

, Protect your paint job, guard against ice on the windshield (see tips), and guard against the fluids and/or water in your radiator from freezing. And, yes, there is such a thing as “gas line freeze”. Condensation builds up in the gas line and gas tank, and freezes. (You may want to inquire with an auto parts store about a head bolt heater.)


If you do not have shelter for your car, invest in a car cover. Try to find one that is reversible – with one side a very bright color such as orange, yellow and in neon shades. A car cover will not save you from freezing fluids, but it will keep snow and ice off the windshield and your paint, and help protect your car from salts that might be used on the streets in your community.







,, Change the windshield wiper fluid with one that has antifreeze added to it.

, The cold weather puts unusual demands on the charging system.

,


An older car in an area that has temperatures that fall below freezing often uses 30-weight single viscosity oil. You need to go to a lower viscosity oil, like a 10-weight, when the temperature falls below zero and stays there.
This also applies to your automatic transmission fluid. Higher weight oils and transmission fluids do not lubricate sufficiently in colder weather. Newer automobiles use multi-viscosity oil such as 10 and 30 weights. This eliminates the need to change type of oil.

, (Like overnight.) The warm air in your tires rises. As it cools the bottom of the tire goes “flat”. This will resolve itself once you begin to drive and the air starts to circulate again. But start off slowly. Consult with a tire retailer about snow tires and chains.


Ensure traction so you know you are safe when driving on icy roads. Check your vehicle's tire treads. Replace any tires that do not have sufficient tread. Snow tires may also be a good investment.







, Know where you are. Before you leave your starting point, advise a family member, friend or neighbor of your destination and judge the approximate duration of the trip. If possible, contact those persons if you will be delayed. Notify them when you reach your destination.;
, If no such item can be found, apply a very large X on the roof section of the car cover. This can be achieved with vinyl, waterproof tape or take the car cover to an upholster to have a durable, highly reflective vinyl X sewn on. On the front and rear sides of the cover, use the same methods to apply your license plate number. When not in use, keep the car cover in the trunk.

, This will provide added traction while driving and the sand can be used around your tires if you become stuck.)






A camping shovel






At least one sleeping bag, preferably one that is down.






Water






Foodstuffs that can be eaten cold. (Described in Item number 4.)
A small First Aid kit
A small tool kit, a jack that works and a spare tire in usable condition, and jumper cables.

, If it has reception, call an emergency number first, then call the persons that are aware of your route and your travel time schedule. Test the cell phone periodically. Do not try to walk over for help. Exit the car ONLY to recover items from the trunk.

, Position the X on the roof the best you can. The car cover will help retain heat inside the car and repel the cold, wind, and drafts. If you are in a severe situation, the reflective X can by seen by aircraft that may be conducting a search for you. Your license plate numbers will be visible to a search and rescue team working on the ground.

Measure the space.,
Buy a ceiling-mounted curtain rod and curtains.,
Mark where each bracket needs to go.,
Install drywall anchors in the ceiling.,
Prepare the ceiling brackets.,
Attach the brackets to the anchors.,
Put the tracks together.,
Attach the track to the ceiling brackets.,
Clip hooks onto your curtain.,
Hook the curtain on the rod.,
Spread the curtain out.",How to Hide a Water Heater2," Use a tape measure or a measuring stick to measure the height of the area from ceiling to floor. You should also measure the depth and width of the water heater area.


Take the full height measurement of the entire space from floor to ceiling, not the height of the water heater. The curtain will need to be long enough to extend from the ceiling down to the floor.
Measure the distance between the front of the water heater and the wall (depth) and the space the water heater takes up from side to side (width). Add 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) to both dimensions so that the final mounted curtain will not sit against the water heater itself.

, You'll need a special curtain rod that can be mounted to the ceiling, and the curtain rod track must suit the dimensions of your water heater area. The curtain you buy must be long enough to hide the entire water heater from sight.


The curtain rod track will need to have one or two bends in it. Make sure that the curtain rod tracks will extend over the width and depth of the water heater. The tracks can be slightly longer than necessary but should not be shorter than the sides of your water heater.
If you cannot find a curtain that matches the height of your ceiling within 2 inches (5 cm) or so, pick a curtain that is too long instead of one that is too short. A long curtain can be hemmed if necessary.
While the choice is yours to make, a non-sheer, lightweight curtain that complements the rest of your décor is recommended., Use a pencil to lightly mark where on the ceiling each bracket should be placed.Take into account the full length of your curtain tracks. You may need to draw light lines on the ceiling indicating where the tracks will rest before you mark out the brackets.
Space the brackets apart evenly along the length of each track.
Take a step back after you've made your marks. Look at the marks from a distance to determine if they look even and make any necessary adjustments.

, Use an electric power drill to make a hole for each drywall anchor directly over each marked spot.


Drill a hole in the center of each marked bracket location using a drill bit. Make sure that the hole is as deep as the drywall anchor.
Push the anchor into the hole until the head lies flush against the ceiling. You may need to use a screwdriver or drill to push the anchors in completely.

, Remove the bottom track piece from each ceiling bracket that came with your curtain rod.Slide the track pieces into your curtain track after removing them from the ceiling bracket structure. The spacing of each piece along the track doesn't matter at this point.

, Insert screws through the center of your empty ceiling brackets. Use a power drill to fix these screws into the anchors already on your ceiling.


The screws used to attach the ceiling brackets must go through the center of each bracket and into the drywall anchor already mounted in the ceiling.

, Use the connector pieces that came with your curtain rod track to connect the individual track rods together.


On a flat working surface, line up the individual track pieces end-to-end.
Slide the connector pieces into the tracks and snap in place.
Slide the fitted plastic curtain gliders onto the track one at a time. If the curtain rod did not come with plastic gliders, you will need to buy some separately from a hardware store.
Attach the end pieces to both ends of your connected track. Secure them in place using a small Allen wrench.

, Re-insert each track piece into the ceiling brackets previously mounted on the ceiling. Use a small Allen wrench to tighten the entire fixture.


Space apart the track pieces of the bracket structure so that they line up with the brackets on your ceiling.
You may need some assistance with this step. One person should hold the track in place so that the bracket pieces on the ceiling and on the track align. The second person should slip the two pieces together and tighten them with an Allen wrench.

, Attach hooks to your curtain, spacing them apart evenly along the top edge.


The clip part of each hook should be attached to the curtain and the hook part should extend out.
The number of hooks you use should match the number of plastic gliders inserted into the curtain rod track.

, Slip each hook into one of the plastic gliders currently sitting inside the track.


If the curtain has a definite front and back, make sure that the front of the curtain faces outward as you slip the hooks into the gliders.

, Pull the curtain so that its hooks slide across the entire curtain rod, completely hiding the water heater in the process.


Once you finish this step, the process is complete.

Shut down supply.,
Shut off the water supply.,
If you have sufficient clearance between the top of the heater and the ceiling you may unscrew the the old anode rod from the heater, and remove it.,
Disconnect the pipes leading in and out of the tank.,
After you have replaced the rod and before turning the power on, turn the water back on.",How to Replace Anode Rod in a Hot Water Heater1," Depending on the fuel used for the heater you must first shut off the gas supply to the unit. If it is electric you must shut off the power. This is critical. If you do not shut off the electricity, you will burn out the heating elements in a few seconds. If the heater is oil fired, shut off the motor switch.;
, You won't want water shooting out all over the place.

, If you do not have the space (at least three (3) feet) you will have to drain the tank. Loosen the anode rod before the next step, it will make life easier.

, Tilt it enough to allow you to remove the old anode rod. Before going to this trouble, verify that your anode rod is not articulated. If it is, you may skip emptying the tank and disconnecting the water connections In the event you do have to drain the tank, disconnect the water and tilt the tank to remove the old rod, consider replacing it with an articulated anode rod. This will make future maintenance much easier.

, Verify that you have no leaks.

"
"Turn off the gas or electricity supply.,Turn off the water supply to the tank.,
Open the drain at the bottom of the tank.,
It would be helpful to spray some lubricant such as WD-40 around the hex head of the rod, then let it penetrate a few minutes before trying to loosen the rod.,
If you don't have the clearance above the tank to pull the rod straight up, you can bend the rod as you are pulling it up.,
For the replacement rod you will need a segmented or flexible rod.,
Apply thread sealant to the threads of the rod before starting it back in.,
Turn the water supply back on.",How to Replace Anode Rod in a Hot Water Heater2,",, If any large pieces of rust come out, you need to replace the tank. If only discolored then runs a little clearer, drain out a few gallons so there is enough drained to not leak when removing the rod., You probably will need an impact wrench with a 1-1/16"" socket to break it loose. Use short burst to break it loose, then finish turning it out by hand., This way you don't have to bother with draining the entire tank, removing the plumbing, and tilting the tank., You can then feed it back in and flex it as needed., Tighten it up snug, but don't over tighten it., Then before turning on the power or gas, check for leaks around the rod. If it leaks, tighten it some more until it stops. If it doesn't leak then go ahead and turn a hot water faucet on to let any air escape. After it quits surging, then turn the power or gas back on."
"
Know when your water heater needs to be replaced.,
Call your local plumbing inspector.,
Gather your tools and materials.",How to Replace a Water Heater1," Water heaters will usually last somewhere between 8 to 15 years. If your water heater has stopped working, there's a good chance that it will need to be replaced.


If you notice water dripping from the bottom of your tank or sitting in a rusty pool beneath it, this means that the steel tank has rusted through. This kind of damage is not fixable and the tank will need to be replaced.
However, if you are experiencing problems such as insufficient or no hot water, your heater may just need to be fixed rather than replaced. If you're unsure what the problem is, call a professional plumber.;
, Plumbing codes vary by region, so it's a good idea to call your local plumbing inspector to find out the specific requirements for your area and whether you need to get a permit before replacing your heater.


It is also a good idea to provide a description of the new water heater and the materials you intend to use while installing it. The plumbing inspector may have some useful feedback or advice that will help you with your installation.
If this is your first time replacing a water heater and you are concerned with safety, you can request for a local plumbing or electrical inspector to check your work.

, Replacing a water heater requires quite a number of tools and materials. You can save yourself time and frustration if you have all of the necessary items lined up and ready to go before you begin. Although the exact items will vary according to the type of water heater, the following guide should help:



Tools: screwdriver, adjustable wrench, pipe wrench, tube cutter, wire stripper/cutter electrical tape, plumbers tape, carpenter's level, tape measure, rags and safety glasses.

Materials: new gas (or electric) water heater, water and gas piping, fittings, solder, pressure relief valve, discharge pipe, pipe thread compound, venting pipe and connectors."

Turn off the gas supply.,
Drain the tank.,
Disconnect the gas and water lines.,
Remove and discard the old tank.",How to Replace a Water Heater2," The first step is to turn off the gas supply. You can do this by turning the gas shutoff valve by hand or using an adjustable wrench.


When the gas is off, the valve handle should be at a right angle to the pipe. Check the pilot light to make sure it's out. Smell for the presence of gas before proceeding.
If you're replacing an electric heater, remove the fuse or turn off the circuit breaker to cut off power to the water heater., Switch off off the water supply by turning the shutoff valve on the cold water supply line.


Start draining the tank by opening a hot water faucet on the lowest floor of the house. This will make the tank lighter and easier to move.
Connect a hose to the drain valve on the tank and slowly open the valve. Allow the water to run off into a nearby drain or bucket.
Be very careful, as the water may be scalding hot., Once the tank has been drained, the next step is to disconnect the gas and water lines.


Use two pipe wrenches to disconnect the gas line at the union or flare fitting. Then use a pipe wrench to unscrew the pipe from the gas control valve. If you have an electric water heater, simply disconnect the electrical service.
Disconnect the hot and cold water lines. If the pipes have been soldered into place, you will need to cut them using a tubing cutter or a hacksaw. Try to ensure that the cuts are as straight as possible.Detach the vent from the water heater by removing the screws which connect the two. Push the vent pipe to one side.

, Now that the old tank has been fully disconnected, carefully slide it out of the way.


You may need some help doing this as older water heaters are often filled with sediment, making them very heavy. If your water heater is in the basement, consider renting an appliance dolly to help you bring the new heater down and the old heater up.
Dispose of the old water heater safely and legally. Contact a local waste management department or sanitation agency for instructions on how to recycle a water heater. Most states have current laws prohibiting the dumping of appliances such as water heaters in dumps or landfills.

"
"
Set the new water heater in place.,
Install the temperature and pressure relief valve.,
Attach the pipe assemblies.,
Connect the hot and cold water lines.,
Reattach the vent.,
Connect the gas line.,
Check for leaks.,
Refill the tank.,
Turn the power back on.",How to Replace a Water Heater3," Wipe up any pooled water from the floor, then move the new water heater into position.


Twist the heater around so that the plumbing locations are lined up with the appropriate pipes.
Use a carpenter's level to ensure that the heater is sitting straight. Use some wooden shims to adjust the level if necessary.

, Wrap a couple of layers of Teflon tape around the threads of the new temperature and pressure relief valve (included with your water heater) and use a pipe wrench or pliers to screw it tightly into place. Attach the discharge drain pipe.

, Take two six inch lengths of 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) copper pipe and attach a new adapter to each of them.


Solder the adapters to the pipes at a work surface away from the water heater, as you don't want to place a heat source too close to the tank.
Attach the adapters to the hot water output and cold water input at the top of the tank using pipe joint compound or Teflon tape.
Some local plumbing codes will also require you to attach plastic lined nipples to the bottom of each pipe assembly. This prevents galvanic corrosion, something which is particular important in hard water areas.

, To connect the hot and cold water lines, cut or extend the old pipes so they reach the newly connected ones.


Solder the two edges of pipe together, using copper slip couplings or dielectric unions (to prevent electrolysis).
If you can't get the old and new pipes to align properly, connect them using pieces of flexible copper pipes or 45 degree elbows.

, Grab the vent pipe and position it directly above the draft hood on the water heater. Use 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) sheet metal screws to secure it tightly in place.

, Before you reassemble the gas line, clean the threaded ends of the pipes with a wire brush and rag, then apply a little piping compound to each.


Use two pipe wrenches to screw the first nipple into the gas valve, then continue to reassemble the remaining fittings.
The last connection should be the union fitting, as this connects the new line to the old. Once this is connected, you can turn on the gas supply valve.
To connect electric heaters to their power supply, reconnect the power lines and ground wire to the junction box.

, You can check for leaks by soaking a sponge in soapy water (made with dishwashing soap) and holding it against each newly connected joint on the water heater.If there's a leak, soap bubbles will form on the surface of the sponge. If this happens, you will need to tighten or reconnect the joints, or a call a professional plumber.
If there are no bubbles, the joints are secure and you are free to turn on the water and power supply.

, Turn on the main water supply and the cold water supply valve to start refilling the tank. Turn on a remote hot water faucet -- at first nothing may come out, or the water will splutter. Once a full flow of water is running from the faucet, the tank has been refilled.

, You can turn the new water heater on by lighting the pilot and setting the control knob to ""on"". Set the temperature somewhere between 110 and 130 degrees Fahrenheit.


If your water heater is electric, turn the power on by reinstalling the fuse or resetting the circuit breaker in the power panel."
"
Measure and cut one hole centrally in each end of the tank or drum, so that the 150 mm pipe fits through snugly.,
Measure and cut a hole in the top of the water heater, into which the J-shaped pipe fits snugly, and solder, braise or weld the longer leg into it.,
Cut one or two holes into the bottom of the tank and insert, solder, weld or braze them into place to act as inlet and outlet, or use one pipe to perform both functions, or just cut a hole in the top and pour water into the tank.,
Cut a rectangular hole into the bottom of the topless 300 mm high cylinder, through which you will feed fuel for your fire and via which you will remove the ash.

,
If you intend using this water heater indoors, cut a second, round hole in the back, opposite the rectangular hole.,
Push the pipe through a hole in the wall so that the other end of the pipe is outside the building so that, as long as the firebox door is closed, the fire draws air from outside and not from inside.

,
To make a door for the firebox, use the rectangular piece of steel you cut from the front and apply two hinges and a latch and catch as illustrated:

,
Position the tank on top of the topless cylinder and weld or braise in place.

,
Fill the tank with water, make a fire in the bottom and let the water heat up.

,
Your water heater should resemble something like this when finished.

",How to Make a Water Heater," Push the pipe right through the tank, and solder, weld or braise in place, ensuring that the joints are water-tight, so that it is flush with one end. This will be the bottom of the water heater. The pipe is the chimney.;
, This is the overflow/expansion/pressure release pipe, without which the heater will either not function at all, as you will not be able to pipe water into it, or will turn your water heater into a bomb that will explode with devastating consequences.

, You will, nevertheless, require an outlet at the bottom, onto which you should fit a tap (faucet), if you do not want the water to run out as fast as you pour it in.

,, Affix a length of pipe of that same diameter as the chimney, to this hole.

This can be done by shutting off the main gas or turning off the circuit breaker for electrical devices.;
,


This procedure will prevent cold water from flowing into the water heater and prevent hot water from coming out during the cleaning process.
The water valves consist of a cold water valve that may be colored blue, a hot water valve that may be colored red, and a third main valve that runs the water into your home.

,


The purge valves have small handles that resemble the letter ""T.""
This procedure is done to relieve any pressure that has built inside the valves and will prevent excess hot water from shooting out and coming into contact with your skin.
There may be pressure when removing the purge port valve caps, so it is extremely important to make sure the hot water valve is completely and accurately shut off for safety purposes.
Handle each cap carefully to make sure the rubber washer sealing discs stay in place, which are needed for your valves to function properly.

,


If the manufacturer of your tankless water heater did not provide you with hosing lines, you can purchase them from any retail store specializing in home repair or water heaters. The hosing lines must be long enough to reach between the water heater and your bucket.
You may need to consult your manual provided by the tankless water heater's manufacturer or contact the manufacturer directly for exact instructions regarding this procedure.
In some cases, this procedure may require you to use a sump pump and connect hoses that will discharge and flush water from the tankless water heater using the cold and hot water valves.

,,


Since your tankless water heater is most likely the source of all your drinking water and bathing water, using chemical cleaning solutions may be extremely harmful to your health.

,


This procedure may take up to 45 minutes.

If you have a gas-powered water heater, turn the switch to ""pilot"" to keep the water heater's pilot light on, but stop the water from heating.
If you have an electric water heater, switch off the electrical switch that connects the heater to the electricity. This may be a switch in a board above the heater.;
, This can take several hours to half a day depending upon the size of the water heater.

, This inlet is often at the top of the heater, and it is where the water pours in before being heated.

,, You may hear a hissing sound when you turn it.

, Most homes will need to drain the water from the water heater into a drain outdoors.


If you have an operable drain in a basement where the water heater is stored, you can opt to drain the heater with a water hose straight into your basement drain.

,


You can also choose to run the cool water into a garden or lawn. In this case, you may want to place a mesh screen above the lawn to trap water heater sediment. In this case, the cooler the water you are draining, the better.

, If it is above, you can simply string the hose outside and gravity will force the water downward.


If your water heater sits below ground level, you will need to purchase a small pump at a home improvement store. This pump can connect to a garden hose and reattach to another hose to pump the water outside or into a drain.

, Plug it in, if need be.

, This is usually located at the bottom of the tank. Use a wrench to secure it tightly.

,, This will help you to see how much sediment is in the water.

, You can also check your mesh screen to see what has gathered.

Turn the water supply back on and wait until the hot water line begins running continuously.,
Turn off the tub spigot.",How to Flush a Water Heater," Before you begin draining your water heater, you will first need to find the main power source and turn it off.









The breaker box or fuse box is usually a small, grey power panel (about the size of a shoebox) with a swinging door. It is often attached to a wall. In some homes, it is located in the garage and in others it can be on the outside of the house.The thermostat for the gas heater is usually a red knob located on the outside of the heater where the gas pipe enters the unit. The knob should have 3 settings: ""Pilot,"" ""On,"" and ""Off."";
, This will cease power to the water heater or the entire house, depending on which circuit/fuse you disable.









You should see small on/off switches. These are called ""branch circuits breakers,"" and they provide protection against electrical overload to different circuits powering your house. If you know which branch circuit breaker is powering your water heater, turn this individual switch off.
If you don't know which individual circuit breaker is powering your heater, locate a larger switch labeled ""Main"" above the branch circuit breakers. The main circuit breaker should have higher amperage values like 100, 150, or 200. The branch circuit breakers will have lower numbers from 10-60amps. Turn the main power off, but know that all the power to your house will be shut off for the time-being.
If you open the box and find round, glass topped shapes or small tubes with metal ends, you have a fuse box, not a breaker box.In this case, you will need to unscrew and remove the fuse that is powering your water heater (similar to turning off the branch circuit breaker). If you are unsure of which fuse to remove, look for a large rectangular box with a handle/lever at the top of the panel. Tug hard and straight out on the handle, but be careful because the metal parts may be hot.The power to your entire house has now been shut off.

, The shut-off valve should be located at or near the cold water inlet pipe at the top of the tank.









There are two types of valves in use: ball valves and gate valves. A 90-degree turn closes and opens the ball valve, but a gate valve takes many turns.
Some gate valves have a ""stop"" before they are fully closed or open, so be sure you turn the valve past that stop. Gas and propane supply valves for non-electric heaters can be left on.
For natural gas and propane (LP) water heaters, make a note of what the temperature setting is and then turn the thermostat, the large red dial on the front of the control, to the lowest setting, or ""Pilot.""
If you plan to use the water for other purposes, turn the heat off ahead of time and allow the water to cool overnight before draining.

, This will prevent a vacuum from forming in the lines keeping water trapped. A similar example of this is when you cover the top of a straw to retain water.















, The drain cock usually looks like a regular hose bib, such as a garden faucet, or a round dial with a threaded hole in the middle.









The drain cock may be hidden under a removable cover.
If you don't have a garden hose, you can use a bucket to catch the water and dump it somewhere safe manually. Don't overfill the bucket since the hot water can soften cheaper plastic buckets or can burn you., Either run your hose to an outside drain or to your driveway.









If you allowed the water to cool overnight, you can drain it into buckets and save the water to use on the yard or for other purposes. Don't use it for delicate plants, though, or to wash your car, given the presence of sediment.
If draining hot water, also be careful of the materials you use. Low-quality hoses and buckets may soften due to the heat, causing leaks. To simplify the process, drain straight into a suitable basement drain or sump hole.
Cover the drain cock and hose connection with a towel or rag to prevent scorching water from bursting and spraying in case there is a pressure leak especially if the water heater supplies a second floor or if located in a basement.

, Consider opening the pressure-relief valve, usually on the top of the unit, to allow water to flow freely. But DO NOT open the pressure-relief valve without first placing a bucket under the discharge pipe. Opening it can allow water to drain onto the floor unless something is placed under the discharge pipe to catch the water.









The pressure relief valve is usually a lever that you flip into an ""up"" position to open it.
Make sure water flows at a rate that wherever you are draining to can be managed.

Caution: If you did not allow the water to cool, it will be extremely hot as it leaves the tank. Also, realize that if the drain cock is made of plastic and the heater is several years old, it may be difficult to open and may break if forced.

, Allow the water in the bucket to stand undisturbed for a minute and see if the water is clear or if any sand-like material settles to the bottom.









If the water is cloudy or you see sand-like material on the bottom of the bucket, continue draining the tank until the water is clear (free of sediment or discoloration). If the tank is empty but you suspect sediment remains, turn the cold-water supply back on to allow more water into the unit. Fill the tank partially and then drain it again. Repeat this process until the discharge is clear.
If the water is clear and you see no sediment , you may carry on to the next step.

, Close the pressure-relief valve if opened.









Also remember to turn off the hot water faucet in your sink or tub.

, When the tank is full and the pressure has equalized, slowly reopen the pressure-relief valve to bleed off the excess air.









This will keep the water heater from ""pinging"" as cold water re-enters it during normal use. After all the compressed air has escaped, close the pressure-relief valve again.

Check when your water heater was manufactured.,
Look for small pieces of plastic in your shower nozzle or faucet aerators.,
Run hot water for a few minutes through your a faucet without the aerator or strainer.,
Examine the particles.,
Put the particles in a small bowl of water.,
Put the particles in a small bowl of vinegar.,
Test the water temperature.,
Turn off all power to the water heater.,
Turn off the cold water going to the tank.,
Open the tank’s pressure relief valve.,
Attach a garden hose to the drain valve.,
Drain the water tank.,
Make sure the power is still turned off to the water heater.,
Locate the dip tube and remove the pipe nipple and connector.,
Take out the dip tube.,
Inspect the dip tube for cracks and small holes.,
Buy a replacement dip tube.,
Wrap plumber’s tape around the top of the replacement dip tube.,
Insert the replacement dip tube into the inlet.,
Replace the cold water pipe connector.,
Close the drain valve and disconnect the hose.,
Turn on all hot faucets and open the cold inlet pipe valve.,
Turn off faucets.,
Flush out faucet aerators and strainers.,
Turn the power back on.",How to Change a Dip Tube," Nearly all gas and electric water heaters manufactured between 1993 and 1997 were installed with defective dip tubes. The dip tubes were made of a material that quickly degraded and disintegrated, causing dip tube failure.Look on your water heater for the serial number. This is probably on the back of your tank. The first four numbers typically display the month and year of when the heater was made (for example, 0200 means that the heater was made in February 2000).
If the third and fourth numbers in the serial number are 93, 94, 95, 96, or 97, you may have a defective dip tube.;
, Take apart your shower nozzle or faucet strainer. If the dip tube has disintegrated, then you might find small pieces of white plastic inside your shower nozzle or faucets., If you find very small chunks of white and gray material, this may be plastic from your dip tube.

, If they are rectangular and sharp on some edges, they may be plastic. Sediment particles, on the other hand, will likely be rough and roundish, but with irregular shapes.If you have a microscope, use it to have a closer look at the particles.
Very small fragments of these plastic particles can get into your water supply, but experts say that they are non-toxic and do not pose a health risk. They can, however, be damaging to appliances that use water such as a dishwasher or washing machine.

, If they float, they are probably plastic. If they dissolve, they are probably sediment.

, Plastic will not dissolve and will float, whereas sediment will do the opposite.

, Attach a hose to the drain valve, open the valve, and keep the water turned on. Water will come out of the drain hose and should cool rapidly. If this is the case, the dip tube is probably still functioning properly and your water heater may have a different problem., Turning off the power to the water heater is an essential step, as you can risk electric shock if you don’t turn it off.


For an electric water heater, turn the power off at the breaker in the circuit box.
For a gas heater, turn off the pilot light on the tank.

, Locate the cold inlet pipe valve and turn it clockwise. This will keep any cold water from entering the tank while you are working.


The inlet pipe valve should be on the right side of the tank.

, The pressure relief valve allows pressure to escape from the tank in order to break the vacuum that can build up inside the tank. This valve is usually located near the top of the water heater. Open the valve to let the pressure escape.Place a bucket under this valve to catch any water that might drain out at this valve point.

, At the bottom of the tank, there is a drainage valve. Hook up the hose to this valve. Put the other end of the garden hose either in the bathtub or direct it outside.


This water will be extremely hot, so take care to drain the water where it will not harm anyone or anything.

, Turn the drain valve so that the water starts to drain out of the tank. Make sure the water is not overflowing at the other end of the hose. Drain the tank completely.


If your tank sits in a low area of your house (such as the basement), you may need to use an electric pump to help drain out the water. Pump the water into a bathtub in a higher location (upstairs bathroom, for example)., Double check to make sure no one has unintentionally switched on the power while you’ve been draining the tank.

, The top of the dip tube sticks up on the top right of the tank and has a pipe nipple and cold water pipe connector. By removing the connector, you'll gain access to the dip tube inlet. Turning the connector and nipple counterclockwise with a wrench should be enough to remove them., You may be able to pull it out by inserting your little finger into the top of the tube and moving it in a circular upward motion. Once you get it moved up a few inches, you should be able to grab it with your hand and pull it the rest of the way out.


You can also use a wooden dowel to hook in the metal ring that sits inside the top of the dip tube. The handles of pliers might also work.

, Over time, the dip tube can corrode or become cracked. By taking out the dip tube and examining it closely, you can see if there is any surface damage to it.


Run water through the dip tube to see if any water leaks through cracks or holes that you can’t see. Start with a dry dip tube so that you will be able to notice water leaks., Dip tubes made from polyethylene are readily available at home supply or hardware stores for $5-$20. Most residential water heaters have a standard size dip tube. Check your water tank’s brand and model number to get the right dip tube.Water heaters typically use a straight dip tube, although some people prefer a curved dip tube. A curved tube swirls the water in the tank when water travels through it, which helps reduce the amount of sediment buildup in the bottom of your tank.Check to see if your water heater is under warranty. You may be able to get a replacement dip tube for free if yours is defective.

, Plumber’s tape is a thin sealing tape that comes in a roll. It is used to seal off any possible drips or leaks in the threads of two parts that screw together., Push the dip tube in all the way until the tip of the tube is flush with the tank. Be gentle with this installation.


Curved tubes should point away from the drain valve so that they swirl the water inside the tank. Look inside the dip tube to find a mark. This mark indicates the direction of the tube’s curve so you can keep track of the direction that this curve is pointing when you install the tube., Use a pipe wrench to tighten it firmly, making sure that it will not come out or fall off.

, Close the drain valve on your water tank before you disconnect the hose so that any remaining water won’t drip on the floor. Take the hose off the drain valve. Turn the pressure relief valve counter-clockwise to close it off.


Pour out the hose in the tub to get remaining water out of the hose.

, Turn each faucet in your house to hot and turn them on. You also need to open the cold inlet pipe valve so that the water heater can refill with water.

, When each faucet has hot water coming out of it, turn it off. Let the faucets run for 3 minutes before shutting them off. Your tank has been drained and refilled., Each faucet in your house, along with other fixtures that attach to appliances such as a dishwasher or washing machine, will need to be flushed out to remove plastic particles and other debris. Clean these and run clean water through them several times.


It is possible, although unlikely, that you need to replace fixtures that have been damaged by debris from your water heater.

, Switch power back on to the water heater at the circuit breaker for electric water heaters, or turn on the pilot light for gas heaters.

Take shorter showers.,
Wash dishes and clothes consciously.,
Avoid letting the water run.",How to Cut Water Heating Costs1," 20 minutes of shower time per day - a conservative estimate for many multi-person households - can add up to 700 gallons of water a week. To frame that in terms of conservation, that’s the equivalent of three years worth drinking water for one person. It will also lead to considerable hot water heating costs, which will vary based on your location.Keep showers to five minutes maximum. Two or three minutes should be plenty to wash up.
Short showers will use much less water than baths. If you do take a bath, only fill it up as much as is necessary to wash.Taking cooler showers will also save you water heating costs, though water cost and conservation are important to be aware of as well.;
, In particular, use the “economy” setting on your washing machines, and choose short washing cycles if you have the option. Only run clothes or dish washing machines with a full load.If your dishwasher is equipped with a booster heater, turn it on.
Dish washing machines use less water than hand-washing, if used efficiently. If you are washing dishes by hand, fill a washtub with soapy water instead of letting the faucet run.
Use cold water for the majority of clothes washing cycles. Always choose cold water for the rinse cycle.
Replace an old or inefficient machine with a more energy efficient model. For information on doing so, see the corresponding section in this article.

, It can be tempting to let the water run while warming up a shower, or while brushing your teeth. This not only wastes water, it costs you money. Get in the habit of rinsing your toothbrush for a moment, and turning the faucet off aside from quick rinses while brushing."

Repair leaky fixtures.,
Replace or add an aerator to faucets.,
Install low-flow shower heads.,
Test whether a shower head needs to be replaced.",How to Cut Water Heating Costs2," One drip per second adds up to over 3,100 gallons of water over the course of a year. Not only is this wasteful, it will likely cost you around $1 per month for each leaky fixture. See if you can fix a fixture yourself before calling a plumber. Turn off water to the fixture and take it apart. Often, replacing a rubber o-ring or other internal part is sufficient to stop a leak.Bring broken or worn-out pieces to the hardware store with you, to ensure you get the correct replacement.
Be sure to periodically check outdoor water fixtures for leaks as.

, Many modern faucets are equipped with a screw-on metal attachment that determines the faucet’s maximum flow rate. Make sure the faucet in your kitchen is equipped with an aerator that restricts water flow to about 1.0 gallon per minute (gpm) (3.8 liters). Likewise, make sure your bathroom faucet’s aerator restricts flow rate to 0.5-1.0 gpm (3.8-1.9 liters).Standard flow rate for kitchen faucets is 2.2 gpm (8.3 liters). The lower the flow rate, the more you’ll save.
Aerators themselves are inexpensive. Altogether, using an aerator is the most cost-effective way to conserve water.
Bring an old or leaky aerator to the home improvement store with you, to ensure the one you purchase will fit your faucet.
If you have a faucet without internal threading for an aerator, considering updating to a newer faucet with a built in aerator. Prices vary, but there are many options below $100.

, Low-flow shower heads can save as much as 60% of the water you’re using in the shower. Further, they can cost as little as $10 to $20. Simply by using low-flow faucets and shower heads, your household will likely save thousands of gallons of water each year.Use a shower head with a flow rate under 2.5 gpm (9.5 liters).
Either aerating or laminar-flow shower heads can be good low-flow options. However, laminar-flow shower heads create less steam, and may be preferable in humid climates.
If your shower heads were installed before 1992, they likely have excessive flow-rates. Replace them at your earliest convenience.

, There’s an easy way to determine whether your shower head is using too much water. Place a bucket with marked measurements beneath your shower head, where it will catch the water. Turn the shower on. If your shower head allows you to adjust the pressure, set it to normal pressure. Time how long it take for the bucket to fill to the 1 gallon (3.8 liter) mark.If the bucket fills with this amount of water within 20 seconds, you will save money and conserve significant water by replacing the shower head with a low-flow option.

Look for the ENERGY STAR® label.,
Selecting an energy efficient dishwasher.,
Choosing an energy efficient clothes washer.",How to Cut Water Heating Costs3," If you’re on the market for a new dishwasher or clothes washer, opt for one that is labeled as energy efficient. These machines will immediately reduce your water-heating costs. For instance, replacing a 10-yr old clothes washer can save you well over $100 a year. Similarly, an energy efficient dishwasher will use much less energy overall, reducing not only your water heating costs but your electricity costs as well., EnergyGuide labeling, which will project the expected annual cost of operating the washer, cannot be relied upon entirely. This is in part because smaller dishwashers, such as “compact” options, will be scored as more energy efficient, but will also wash less dishes per load. If you live in a multi-person home, a full capacity dishwasher is likely a better option.Choose an option with a booster heater. This feature heats water as it enters the machine. This is important because high water temperature is better for washing dishes. Ultimately, a booster heater allows you to keep the temperature on your water heater’s tank at an energy efficient level, and still clean your dishes effectively.
Choose an option with different wash cycle options. The ability to choose shorter cycles to wash dishes that require less cleaning will allow you to save water and water heating costs.

, An energy efficient clothes washer will cost about three times less to operate than a traditional washer. Generally, front-loading washing machines will use less water. Opt for a machine that allows you to select water temperatures for each cycle, and use cold water whenever possible. Always use cold water to rinse.Again, smaller models will have better EnergyGuide ratings, though a full-size option is better if it means running less loads.

Turn your tank’s thermostat to 120°F (49°C).,
Drain the tank’s sediment.,
Insulate hot water pipes.,
Insulate the water tank itself.,
Attach the material as close to the tank’s surface as you can.,
Install a timer on your water heater.",How to Cut Water Heating Costs4," Most homes are equipped with conventional water heaters that store hot water in tanks. Water is constantly reheated as it cools down naturally. This is an inefficient process that leads to considerable costs, but there are a few steps you can take to improve your water heater’s efficiency. For instance, you will save 3-5% on your water heating costs for every 10°F (12°C) reduction in the tank’s standing water temperature.Since water heaters are usually set to 140°F (60°C), you’ll likely be saving a good amount just be taking this step.
Don’t trust the heater’s thermostat. (Some won’t have numbers anyway.) Instead, carefully hold a thermometer beneath the faucet farthest from the water heater and turn the hot water on full blast. After a few seconds, read the thermometer. This will establish the tank’s temp.
Go back to the hot water heater and check it's thermostat. If it’s accurate - great. If it’s not, write down the actual temperature next to a mark at the level shown.
Using the temperature you found as a guide, turn down the water heater’s thermostat to whatever you think will bring the actual temp of the water’s tank down to 120°F (49°C).
Wait two hours or more and take the water’s temperature at the faucet you tested earlier. It may take a few adjustments of the water heater’s thermostat to get the tank’s temperature to 120°F (49°C). Once you do, mark the water heater’s thermostat at the level that maintains this temperature.

, Your water heater’s tank will gradually build up deposits. Fortunately, you don't have to drain the entire tank to keep these deposits from accumulating. Drain a quart of water from the tank every three months to keep the heater working at its peak efficiency.To do so, turn off the water running to the water heater, as well as the heater’s power. For gas units, set the burner on “pilot.” Connect a hose to the spigot at the tank’s base, and run the other end to a drain. Lift the pressure-relief valve on the tank and open the spigot. Take care not to let the water touch you or anyone else.

, Make sure the pipes that hold your hot water are well insulated. This will keep the water several degrees warmer, preventing unnecessary reheating. You can use self-sealing sleeves that cost a few dollars each and can easily be slipped onto pipes.In particular, look for exposed pipes in your basement or crawlspace.

, Many hot water heaters are equipped with a layer of insulation wrapped around the water heater’s tank. However, many older tanks did not include this feature. If your tank does not have insulation on it, or is rated with an R-value lower than 24, wrap it in an insulation blanket and seal it with heat-resistant tape.A roughly $20 insulation blanket can easily be installed and will reduce heat loss from the tank by as much as 45%. This can save you as much as 9% on your water-heating costs.

, Do not cover the top and the bottom of the water heater. Further, take care not to block a thermostat, or the air inlet/exhaust on a gas unit. See the manufacturer’s warning for specific locations.Do not insulate a unit that already has insulation on it. This will not improve the unit’s efficiency.

, Timers can turn off your water heater at night, or any other time you know hot water won’t be needed in your home. Some places also charge more during periods of peak demand, and you can set the timer to turn off for this period to save money as well."
"
Replace an old or inefficient hot water heater.,
Make sure you have the right hook-ups.,
Weigh the benefits of a tankless water heater.,
Look into heat-pump and solar systems.,
Check the EnergyGuide and Energy Factor labels.",How to Cut Water Heating Costs5," If your unit is over seven years old, replacing it now with a more energy efficient option will almost certainly save you money in the long run.Hot water units are generally expected to last 10-15 years, but will be less cost-efficient than newer models well before they stop working.

, If you’re looking to replace a conventional storage tank model with a newer, more efficient model, you may have to go with the same type of power supply. For instance, if the old model was electric or gas, the corresponding hookup may determine the type of model you’ll need to get.If the old heater was electric but your home is already equipped with gas (natural or propane), you may be able to run a gas line to the location of your water heater and go with a more efficient, gas-powered option for your new hot water heater.

, Tankless water heaters greatly reduce heat loss and can cut your water heating costs by 10-20%. These units usually sit near the fixture that supplies you with hot water, though large centralized units can't sometimes supply multiple fixtures. They are only usable in certain situations, however.If you live in a multi-person household that requires several uses of hot water simultaneously, even a large, centralized tankless unit will likely be insufficient.
You can use small tankless models on fixtures far from your water heater to reduce the main heater’s overall efficiency.
Tankless water heaters last about 20 years, and cost anywhere from $200-$1000.
While any type of tankless unit will be much less expensive to operate that a conventional unit, gas-powered tankless units will be more efficient than electric units.
Unfortunately, temperature variability will likely increase with a tankless water heater.

, New technologies, such as units that move hot water around with pumps or heat water with the sun, are also increasingly available. While installation costs are generally high, the newest water heating options allow you to reduce your water-heating costs substantially., Conventional hot water heaters are labeled with their expected annual operating cost, or an EnergyGuide rating. Energy Factor labels, on the other hand, refer to the actual energy efficiency of the unit. The higher the Energy Factor number, the more efficient the unit. These labels will make comparison shopping much easier.Meanwhile, one of the other important factors to be aware of is the unit’s capacity - which will indicate how many gallons of hot water the unit will provide for an hour, starting with a full tank. Don’t rely on the units physical size to indicate its capacity - look for this “first hour” rating instead.
In general, newer units of comparable abilities to older models will cost nearly 20% less to run per year, mostly on account of less heat loss.
When in doubt, go with the option that has a higher Energy Factor rating. Though the initial cost may be higher, you’ll save more money in the long run.

Determine the size of the fan your home will need.,
Ensure that the home has at least 1.5 times the area for discharge as the opening you cut into the ceiling for the fan.,
Determine where the best intake locations are (windows or doors).,
Close the damper on the fireplace.,
Open only the windows that have screens in the room(s) in which you are in.,
Consider adding additional vents for the attic space.,
Be safe.",How to Use a Whole House Fan," Calculate the square footage of your home. Most whole-house fan manufacturers will list the capability of the fan to the square footage of your house. Some believe a complete change of the home's air should be accomplished every 3 or 4 minutes.


Many fans include a CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute) rating. The greater the CFM value, the more air it can move. Simply divide your home's cubic feet by the fan's CFM rating to result in the number of minutes to exchange the air.
Consider that larger value CFM fans often have a larger physical size and/or higher rotational speed. As a result, they may be more noisy than lower value CFM types. Noise levels might also dictate where in the home the fan should be installed. A 2000 square foot home with 8 foot (2.4 m) high ceilings will, in theory, have all the air in the house completely changed in 8 minutes with a 2000 CFM fan (and windows open in each room). Likewise, a 4000 CFM fan will do it in as little as 4 minutes!
Here's how one arrives at those figures. A 2000 CFM fan moves 2000 cubic foot volume of air in a minute. A 2000 square foot house with an 8 foot (2.4 m) high ceilings has 16,000 cubic feet of space (2,000 sq/ft area * 8 ft = 16,000 cubic feet). 16,000 cubic feet of space divided by the capacity of the fan, 2,000 cubic feet per minute, equals 8 minutes (16,000 cu/ft volume of air divided by 2,000 cu/ft of air moved per minute = 8 minutes to move that volume of air).;
, The air being drawn up by the whole-house fan needs to be discharged somewhere, and you want that process to move smoothly.


Example: a 2' X 2' opening for a fan results in 4 sq Ft. So, this 4 sq Ft X 1.5 = 6 sq Ft. Look around your attic. If you have 2 gable vents that are 1' x 2' = 2 sq Ft each, equaling only 4 sq Ft total. You probably have screens over them, so knock off 20% to 30% from 4 sq ft and you're down to around 3 feet (0.9 m). If you do not have adequate exhaust vent area, add some.
Ridge vent, soffit vents or enlarge the existing gable end vents are ways to obtain adequate exhaust ventilation area. Deduct for any and all blockages (screens, slats, lattice, etc). Generally, 10 sq Ft of attic discharge area is more than sufficient per fan in residential applications.
That said, only very largest of homes would require multiple fans, and that is only when many windows are open and the resulting breeze is not satisfactory. Of course, closing windows increases the air flow (CFM) through those that are left open. More on this below.

, These locations will have screens. Locations without screens are unsuitable. The fan should not be behind a door, but rather in a common hallway.

, If the damper is left open, outside air will be drawn down the chimney, bringing in soot and odor.

, A 2000 CFM whole house fan will try to move 2000 CFM of air. This fan is limited only by the fan's 2000 CFM rating and the amount of area to intake (windows) and discharge (gable & ridge vents, etc) air area. Pulling that 2000 CFM through 2 or 3 windows instead of 10 windows results in a much stronger breeze.


Let's do the math: 2000 CFM via 10 windows = 200 CFM per window. Now, close all but the 4 windows of the rooms you're in. 2000 CFM via 4 windows = 500 CFM per window (If windows are large enough)! That's a big difference. It's this breeze that creates the evaporative cooling of the skin.

Moving air in an unoccupied room for hours doesn't make it feel cooler than it would if you had just entered it and then opened its windows. You can turn this into cash in electric bill savings by running the fan at a lower speed with 2 or 3 open windows instead of high speed with 10+ open windows.
Don't run the fan when no one is home, as this just wastes electricity. The instant the fan is turned on, it creates a breeze that immediately cools you down. You can't get that kind of instant relief when you turn on an air conditioner.

Maximize your savings: Windows that are open on the shaded side of a house will bring in much cooler air than those open above a sun drenched blacktop.

, Allowing hot air trapped anywhere in the attic out prevents that heat from radiating downward through the ceiling into the living space, and reduces cooling load.


Turbine ventilators work great, but strong winds can cause a downdraft and create static pressure, which will destroy the fan's ability to exhaust the home's air.
Under eave vents are inexpensive to buy, inexpensive to mount, and provide a great way to exhaust the air. If your house has eaves, mount as many as possible under the eaves to allow proper ventilation. This is the best way to exhaust, as the effects are twofold: The first is that hot stale attic air is exhausted out, and second, with under eave vents the air travels along the roof line and down, which provides cross-ventilation for the attic itself. These are much easier to add than a ridge vent or powered attic ventilator.

, Have your work permitted and inspected. Most localities observe the National Electrical Code or some derivative of it. Follow your local code.


If you insist on doing it yourself, make sure you install a service switch in the attic if it is possible to work on the fan from the attic space. An outlet nearby would probably come in handy to plug in a drop light or power tool.

Understand the pros and cons of owning a tankless water heater.,
Tankless water heaters are more expensive than conventional tank heaters but still can provide a return on investment.,
Understand that you may or may not receive tax credits and incentives based on your location.

",How to Choose a Tankless Water Heater1," On the pro side, a tankless water heater can provide an endless supply of hot water. You don’t have the standby energy loss with a tankless water heater that you do with a standard model that keeps a large quantity of water ready. It saves energy and has a smaller carbon footprint due to its smaller physical size which uses less materials and subsequently reduces transportation costs. Life expectancy is 20 years or more and they are less prone to corrosion since there is no water tank. Parts are also easily replaceable which can extend their life even further. On the con side, if the system isn't adequate for your home, you will never have the hot water you desire. It is really important that you choose the right system and that it is properly installed. Tankless hot water heaters are more expensive than their conventional counterparts and cost more to install.;
, It can take several years to realize the extra savings because of the expensive initial cost and potential extra dollars spent on proper installation.

Consider natural gas or propane.,
Look at electrical tankless heaters.,
Realize that even if you install a gas model, it must have electrical connections to operate the sensors and switches.,
Check with your local town or city officials regarding building code requirements in your area.

,
Evaluate long-term utility rates in your area as you study how to choose a tankless water heater.,
Factor in installation options including space requirements for the tankless heater.",How to Choose a Tankless Water Heater2," This type of tankless heating system must have vents to the exterior of the house. You also must have adequate gas line piping. Gas tankless water heaters can produce greater water flow (gpm) gallons per minute with higher temperature rise so are better for whole house systems than electric.

, Your house’s electrical set up must be able to provide adequate amperage, voltage and a circuit breaker.

, These connections must also meet amperage and voltage requirements and may have to have a separate circuit breaker.

,, This may be the final determining factor in choosing a gas or electric model.

, Furthermore, factor in labor and material costs of installation.

, There are many online calculators to help you with this step of the process. It is important that a tankless water heater works within its capacity so you need to know your required flow rate (gpm) and your temperature rise (which is the difference between your inlet or incoming water temperature and outlet temperature or the desired temperature of hot water)

Understand window insulation film.,
Choose windows to insulate.,
Prepare windows.,
Open the box of window insulation film and take out the tape.,
Test tape adhesion.,
Apply the tape to the frame.,
Rub down the tape using firm pressure.,
Remove the backing from the top piece and about six inches from each side piece at the top end.

,
Unpack the film.,
Think about how to best fit the film to the window.,
Unfold the first 12 inches (30.5 cm) of film along the entire width of the window.,
If the bundle of film is dusty, put the dusty surfaces on the outside, toward the room, so they can be cleaned off.,
Work down the window attaching the film.,
Peel off the last few inches and the bottom tape while holding the film away from the tape with the other hand.,
Carefully rub down the film onto the tape all the way round.,
Trim the excess film with a snap-off knife.,
Use a hair dryer to shrink the film, removing wrinkles.",How to Install Window Insulation Film," The window insulation film this article discusses, and which most hardware stores carry, is heat-shrink film stretched across the interior window frame to form a bubble that blocks drafts and disrupts convection of the indoor air mass across the too-cold (or too-warm) glass. Window laminate films that stick directly to the glass like automotive window tint, to shade, insulate, and reinforce, are very different.;
, You won't be able to open the window without removing the film, so leave at least one window near the kitchen uninsulated in case you have to air it out after burning food. You may want to leave windows on opposite ends of the house uninsulated to open them for a breeze when the weather is nice if you don't want to re-insulate each winter. You won't be able to reach window blinds after applying insulation, and a lack of opaque window covering lets a lot of heat radiate in or out, so don't apply insulation where blinds are involved unless you have curtains to shade the window at night or want the blinds permanently closed or mostly-closed (perhaps angled to let some light in at an angle without being able to see straight through). A window that will be brushed against frequently is also not a good candidate because the film and its tape attachment are not very strong.

, It's most efficient to insulate all you want to insulate at once. Remove debris from around the lower sash, close the window, lock it, clean the window and frame, and clean and adjust the blinds if any (a vacuum works well for light dust on them). Allow the window and frame to dry.

, Just use fingers, not sharp objects, to open the box, lest you damage the bundle of film inside. Leave the film itself for later.


If you run out of tape, tell the manufacturer you ran out and need more. It will likely be sent for free. The long rolls of double sided tape that is fairly weak so as not to lift paint are not widely available to buy on their own.

,


Stick a small piece of tape onto the frame.
If the tape pulls off very easily, there is moisture or grease on the frame.

Clean off grease with a rag and residue-free solvent such as methylated spirits or white spirit (apparently common in the UK) or rubbing alcohol (common in the US).
Wipe off moisture and use gentle heat to evaporate away any that remains. Turn up the thermostat several degrees, or operate a space heater in the general area of the window. Make sure any humidifier has been turned off and you haven't boiled or washed anything with hot water for a few hours.


Metal frames are more difficult. It is harder to remove the moisture from metal framed windows because the cold metal attracts fresh moisture very quickly. Metal frames must be smooth; any loose paint or rust should be removed. Just use a plastic brush to scrub off the excess; leave marring them more or exposing more of a vulnerable surface for repainting time.

, It goes on the front of the molding and on the sill right in front of the vertical moldings. Put it just inside a ridge on the molding, if the style has one, to keep it straight and protected by the molding edge. Cut an end in the proper place with a scissors before laying it down. When you finish one piece, rub down the corner and peel the backing paper about an inch (a few centimeters) to overlap it with the next piece. Be careful not to touch the sticky side or the frame area where the with your fingers because this creates a layer of grease which reduces the adhesion.

, (Use a couple of scrunched up paper kitchen towels.)

,, The film is thin and easily damaged by hard objects. It also has static cling, so keep it away from dirt and dust, preferably off the floor. If the package contains multiple sheets of film, unpack only one at a time; if the package contains one big sheet, consider how to position it on and trim it off each window for minimum waste.

, If you have individual window-sized sheets, it should be easy, but if you have very tall windows measure first. It may be a tight fit so you'll have to leave narrow margins, or even extend the film to reach the full length. You can splice sheets with the double-sided tape, or even extend them a little with wide clear mailing tape (which could possibly lift paint). These imperfect fixes are more easily hidden at the top of the window after attaching the film from the bottom up than at the bottom after attaching the film top-down as usual. If you have one huge sheet, or a part of it left over after insulating a set of windows or sliding glass door, it may be more efficiently used the ""wide"" way across the wall rather than the ""long"" way.

, Leave the remainder of the film stuck together. The film is tightly stuck together because of static and can be tricky to separate. If it won't separate easily, moisten thumb and fingers and rub the edge of the folded film film gently between them until it separates. (This can take a little while and you will notice that the friction increases until the film separates.) The folded edge can be recognised because it is a bit crinkly when the film is laid flat. Do not unroll the film before applying it because the inside surfaces facing the glass will immediately start to attract dust. Stick the top edge of the film to the tape, centering the film side-to-side so there is a little excess on each side.

, To do this, present the window insulation film to the top of the frame as you unfold it such that so that the clean inside surfaces that emerge as you begin to unfold face the window.

, Unroll about six inches at a time from the bundle of film, peel the tape backing paper off (or pull it off all at once), and stick the film to the tape. Keep the sides slightly taut and even from side to side. Wrinkles are OK: they will be removed later.

, Attach the bottom of the film. Do not pull the film tight; rather, push in on it a little to make sure it sticks to the full width of the tape across the sill, including at the corners. This is a common weak point because tension tends to pull the film up off the tape on the sill, rather than straight across it as with the tape on the other molding.


If the tape comes off the sill later, you can fix the problem with clear mailing tape (which doesn't look quite perfect and can lift paint).

, Do not use a hard object. A clean cloth would work well.

, Pull very gently at the film where you are cutting it to keep it perpendicular to the window and tape, and, holding the knife parallel to and pointing away from the center of the window, trim the excess film a fraction of an inch (less than a centimeter) from the edge of the tape. This eliminates a need to scrape the window frame near the tape. Holding the knife swept back so that the film sweeps by as it cuts rather than bunching up at a single point on it will cut more smoothly. Care is needed because the film can tear across the line of the tape. The small excess of film will curl up even further when heat is applied and not be noticeable.


Be very careful to stand so that you would not fall onto the window if you fall, and to extend the knife very little and hold it so that you would be unlikely to cut yourself badly in case of an accident.

, Hold it a few inches away; you'll see the film begin to shrink. Closer will not work better: it'll just reduce the airflow, potentially overheating the dryer or damaging the film. Work in a pattern, for instance, a spiral from the corners towards the centre. Shrinkage in one space will remove wrinkles all over. Don't try to shrink one area enough to remove all wrinkles before proceeding to the next. That will cause uneven tension and, possibly, separate the film from the tape.


If the hair dryer turns off on its own, it has probably overheated. It probably has a thermal protector that will reset itself if the dryer is unplugged and allowed to cool for up to a half-hour.

Consider the different possibilities for insulating your shipping container home.,
Don't use traditional methods unless they're corrosion-proof or won't promote condensation.,
Prefer spray-on type insulation.",How to Insulate a Shipping Container Home," Some of the possibilities include:

Spray-on insulation



 


Roll-on insulation






Some type of ecological insulation, such as egg cartons, etc.





;
, Most homes, in the traditional fashion, are insulated on the interior with fiberglass or wool. If you apply this concept to container homes, the end result may be corrosion or too much condensation on the inside of the walls due to too much water or vapors.

, Polyurethane foam works best in combination with ceramic insulation paint. The paint is obvious for the exterior of the shipping container, while the foam is for the interior.


The paint contains a special gas that contains inside bubbles, which gives it a high thermal efficiency. The spray-on foam is available in both “open-cell” and “closed-cell”. The difference is in the price tag, density, strength, R-factor and in waterproofing.

Wrap your hot water tank in a cosy 80 mm jacket.",How to Insulate Your Home," Fit draught excluders around all exterior doors, and interior if needs be. Sealant strips can be bought cheaply from DIY stores and are very easy to fit - just like applying sticky tape. Don't forget to get a brush trim for letter boxes, bigger gaps and the bottom of doors.;
, Cracks and crevices around window frames are a popular escape point for warm air. To check for weak points in your window, run the palm of your hand around the edge of the frame. If you feel a breeze, you've got a hole. Patch the weak points up with a putty or sealer.


To make it really easy on yourself get the type that comes in a tube. Squirt it on, smooth it over, job done.

, It's worth investing in double glazing if you don't already have it. This could save you between up to hundreds of dollars or pounds on your annual heating bill.

, Closing curtains or blinds after dark also traps in the warm air and prevents draughts. And it looks cozy too! Use curtains and blinds with thermal backing for added warmth retention.

, Most homes have gaps between the skirting board and the floor, and if your have floorboards there's likely to be a few gaps between them too. This is a job for the silicone sealer. If you have a wood floor and want to insulate thoroughly, you could get the experts in to fit floor insulation beneath the boards. Putting a rug down isn't a bad idea either.

, Laying loft insulation on the average home can save a whopping 1 tonne of carbon dioxide a year, and make a major dent in you bills. This is one of the most efficient energy savings options, it is cheap and simple, any person with no experience can do this. It is just to get fiberglass wool and cover all places under your ruff you have access to, fill all gaps in your home around your rooms with it; it costs some 5 Euro or US$6.80 per meter square for 15 centimeter (5.9 in) thick Glass wool. Glass wool is made of mixture of natural sand and recycled glass at 1,450 °C (2642 °F), the glass that is produced is converted into fibers. Glass wool is recyclable material.

, If you have some ""cold wall"" in your home , usually concrete wall with no or with bad insulation you can build 10–15 centimeter (3.9–5.9 in) thick dry wall to it. Process is very simple , you can choose between Ytong wall or plasterboard wall. Plasterboard wall is very simple to build and you can add very good and very cheap Glass wool into it. Glass wool is excellent insulator but you can get glass wool for soundproofing. Both kind of walls are Fire-resistant.

, This will cut heat loss by 75 %, and you'll recoup the cost of it in less than 6 months.

Measure the width between your studs - most common is 16"" on center; also measure the depth of the studs - most are 4"" dimensional lumber, but if they're thicker you'll need deeper insulation to fill the void properly.
,Measure the size of the area you want to cover - width and height.,
Go to a home improvement/building supply with your measurements to purchase the insulation needed.,
There are different R-values of insulation (the higher the R value, the better it will insulate.),
If you are using fiberglass insulation, you'll need to wear gloves, eye protection, a face mask and long sleeved clothing.,Paper-faced insulation should be inserted into the wall cavity with paper facing out.,
Measure the length required to fill the cavity, with the insulation on the floor, and with the paper side facing up, cut though it with a utility knife.,

Once you have finished installing the insulation, remove all the clothing that you wore and wash it immediately.,You can now proceed to cover the walls with drywall or paneling.",How to Install Insulation Batting,",, It is sold in various widths (and thicknesses) depending on the width and depth of the studs. Always get the proper size - never compress the insulation or you'll reduce it's effectiveness., There are two R-value scales, one US customary and one metric; US customary R-values are 5.68 times metric R-values. The most common is fiberglass insulation, but you can also buy insulation made of minerals, paper, and insulation made of recycled blue jeans. Any materials that could burn are treated with a fire retardant., Small pieces of glass are embedded the insulation and will itch if they contact your skin, or irritate your lungs and eyes. You should always wear eye protection and a face mask with any type of insulation to protect your eyes and lungs from small fragments of insulation that become airborne.,, You'll have to press down on the insulation to make a cut through it., Do not compress it around outlets and other obstacles - simply cut an opening. If there is wiring or plumbing in the wall, the insulation goes behind it if you don't have to compress it too much; otherwise cut the insulation in half width-wise and put half behind the wiring/plumbing and half in front of it., This keeps warm moist air inside your house from migrating behind the wall. Moisture can cause mold problems and will lower the value of your insulation if it gets wet., Cover any seams in the vapor barrier with special tape made for the purpose (called ""tuck tape""). You want to have an air proof seal in front of the insulation to prevent air migration from inside your home that has moisture from causing mold formation on the cold walls., If any insulation has touched your skin, wash using COLD water only - hot or warm water will only make your skin more irritated.,"

Choose the right type of humidifier for your needs.,
Read the humidifier manual.,
Assemble the humidifier if needed.,
Rinse out the water reservoir.,
Add water to the reservoir.,
Position your humidifier.,
Turn on and adjust any settings.,
Clean the humidifier regularly.",How to Use a Humidifier," There are many different types of humidifiers on the market, so finding the best humidifier for your needs and circumstances is very important. A few of the most common humidifiers include:



Central humidifiers. Central humidifiers are used to humidify an entire house. They are built into the house’s heating and cooling system.Evaporators. Evaporators are smaller humidifiers that use filters and fans to add moisture to the air. These types of humidifiers tend to be very affordable. Impeller humidifiers. Impeller humidifiers release a cool mist into the air. This is especially good news for people who have children in the house. These humidifiers use fast moving disks to release their mist, and they work best for single rooms. Steam vaporizers. Steam vaporizers heat up the water in the water reservoirs and the force the water to cool before releasing it into the air as a mist. These are the most economically friendly humidifiers, but they can release hotter mists, which can cause burns.Ultrasonic humidifiers. Ultrasonic humidifiers use vibrations to release moisture into the air. Since these come in both cool and warm mist variations, they are a good choice for a home with children. Pick one that is sized properly for your intended use and room volume and be aware that they will vary in cost depending on size and features.;
, Humidifiers come in many styles, each with a set of recommended settings and care instructions. The instructions may differ from others you have owned so it is important to carefully read the instructions for your specific humidifier.

, With the help of the owner’s manual, put together any apparatuses that need to be assembled before your humidifier can be used. This can include things like adding wheels for mobility, basic assembly of the humidifier, or personal preference settings (such as the size of the mist opening).

, Remove the water reservoir and clean it with mild soap and water before using the humidifier. This will clear out any residue from the manufacturing process, so you aren’t breathing those in when the humidifier is in use. 2.

, Once the reservoir is cleaned, add in some distilled water.Some humidifiers allow for tap water to be used, but distilled water is going to be free of any additives that tap water contains. There should be a marked water line on the water reservoir. Add the water up until this indicated water line.


If a filter must be added directly to the water, this is when to do so.

, Your humidifier should be on a level, raised surface at least 12 inches away from walls.Choose a spot that is high up with nothing underneath, like on top of a dresser. .


Don't place your humidifier underneath a shelf or near paper or curtains. Nearby objects tend to get dampened by the humidifier.

, Plug in and power on the humidifier. Some humidifiers may have buttons or knobs that adjust the settings, so use these tools to change anything to your personal preference. If you are confused about what settings you should use or what any of the buttons or knobs mean, consult your owner’s manual.


Some humidifiers have a small space that allows you to add things like essential oils or vapor rub to the mist. This would be the time to add those items if desired. However, if your humidifier doesn’t explicitly say that it is compatible with those items, don’t use them.
Recommended humidity levels are normally between 30–50%.When not in use, turn off the humidifier. The humidifier should not be going in an empty room.

, A humidifier should be cleaned at least twice a week for regular users.This will help prevent any bacterial growths from forming in the humidifier and in the water. For less frequent users, your cleaning habits should be very diligent, since bacteria and mold can grow between longer intervals of time between uses.


Water and mild soap work well for basic cleaning, but hydrogen peroxide and white vinegar can also kill bacteria.

Determine whether you can blow in the insulation from the outside or inside the house.,
Determine which side of the wall will be best for you to drill into and then repair.,
If you have a 2 or more story house you may want to consider installing from indoors to avoid being high on a ladder or you might want to install the first floor from the exterior and the higher floors from inside.,
Go to the rental store and check the blower machine that you'll use to see what the nozzle size is.,
Drill a 1 inch (2.5 cm) hole (or the size of the nozzle) between each stud at the top of each story of the house that you are insulating.,
Check your basement to see if the first floor wall cavity is sealed or opens up to the basement.,
Check or create access holes to your attic and knee-walls.,
Insulate any attic knee-walls with rolls of fiberglass insulation.

,
Prepare a crawl way in the attic so you are able to reach all places in the attic.,
Prevent your attic ventilation from being blocked with insulation.,
Rent the blower.,
Now you can start filling the holes!,
First, have the nozzle holder place the nozzle into your first hole.,
Next, blow the insulation into the attic.,
Clean up the machine and return it to the store.

,
Seal up your attic access holes.,Patch the holes

,Clean up

",How to Blow in Cellulose Insulation," Installing cellulose is extremely dusty and dirty. Installing from the inside the clean up is considerable. Carpets and furniture should be removed or covered. Dust will cover the walls, ceiling, windows, floor, basically everywhere. Exterior installation, clean up might involve a quick rake and sweep around your house. One inch holes have to be drilled between each stud in your wall, above and below all windows and above doors. Probably, the biggest amount of time will be spent drilling holes and then repairing them when you are done.;
, Interior side of the walls are usually dry-wall and can be easily patched but again is messy. Exterior side of the wall depends on the type of siding you have on your home. You may want to remove a couple of rows of your siding to drill the holes or you can drill through your siding if you can determine whether you can patch it without being noticeable afterward. For example, if you have wood siding you could drill through it and then patch with a wooden dowel and wood glue then paint to match the rest of the siding.

, Determine where your studs, electric lines, air vents, and anything else you want to avoid during installation. Ask yourself if you are comfortable drilling into your walls and that you can repair the holes. If you are, then you can continue down this list otherwise it's time to find a contractor.

, Usually it's 1 inch (2.5 cm) but if bigger or smaller you'll need to know because the nozzle needs to fit tightly into the holes you drill in the wall. If you drilled the hole too big for the nozzle, you'll have problems trying the hold the insulation in or the nozzle will go in too deep and hit the other side of the wall. If the holes are too small then you'll have issues with the nozzle clogging.

, You'll probably need a stud finder and a tape measure to help you find the studs. Try to center the hole between the two studs. Start with one hole near the top of the wall 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) below the ceiling or if installing from the exterior then under the floor of the next story. During installation you might notice a space will get filled up too quickly compared to other places in the wall. At that time you may want to consider another hole about 3 feet (0.9 m) above the floor of that story. If installing from the exterior, make sure you do not drill holes above the ceiling of the story, if you do you might end up insulating part of the area between floors or attic instead of your wall.

, If it's opened, you'll have to seal the cavity or the insulation will flow down into the basement. You are now done with the prep work to install the insulation in the walls, next is the attic.

, If you don't have an access door to your attic you'll have to cut into the ceiling between studs or you can even create a door from outside into your attic. Do what is ever easier for you.

,, Once inside your attic, be careful not to step through the floor/ceiling. Step only on the studs. You might want to install wood planks on top of the studs to create a safe crawl way if there isn't one already. Before you nail or screw the planks to the stud check the depth of the area from the top of the stud to the bottom of the attic ceiling, some attic ceilings are made with 2x4s or even smaller. If it's only 4 inches (10.2 cm) depth you should nail another 2x4 on top of the stud to make the depth deeper so you can install more insulation without burying your walk way. Make the board as long as the width of your wood planks. Nail them to the studs and then install the wood plank over top. Now you have a nice place to sit and crawl.

, Ventilation in your attic is very important. In the wintertime if heat is trapped in the attic, the heat will melt the snow on the roof and then create ice dams and then you'll have water leaking into your home. In the summertime, excessive heat trapped in the attic can damage your roof, usually by warping the wood the shingles are attached to. You might already have this problem if there's no insulation in your attic and no vents. Usually, air vents are at the top of the roof at the peak or mid-way through and soffit vents underneath bottom of the roof. You can buy plastic or foam shields to install to protect the soffit vents from being blocked. If there are no soffit or gable vents I would recommend installing some.

, The blower should come with a long about 6 inch (15.2 cm) diameter hose and a nozzle that reduces down to 1 inch (2.5 cm). Ask for directions from the store you rented it from on how to operate the machine. You can use duct tape to secure the hose to the blower and the nozzle to the hose if the blower isn't equipped with a locking mechanism to keep the hose together.

, This is at least a two person job. One person will operate the blower, turn the machine on and off and fill the hopper with insulation. The other person will manage the hose and hold the nozzle tightly into the holes. If you drilled more than one hole per space between studs you'll want to start with the lower one and you'll probably want to cover the other hole until you are ready to fill it because insulation will be blown out of the other hole. The nozzle should fit tightly into the hole otherwise the insulation will shoot back at you.

, Then have the blower operator turn the machine on and slowly start putting insulation into the hopper. If the hopper has a gate to stop the insulation start with it closed and then slowly open it. You probably shouldn't open it up all the way while using the nozzle. The nozzle can clog the insulation inside the hose if the insulation is feed to fast or the nozzle is blocked. Try to avoid clogging the hose as best you can. The blower will usually sound different, louder and higher pitched, when the insulation has stopped flowing through the hose. When this happens turn off the blower right away. While filling a hole insulation should flow freely through the hose while there is still room in the cavity. The different sound from the blower should signal to the blower operator to run the machine off quickly. The nozzle operator might be able to notice the follow has stopped from the hose first and should yell back to the blower operator to turn off the blower to avoid a clog. The blower operator will have to juggle the task of constantly and slowly adding cellulose to the hopper and listening to shut down the blower. Depending on the height of the wall, it should only take a couple of minutes to fill a cavity. If it's taking longer than a couple of minutes then you can open the hopper gate wider and go faster or the cellulose might be escaping to somewhere in the house like your basement or the area between the two floors. It's best to turn off the machine between each hole to avoid excess mess. That's all there is to it!

, You can take the nozzle off for this step. One person should control the hose and again another person controlling the blower. Start away from your access hole and work your way back to the hole. Try to keep the insulation at the same thickness.

,, You can create doors or just cover it back up with dry-wall or plaster to match. Just make sure you find a way to insulate the hole first. You can purchase foam covers or you can use fiberglass insulation and attach it to the drywall or wood you are using for a door.

Measure the square footage of your room.,
Consult a sizing guide to determine what ceiling fan sweep will work for the square footage of your room.,
Measure the height of your room.,
Assess the ceiling for possible obstacles.,
Determine how you want to use the fan.,
Think about how different size ceiling fans will look in the space.,
Determine what kind of supports you have in the ceiling for your ceiling fan.",How to Size a Ceiling Fan," This will help you determine what diameter ceiling fan will fit in the space.


Measure the length and width of your room, then simply multiply the measurements together. This will give you the square footage of your room.
When looking at the diameter of different brands of fan, you may find the diameter of its span listed as its ""sweep."";
, A guideline for sizing ceiling fans has been determined by the American Lighting Association.For rooms 75 square feet or smaller, your ceiling fan should be 36 inches or less in diameter.
For rooms between 75 and 144 square feet, your ceiling fan should have a diameter of 36 to 42 inches.
For larger rooms, with a square footage around 225, a 50 to 52 inch blade span, or even larger, are best.

, You need to install a ceiling fan high enough so that it poses no risk of hitting someone. Larger ceiling fans tend to be have a larger drop from the ceiling, so you need to take their drop into consideration when picking what size ceiling fan you want to install.


The American Lighting Association recommends that you should put a ceiling fan at least 7 feet above the floor.This means that you should probably not install a ceiling fan in a room that has a very low ceiling. It also means that you need to look at the drop of any ceiling fans you are considering, making sure that the lowest point of the fan will be above 7 feet at minimum.
Most ceiling fans come with an optional down rod, an attachment that can lower the fan away from the ceiling.If you have very tall ceilings, you may want to use it so that the fan can move the air in the room efficiently.
For low ceilings, you will want to flush-mount the fan. If your ceilings are very close to 7 feet tall, there are even some ""hugger"" or ""low-profile"" models., You will need to make sure that there are not obstacles on the ceiling that paddles could hit. Make sure there are no other lights in the way or architectural features that will create an obstacle to the rotation of the fan.


If you have obstacles that cannot be moved, you may need to downsize the size of ceiling fan you install.

, The purpose of a ceiling fan can vary. You can install them just for moving air around slightly or to cooling a space dramatically. If you want a lot of air movement, you will need to get a larger ceiling fan.


You may want a ceiling fan that has a light integrated into it, so that it can function as a light and a fan. Ceiling fans with light kits, the term for the light fixtures attached to the bottom, will usually have a greater depth. This means that you need an even higher ceiling for a ceiling fan with a light on it, than one with without.

, The bigger the fan, the more room it will take up and the more noticeable it will be. While there are many stylish options to choose from, taking the look into consideration when deciding on a size of ceiling fan is important.


If you are concerned about a fan standing out in a space, and you are determined to get a certain size, try getting your ceiling fan in a color that matches the ceiling. It will stand out less than one in a bright or shiny color.

, Once you have decided what size fan you want, you will need to make sure that you have enough support in the ceiling to handle its weight and movement.


While all ceiling fans should have additional supports added to the electrical box they are connected to, larger ceiling fans usually weight more and thus will need stronger support to hang from.
The manual that comes with your fan should have recommendations for ceiling supports.
If you are unsure if you have enough support for the ceiling fan you choose, you might consider hiring an electrician to check and add any additional supports in the ceiling that are necessary.
The weight of your ceiling fan will be dramatically different depending on its size. The weight is particularly determined by the size of the motor. A larger, stronger motor will weight a lot more than a weaker, smaller motor.

Wear overalls.,
Wear gloves and socks.,
Tape up all opening gaps.,
Wear a cotton scarf or bandanna around your neck.,
Wear safety glasses and a dust mask.,
Wash all clothes thoroughly after use.",How to Dress to Install Insulation," If you don't own any, purchase disposable paper overalls with long sleeves. These are usually available from hardware stores. Alternatively, wear your own cloth overalls with either long-sleeves, or wear a long-sleeved top underneath if yours isn't long-sleeved.;
, The gloves protect your hands from everything you will be touching, be it dust, dirt, or fibers. Wearing socks and closed shoes or boots is vital - this is no job for open footwear.

, Tape the overalls to your socks and to your gloves. Tape around your neck to the t-shirt (you'll probably need help).

, You might need to tape this to the shirt or overalls too, depends how hard doing this is.

, Add a cap to protect your scalp.

, It is a good idea to change in the laundry to prevent walking fibers around the house. If you have to walk through the house to get to the laundry, change where it is least likely to leave fibers in the house and put the clothes in a bucket to take to the laundry.

Go online!",How to Choose the Right Insulation Contractor," Make sure the contractor you are hiring has a current license to perform work in the state and is insured to state regulations.;
, Pick a contractor that has been in business for a respectable number of years. There are contractors who have been around for over 35 years and you just can't beat experience. There are so many choices: fiberglass batt insulation, blown-in loose fill insulation, and even spray foam insulation. The guy with the right amount of experience will help you make the best choice for your home.

, Check their certification. If an insulation contractor has their installers trained directly by the manufacturer to install their product, then you can be willing to bet that they have the support of the manufacturer during all phases of an installation. This is like extra insurance.

, See if they have a fleet of vehicles or not. It is important that your insulation contractor has more than one truck on the road, especially if you are installing spray foam insulation. In the event that there is an equipment breakdown on a job site, the contractor that has a multi-vehicle fleet can send a new rig to the job site immediately.

, Spray foam installation is a complex process involving many steps and elaborate equipment. If a contractor staffs an equipment specialist they are continuously maintaining the integrity of their equipment, thus ensuring that your job gets done promptly and efficiently.

, Look for insulation contractors who maintain an online presence and read through their testimonials. Also, ask your friends! Maybe they can help by giving you a referral of someone they know and trust.

Test your fan.",How to Oil a Ceiling Fan," Check to be sure your fan requires oil, because some models do not. Read through the instructions about how to oil it. Look for instructions about checking oil levels.Your model may require a specific kind of oil, oiling at a certain frequency (like once a year), or may require no oil at all. Therefore it is important to follow the care instructions for your specific model.
If you have lost your owner’s manual, you could visit the maker’s website or call them to inquire about care instructions. To find the website, locate the company’s name on your fan and do a Google search.;
, A stepladder will allow you to check the oil while your fan is still installed in the ceiling. Be sure to follow all safety instructions for your ladder, to lock it in place, and to place it on level ground., Make sure your fan is powered off. If your fan has lights, make sure they are off too so that you don't burn yourself by touching a hot bulb. Your ceiling fan should not be operating at all while you work on it.If it is hard to see with your fan’s lights off, use a flashlight.

, It will likely be on top of the motor, near the downrod. It is a small hole and will likely be labeled “oil hole.” If you are unable to locate the oil hole, your fan probably does not need oiling.A fan’s downrod is what connects the housing of the motor to the mounting hardware. It is the narrow tube that connects the fan to the ceiling., This will allow you to test the fan’s oil level. Fold the pipe cleaner over half an inch (1.27 cm) to form a hook. Then, stick the 1/2 inch hook into the oil hole to use as a dipstick.If the pipe cleaner comes out with oil on it, then oiling the fan will not solve your problem.
If the pipe cleaner is inserted and it doesn’t touch oil in the reservoir, you should oil your fan.

, This is the kind of oil that works well for fans. It is important not to just use any oil, because certain forms of oil are combustible and can cause fires with an electric motor. If your fan’s owner manual recommends a specific kind of oil, purchase that type.You will need a 10, 15, or 20 weight oil. Do not use 3-in-1 oil or an oil with detergents.Try Hunter oil for fans. This is a specific fan oil that will work well for most models.Don’t use WD-40. WD-40 is not a motor oil. It can be used for cleaning dirty bearings on your fan, but is not sufficient to protect moving parts., Use a rag to clean off your fan with an all-purpose cleaner. Make sure there isn’t any dust or grime. Wipe it clean before oiling it so that dirt won’t clog the oil hole. Clean out the oil hole with a pipe cleaner. Keeping your fan clean is important for it to continue operating properly.To clean your fan’s motor, do not use all-purpose cleaner. Simply wipe it with a rag.

, Slowly pour oil into the fan’s oil hole. Test it periodically with your 1/2” pipe cleaner hook and stop filling it as soon as the pipe cleaner touches the oil.If your fan has not been oiled in a very long time, it might require more than 1-2 ounces of oil. Fill it until it reaches the level of your 1/2” pipe cleaner hook., Turn your fan on a slow setting and listen for any squeaks or grinding sounds. The oil should allow your fan to run smoothly. If it still is having problems, then low oil was not the cause of the issue. Don’t keep adding oil. There is something else wrong.Instead of turning on the fan, you could also slowly spin the blades around with your hand while the power is off. You will still be able to hear if there are problems.

, If oiling your fan was not the solution, it is time to contact a professional who can troubleshoot the issues with your fan. There are professionals who specialize in ceiling fans. It is best to find someone with this expertise rather than a general handyman.You could find someone at a fan store, at a fan department of a larger home improvement store, or online by doing a Google search for fan repair in your city.

, You should only remove your ceiling fan if absolutely necessary. Many models can be oiled while still attached to the ceiling. If you are simply unable to access the oil hole, then you will need to remove the fan from the ceiling, which is a bit more complicated! But it is necessary if your fan has sealed bearings., Find your house’s breaker box and turn the appropriate switch off so that there is no power going to your fan. It should turn off the power to the whole room that your fan is in. To make sure you turned off the right switch, test the fan and make sure it doesn’t turn on.This is a very important step so that you will not be in danger of electrocution.
You can also use a handheld circuit tester to be sure that no power is going to the wires. You can buy one on Amazon or at your local home improvement store.

, If you fan comes with lights, remove them first. You will need a Philips-head screwdriver and a stepladder. Climb your ladder and unscrew the lighting unit from the fan. Start by removing the screws from the top of the lighting unit by turning them counterclockwise.Be sure to support the lighting unit as you remove it so that it doesn’t crash to the ground.
You will also need to remove protective wire nuts on the lighting unit. Find an appropriate wrench that will allow you to twist these off. Once these are removed, you should be able to detach the lighting unit from the fan by gently pulling it off.
Once the lighting unit is removed, set it out of the way.

, Use your Philips-head screwdriver to turn the screws counterclockwise to remove them. Make sure you are removing the screws that attach the blades to the fan. The screws should be on the part of the fan that is still attached to the ceiling and not on the blades themselves (these can stay on). As you remove the blade from the fan, set the blade down on the ground or on a table.You may need help from a friend to hold the fan blades as you take them down.
You can use an electric screwdriver to unscrew the blades more easily.

, Disconnect the ceiling fan from the ceiling by removing the covering around the motor. Unscrew the screws that are holding the fan's canopy (it is the part over the motor). There will probably be four screws to remove. Remove them with one hand while supporting the fan with your other hand. Once these screws have been removed, your fan should be able to lower from the ceiling.If you can’t find the screws that are holding the motor’s cover in place, they may be covered by a decorative ring.

, With your motor lowered, there should be wires connecting the fan to the ceiling. Look for where they connect with a plastic cap. This is where you can disconnect them by unwrapping the caps counterclockwise. Once they are disconnected, you can set your fan’s motor right-side-up on a table.Cover the wires that are hanging down from the ceiling with black electrical tape.

, Find the bearings at the top and the bottom of the motor. You are looking for where the rotating parts meet the stationary parts. There should be a small seam, which is the edge of the bearing. Drip three to four drops of non-detergent electric motor oil into the top bearing. Then, spin the motor around about 10 times so that the oil works into the bearings.Repeat this for the bottom bearings. Turn the motor upside down and add a few drops of oil where the blades connect to the motor. Turn the bottom section of the motor 10 times to work the oil into the bearings.

, Reverse your steps to reassemble the fan, or follow your fan’s instruction manual for installation. Start by reconnecting the electrical wiring. Then screw in the canopy. Then reconnect the fan's blades one at a time. To attach the screws, you will turn them clockwise., Once reinstalled, test your fan on a slow setting to ensure it’s properly connected and balanced. Turn on the power to the room by switching back the breaker so that you can test the fan. Your fan should be working well now. If you are still having problems, you will need to hire a professional.

Examine three totally different ways that heat energy works with the laws of ""heat-loss or heat-gain"".,
Insulate and create air barriers (durable seal) for floors, walls, ceilings (extensions, attachments, openings) on all six sides of your home/building (insulated box) -- top, bottom, back, front, left, and right.,
Understand conduction where heat flows through, and across more conductive materials in an otherwise well-insulated wall, floor or ceiling, for significant heat loss.,
Watch out for several areas where your builders might forget to include two or some of all three categories:

Exterior air barrier (on all 6 sides),
Interior air barriers (behind certain areas),
Insulation, including in openings, doors and windows and around them including ""weather stripping, gaskets"" at openings.

,Install internal barriers and insulation as mandatory measures for an ""Energy Star Home"", with the EPA Thermal Bypass Checklist (for example, drywall or foam ""Thermo-ply"" board) on the interior side of wall insulation behind a metal fireplace (and several similar areas) in colder climate zones.,
If builders are in warm climates (climate zones 1 through 3), they may eliminate the interior air barrier in several places that are required in zones 4 and higher (colder) -- but are still required in an ""Energy Star Home"" in all zones or as long as the insulation is fully supported in place and is installed according to RESNET’s insulation installation requirements for a ""Grade One"" performance rating,:

Over the insulation behind a metal fireplace (fire-rated drywall board),
Behind a tub/shower or tub (such as blueboard drywall or concrete board),
Behind attic knee walls (low walls -- seen with slanted attic ceilings),
At skylight shaft walls, and
At all staircase walls.

,
Understand that the required interior insulation and barriers also include:

Behind tub/shower units ""on exterior walls"";
Behind zero-clearance metal fireplaces;
On walls at either side of attic stairs;
At interior soffits (for example, kitchen cabinet soffits);
At exterior walls;
Above porch ceilings.

,Insulate and weatherstrip around attic access doors and hatches.,
Fill the joist area in a bonus-room floor over a garage: The insulation should be in full contact with both the subfloor above and the exterior air barrier below, which is often a drywall ceiling in the garage.,Insulate the edges of slabs in climate zones 4 or higher/colder — a requirement that can also be found in the International Residential Code.,
Realize there are exceptions to the ""two-air-barrier"" (internal and external) -- while this is about the rules:

Ventilated airspace including the exterior air barrier can be omitted above insulation installed in an unfinished/non-living space of an attic floor, but adequate ventilation is usually desirable;
The interior air barrier can be omitted at rim joists sometimes, but often should be sealed;
The interior air barrier (behind insulation) can be omitted in warmer climate zones.",How to Achieve All Season Insulation and Air Barriers for Your Home," Those are -- (i.) air passing through, or (ii.) thermal heat waves transmitting through solid materials, and even slowly through fluffy insulation and ""dead air"" -- and by (iii.) heat radiation and rays traveling in all 3 common states of matter. Infrared ""as deep-penetrating heat rays"" and ultraviolet (UV -- as in sun-light) can travel easily through a vacuum! Heat convection is heat rising -- and also, spreading out in all directions.
Understand that it is really heat that has to be stopped -- not cold! Well, sure we block-off/block-out cold air and harsh unheated, winter winds blowing... Refrigerators/freezers are insulated to keep heat from being absorbed! Heat is a real commodity, but ""cold"" does not exist, as such: cold is only ""less heat!"" -- it's just heat moving and so losing of heat, heat lost (heat is lost from a building in cold weather; No! cold is not gained, at all!), the relative absence of heat! Air conditioners remove heat from the ambient, interior environment out to the external atmosphere.

The two main ways are found in section one of the six sections in the EPA's ""Thermal Bypass Checklist"":What Happens and How They Are Different:
1.) Air and Thermal barriers (The ""Air Barrier"" stops GAS (air blowing or seeping) versus ""Thermal Barrier"" including (i) HEAT WAVE traveling in soft, fluffy insulation that hinders/slows it -- and/or (ii) to REFLECT INFRARED radiant heat (rays) back ,Where that transpires:
~ 2.) Walls adjoining exterior or unconditioned spaces,~ 3.) Floors between conditioned and exterior spaces,~ 4.) Shafts (stairwells, skylights, etc.),~ 5.) Attic and ceiling,~ 6.) Common walls between dwelling units (town home, duplex, etc.).;
,: external air tightness, wind tightness, encapsulation.Know the EPA's Checklist definition of an air barrier: “any solid material that blocks air flow between a conditioned space and an unconditioned space, including necessary sealing to block excessive air flow at edges and seams” — but “solid” can be interpreted in various ways; taken literally, the word refers to any substance that is not a liquid or a gas/vapor, but means a durable seal, so that sometimes is a house wrap like Tyvek, spun polyester (which is a highly breathable), but it does not pass liquid water -- or use asphalt/felt paper as a ""solid"" air barrier, also called a ""water resistant barrier"" (WRB).

,

Use sprayed foam or foam board to interrupt heat flow into wood and metal components, where possible to minimize thermal exchange/flow by placing rigid foam board, for example between heated space and exterior siding sheathing -- or unheated attic space and ceiling.
An extreme problem is steel studs or beams in an insulated wall, ceiling or floor that would severely reduce the overall energy performance of that wall, because of thermal conduction, (exchange/flow) through the steel.
Yes, wood studs and joist do, also, conduct heat much more so than the insulation between the studs.

,,,,,,

Use cans of spray foam -- unless the builder/remodeler installs it with high volume spray foam equipment, and then the exterior air barrier is the exterior surface of the cured foam.

Canned foam is great for owners improving both air and thermal barriers and for small remodeling projects, for achieving a good/solid barrier.



,, (zones 1 through 3). The Thermal Bypass Checklist (such as installing all insulation according to RESNET’s ""Grade One"" insulation installation guidelines) is required both for builders following the path to obtaining an ""Energy Star label"" — using a “builder option package,” (BOP) — as well as for builders following the ""Performance Home path"" (can be somewhat sloppy -- but very sloppy insulation installs will warrant downgrading by the rater, resulting in a performance value ""below that of a Grade One installation""). The Checklist has 25 items. While at least 19 of these items must be verified by a third-party home rater, up to 6 of the items can be “self-certified” by the builder.

Turn off the power to your existing ceiling fan.,
Determine whether the bottom of your ceiling fan has a housing cap.,
Assess whether there are wires inside the housing for a lighting assembly.,
Measure the attachment point on your ceiling fan.,
Visit a home improvement store to find the appropriate ceiling fan light kit.,
Turn off the circuit breaker that controls the power to your ceiling fan.,
Unscrew the cap hiding the wires and set it aside.,
Connect the light's wires to the fan's wires with wire nuts.This should be done by simply lining up the two matching wires so that they are parallel and screwing a wire nut on the end, like you would a lid on a bottle.,
Screw the lighting assembly onto the ceiling fan.,
Install light bulbs, glass shades, and pull chains, following the directions provided by the manufacturer.,
Flip the circuit breaker back on, pull the chain, and check out your newly-improved fan!",How to Install a Light on a Ceiling Fan," Begin any project involving electricity by turning off the source of power.









This does not just mean flipping off the switch on the wall, as it could easily accidentally get turned back on mid project. Instead, go to your circuit box and turn off the whole circuit. If you are unsure of which circuit you are working on, play is safe and just turn off the whole panel. A few minutes of no power is worth your safety.;
, This is the area at the center of a ceiling fan where an optional light assembly will go.Unscrew any screws in this area and pull off any decorative plates or covers that are concealing light attachment points and wires.









Some ceiling fans will not accommodate the addition of a light kit but quite a few will. Many times when a ceiling fan is designed, it can be built with an optional lighting assembly. This way a company can use the same parts for both a cheaper product, with no light, and a more expensive one, with lights. Because of this, adding a light to your ceiling fan may be a quick and easy job.
If your ceiling fan has no housing assembly at the center of it, then you will not be able to attach a lighting assembly. Be sure there is no housing cover before you give up, as the way they are attached can be hidden with decorative details, such as an embellished cover.

, Because you will want to be able to control the light and the fan separately, there will need to be existing wiring inside the housing to allow light assembly operation. You should see several wires inside the housing that are capped off by themselves with wire nuts. They could be a variety of colors but most likely will be black (power) and white (neutral).









With any luck the wires inside the housing will even be labeled with something like ""lighting power"" or something like that. This is a very good sign that you will be able to attach a lighting assembly.

, Now that you know you have power for a lighting assembly, you will need to know the size lighting assembly you need to find. Measure the diameter of the opening and pay attention to where screw holes should be located on a lighting assembly in order to attach easily to your existing ceiling fan.









Also make note of the company and style name or number of your ceiling fan. Parts from the same company are more likely to fit your existing fan.

, If you cannot find the right part, don't hesitate to ask someone working at the store to help you.









Some companies sell universal ceiling fan lighting kits that fit a variety of their models. Make sure to check that the style name or number of your fan is listed as an acceptable match for the lighting assembly you buy.
If you cannot find the right lighting assembly at a home improvement store try elsewhere. A lot of cities now have companies that salvage construction parts and resell them to the public. You should also look online at the website of the company who manufactured you ceiling fan. They may sell directly to the public or the site may direct you to a company that does.
Ceiling fan lighting assemblies come in a variety of styles. For instance, you will need to decide whether you would like to attach a fixture that has one, two, or three light bulb sockets., Between the time you assessed whether you could possibly attach a light assembly and when you actually install it, you have probably turned back on the circuit breaker. Make sure that you turn it off once again!








, Be sure to keep track of the parts you are removing. You will probably no longer need the cap but you may need any screws that it was attached with.








,









In most cases you will be attaching wires that are the same color together. For instance if there is a white and a black wire in the ceiling fan and a white and black wire coming out the back of the lighting assembly, simply wire nut like colors together. That being said, it's best to follow any directions that have been supplied with your lighting assembly.

, This attachment should go smoothly, especially if you have purchased a lighting assembly designed to be attached to your ceiling fan.







, Usually shades on ceiling fixtures are held in place with thumbscrews, which, when screwed in, simply keep the shades attached with a light amount of pressure on multiple sides of the shade.








, Now you should be able to feel a cool breeze from the fan while enjoying a brightly lit room.

Turn the power back on.",How to Replace a Ceiling Fan," Some cities require permits when you are changing out ceiling fans. Others just require them if you're moving from a light to a ceiling fan. It's best to check ahead of time to see if you need to get a permit.Contact your city permit office for more information. You may also be able to look the information up online.;
, You don't want to work on live wires, and just turning it off at the switch isn't enough to keep you safe. Find the room on the breaker box. Flip the switch so there is no power going to that room.Always flip the power switch to the fan to make sure the power has actually been turned off., The canopy is the part up near the ceiling that is over the wires. Usually, you'll need to unscrew a few screws to take off the canopy. Some may twist off, though. It just depends on your fan. If you can't figure it out, try looking up the fan on the internet for help.The screws will likely be near the ceiling. You may need to slide the canopy over a notch on one screw to pull it down., Just to be on the safe side, you should check the wires one more time to see if they have power. To check them, you'll need a non-contact voltage tester. All you do is place the voltage tester up near the wires, and it will indicate whether the wires are hot or not. Check each wire separately.Read the directions for your particular tester to see what indicators it uses. Some use a green light if there's no power and a red light if there is power. Others will chirp as they get near hot wires.
It's a good idea to test your voltage tester on an outlet first. You can stick in the hot side (small side) of an outlet to test if it's working.Keep in mind, these readers only work on plastic-insulated wires, not metal-insulated wires.

, You'll need to twist the caps a bit to pull them off.Start with the black wires first, then do the white. Finish up with the bare/green wires., As you take off each cap, you should notice two wires that have been twisted together. Often, they'll spring apart as you untwist the cap, but you may need to pull them apart yourself. One wire is from the fan, and one is from the ceiling, which is why they need to come apart for you to pull the fan down., Now, you'll need to move the fan off the mounting bracket. Often, the fan will have a ball or something similar that just slides off the bracket, though you may need to jiggle it a bit.It can help to have someone support the fan as you pull it off its bracket and slide it free., Your new ceiling fan will have its own bracket that fits that fan perfectly, so you need to take down the old bracket. However, leave the mount that attaches to the ceiling in place. The bracket fits over the mount., Now is a good time to check if the wires look frayed. You can also check the mount/brace above the bracket to make sure it is secure. It shouldn't wiggle around, and it should be screwed into the ceiling. Also, look at where the wires come out. It should have a plastic connector around the hole, so that the wires are up against the edge of the mount (because the mount is metal).If you have a problem with any of the above, you may need to replace the mount or the wiring. If that's the case, you'll likely want to call in a professional.

, You won't have to do this step with all fans, so make sure yours comes with this part. Apply (urethane) glue to the back of the medallion. Pull the wires on the ceiling through the center. Once the medallion is centered, push it onto the ceiling until it sticks.To hold it in place, use four 6D finishing nails, and cover the ends with spackle or caulk.

, The bracket holds the fan in place, and it's hidden by the fan's structure. Pull the wires from the brace through the middle of the bracket. Line up the bracket with the mounting bolts in the brace above. You'll either clip or slide the bracket into place over the bolts.Make sure you read the instructions for your particular fan. In some cases, you may need to use screws to secure the bracket.

, On the floor, find the wires coming off of the fan's motor. Feed them through the canopy that will cover the wires eventually. Then, feed them through the downrod., The downrod will likely screw into the top of the fan. You may need to tighten a locking screw in place, usually on the side of the rod near the motor. Use a wrench for tightening.Make sure the locking screws are tight, as your fan may wobble if they're not.You may also need to attach the ball mount, though some may have this attached already. Place it on the downrod, and secure it with the pin.Some people install the blades while the fan is still on the ground. However, that is up to you. If you want to minimize your time on the ladder, you may want to install them now. On the other hand, having the blades in place now can make it unwieldy.

, Have someone support the fan from below. Lift it up to the bracket. The ball at the top should slide right into the bracket you just installed. If you're unsure how yours slides in, check the instructions that came with your fan.Hang one edge of the canopy up to work on the wires.

, The wires will be long to thread through the fan, so now you need to cut them. Just make them about 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) longer than the downrod, matching the length of the wires extending from the ceiling. Strip off the plastic at the ends of the wire so they can be joined with their mates., Use a wire nut to connect the two green wires with the bare copper wire. Hold the ends together, and twist it on to connect them. Also connect the two white wires, and then the two black wires with the same method.When you're done, tuck the wires up into the brace above.

, Push the canopy up so that it's flat against the ceiling. You'll likely need to screw it into place, though a few may pop into the bracket without screws. The screws should fit up close to the ceiling., Each fan blade will fit into a bracket that will then fit into the fan. Slide the blade into the bracket, then add a screw to secure it. You may need to use more than one screw, according to your directions., Each fan bracket will have a place to screw the blade brackets into the fan's motor.To make it easier on yourself, place the screw in the bracket, and use the screwdriver to keep it in place. Lift the blade and bracket up, and then screw it into the motor.Screw these in tightly, as a loose bracket could make your fan wobble.

, Plug the wired plug into the light's attachment, which connects the electricity, and screw in the light kit as described by your directions. Add the light bulb and any shade that goes on top, which you may also need to screw in.You may also need to attach the pull chain.

Turn the power back on and then turn on your fan.,
Finished.

",How to Install the Correct Ceiling Fan," Ceiling fans with light fixtures permit you to add additional lighting to your room. The fan will work with air conditioning or with open windows to cool your home. During winter a ceiling fan operating in reverse helps to circulate the warmer air that collects at the ceiling.;
, It is important to buy the right size fan for the intended room, consider the following guidelines for the right size fan:


If the room dimension is 12 feet (3.7 m) or less, you need a 36-inch fan
If the room dimension is 12 to 16 feet (3.7 to 4.9 m), you need a 48-inch fan
If the room dimension is 16 to 18 feet (4.9 to 5.5 m), you need a 52-inch fan

, The fan hardware is usually included with the fan.

, Before starting, turn off the power at the main circuit breaker panel. If you are not sure which breaker to use, then turn off the master breaker to the entire house.

,, Test the fixture box to ensure it will hold the weight of the fan. If for some reason it does not hold, a metal brace will be needed to be installed between the joists. In most cases, the canopy of the fan will cover any holes that are drilled into the ceiling.

, Run the wire into the mounting box of the fixture. Make sure the face of the box is flush with the ceiling.

, The bars holding the mounting box are then twisted to extend the braces.

, Attach the black wires together, attach the white wires together, and attach the bare wire to the green wire (ground). Secure the fan to the fan box using the mounting bolts and install the canopy to cover the ceiling holes and fixture box. Install the fan blade if not installed.

, Enjoy your new fan.

Turn off the power to the light you're replacing (if applicable) at the circuit breaker or fuse panel.,
If there is no central light fixture, determine the center of the room, using one of the below techniques.,
Obtain a FAN RATED BOX from home supply or electrical supply store.,
After determining where you want to install the fan, assess your ability to get power to it.,
After determining there are no obstructions, (wires, pipes, framing members, etc.),
If installing in a kitchen or dining room, and the existing power source you choose to utilize may be on larger, #12 wire.,
Fish a #14-2* or #14-3* cable from a switch box that has BOTH a #14* unswitched 120 volt hot wire AND neutral wire to the fan location.,
Use #14-2* cable if you want to either: A) power the fan (and light if applicable) on and off from one switch.,
Use #14-3* if you want to: C) power the fan independently from the light by two switches in the same box.

,
Running #14-3* provides the ability to do A, B, or C wiring methods mentioned above, and as such provides the greatest flexibility with little added cost.

,
Using appropriate connectors where needed, route the cable into the fan box through the cable entry openings.

,
Secure the fan rated junction box following the manufacturer's instructions.,
Determine if a special mount is required.,
At the fan box: If you used #14-2 or #12-2, attach the wires to the fan by following the standard color coding scheme: switch cable white to fan white, switch cable bare (or green) to fan ground / green, switch cable black to fan black (AND fan blue if present).

,
At the fan box: If you opted for the #14-3 or #12-3 feed, you will have a switch cable black, red, white and bare (or green).,
At the switch box: If using two wall switches or controls in the same box, all grounds (bare & green wires) connect together.,
At the switch box: If using one wall switch, the wiring for the whites and grounds are the same as above.,
If using a remote, connect the fan black and white wires directly to a power source that is always on (outlet or line side of a switch).,
Cover each connection with a wire nut.,
Follow the specific instructions of the manufacturer first.,
Once you start mounting the blade/bracket assemblies to the fan motor, you may need 3 or 4 hands as it can be an awkward job.

,
The manufacturer’s instructions may say otherwise, but if the fan blades are less than a screwdriver's length away from the ceiling, it may be best to install the blades before hanging the fan.

,
Some fans use a ""speed ring"" which allows you to assemble the blades on the floor and then attach them to the motor after it has been installed on the ceiling.,
Install the hanger bracket on the box with screws and lock washers.,
Attach the fan canopy to the fan motor housing by screwing the mounting ring in place.,
Hang the assembled motor unit from the two hooks on the mounting bracket.

,
Reconnect the wires, starting with the ground wire.,
Slip the ceiling cover up to its full height and tighten it in place.

,
Attach the fan motor to the mounting bracket with the provided screws.,
To access the wiring that powers the light, loosen the screws that hold the cap on the fan's switch housing bracket on the bottom.,
Before wiring the lamp, however, install the adapter ring included with the fan kit bracket.,
Pull the two labeled wires through the adapter ring, lift the lamp and make the wiring connections.,
Power up and test your connection.",How to Install a Ceiling Fan," Once this is done, only then should you remove the light fixture. This can be tested by flipping wall switches or using a circuit tester on the actual light fixture. If there is a pre-existing fixture, remove it and disconnect the wiring. A fan presents a dynamic physical load that is usually much heavier than typical ceiling fixtures that present a static load. Because of these two qualities, if a fan rated box is not already present, the old box will need to be replaced with one that is.

, Fasten the new fan rated junction box directly to the nearest joist.


Snap diagonal chalk lines from opposite corners of the room. The lines will cross in the exact center of the room. (Much easier.)
Use a tape measure to measure the walls, and find the halfway points. (If you really can't get hold of a chalk line.)

, It will likely be best to buy the old work (not new construction) style if you do not have access to the ceiling from above. There are two types of old work boxes; one fan rated box is designed to straddle an existing joist; this style can be easier to install, but requires that you find the joist rather than avoid it. The other type has an adjustable bar that expands to span between two joists, it can be a little more involved to install but allows more mounting location choices. Either type works equally well.;
, See the tips section below for some ideas for a power source. Adjust this location as needed. Next, cut a hole by hand with a sheetrock saw; just large enough to feel around with your fingers to check for potential obstructions for the box. This small opening will make patching easier if it is an unsuitable location.

, trace the fan rated junction box to be installed on the ceiling and cut it out with the sheetrock saw.

, Regardless of the location, if your power source is via #12 wires, you must use #12-2 or #12-3 instead of #14-2 or #14-3 where indicated below with "" * "" (A general rule is to never connect different size wires together).

, If your fan has a wireless remote, you may wish to feed directly from a 120 volt outlet plug. Better yet, install a new switch box and run a wire cable from the outlet and fan, wire nut the white wires together and the ground wires (green or bare) together with a wire connector and then connect the two black wires that would connect to the switch together - that would in turn feed the fan. If you ever decide to remove the fan and replace with a light fixture, there will be a wall switch to control it.

, B) power the fan and/or light on and off with an RF remote included with the fan or purchased separately.

,,,, All fans vibrate when running. Your mount must be able to withstand this constant stress, this why the National Electrical Code (NEC) mandates the use of fan rated boxes. Many people have been injured due to mount failure prior to this NEC change. Use of fan rated boxes significantly reduces this risk.

, When mounting to a beamed or angled ceiling, some fans require specific mounts for pitch that may or may not be included with the fan. Most fans however, include a universal mount that will support a fan from ""normal"" horizontal through most common roof pitch angles. Select the one that best fits the application. Down rod extensions may be added to lower the fan to the desired level.

,, Attach the wires to the fan by connecting switch cable white to fan white, switch cable bare (or green) to fan ground / green, switch cable black to fan black and switch cable red to fan blue.

, The green screw or green wire on each switch should be connected to the ground wire bundle. Wirenut this connection and push towards the back of the box. Connect the power source cable white to fan cable white, wirenut and push towards the back of the box. With switches oriented to read ON and OFF (single pole switches), connect a 6–8 inch (15.2–20.3 cm) black wire power source cable black (or hot) to the bottom screw on each switch. Connect the fan cable red to the top screw on switch #1, and fan cable black to the top screw on switch #2. If all is wired correctly, switch #1 will operate the light & switch #2 will operate the fan. If you want to vary fan speed from the switch box, you should substitute a fan speed controller for switch #2. A dimmer may be used in place of switch #1 to dim the lights.

, Connect the power source cable black (hot) to the bottom screw of the switch. If you wish to control the light via wall switch: connect the fan cable black to the power source and the fan cable red to the switch, since power is always available to the fan, it can be operated independently of the switch position by the pull chain and the light will operated by the wall switch. Reverse the wire connections to the switch and power source to control the fan by the switch and light by the pull chain.

, Wire the remote receiver as per the instructions included with it - most likely power source color to remote input color (black to black, white to white) and fan / light color to remote output color (black to black, white to white, blue to blue).

, Keep extra wiring out of the way by pushing it into the electrical box. While working on the fan wiring, use the “wiring hook"" that is provided to hang the fan.

, Most fan blades have a two-pronged attachment, using screws that come through holes in the blades and into the prongs. These need to be drawn up securely, but not so tightly that the threads are damaged or the laminated blade material is crushed.On many fans you'll find the prongs also need to be mounted to the motor housing. If this is the case, mount them before the prongs are mounted to the blades themselves.

,,, To do this:

Fasten each blade to the speed ring, then attach the assembled ring to the motor unit using rubber grommets and fastening screws.
Attach the cover over the speed ring and install the decorative cover plate.

, If no lock washers are supplied, you should purchase some as they prevent fan vibrations from loosening the screws over time. The hanger bracket may accept either a half-ball hanger or a hook-type hanger, depending on your fan. Either way, the hanger is carefully slipped into the bracket. Twist the half ball type hanger until the hanger bracket's tab aligns with the groove in the ball hanger.

, If you have high ceilings, you may also want to attach a hanger pipe.

,, Be sure to connect the black house wires to the black fan wires, and the white house wires to the white fan wires. Connect the ground wires from the box, the fan and the power supply together with a wire nut. Tuck all wires inside the canopy and secure the canopy to the mounting bracket.

,, Turn the power back on and make sure the connections are good - remember to have both the wall switch and the pull-cord switch on the fan in the ""On"" position.

, With the cap removed, you'll see a bundle of wires. Of these wires, two will be labeled for use with the light kit. One will be white (neutral) and the other will be black, red or blue (hot). Some fans and light kits make use of a plug and jack instead of individual wires.

, The adapter serves as a reducing ring for the lamp housing. Attach the adapter ring with the screws provided.

, Join the two white wires with a wire connector and the two black, red or blue wires with a wire connector to the remaining labeled wire bracket. If the fan and light have a plug and jack for a connection, simply join them by inserting the plug into the jack. Fasten the light kit to the fan with the screws provided.

, Check for wobbling.

Check that the fan's blades are evenly spaced and aligned.,
Oil a fan's motor bearings if you hear a grinding, ticking or rubbing noise as the fan spins.,
Put a rubber flywheel or rubber or paper spacers between a fan's blade brackets and its motor.",How to Muffle a Fan1," Bend any blades out of position back into place. Do this very carefully as the blades could snap.;
, Use a non-detergent motor oil that is lightweight.


Some fans, usually those made before 1970, are designed to be regularly oiled and will have a reservoir that holds oil. Pour oil into the reservoir through the fan's oil hole.
Alternatively, look for the motor shaft where the fan's moving parts meet its stationary parts. Slowly pour oil onto a small seam on the motor shaft. The seam is the edge of the fan's bearing.
Let oil poured on the seam run into the bearing. Add oil to the top and bottom bearings if applicable.

, The rubber or paper can dampen noise from vibrating blades.

, Save the drywall piece/pieces that you cut out.

, following the instruction on the blower.

,,,,, If it does stick out just ease it in with a hand screwdriver. It takes a light touch at the end so that you don't break the paper of the sheetrock.

,,,, Use 100 grit paper between coats if you want, using the same sandpaper over and over. By the time you get to the final coat it will be worn down enough that paint should cover any scratches.

, Practice on a piece of cardboard putting a paint brush in your mud and flicking it on the cardboard. Add more water or mud as needed and try different stuff to fling mud to get sort of a match to your current wall texture. (You can also purchase 'texture in a can' with extra spray nozzles for varying textures from most home improvement stores).

, Remember that once you paint, you probably will be OK with your blending.

Make sure the fan can't turn on while you work.,
Clean the fan blades.,
Check and tighten all the visible screws on your fan.,
Remove the canopy where the fan attaches to the ceiling and tighten any screws.,
Check the hanger ball before reattaching the canopy.,
Tighten the downrod support screws.,
Run the fan on high to check for any wobble.",How to Fix a Wobbling Ceiling Fan1," Switch the fan on, then pull the cord controlling the fan to ensure that, even if someone flicked the switch on accident, the fan won't start turning while you work on it.


If you plan on working on the motor, or want to feel extra secure, flip the circuit breaker so that there is no power in the room you are working on. This, however, will make it difficult to test the fan.;
, Dust, dirt, and debris collecting on the top of the fans can make it off balance, as well as get into the motor or grooves and cause wiggling issues. To clean them:


Take a damp, soapy cloth and wipe down each blade to remove dust. A little dusting solution or a drop of dish soap should be enough.
Rinse out the soap and wipe up any suds with a clean, damp cloth.
Dry the blades by using a clean towel or paper wipes.

, This includes the screws holding the blades and any connections between the light and fan. Loose screws on any part of the ceiling fan allow parts to move independently, making the whole thing wobble when the blades get up to speed.


The screws should all be hand tight, but don't break your wrist trying to get them extra tight. Once they start resisting your turns, you're good to go.

, These screws keep the fan attached, and wobbling will be the least of your worries if they get too loose. Undo the screws and slide the canopy down, then hand-tighten any visible screws where the fan meets the ceiling to ensure that the fan is well attached., This small ball fits in a similarly shaped bowl like a bone in a socket. Attached to the ball is the center rod of the fan that keeps everything attached to the ceiling. Make sure the hanger ball is completely seated so the ball fits snugly in its joint and doesn't move around. Reattach the canopy when you're done.

, These small screws attach at the top of the motor, where the downrod (coming from the ceiling) meets the body of the fan. There are usually 2-3 screws that keep the fan attached, but they may be covered by a small metal piece to make the fan look more appealing. Simply unscrew or push this covering up the downrod and tighten any screws you see.

, Once you've tightened the screws in the blades, downrod, and mounting, try the fan again and see if you've made progress. If not, the problem likely comes from unbalanced or warped blades. However, keeping the screws tight only takes a few minutes and helps prevent future problems.

Use a step-ladder to check each blade for warping.,
Use a yardstick to measure for equal blade height.,
Tighten the screws connecting the blade hanger to the motor for any low blades.,
Gently bend the blade holders up or down to get them aligned.,
Test the fan.",How to Fix a Wobbling Ceiling Fan2," Stand at fan height and look down each blade. Do any look warped, cracked, or bent? Check the blade holders, the metal pieces at the base of each blade, and check for any cracks or wear. If you have broken or warped blades or blade holders you should contact your fan's manufacturer for a replacement., Hold the yardstick up to the ceiling and spin the fan so that the outside edge of a blade lines up with the yardstick. Note the height of the blade, and then check the other blades to make sure they are the same. Keep the yardstick in place the entire time, spinning the fan to make sure all the blades meet the yardstick at the same height.Since fans blades are usually tilted, make sure you measure from the same edge on every blade -- the highest corner is usually the easiest to mark.
If you don't have a yardstick, a board or piece of paper should work too. Use a permanent marker to note the height of each blade, keeping your measurement instrument in the same place while spinning the blades., this screw may be covered up or hard to reach, but it is found where the blade hanger (metal piece attaching the wooden blade to the fan) meets the motor. Get in and tighten this screw, which should raise the fan.

, Do not do this if a blade holder is cracked, as it could cause it to break. However, light pressure can be used to bend the blade to the right height. Hold onto the base of the fan with one hand, keeping it still. Put gentle upward or downward pressure on the blade holder at the point where it meets the blade to align it correctly.Check the height of the blades one more time to make sure everything is well aligned. Remember to use your yardstick and spin the blades instead of moving the measuring stick.

, If the wobble is gone, it should stay that way unless someone accidentally clips a blade. A vertical variance of even 1/8"" in one blade can cause it to wobble, so make sure you get this right before moving on to fan balancing.

"
"
Know that unbalanced blades cause most fan wobbling issues.,
Purchase a blade balancing kit, or make your own.,
Hook the balancing clip on the center of a blade, using the edge angled higher.,
Slide the balancing clip up and down the blade, testing each time.,
Attach a balancing weight at the location of the balancing clip, in the center of the blade.,
Swap the blade positions if more than one blade is out of balance or if the fan is wobbling right after installation.",How to Fix a Wobbling Ceiling Fan3," If there is a weight difference of even .5 grams you will be in for some wobbling when things start spinning at high speeds. This could be the result of improper installation, fan wear, or simply poorly designed blades.

, Blade balancing kits are simply small weights that you use to get your fan running smoothly. They consist of weighted clips and/or several adhesive weights meant to attach to your fan blade, allowing you to adjust the weight slightly and get everything balanced.


Though balancing kits are cheap, you can use tape and a few nickels and dimes to make your own balancing kit at home, though the need to tape and untape the coins makes the process take a little longer., These small clips add weight to the blade, allowing you to test which one is ruining the balance. Turn on the fan and note if the wobble is reduced. Move the clip to another blade, testing each one until your find out which one is causing the problem.


Look for the blade that, when the balance clip is attached, lowers the wobble the most.
To test without a kit, tape a nickel in the center of a blade, then test it. Remove the nickel and try another one until you find the culprit.

, Once you've found the unbalanced blade, move the clip up 6 inches, then test it again. Move it down towards the base and test that too, looking for the spot where the fan spins the smoothest.There are apps available which will help you find the best spot for the clips to remove the wobble.

, Once you know where you need to balance the fan, remove the adhesive backing to the weight and stick it on the blade so that it is lined up with the balancing clip. Remove the clip and test the fan again.


If the fan starts wobbling again after you remove the clip, attach a second, smaller weight next to the first one to make up for the weight of the balancing clip.

, If you can't find one blade that is out of balance they may have been installed incorrectly. If your fan is brand new, you may have simply added the fans in the wrong order, and switching out the blades should fix your issue. Use post-it notes to label the blades (1,2,3,4,5), then switch them by unscrewing them from the blade mounts and reattaching them to the correct mount.


For 4-blade fans, swap a set of neighboring blades and turn the fan on again to test.
For 5-blade fans, swap blades two away from each other (such as the first blade and the third) and test. It may take 2-3 tries to get the right order. "

Invest in a humidity monitor.,
Run a de-humidifier.,
Use fans.,
Purchase moisture-absorbing materials.,
Turn on your air conditioner.,
Run a space heater.",How to Dehumidify a Room1," Pick up a humidity monitor at a department store or buy one online. You can keep this in your home to monitor humidity levels, as this will help you figure out which activities and appliances raise humidity in your home. For example, if humidity levels sky rocket when you're cooking, make a habit of opening windows and turning on fans when you're cooking.
, A de-humidifier is one of the easiest ways to reduce humidity in your home. You can buy a de-humidifier online or pick one up at a local department store.De-humidifiers come in different sizes to accommodate varying living spaces. If you live in a smaller home, you can buy a small portable de-humidifier.
If you live in a larger home, you can buy a larger de-humidifier that's similar to a home fridge or air conditioner.

, If you have fans, keeping them on throughout the day can help de-humidify your home. Proper ventilation helps keep the air from becoming stale and humid.Position fans near open windows. This helps increase air flow to your home, decreasing levels of humidity.

, There are many types of absorbent crystals you can purchase online or at a department store that reduce humidity in the home. Things like rock salt, DriZair, and Damprid can all be used to dehumidify your living space.To use rock salt, you need to drill inside one bucket. Then, put this bucket inside one without holes and pour in the rock salt. Place it in the area you want to dehumidify.
Damprid comes in a powder of package that can be hung or spread throughout your home to reduce humidity.
DriZair is usually placed in a colander filled with a vinyl screen. Leave the colander in a room to dehumidify.

, If you have an air conditioner, run it. Most modern air conditioners both de-humidify and cool the air.Some air conditioners may have a de-humidify setting. If your AC comes equipped with such a setting, use it.

, If your home is humid during cooler months, a space heater can actually help. Warming a room can help reduce humidity if the warmth comes from a dry heat source, like a space heater."

Turn the ceiling fan off, and allow the blades to coast to a complete stop.,
Grasp each blade and wiggle them to see if any of the fasteners (usually phillips type screws) are loose, and if so, tighten them.,
Look for excess dust accumulated on the blade surface, especially the top.,
Check the globe or globes on the light kit if the fan is equipped with one.,
Tighten the set screws that holds the globe in place.,
Test the fan to see if any of the above steps have helped quiet the squeak.,
Rebalance the blades on your ceiling fan.,
Recheck to see if the squeak is diminished or not.",How to Fix a Squeaking Ceiling Fan,";
, It is unusual for loose blades to cause a squeak, but possible in some instances. Also check that the light bulbs are securely in place; they can rattle around in their sockets.

, The weight of this dust can create an out of balance situation which can put unequal pressure on the fan motor bearings, causing them to squeak, and wear out prematurely, as well.

, Some light kits come with a rubber band-like accessory that is wrapped around the ""neck"" of the glove to isolate it from the metal flange, to prevent squeaking if the unit is slightly out of balance or wobbles.

, These are knurled headed screws which should only be tightened finger tight; excess pressure can cause the glass to break if too much force is applied.

, If not, proceed to the next troubleshooting steps.

, This can be done with a ""Balancing Kit"" sold at home centers and electrical supply stores. These kits have a weighted, self-adhesive material similar to very thick tape that is attached to the top of the fan blades. Follow package instructions, or if you are very patient, attach small pieces of these weights by trial and error to balance your blades.

, If not, there is a possibility the bearings in the fan motor are wearing out, and this can cause a fan motor to overheat and ""short out"". This, in turn, can be a serious fire hazard. Most ceiling fans come with sealed bearings which cannot be lubricated, but if someone really wanted to salvage the fan, you may be able to disassemble the motor and use a light machine oil on the bearings if you can get access to them.

Put plants in your home.,
Get a salt lamp.,
Burn beeswax candles.",How to Increase Oxygen Levels in Your Home2," Fill your home with indoor plants to purify the air and increase oxygen in your space.If you have limited room, put plants in the rooms you use the most, like your bedroom and kitchen. If you have pets, research online before purchasing plants to make sure they’re non-toxic. All plants are good at boosting the oxygen in your home, but the following are very efficient:Aloe
English ivy
Rubber tree
Peace lily
Philodendron
Snake plant
Spider plant
Red-edged dracaena
Golden pothos

, Though not scientifically proven, some believe that lamps made from pink Himalayan salt may help to purify the air. They emit a nice pink glow as well. This may not generate enough negative ions to change your environment, but it might help remove some of the toxins in the air around you., Candles made of beeswax don’t smoke when they’re lit, and they don’t release chemicals as they burn. Similar to salt lamps, these candles don’t release enough ions to purify the air completely. However, beeswax candles may be a healthier substitute for more common candles made of paraffin, which usually emit pollutants.You can purchase beeswax candles at your local health food store or online.


Never let candles burn unattended.

Use a portable oxygen tank.,
Get compressed gas or liquid oxygen for your home.,
Obtain an oxygen concentrator.",How to Increase Oxygen Levels in Your Home3," Oxygen comes in portable, lightweight units that are easy to carry around the house with you.Ask your doctor for a prescription for an oxygen tank. They will do some lung function tests and prescribe you the appropriate amount of oxygen. Place the small clear nosepiece (nasal cannula) inside your nostrils to get oxygen straight from the tank.Oxygen therapy at home should be used with caution, especially when treating Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Always follow instructions given by your physician.Always follow safety precautions when using oxygen: Do not smoke, apply heat, or have any sort of fire near your oxygen containers.Depending on your symptoms and your doctor’s recommendations, you can use oxygen all the time or only while you’re exercising or sleeping. Oxygen intake should be carefully monitored at all times when the tank is being used.
Medical equipment is only appropriate for people with specific illnesses. Consult your doctor to see if these options are right for you.

, If you only need high-flow oxygen while you’re at home, get gas or liquid oxygen delivered from a reputable provider. Ask your doctor to help your choose a type of oxygen, or contact your health insurance company to ask if they have a preferred provider. Oxygen can come to your home as compressed gas in a tank or cylinder, or as a liquid.Liquid oxygen is more portable, but the tanks do not last as long.

, Oxygen concentrators plug into an outlet and continuously filter oxygen from your environment, channeling it to you through a face mask or nasal cannula.This is a good option if you need lots of concentrated oxygen while at home due to a chronic illness. Your doctor can suggest a good machine, and a nurse will set it up and show you how to use it."

Measure the dimensions of your bathroom.,
Calculate the floor area of your bathroom.,
Calculate the total volume of your bathroom.,
Determine the required CFM for your bathroom fan.,
Purchase a bathroom fan with the required CFM rating or higher.",How to Calculate CFM for Bathroom Fan," Use a tape measure to measure each dimension of your bathroom - the length of each wall and the height from floor to ceiling. For a bathroom with a rectangular floor plan, you can keep these numbers in your head for the CFM calculation. If you have an irregular floor plan, you may want to draw and label the plan on paper to help you calculate your bathroom's volume.;
, For a rectangular bathroom, this is done by multiplying the width and length. For example, a 7 ft x 10 ft (2.1 m x 3 m) bathroom has a floor area of 70 square feet (6.5 square meters). If your bathroom has a more complex shape, break the floor plan into simpler shapes, calculate their areas, and then add those areas together to arrive at the total floor area.  Don't ignore the air above the bathtub--it is part of the total volume.

, This is done by multiplying your bathroom's floor area by the ceiling height. For example, a bathroom with a 90 square feet (8.4 square meters) floor area and a 9 ft (2.7 m) ceiling height has a total volume of 810 cubic feet (22.9 cubic meters).


Your bathroom ceiling may not have a uniform height; for example, it may be slanted or vaulted. In this case, estimate the average ceiling height (somewhere in between the lowest and highest points) and use that in your calculation.

, An effective bathroom fan should be capable of replacing the entire volume of air 8 times per hour, or every 7.5 minutes. To arrive at your required CFM, simply divide your bathroom's volume by 7.5. For example, a bathroom with a volume of 1000 cubic feet (28.3 cubic meters) needs a fan capable of moving (1000 / 7.5) or 133 CFM (3.8 cubic meters per minute).

, After calculating your required CFM, make sure to check the rating of any fan your purchase. A fan with too low of a rating won't remove moisture effectively, while buying a fan with too much power may lead to unnecessary noise (as more powerful fans tend to be louder). Aim for a CFM rating just above your requirement.

Unplug the box fan.,
Remove the outer covers of the fan.Unscrew the screw securing both grilles to the metal box frame and remove them.,
Clean the outer covers of the fan.,
Spray and wipe down the blades to clean them.,
Reassemble the box fan back together.Be sure that all the parts are thoroughly dry before reassembling.",How to Clean a Box Fan1," Wipe down the power cord with a damp cloth. Make sure to dry it. Set the fan itself on a waist level work area, like on a bench or kitchen table.





;
, Place the screws in a plastic baggie for later to ensure the screws don’t get lost.








, Use your bathtub as a method to clean the covers. Plug the drain to your tub and add enough water to soak them in. When the dust and dirt removes easily with a rinse, the covers are finished soaking.








An alternative method is dousing the covers down with some vinegar. If you have a hose outside, use that to hose off your covers. The dirt will come right off.It’s slightly harder to clean the covers by hand, but it can be done that way as well. Spray the covers with equal parts water and vinegar, and then wipe the dirt away with a towel., You can either use the towel you already dampened with vinegar and water, or apply vinegar and water to a dry towel. Be careful to avoid spraying directly onto the blades and focus on getting on the cloth to transfer it to the blades. Apply pulling pressure to the blade set and remove it if needed.








Use a vacuum with the hose attachment to vacuum out the motor vents.
You can also use mild dish soap mixed with water and use a q-tip to help you clean out hard to reach areas in the motors.Gently wipe all plastic parts, like the outside of the fan, its carrying handle, and its knobs, down with a damp cloth.

, Apply pushing pressure to the blade set and knock it back on gently with a hammer. Secure both plastic grilles and use the screws you removed earlier to screw it back into place. Place on the plastic speed control dial knob.

Disassemble the box fan to see if there are any loose internal fasteners if the problem persists.Inspect blades to make sure there aren’t any cracks, and replace them as necessary.,
Quiet any rattling the box fan might make.",How to Clean a Box Fan2," Accrued dirt on fan blades cause bearings to become worn out, which creates a lot of noise from the fan. Every two weeks you should vacuum the fan with the crevice-cleaning hose attachment. Wipe down the blades with a damp sponge twice a summer.







, Box fans do an amazing job keeping the house cool, but often times also cause a lot of noise. Look for looseness in the fan guards, its housing, and its fan guards.








Wedge a piece of cardboard between the edges of blade guards if they are not firmly attached to the fan and their looseness is causing a rattle.Add a drop of silicone sealant to secure the decorative cap to the front guard of the fan if it is too noisy., Screw the spinner further into place and tighten it if it seems too loose. This will tighten the fan hub to the shaft and simultaneously secure the spinner into place.







, If you notice that the box fan makes noise on level or smooth surfaces instead of on cushioned surfaces, it might be an issue with its base. Pads might be missing so inspect the base of the fan and replace its pads as needed."

Measure the length and width of the room.,
Measure the ceiling height.,
Find a fan that is the appropriate size.,
Choose the drop rod length.,
Evaluate the efficiency of the fan.,
Look online.,
Go to a store.,
Look for a good warranty.,
Match the style.,
Consider accessories.",How to Buy a Ceiling Fan," Before you go ahead and buy your new ceiling fan, there are a number of factors and variables that you need to take into account. The first of these is the size of the room you are buying the fan for. To make sure that the fan works effectively you need to ensure that it is big enough for the space.


Get hold of a tape measure and determine the length and width of the room.
A larger fan will work better in a larger room.;
, Once you have measured the height and width of the room, you need to measure the ceiling height. This measurement will give you the overall size of the room, as well as helping you to determine how far from the ceiling you can suspend the fan.


As a general rule the fan should always be suspended at least seven feet above the floor of the room.
If you have a ceiling height of nine feet or more, you can use a longer drop rod to increase the distance between the ceiling and the fan., Now you have all the measurements, you need to match your room to a recommended fan size. Multiply the length of the room, by the width of the room to find an approximate value for the square footage of the room. Once you have this number, you can match it to a fan size. Some common matches are as follows:


A room of up to 75 square feet = a 29-36 inch fan.
A room of 76-144 square feet = a 36-42 inch fan.
A room of around 144-225 square feet = a 44 inch fan.
A room of between 225-400 square feet = a 50-54 inch fan.A room of up to 500 square feet = a 60 inch fan., You will now have to decide on a drop rod length that fits the ceiling height of the room. Remember that you should always ensure you have at least seven feet of clearance beneath the fan and the floor for safety reasons.


If the ceiling is low, only 7-7 ½ feet, you can get a hugger fan, which is suspended very close to the ceiling.
Choose a close adapter fan for ceilings that are between 7.5 and 8 feet. For higher ceilings you will need a drop rod of the appropriate length.Standard fans tend to be designed for rooms with ceilings between 8 and 9 feet high. For a room like this you will not need to add any length to the down rod.
For taller ceilings the recommendations are as follows:

9 feet ceiling = 12 inch drop rod.
10 feet ceiling = 18 inch drop rod.
11 feet ceiling = 24 inch drop rod.
12 feet ceiling = 36 inch drop rod.
13 feet ceiling = 48 inch drop rod., Once you have determined what size fan you need, you can consider the other factors that will influence your decision on what fan to buy. The first thing you should look at is the efficiency and effectiveness of the fan. You will want a fan that works well, moving air around the room and keeping you cool. Fans should have a number of cubic feet per minute written on the box. This figure tells you how much air the fan moves.


The higher the number, the more air the fan can move.
Be aware that a higher number may also mean more noise.
If the fan has an Energy Star label, it means that it moves air 20 per cent more efficiently than the standard fan models., After you have determined all the information you need about the size and specification of the fan, you should spend a little time researching pricing online. Doing some research will help you get a clearer picture of the pricing range and different places that sell fans. Do this before you go to the store to help you to make a more informed decision.Looking online will also enable you to see user reviews of different fans, which can give you a useful insight.
Remember that user reviews are not always completely reliable.

, Once you have spent some time researching fans online, it’s a good idea to visit some local DIY, hardware and lighting stores to look at the range they have available. With a big purchase like a ceiling fan, it’s generally a good idea to see the item in the flesh before you commit to buying anything. Perhaps the colour or design will look slightly different than it did online.


Visiting a store also gives you a good opportunity to talk to people in the shop who will have experience and knowledge about the different fans.
Be wary of salesmen trying to push you into a purchase, but do try to get impartial advice if you can.

, Fans come in wide-range of prices, starting as cheap as around $40. Remember that this is a potentially big purchase which requires installation and you will not want to have to replace it regularly. It can be hard to judge the quality or longevity of a product, but a good general guide is to pay attention to the length of warranty on offer.


As a general rule for ceiling fans, you should try to get one that has a warranty of at least ten years., Now you have worked out all the technical specifications you need for your fan, you can think about what style and look you want to go for. If you want the fan to be an integral part of your décor, think about how you can tie it in with the colour scheme and style of the room. You can choose to make the fan a big feature by choosing an ornate or striking design, perhaps with lots of light and colour.


Alternatively, if you want to fan to blend in more, you can choose one that is more modest and is of a colour that matches the ceiling.Some fans will have reversible blades, so you can change the colour of the blade you see in the room.
You can even buy shades for ceiling fans, in glass or fabric, which obscure the blades and give you a cleaner look., There is an increasingly wide-range of ceiling fan accessories available, which you can use to customise and change your fan. Light kits are some of the most popular accessories. These enable you to make your fan into a light even after installation. These are good if you want to make your fan into more of a feature in the room, and avoid cluttering up your ceiling with too many fittings.Most new fans include either a wall or remote control.

, Take warm showers in the morning and at night to keep you cold. Do not take cold showers because then the body tries to heat you up, instead of cooling you down.

, They keep cold air circulating through the room and cool off the hot air. If you have one, use a personal fan. Rotating ground fans are the best.

, Keeping your upper body is essential as it is the base temperature for the rest of the body. The frozen water will also melt and give you water.

, Being submerged in water cools off your body and hydrates your pores. You may also make good friends who's houses may still have air conditioning!

, These are good places to cool off. Places like the library and movie theater can also take your mind off the heat by distracting you.

Decide where you want to install the fan.,
Consider various room factors:


Room Size

30"" ceiling fan for rooms up to 8' x 10' (small bedrooms, walk-in closets, smaller kitchens)
42"" ceiling fan for rooms up to 12' x 12' (medium bedrooms, kitchens, small recreation areas)
52"" ceiling fan for rooms up to 18' x 20' (large bedrooms, family rooms, great rooms, dining rooms)


Ceiling Height

Low ceiling: Hugger mount or traditional- mount without down rod
Standard 8' ceiling: traditional- mount with down rod
9' or Higher ceiling: Extended down rod
Sloped ceiling: Extended down rod


You will need to check the floor to ceiling height of the blades.,
Think about electricity.,
Choose a good quality fan.",How to Choose the Right Ceiling Fan," Most fans are placed in the center of the room, allowing smooth air flow throughout the room. However, larger rooms may be better suited for 2 fans for optimal air flow. For safety reasons, do not install a fan over a bed.;
, Make sure you take into account the distance that the fan hangs from the ceiling.

For safety, a minimum height of 7’-9’ is recommended. If your fan does not meet the 7’ recommendation, you can look into a low-ceiling mount. Building codes in your area may require this.
For optimum air circulation it is most efficient to have the fan blade 8' to 9' above the floor. For higher ceilings see the chart for recommended down rod length.



, Since fans require the same amount of power as most ceiling fixtures, the electrical circuit shouldn’t be overloaded.


If the fan includes a light fixture, ensure that the circuit is able to handle both the fan and light. If your circuit will not hold this capacity then a new circuit must be run from the home’s main panel to the fan.
If there was not a preexisting fixture, you will need to create a place to hang the fan. If your home is not wired properly, some fans do have swag wiring that can be plugged into a wall outlet, but ceiling installation is preferred.
It is easiest to install ceiling bracing and electrical wiring during new home construction even if you will be installing a fan at a later time.
Consulting an electrician is always your best option.

, A cheap fan is more trouble than it is worth. Not only will a cheap fan wobble, but a poor-quality fan will not circulate as much air at a given RPM.


While speed helps control how much air is moved, blade pitch (angle between blade and horizontal) and design also play a role. Good quality fans boast motors that have more power, so as to allow for greater blade pitch. Cheap fans, on the other hand, have motors that are not strong enough to handle the air resistance associated with greater blade pitch, requiring the manufacturer to lower the blade pitch to avoid burning out the motor.
Also, cheap fans produce a humming noise. Remember that a good-quality fan will not always be priced unreasonably high. Even Hunter ceiling fans, which can be found at stores such as Lowes or Home Depot, are of decent quality for reasonable price.

Check the fan blades for dust and build-up.,
Check to make sure all the blades are screwed in tightly.,
Measure the blade alignment.,
Weight the blades with a balancing clip.,
Place the clip in the center of the blade.,
Determine the best placement of the weight.,
Weight the fan.",How to Balance a Wobbly Ceiling Fan," It's easy to skip dusting the fan blades when you're cleaning the house, so over the course of a few months, or even years, a large amount of dust will accumulate the weight of which can misalign the blades, causing them to wobble. With the fan turned off and the blades still, clean any excess build-up off the top, sides, and bottom of the fan blades with your a household cleaner.


Turn the fan back on and check for wobble. If it continues, one of the blades is probably out of alignment.;
, Look at the fan's flywheel, which is the part attached to the ceiling, and find the point at which the blade attaches to the mechanism. With a screwdriver, tighten any screws that seem to be loose.


Alternatively, at this point you can unscrew the fan blades and clean them further. Dust can build up in the gaps in between the blades and the flywheel, causing misalignment after a while. If any of them are loose, unscrew them, remove them, and clean the blades before replacing them securely.

, With a ruler or yardstick, measure the distance between the end of each blade (the point farthest from the flywheel, the furthest point to the right of the blade in the image, NOT where the arrow is located) and the ceiling. Do this for each blade.If any of the distances are slightly higher than the others, try bending it up or down gently at the blade holder. Be careful not to snap or jostle anything that attaches to the flywheel. Just use a little bit of pressure to align the blade.

, For a dollar or two, you can get a blade balancing kit at most home improvement stores.It should come with a U-shaped clip and some small self-adhering weights. You might end up getting more than one if you've got a significant wobble, but it probably won't be necessary.

, Clip the provided U-clip from the kit in the center of any of the blades, and watch to see if the wobble decreases when you turn the fan back on. Turn the fan off and move the clip to the same position on another blade. Check to see which blade is most affected by the presence of the clip by decreasing the wobble. This is the blade that you need to weight.

, Starting in the center, move the clip out toward the end of the blade and turn the fan back on to check for wobble. Move the fan in increments of a few inches up and down the blade to determine which placement most deters the wobble of the blade.

, Once you find the problem spot, remove the clip and replace the plastic clip with a stick-on weight provided in the kit. You'll want to place the weight on top of the fan. It should have a peel-off self-adhesive surface on which you fix it.


If the fan still has some wobble in it, you can add another weight to the same blade. If the wobble gets worse, remove the weight and use the clip to find a more suitable location.

Have a plan.",How to Stay Cool During the Summer," Air conditioning is not an amenity that every household has. If you don’t have air conditioning, plan a few hours to go somewhere that has it. Try to do so in the middle of the afternoon (the hottest part of the day).


Have late lunch with friends in a restaurant.
Study at the library.
Walk through the mall.
Go to a museum.
See a movie.;
, If you are outside, don’t spend extended amounts of time without shade. The cooling effect of a tree is equivalent to ten room-size air conditioners operating 20 hours per day.Under trees, umbrellas, tents, gazebos, or awnings are all great places to relax in the shade.

, If you live near a body of water, there is likely to be a breeze there. If you live in the mountains, the valley between them is likely to have a cool breeze.If you don’t have access to a breezy area, you can use a fan for the same effect.

, You should consume 6-12 ounces of water every 15 minutes in the hot summer days. If you do this, you’ll be aiming to drink a gallon of water a day. If you don’t normally drink water, this may sound daunting. However, if you switch out soft drinks during lunch or your afternoon coffee with waters, you’ll have no problem drinking a full gallon throughout the day., Caffeinated beverages, such as coffee, tea, and soda are detrimental to your hydration. They pull water from your body. You don’t have to cut it out of your diet completely but limit yourself to one or two a day., Sports drinks were designed to hydrate you properly. They contain electrolytes (a mixture of carbohydrates, sodium, and potassium). These help replace the minerals that you lose when you sweat and help keep you hydrated. Plus, if you don’t like the taste of water, sports drinks come in hundreds of flavors.

, These will reflect the light away from your body. Dark colored clothing attracts the light and holds heat in, making your body temperature rise.

, Lightweight clothes are the best choice when you’re trying to keep cool. Of course if you’re at the beach or at home, you can wear minimal clothing. But if you’re running errands or going to work, you should wear linen, cotton, silk, or other breathable fabrics. Keep your clothing loose and breezy., The heat will exhaust you more quickly than cooler temperatures. Take time to rest during the day in a shaded spot to keep your body temperature down.

, You might not be able to rest during the day. If you work outside or play outdoor sports in the summer, you need to be aware of your limits. Make sure that you’re consistently drinking water throughout the day—not just during the time of activity. If you get a moment to rest, do so under the shade. As soon as you notice that you don’t feel well, take yourself out of the heat. Any dizziness, headaches, or stomach aches can be early signs of heat illness., If you are in the heat for an extended amount of time, you’re putting yourself at risk of heat illness. This ranges from basic symptoms to heat stroke. Watch for the basic symptoms so that you can react before it becomes more serious.


Dizziness
Headache
Muscle cramps
Nausea

, If you pass off the early signs as something other than heat illness, the symptoms will grow more severe. This is when you’re passing the realm of heat exhaustion and entering a medical emergency situation called a heat stroke.Profuse sweating
Convulsions and chills
Confusion/mumbling
Vomiting

, Be prepared just in case these heat illnesses happen. If you recognize early signs, you can simply rest in the shade, and drink 2 quarts of water in the next hour while you rest. If they become more severe, you will need medical attention. If no one is with you, call for help. Immediately strip and cover your entire body in cool water. (You can use the spray from a garden hose.) Place ice packs under the armpits and groin."

Check the average humidity in your area.,
Check your water supply.,
Assess your house ventilation.",How to Make the Air Colder in a Swamp Cooler Home1," Evaporative coolers work best with very low relative humidity and hot temperatures. If the average humidity in your area is 40-50%, an evaporative cooler will not work properly.;
, Your swamp cooler will need a lot of water—as the name implies, it works by evaporation, so make sure you have plenty to go.

, Swamp coolers will increase the humidity in your home significantly, so you need to have very good ventilation. Homes built for evaporative coolers will have the ductwork in place, but for most retrofit installations, you'll want windows opened. I know, you grew up with your dad telling you ""close the windows, we aren't cooling the neighborhood,"" but with swamp coolers that's exactly what you want to do!

"
"
Calculate your CFM rating.,
Use this formula to calculate the CFM needed to cool your home:


Determine the area of the space you want to cool.",How to Make the Air Colder in a Swamp Cooler Home2," Swamp coolers are rated by how much air the cooler can move, and is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM).

,
Multiply this figure by the height of your ceilings.
Divide that number by 2 (120 for European measurements).
The result is the CFM rating for the evaporative cooler you need.
For example: If you have a 1,500 square foot home with 8 foot (2.4 m) ceilings:

1,500 square feet x 8 feet (2.4 m). ceilings = 12,000 ÷ 2 = 6,000 CFM.
You need a unit rated at 6,000 CFM or higher.


Example 2, in CMS (cubic meters per second): If you have a 140m2 home with 3m ceilings:

140m2 x 3m ceiling = 420 ÷ 120 = 3.5 centimeters (1.4 in).
You need a unit rated at 3.5 centimeters (1.4 in) or higher.



"
"
Purchase an evaporative cooler.,
Set it up.,
Create a ""vent"" to direct the cool air through the house.,
Wait until it's 85°F (30°C) or higher outside.,
Clean the filter regularly.",How to Make the Air Colder in a Swamp Cooler Home3," Make sure that it's rated at least the minimum CFM (CMS) that meets your requirements.

, Different types are installed different ways. Your dwelling may be pre-fitted for installation, and if so—install there.


Swamp coolers are most efficient on the roof: cool air sinks, after all. But there may be issues with placement, leakage, or supply that prevent that.
Consider portable evaporative coolers. They are also available in-wall or window-mounted.
Make sure you follow the manufacturers instructions completely to maximize the output of your swamp cooler.

, e.g. During the day open a window in the living room an inch or two and close the bedroom doors to cool the space you're using and cool less space. At night close the living room window and open one in each bedroom that will be used. Remember open the windows just a crack to direct air out without letting hot air in. Venting also prevents moisture build-up in your house will not only reduce the efficiency of the swamp cooler, it could also cause indoor humidity to run out of control and damage furniture, books, or musical instruments. This is because swamp coolers use moisture to cool the air. When there is too much moisture, the temperature won't change as much.

, Believe it or not, swamp coolers operate the best when it's warmer. The evaporation mechanism is most efficient when there is a significant difference between the cooling pads, the water, and the air, and as long as the outdoor relative humidity is less than 30%.

, The water filter for the swamp cooler cleans out any impurities for maximum evaporation. When the filter is clogged, these impurities will get through and evaporation will slow, or stop altogether.


If that's not enough to motivate you, consider why the evaporative cooler bears the euphemistic name swamp cooler. Early units had a problem with algae growth, and the resultant odor would make an alligator feel right at home.

Evaluate if your situation is appropriate for this cooling method.,
Choose your fan(s).,
Decide on the placement of window fans.,
Place fans in windows.,
Mask window gaps adjacent to the fan.,
Turn on window fans whenever it is cooler outside than inside.",How to Use Window Fans for Home Cooling,"


If the temperature is uncomfortably hot and/or humid both day and night, then this method isn't appropriate for you. If this is only the case during the day, a window fan can be successfully used to bring the temperature down at night.
If you live in a very polluted area, using a window fan will pull this pollution inside.
Window fan ventilation is not recommended for those without adequate window screens, as insects or animals may enter through the open windows. Gnats and other small insects often get in right through window screens, so be prepared to accept that or don't use this method.
In high crime areas, windows accessible from the outside are also likely to be used as a means of entrance by criminals.
Noises outside the home will also become louder inside with the window open, although the fan noise may mask some of this.;
, Ideally, each fan should be the largest that will fit inside the window. Avoid fans that are too large for the window, as positioning them near the window, outside the window frame, frequently results in their falling over. Your house should have an approximately even capacity blowing inward as outward (bearing in mind that smaller, less powerful fans should be counted as a portion of a fan for calculation purposes). If you have an uneven capacity that can't be balanced, it's better to have more blowing inward, as that creates a slight positive pressure inside the home, which prevents carrying dust and insects in when doors are opened and stops ""bad air"" from backing down chimneys.

, This will also determine which fans will blow inward and which outward. There are many considerations here:


Blow inward on the coolest sides of the house. This will typically be the sides in shade.
Work with the prevailing wind direction, pointing fans in the same direction as the wind blows, rather than fighting the wind. On days when the wind is strong enough, you may not even need the fans.
In a single-story flat, arrange fans to blow inward on one side of the house and outward on the opposite side, with the doors open in between for maximum air flow.
For multi-story houses, another option is to use the fact that heat rises to assist the air flow by blowing cool air into the lower floors and hot air out of the upper floors, including the attic (with the attic door left open if possible).
Avoid blowing inward near garbage cans or parking areas, where fumes and odors may enter the house. Air intake near trees or plants often provides pleasant smelling air, unless pollen presents a problem.
Fans blowing inward toward a refrigerator/freezer may blow cool air out quicker than usual (when open), thus increasing the load on the device, so avoid this.
Bear in mind that an inward blowing fan may disrupt loose papers, so avoid this in areas like a home office, or secure all papers first.
Avoid placing inward blowing window fans above valuable items, like an antique desk or expensive oriental rug, to prevent water damage.
Rooms with fans blowing inward will both seem cooler (due to the increased circulation) and will cool down quicker than rooms with fans blowing out.

, Close the window as tightly as possible around the fan to hold it in place and prevent local circulation. Local circulation is where the same air blown through the fan then goes back around the fan and gets sucked back in, repeating the cycle indefinitely. This just results in the motor warming the air.

, If the fan is blowing inward, the air will want to go back out around the fan due to a local pressure increase. Placing drapes or even paper at the sides of the fan will often work in this case, since they will be suctioned to the window screen. Fans blowing outward are more difficult to mask, as the air around them will want to blow inward. You could place paper or cardboard on the outside of the window, if it's accessible, or tape it down on the inside. Or, you could opt to skip the masking in this case and accept the lower efficiency instead.

, Turn them off, remove the fans and close the windows when the house is cool enough to offset the predicted daytime temperature. A general rule of thumb is that the inside daytime temperature will be the average of the outside daytime temperature and the inside nighttime temperature. So, if you want to keep the inside temp down to 70 °F (21 °C) and are expecting a high of 80 degrees outside, you need to lower the inside temp to 60 degrees at night. This will vary from home to home, but you can use this rule of thumb until you figure out the formula for your area. In this example, the fans could be turned off once the inside temperature dropped below 60.

Keep doors to bedrooms and bathrooms open as much as possible, this will allow better airflow in your house.,
Keep the windows open while it is still cool outside.,
Close shades and blinds on the sunny side of the house.

Open the windows at night.,
Buy a fan for your room and some other hot rooms in the house.",How to Keep Your House Cool Without an Air Conditioner1,";
, To keep the coolness in the house, close them until the house starts to heat up.

,, If possible, open a door to the attic or loft; this creates a ""stack effect"" and the hot air will rise out of the living space.

, Circulating hot air feels better than stagnant hot air.


Wet a big towel, hang from the ceiling in the pathway of the fan's breeze and close the door. The towel will absorb all the heat in your bedroom.
Small wet towels or face-washers can be hung directly over a fan too; just be sure to not have any ends of the towel dangling near the fan blades.

Don't cook anything on the stove.,
Cook only in the cool of the evenings or first thing in the morning.",How to Keep Your House Cool Without an Air Conditioner2," In particular, do not use a gas stove or the oven. Instead, shift your cooking to the outside grill and get some fresh (albeit hot) air.

, Bake early, grill outdoors late. That way, you can keep the heat to a minimum. Enjoy fresh salads, sandwiches and cool foods throughout the day.

Close your blinds/curtains.,
Turn off all unnecessary heat-producing devices, appliances and lights.,
Pick up the clutter.,
Open a window and close off other rooms in the house.",How to Cool Down a Room1," About 30 percent of unwanted heat comes from windows. Close your window coverings to prevent direct sunlight from heating up the room. If you don’t already have blinds or curtains in the room, invest in some, especially if you have any south or west-facing windows. By using window coverings, you can reduce indoor temperatures by up to 20 degrees.Try to keep the window coverings closed from morning until late afternoon, when the sun is at its peak.
If heat is a persistent problem in the room, consider purchasing thermal insulated black out curtains.;
, Any device that is powered on is currently contributing to the heat in the room. Unplug or turn off everything you’re not using. Computers and televisions in particular generate a lot of heat. Incandescent lightbulbs are big heat-generators, too. If possible, turn the lights off in the room.


It's not always feasible to turn out all the lights. At the very least, dim them as much as you can.Consider replacing your incandescent lights with compact fluorescent lamps, which generate far less heat.CFLs are more environmentally-friendly, as well.

, Piles of clothing and other kinds of clutter absorb heat and keep it trapped in the room. The less clutter you have in the room, the more available space there is for the heat to disperse and the faster it will cool down.A lot of clutter can also restrict airflow, making it feel even hotter in the room. Toss any piles of clothing you have on the floor into your closet and shut the door behind them.


Do a quick survey of the remaining clutter and quickly eliminate what you can.

, If it’s hotter inside the room than it is outside, the walls have probably absorbed a lot of heat from sunlight throughout the day. Remove this trapped heat and push it outdoors by opening the windows in the room.Close off any spaces in the house that you currently aren’t using, too. This will help to cool down the room you’re in more quickly.Once it cools off a bit, be sure to close the windows.

Turn on the ceiling fan(s) and adjust the settings.,
Turn on any other fans you have at your disposal.,
Place a tray of ice in front of one of the fans.,
Position a box fan in an open window, facing out.",How to Cool Down a Room2," Ceiling fans are very effective because they move the air around the room and create a draft.They also pull air up when circulating it, and since hot air rises, this will help to cool the room down faster.If the ceiling fan isn’t already on in the room, turn it on immediately. If your ceiling fan has settings of low, medium and high, put the fan on the highest setting.


Check the ceiling fan blades to see if they’re rotating counterclockwise (if viewing them from below) – if they aren’t, adjust the settings.
Setting the blades to rotate counterclockwise and turning the fan on a higher speed will substantially increase air flow., Table fans, box fans, oscillating fans and mounted fans will all help to contribute to air circulation in the room and create a wind chill effect.A medium-sized oscillating fan placed on a desktop is very efficient at moving around stagnant hot air quickly. Keep multiple fans set up in the room during the summer so you can turn them on as soon as you walk in.Turn on your bathroom ventilation fan, too. The ventilation fan can help suck hot air out of the room, just as it does when you take a steamy shower., Create a makeshift air conditioner by filling up a shallow pan, tray or mixing bowl with ice and positioning it in front one of the fans. This will get cold, slightly misty air circulating the room very quickly.You could also use icepacks or, if you’re all out of ice, you can effectively improvise with something similarly cold, like a bag of frozen vegetables.


Position the bowl at a slight angle, tilted up, if the fan doesn’t seem to be blowing across the ice effectively., The fan will pull hot air out of the room and transfer it outside. It will also bring in cooler air. Put the fan in the window that gets the most shade – this will provide the coolest intake air. Close any other windows nearby tightly. Open a few windows on the other side of your house. This will create a house-wide draft and cool things down quickly."

Install a window air conditioning unit or get a portable one.One of the best ways to quickly cool down a room is to install a window A/C unit.,
Open the windows at night.Temperatures typically drop at night, even in the summer.,
Consider getting a dehumidifier if you live in a humid climate.,
Manage your window coverings.",How to Cool Down a Room3," This will effectively cool down the room by working to condition the air in that space only.A central air conditioning system has to work to cool down the entire house, which takes a lot longer. Installing a window A/C unit is easy to do, especially if you have a sash window.


If you don’t want to bother with installation or you have windows that aren’t ideal for it, consider buying a portable air conditioner. All you have to do is plug it in – no installation necessary., Take advantage of the cooler air by cracking a few windows at night before you go to sleep. You can capitalize on this cooler night air by setting up a fan or two across from a window to create a nice cross-breeze. Make sure you close the windows tightly in the morning to avoid letting hot air in. Close the blinds or curtains, too.Unplug all of the electronics in the room during the night, as well, to cool down the area even more., Humidity can make heat feel even more oppressive. If you live in a humid area, you might want to get a dehumidifier. These devices pull in the humid air of a room and circulate it around special coils before releasing it back into the room. You can pick up a dehumidifier at any home improvement store.


Dehumidifiers aren’t cheap, but they are usually portable, so you can bring it from room to room to maximize its usage.
For best results, place the dehumidifier in the center of the room you are trying to cool down., If you are using window curtains or drapes, get medium-colored ones with white plastic backing to efficiently block heat. Be sure to hang them as close to the window as possible. Shades are also very effective at keeping heat out – be sure to mount these as close to the window glass as you can to create a sealed space to trap heat. Consider getting reversible shades that are white on one side and dark on the other side.


In the summer you can position the white side facing out to reflect the sun and in the winter the dark side can be positioned to face out, which will absorb heat."

Shut power off.,
Remove and disconnect the light fixture.,
Remove one or more fan blades.,
Prepare to remove the fan from the ceiling.,
Disconnect and remove the fan.",How to Remove a Ceiling (Paddle) Fan for Reuse1," This may be done at the wall switch, if the switch(es) control the entire fixture (both fan and light). If the wall switch controls only the light, and a pull chain on the fixture controls the fan (or vice versa), or if an RF remote is used, then it should be shut off at the electrical panel.

, This is should be done only if the light fixture is overly ornate, delicate, heavy or obstructs access to the fan blades. Generally, the light fixture is secured with 3 or 4 screws that need to be removed. These screws may be behind a glass globe or shield that needs to be removed to access. With the screws visible, have a helper supports the fixture and remove the screws that secure it. Allow the fixture to separate from the fan several inches. Disconnect the light fixture from the fan wiring. The light fixture will most likely have either a nylon molded plug or wirenuts connecting it to the fan portion. Identify the wires and remove the wirenuts. If a nylon plug is used, simply pull apart. The plug can only be inserted one way.

, All of the blades may be removed if desired, but all that is required are enough to allow access to the ceiling where the fixture is secured. Many newer fans have blades that ""slip"" on metal studs on the hub support arms and lock into place, others require that 2 screws be removed from the hub support arms of the fan. Unclipping the blades is much quicker and reduces the chances of losing screws.

, If the fan does not have a down rod, skip ahead to ""Ceiling Hugger"" below. Locate a single screw on the housing that covers the ceiling wiring compartment. The housing looks like an ""upside down"" bell. Loosen the screw and slide the housing downward on the rod to the fan housing. The hanger and wiring should be visible now.

, Identify the wires originating from the ceiling box. The fan should have bare or green, white and black (and blue if a light fixture was installed) wires connected. Identify the wires from the ceiling as ""white"", ""fan"" and ""light"" as they are connected to the fan. If the fan's black and blue wires connect together with a wire from the ceiling, mark it as ""light"". If the fan utilized an ""RF remote"" instead of a wall switch to control all or part of the ceiling fan / light fixture, disconnect it from the ceiling allowing it to remain with the fan for now. Remove the the bare / green wire from the support fixture. With all wires disconnected, grasp the fan and or down-rod and lift upward. Maneuver the down-rod so round knob on the end can slip out of the ""cage"" or ""basket"" support it sits in, and lower to a helper. Skip ahead to ""Finishing Up"" below.

Remove and disconnect the fan.",How to Remove a Ceiling (Paddle) Fan for Reuse2," Locate 4 screws along the edge of the fan housing cover, close to the ceiling. (There may be a plastic piece concealing the screws that you have to twist off.) Inspection of the screws should reveal that two of the screws (one on each side) need to be completely removed. The remaining two screws need only be loosened, as the housing has a slot to allow it to slip off when properly aligned. Remove the two screws that must be completely removed. Loosen the remaining screws 2 or 3 turns.;
, The weight will instantly shift from the ceiling to you. Lower the fan about 6 inches (15.2 cm). With the support fixture in view, locate the hook. Align the hook with one of the two holes on the fixture housing (these were used for the support screws that were removed in the previous step), and hang.

, With the fan supported by the hook, identify the wires originating from the ceiling box. The fan should have bare or green, white and black (and blue if a light fixture was installed) wires connected. Identify the wires from the ceiling as ""white"", ""fan"" and ""light"" as they are connected to the fan. If the fan's black and blue wires connect together with a wire from the ceiling, mark it as ""light"". If the fan utilized an ""RF remote"" instead of a wall switch to control all or part of the ceiling fan / light fixture, disconnect it from the ceiling allowing it to remain with the fan for now.

Try filling a big cup with cold water and then put it in the freezer. Wait until it freezes and then you can take the ice cube out of the cup and dab it where you're sweating or hot.

, Don't go outside if you can help it between 11 o'clock and 3 o'clock, as these are the hours during which the sun is at its strongest.

, Try to do this without relying on fans too much. That way, you can be more independent of relying on any electrical equipment. This can become very important should there be a summer blackout.

, Use screens to keep out insects if they are a problem.

, Fans keep the air circulating and produce a small cooling effect. Place a wet face cloth on the fan to produce a mini air-conditioning effect. Be careful to set the wet cloth only on the outer cage part of the fan so that it cannot be caught by the fan blades. Also do not leave the room without removing the cloth from the fan.

, Read a good book, sit still or take a nap.When you move around, you will get hotter and hotter.

, If you can, select a shady body of water.

, There are lots of fun ways to use water to keep cool outdoors. Some suggestions include:

Consider running through sprinklers.






Have a water fight with a sibling or friend(s). Having a water gun fight is effective and fun too.
Dunk your head in cold water.
Pour a bucket of iced water over your head (Instagram ALS ice bucket competition).
Have a water balloon fight with your friends.
To keep your kids cool, get a paddling pool for them and fill it with cool water. You could also put up an umbrella to keep them in the shade.
Grab a companion, a hose, a sprinkler, a water bottle or water gun and flood your yard. Don't do this if you live under water restrictions.

, It keeps you cool and feels good.

Remove the panels and take out the fiber pads.,
Drain the water out of the swamp cooler.,
Brush out the inside of the swamp cooler.,
Soak the reservoir with vinegar.,
Scrub the water reservoir.",How to Clean a Swamp Cooler1," Unplug the cooler and turn off the water. Then remove the panels. Once the panels are removed, take out the used fiber pads., Open the drain plug if the swamp cooler has one. Allow the water to drain out. If there is no plug, siphon the water out with a hose.If you have a portable swamp cooler, make sure you drain the water outside and not inside your house.
For window-mounted swamp coolers, you can leave it mounted in the window and let it drain outside the window. You may also choose to unmount it for maintenance and then put it back in the window.

, Use a stiff brush or broom to sweep the inside of the swamp cooler. After you brush the debris and dirt loose, use a small vacuum that can be used on wet and dry surfaces to vacuum up the dirt.Debris can get inside the water pan. This can cause blockages that stop up the cooler, and may lead to unclean water cycling through it.

, To clean the water reservoir, pour distilled white vinegar inside it. Let the vinegar sit in the water reservoir for an hour. You can also rinse the water tank with mild soap and warm water. Rinse the water tank well.When the time is up, drain the vinegar or soapy water into a bucket.

, Use a scrub brush or cloth to clean the bottom of the water reservoir. Make sure to remove all stains and buildup, scrubbing harder if necessary. Rinse the water reservoir with clean water after you finish scrubbing."

Check the mechanical parts.,
Install fresh fiber pads.,
Refill the reservoir.,
Replace the panels.",How to Clean a Swamp Cooler2," While you have the swamp cooler apart, use a few drops of lubricating oil on the motor and fan. Use a few drops to lubricate the parts. You should also check the fan belt. Make sure there is tension and it is not sagging. The fan belt should only move about half an inch., Cut new fiber pads from the padding roll using shears. Use the old fiber pads you pulled out at the beginning to cut the shape of the new pads. Install the pads in the same places you removed them., Cut the water back on. Let the water reservoir refill., Double check to ensure the panels are properly attached. Then, plug the cooler back in and turn it on. Check to make sure the pump and fan are working."

Use a damp cloth to clean off the outside of the unit. Just use water. Don’t use any harsh chemicals that may cause damage., Cooling pads may only need to be changed twice each year, once at the beginning of the season and once in the middle of the season. However, pads may wear out faster. If you swamp cooler smells bad, or if the local water quality is lower, you may need to replace the pads more often.Check the pads every few months to look for cracks and overall poor condition.

, During the colder months, you probably will not use the swamp cooler. Make sure when the cooler is not in use that you shut down the entire system. Turn off the cooler and unplug it. Cut off the water supply and then drain all the water.Store the swamp cooler in a cool, dry area in the original carton.

, Swamp coolers can have musty smells. Mixing 15 drops of a scented essential oil, like lemon, lavender, or peppermint, or a mixture of essential oils can help make the swamp cooler smell better. Mix the essential oils with vinegar and place it in a spray bottle.Spray the essential oil mixture into the swamp cooler after you have cleaned it.

Drink water frequently.,
Spritz yourself with cool water.,
Freeze a handkerchief and put it on your neck, forehead, arms, or legs.,
Run cold water over your wrists.,
Wet your hair.,
Fill your bathtub with cool water and get in.,
Go for a swim.",How to Cool Yourself Without Air Conditioning1," Your body will feel cooler if you are hydrated. Try drinking eight ounces of water at least every hour. Adding mint leaves, or orange, lemon, or cucumber slices to your water makes it more refreshing. It may be easier to drink more if your water is flavored., Fill a spray bottle with cool water and adjust it to fine mist. Spray it on your exposed skin for an instant cooling effect.


You can also use a water misting fan. These portable devices are battery operated so you can take them with you wherever you go. As you mist and fan yourself, the water is evaporated on your skin, giving you an instant cooling sensation., Adding a cold cloth to your skin can help you beat the heat. When the cloth heats up, simply rinse it out and stick it back in the freezer.You can also put an icepack behind your head.

, Douse your wrists and other pressure points, such as your neck, your inner elbows, and behind your knees, in cool water for 10 seconds each. This will reduce your temperature for a little bit., Wet hair cools the body down, so try this for an instant chilling effect. You can wet all your hair, or just along the hairline. The evaporation of the water will cool your head (though it may make your hair a bit frizzy if it's curly).


Wear a bandana with water soaked on it and put it on your head.

, Once you are used to the temperature, let some water out and refill with cold water. Keep doing this until you are sufficiently cold. Your body will stay cool for a long time after you get out.


Take a cool shower rather than a bath, if you prefer.
You could also soak your feet in a bucket of cold water. The body radiates heat from the hands, feet, face and ears, so cooling any of these will efficiently cool the body. Kiddie wading pools are great for adult feet too.

, Visit the swimming pool, lake, ocean, or river and unwind. Taking a dip in the water will cool you down immensely. Be sure to wear sunscreen to prevent getting a sunburn, which will heat you up even more."

Close the blinds or curtains.,
Open the windows at night.,
Cool down your home with fans.,
Make a do-it-yourself air conditioner.,
Turn off all heat sources.,
Send up the cool air.,
Set your ceiling fans to run counterclockwise.,
Install a whole-house fan.",How to Cool Yourself Without Air Conditioning2," Shutting your blinds and curtains during the day will help block the sun's rays. As soon as the sun hits your building in the morning, close all windows and keep exterior doors and windows closed throughout the hottest part of the day. Do this until night falls and it is cool enough to open the windows for the night.Angle your blinds up, so that if you are looking through them you can see the ground, not the sky.
For even better protection, get cellular, insulated curtains, or window tint film, which, like car tint, looks like a dark or shiny part of the glass itself.

, Open strategic windows so that cooler night air is blowing in throughout the evening. Leaving all interior doors open (including closets and kitchen cabinets) helps, too. If you leave them closed, they store the daytime heat and your house won't cool off so quickly at night.Be sure to get up and close the windows and blinds as soon as the sunlight hits your house. This can be as early as 5-6 a.m. in some areas.

, Position a ceiling fan, an upstairs window fan, or an attic fan to draw off the heat collected in upper rooms and push the heat outdoors. Set up your portable fan so that the fan sucks up cooler air from the floor below, and blows hot air upwards towards the ceiling.


Use a combination of fans to create good air circulation. Blow hot air out by positioning a powerful exhaust fan near a window and use oscillating fans placed near other windows to blow in fresh, cooler air.
You can also turn on your stove ventilator hood fan or open up your chimney flue. These will also draw hot air out of the house and pull cooler evening air into the house.

, Put a metal bowl of salted ice in front of a fan, and adjust the fan so that the air is blowing over the ice. Or, use one or more 2 liter (0.5 US gal) bottles and fill them mostly full of water (70%) and rock salt (10%). Leave 20% of the volume empty for expansion. Freeze the liquid in the bottles, then place them in a large bowl (to catch dripping condensation). Position a fan to blow on them. As the salty ice in the bottles melts, the air around them cools and the fan will blow that air at you.The salt lowers the temperature at which the water freezes, allowing you to make the ice super cold.
The water and salt in the bottles can be refrozen every night and used repeatedly.

, Don't use the stove or oven for cooking. Eat cold food, or use the microwave or an outdoor grill when cooking your meals. Turn off your lamps and your computer when you're not using them. You should also turn off your TV since it gives off a lot of heat and take the power off of non-essential plug-in power adapters.Incandescent light bulbs also give off heat. Switch to compact fluorescents or LEDs.

, If your home has a basement and central air system, have an HVAC professional add a cold air return in the basement to pull the naturally cool air that falls down and recycle it into the rest of your home by simply setting your furnace to ""fan"" mode.


Install an individual room ventilation system with a cool air intake, hot air exhaust, and temperature and humidity controls. This will bring the night-time air in and let the A/C take over in the middle of the day.

, This will draw hot air up while circulating a cool breeze through your rooms. Turn the fans up to a higher speed to add an even cooler effect., This will pull hot air into the attic, where it dissipates via attic vents. To cool your house, open a door to the basement, and make sure that all doors between the basement and the room where the fan is located are open. Turn it on at night and open downstairs windows, and that will cool the house efficiently. However, make sure that you've got good attic vents, or your attic won't properly exhaust the heat.If you don’t have them already, install attic vents. It's amazing how much difference a cool attic makes to the temperature of a house.

Stock your freezer with flavored ice treats.,
Use a hint of mint.,
Use silk or satin pillowcases and sheets.",How to Cool Yourself Without Air Conditioning3," Avoid going out between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., when the sun's rays are hottest. You can also avoid a sunburn this way. Instead, exercise or run errands early in the morning or late in the evening. The early morning and evening are usually cool enough to enjoy your walk, run, hike, bike, gardening, or yard work., Wear loosely-woven natural fabrics (cotton, silk, linen) rather than polyester, rayon, or other artificial fibers (with the possible exception of performance fabrics).Choose light colored clothing. Darker colors will absorb the sun's heat and stay warmer longer than light or white clothing, which reflects light and heat.

, Take off those shoes and socks, especially on extremely humid days. Wearing shoes and socks will make your feet sweat, and raise your overall body temperature. Go barefoot as often as you can.

, Grab some popsicles from the grocery store, or freeze a bag of chopped fruit such as watermelon, pineapple, or lemons. Cooling down can be a tasty experience too!

, Mint refreshes the skin and leaves a nice cooling sensation. Try a few minty or menthol products to cool your skin. Slather on lotion with peppermint (avoid your face and eyes), shower with peppermint soap, use a minty foot soak or other powders with mint. There are even a few minty recipes you could try, for example:


Watermelon Yogurt Mint Smoothie
Irish Cream Mint Chocolate Drink
Mint Truffles

, Smooth sheets help you stay cool, so opting for silk or satin can make you more comfortable. Crisp cotton sheets are better than flannel, which should be stored during summer months. Silk, satin, and cotton will feel smoother and cooler as you sleep."

Focus on rooftops, gutters and downspouts.,
Check the roof for signs of weakness.,
Talk to a professional home improvement service, if relevant or possible.,
Do it yourself.,
Consider adding storm shutters to protect windows.,
Install a seamless gutter system.,
Make sure that the downspouts extend to the ground.,
Strengthen the garage door with horizontal bracing plates.",How to Storm Proof Your Home," The best way to prepare a home for a rainy season is to direct water away from it and make sure those runoff channels are solid. Check that the gutters are clear of debris and that the downspouts aren't clogged or loose. Consider pre-purchasing a gutter helmet to avoid having to clean out the gutters often. This will ensure that the spouts remain clear and unclogged all season.;
, Look for obvious areas of weakness, such as warped or missing shingles or popped roofing nail heads. If you have an attic, see if you can see any daylight where the walls meet the roof. These are all indications of problems that could result in serious damage in the face of high winds and heavy rain.

, If you've noticed some disconcerting signs in the attic or exterior of your home, it's time to make some changes. A professional home improvement company can check and find the extent of any roof damage. Before making any changes yourself, it's advisable to seek the recommendation of a professional.

, If you're in an emergency weather situation and you don't have time to get a contractor out to see your roof, there are solutions. For missing shingles or holes, purchase a piece of aluminum flashing and a tube of rubber cement. This temporary solution will keep water out of your attic space. This is not a permanent solution though, just a quick stopgap until you can get it properly repaired. If you've noticed rotting or weakened supports, try reinforcing your eaves with galvanized metal hurricane straps. These small fixes can make big differences when it comes to damage mitigation.

, Alternatively, upgrade the windows. If you live in an older home with single-pane, glass windows, consider installing exterior storm shutters. This seems obvious, but a lot of homes have merely decorative storm shutters or none at all. This leaves your windows vulnerable to high winds and flying debris. If your home was built before the 1930s, it probably has its original single-pane windows. Another option is to upgrade your windows to a stronger, more durable, modern design. Consider swapping your original windows for double-pane glass replacement windows.

, While you’re inspecting your gutters, take a few moments to check where they connect to your downspouts. If they are loose or detached, make sure to secure them. Loose downspouts can easily blow away in high winds and create as much damage as blocked gutters. A seamless gutter system should diminish your fear of leaks or erosion for years into the future.

, Extend your downspouts away from the house to keep water away and to prevent moisture from infiltrating your basement and foundation. Oversaturation of the ground surrounding your home can cause significant unseen problems that may not be caught until it is too late to do anything about them.

, High winds and rain can cave in an old garage door. If you have an older home, consider adding some braces to your garage door to keep it stable during storms. Replacing a garage door can be expensive. Take some preventative measures to make it last as long as possible.

Wait 10 minutes before restarting your dehumidifier.",How to Use a Dehumidifier," The best size of dehumidifier to buy depends on how big the room is that you want to dehumidify. Measure the square footage of the main room where you’ll use the dehumidifier. Match that to the size of dehumidifier., In addition to being categorized in terms of room size, dehumidifiers are categorized according to the level of moisture in a given room. This is measured in number of pints of water that will be extracted from the environment in a 24-hour period. The result will be a room with your ideal level of humidity.


For example, a 500 square foot room that smells musty and feels damp would require a 40-45 pint dehumidifier. Consult a buying guide to determine the proper size for your needs.Dehumidifiers can accommodate up to 44 pints (20.8197 liters) per 24 hours in a space as large as 2,500 square feet (232.257 square meters).

, Using a larger dehumidifier can potentially remove moisture from a room more quickly. Plus, you won’t need to empty the reservoir as often. However, larger machines do cost more to purchase and they use more electricity, adding to your overall costs., If you need a dehumidifier for a spa room, pool house, warehouse or other space, you should purchase a dehumidifier that is specially made for these spaces. Consult a home supply store to locate the correct type of dehumidifier for these locations.

, If you plan to move the dehumidifier from room to room frequently, consider buying a portable model. These often have wheels on the base or are light and easy to move. Having a portable dehumidifier will also enable you to move it around the room.


If you need dehumidifying in multiple rooms in your house, you might consider ducting a dehumidifier into your HVAC system instead of buying a single room unit.

, Modern dehumidifiers have multiple features and settings, and the more expensive the machine is, the more options it will have. Some of the potential features include:Adjustable Humidistat: This feature allows you to control the level of moisture in the room. Set the humidistat to your ideal relative humidity level. Once it reaches this level, the machine will automatically shut off.Built-in Hygrometer: This instrument reads the humidity level in the room, which helps you accurately set the dehumidifier to maximize water extraction.

Automatic Shut Off: Many dehumidifiers will automatically shut off when they reach the set humidity level, or when the water reservoir is full.

Automatic Defrost: If a dehumidifier is overly used, frost can easily build up on the machine’s coils. This can damage the components of the dehumidifier. An automatic defrost option will keep the machine’s fan running to melt the frost.

, Rooms that feel damp and smell musty have a relatively high humidity level. Using a dehumidifier can restore the room to an ideal relative humidity. If the walls feel damp to the touch or have moldy patches, a dehumidifier should be used frequently.


A dehumidifier is necessary if you have experienced flooding in your home. Use a dehumidifier constantly to help remove excess moisture from the air.

, People suffering from asthma, allergies or colds can benefit from a dehumidifier. A dehumidified room can enable some people to breathe more easily, clear up sinuses, and improve coughs or colds., Humid climates, especially in the summer, can produce uncomfortable conditions and damp-feeling rooms. Using a dehumidifier in the summer will help maintain a more ideal relative humidity level inside your home.


A dehumidifier works in tandem with air conditioning units, making your AC work more efficiently and keeping the room more comfortable and cool. This can also potentially result in reduced electricity costs.

, Many dehumidifiers, such as compressor dehumidifiers, are not very efficient when the air temperature is lower than about 65 degrees Fahrenheit. Cooler weather increases the possibility of frost build-up on the machine’s coils, interrupting its efficiency and potentially damaging its operation.Desiccant dehumidifiers are effective for cold spaces. If you do need to dehumidify a cold space, you can purchase a dehumidifier specially made for working at lower temperatures.

, Many dehumidifiers can be positioned against a wall if they have top-mounted air discharge. If your machine does not have this feature, you should make sure that you leave plenty of room around the machine. Do not place it against a wall or furniture. Better air circulation will allow your machine to work more efficiently.Aim for about 6-12 inches of airflow space around all sides of your dehumidifier., If you are using a hose to drain the water reservoir, place the hose so that it rests in a sink or tub and will not fall out of the sink. Periodically check to make sure that the hose hasn’t been moved and still drains properly into the sink. Use twine to secure the hose to the faucet if it doesn’t want to stay put.


Keep the hose away from electrical outlets and cords to prevent electric shock.
Use the shortest hose possible. Someone might trip over a long hose.

, Place the dehumidifier away from sources that create dirt and dust, such as woodworking equipment., The rooms that usually hold the most moisture are bathrooms, laundry rooms, and basements. These are the most typical places to install a dehumidifier.


Dehumidifiers can also be used on a boat while the boat is moored to a dock.

, The most efficient use of a dehumidifier is to use it in one room with the doors and windows closed. You can install it on a wall between two rooms, but this can detract from its efficiency, causing the machine to work harder.

, Many dehumidifiers are wall-mounted, but there are a number of models that are portable. If you can, place your dehumidifier close to the center of the room. This will help the machine work more efficiently., Some larger units, such as a Santa Fe Dehumidifier, are specially designed to hook into your HVAC system. These are installed with a duct kit and other installation accessories.


You may want to hire a professional to install a dehumidifier into your HVAC system.

, Read through the entire owner’s manual for your machine so you are familiar with specific operational instructions. Keep the manual in a location where you can reference it easily.

, A hygrometer is an instrument that measures the amount of humidity in the air.An ideal relative humidity (RH) level is approximately 45-50% RH. Going above this level may start mold growth, and below 30% RH can contribute to housing structural damage such as cracked ceilings, separated wood floors and other issues., Plug your machine into a three-pronged grounded and polarized outlet. Do not use an extension cord.If you don’t have the proper plug, hire an electrician to install a grounded outlet.


Always unplug the dehumidifier by pulling the cord at the plug. Never yank on the cord to pull it out.
Do not allow the cord to become bent or pinched.

, Depending on the model of dehumidifier, you may adjust the relative humidity (RH) level, measure hygrometer readings, and so on. Run the dehumidifier until you have reached your ideal RH level.

, The first time you use your dehumidifier will be the most productive. You will be removing the majority of the excess water in the air over the first few hours, days or sometimes even weeks. After the first round, though, you will be simply maintaining an appropriate level of humidity rather than trying to bring it down drastically.


You will be able to set the amount of humidity that you desire on your dehumidifier when you plug it in.

, The larger the space, the harder your dehumidifier will need to work. If you close off a room with the dehumidifier inside, it will only work to remove moisture from that room.


If you are dehumidifying the bathroom, consider where additional moisture can come from. Keep the toilet lid down so that your dehumidifier isn’t drawing water from the toilet.

, Dehumidifiers produce a lot of water, depending on the relative humidity of the room in which it is operating. If you are not using a hose to drain the water into a sink, you’ll need to empty the water reservoir tray regularly. The machine should turn off automatically when the tray is full in order to prevent overflow.


Unplug your machine before dumping out the water.
Monitor your reservoir tray every few hours if it is particularly humid.
Check your machine’s manufacturer instructions to determine the approximate frequency for dumping the tray.

, Read through the entire owner’s manual for your machine so you are familiar with specific care instructions. Keep the manual in a location where you can reference it easily.

, Before cleaning or maintaining your machine, turn it off and unplug it. This will prevent the possibility of receiving an electric shock.

, Remove the water drip reservoir. Wash it with warm water and a mild dishwashing liquid. Rinse it well and dry it thoroughly with a clean cloth.Clean this part of the dehumidifier on a regular basis, aiming for at least every 2 weeks.
Add an odor-eliminating tablet if there is a smell that remains in the reservoir. These tablets are available at home supply stores, and dissolve in water as the reservoir fills up.

, Dust in the coils can hamper the effectiveness of your dehumidifier, making it work harder and less efficiently. The dust can also potentially freeze in the dehumidifier, causing damage to the machine.Dust and clean the coils on the dehumidifier every few months to keep them free from dirt that can circulate through the machine. Use a cloth to wipe the dust away.
Check the coils for any ice build-up as well. If you find any ice, make sure your dehumidifier is not resting on the floor, as this is where the coolest room temperature will be. Rest it on a shelf or chair instead., Remove the air filter and inspect it for damage every six months. Check for holes, tears or other perforations that may decrease its effectiveness. Depending on the type of air filter you use, you might be able to clean it and reinstall it in the dehumidifier. Other types need to be replaced. Check your manufacturer’s instructions for specific details about your machine.The air filter is typically located in the grill area of your dehumidifier. Remove it by opening the front panel and taking out the filter.
Some dehumidifier manufacturers recommend much more frequent air filter checks, depending how frequently you use the machine. Check your manufacturer’s instructions for specifics regarding your machine., Avoid short cycling your machine and ensure the longevity of your machine’s operation by making sure the machine has been off for at least 10 minutes before restarting."

If you notice water droplets or any dampness on or around your windows, you may need a dehumidifier.

Condensation on windows will most likely appear in the winter time when the air is cold outside.
Pay special attention to the area around your windows, as moisture could accumulate there and lead to mold or mildew growth., If you live in a tropical or subtropical environment where the humidity is regularly higher than 50%, you should consider purchasing a dehumidifier as a preventative measure. By running a dehumidifier, you’ll make sure the humidity level in your home or work space stays low. In the end, you’ll help maintain air quality and prevent damage to property.Homes in the Southeastern United States are especially vulnerable to high humidity.

, Mold will typically grow on ceilings, walls, or in areas exposed to a lot of moisture. Pay special attention to the areas behind your sink, toilet, or next to your shower/tubs in bathrooms. In addition, keep an eye underneath your kitchen sink, as moisture there could lead to mold growth.

Mold will first appear as small black, green, or brown spots., Walk around your home and notice if you smell any musty or earthy scents. If you smell odors that you’d recognize in the forest or outside, it is likely that you have mold or mildew growth and need a dehumidifier to lower the humidity level.Pay specific attention to musty or mildew smells in garages, attics, or basements.

, If you sneeze, cough, wheeze, or have a runny nose or eyes, you may be experiencing mold or bacteria-related allergies. This could be the result of mold growth in your home due to a high humidity level. Ultimately, a dehumidifier will starve mold and mildew of moisture, and limit their growth., Purchase an air quality kit or hire an environmental testing service to do so. By testing your home’s air quality, you’ll be able to identify mold, mildew, or other contaminants that are in the air. If you find a high level of mold or mildew, you may need a dehumidifier in your home.

Air quality tests can also help you identify other air quality concerns, like asbestos or radon."

Clean your radiator before you use it.,
Place a high-speed fan behind the radiator.,
Attach a garden hose to a spigot on the exterior of your house.

,
Connect the vinyl tubing to the inlet tube on your radiator.,
Feed the tubing through a window and attach the tubing to the spout end of your garden hose with duct tape.,
Coil your garden hose up and wrap it in a towel for insulation.,
Attach another length of plastic tubing to the outlet tube of your radiator.,
Attach a small hand valve to the plastic inlet tubing that goes into the radiator.,
Open the hand valve completely.,
Plug in the fan and turn it on.",How to Build Your Own Air Conditioner2," You can soak it in water and mild soap and then let it air dry.

, You may have to place some objects under the radiator to line it up with the fan.

,, You may have to try a couple of sizes to find the right size of tubing that will fit over the copper tubing from your radiator. The tube length should be long enough to connect with the garden hose outside.

, You may need to cut a small hole in your window screen to make this work.

, Wrap pipe insulation around the exposed end to keep the water cold.

,


Thread the tubing upward through your window so that the water is expelled onto your roof or into your gutters.






If you expel water onto your roof, then you'll need to make sure that the overflow hitting the ground doesn't flood your basement. Try placing a large plastic garbage can beneath the stream to catch the water, and recycle the water in your garden.

,


Cut the plastic inlet tubing to leave a 6"" (15 cm) stub attached to the copper inlet tube of the radiator.






Attach the end that releases water to the stub of inlet tube.






Connect the side that pulls in water to the tube that's connected to your garden hose.

, On the outside of your house, open the garden hose spigot to find the right water flow volume.

, When you're ready to switch off your homemade air conditioner, close the hand valve and unplug your fan.

Close all doors and windows in the location where you run your dehumidifier.,
Place the dehumidifier in an area where air can circulate efficiently through the appliance.,
Run your dehumidifier only when humidity levels are higher than 50 percent.,
Replace the filter on your dehumidifier or clean it at least once per year.,
Clean the dehumidifier coils once per year.,
Check the dehumidifier coils for frost in cooler temperatures.,
Clean the water container of your dehumidifier as often as needed.,
Wait at least 10 minutes to turn your dehumidifier back on after it has been turned off.",How to Improve the Efficiency of a Dehumidifier," This will prevent your dehumidifier from running constantly throughout the day and night, which can potentially decrease the lifespan of your dehumidifier.;
, If you place the dehumidifier against a wall or large piece of furniture, the dehumidifier may have to work harder in order to function effectively.


Verify that your dehumidifier sits in an area with at least 12 inches (30.48 cm) of free space around each of its air vents to allow for proper air circulation.

, When you run your dehumidifier at any other time, your appliance will most likely run continuously and have very little impact on the overall air quality of your living space.


Monitor humidity levels by reviewing the humidistat built into your dehumidifier, or by purchasing a separate humidistat reader for your home or office.

, This can prevent any dust, mold, or mildew from collecting or growing on the filter, which can decrease the overall efficiency of the dehumidifier.


Consult the user manual or with the manufacturer of your dehumidifier to determine the exact steps for replacing the filter or performing filter maintenance.

, The air that passes through the coils will often contain dust and fungal spores that affect the performance of your dehumidifier.


Turn off your dehumidifier, then unplug it from the electrical outlet.
Use a vacuum attachment to remove dust from the coils, or mist the coils with water from a spray bottle, then wipe the coils down using a soft cloth.

, In temperatures below 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18.33 degrees Celsius), frost can sometimes build up on the coils. If frost is left undetected or remedied, the efficiency of your dehumidifier will significantly decrease.


Turn the dehumidifier completely off if frost exists on the coils, then wait for the ice to melt and for the room temperature to increase before using the dehumidifier again.

, The water collected from the air will often become moldy or stale, and can negatively affect the efficiency of your dehumidifier.

, This will allow the pressure in the appliance to equalize fully, which can result in the prolonged life of your dehumidifier.

Check the pilot light.,
Make sure there is no leaking gas.,
Check inside the door panel of your water heater for instructions.,
Set the temperature control setting to the lowest temperature.,
Locate the regulator valve.,
Turn the knob to the “Off” position.,
Determine what style of water heater you have.,
Collect any necessary lighting materials.,
Find the pilot.,
Turn the gas valve to the ""Pilot"" setting and push down on it.,
Light the pilot burner.,
Continue holding down the gas valve or control button for 1 minute after the pilot light has been lit.,
Release the valve knob/control button.,
Replace the access panels.,
Reignite the main burner.,
Set the thermostat to your desired temperature.",How to Light a Water Heater," You will probably need to remove a small panel, called an access panel, at the bottom of the tank in order to see whether the pilot light is actually out. If you do not see a small flame burning, then your pilot light has gone out.









If you have a newer water heater, it is possible that your panel is not removable and that you view your pilot light through glass. In this case, if you cannot see a flame burning through the glass, then your pilot light is out.;
, You should never try to reignite your pilot if there is gas leaking from your water heater, as this is extremely dangerous to both you and your home. Before attempting to relight the pilot, do a simple smell test to check for leakage.Stand next to your water heater and see if you detect any unusual smells. Then kneel down and sniff near any valves on the front and side of the tank. Natural gas is odorless by nature, but gas companies add a substance called mercaptan to it to make it detectable to humans. Leaking gas smells like sulfur or rotten eggs.If you smell gas in either of these places (even a faint smell), do not attempt to relight the pilot. Leave the area of the water heater and call your gas company immediately; they will tell you how to proceed.
Also listen for a hissing sound near the water heater, as this is a sign of a gas leak., Specific instruction of details for your individual model may be listed here, and they may help guide you in the process of relighting the pilot for your specific water heater.

, This is typically located on the front of a box found on the outside of the water heater.








, This valve is usually located on the same box as the temperature control, only it’s likely on top of the box; it regulates gas flow to the pilot burner beneath the hot water tank., After turning the knob off, wait 10 minutes before proceeding to allow any residual gas from the tank to clear from the air. Safety is key!







, There are two basic styles of gas hot water heaters, “new” and “old.” Old style heaters will require you to use your own flame to relight the pilot, while new style tanks come equipped with a pilot light igniter.








The exact look of the buttons on new style tanks may vary, but many have a red igniter button set a few inches away from the temperature and regulator valves.

, If you have an old style water heater, you will need to find a long reach “wand” lighter or fireplace matches to relight the pilot.









Do not attempt to relight a pilot with a regular matchstick or a small cigarette lighter, as this will require placing your fingers in a small, tight space too close to the open flame and put you in danger of getting burned.

, The pilot is located at the end of the small silver tube that comes out the control valve. You may need to use a flashlight to see this area clearly.








, Doing this starts the flow of gas into the tube that supplies the pilot light.









If your water heater’s gas valve does not push down, look for a red control button near the valve. Hold this button down.

, While holding down the pilot gas valve or the red button with one hand, you will use your other hand to quickly light the pilot.









If you have a new style water tank with a built-in ignition switch, press this button. You should hear a clicking noise until the pilot burner lights.If you have an old style heater, apply your wand lighter/match to the pilot burner.
Because you will be using one hand to depress the valve/red button and one hand to light the pilot, you may need someone to hold a flashlight for you if extra light is needed. Try to ask someone for help in advance so that you don’t get halfway through the process, then have to stop because you are unable to see what you’re doing.

, This will heat the thermocouple, which is a sensor that shuts the gas off when the pilot is out.







, After a minute, release the valve and control button to see whether the pilot light remains lit.








, If the pilot light has remained lit, put the access panel back into place (if you had to remove it initially) so that no flame can escape into your home.








, Turn the main gas valve back “On” and adjust the temperature control to your desired setting. The main burner under the tank should light and begin heating the water in the tank.







, Be sure not to make it too hot, as you could inadvertently scald your hands or body while washing or bathing. 49 C (120 F) is the temperature recommended by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

CAUTION: Tankless water heaters generally require larger diameter gas supply lines, higher voltage power supply (if contemplating electric on-demand), dedicated - special stainless steel flue (known as Category II, III or IV) or larger diameter exhaust system.,
It is highly recommended that you use special union connector sets for the water supply which employ bypass capability.,
Turn off main incoming water line to house.

,
Disconnect supply line from old water heater.,
Disconnect heat source from old water heater as follows: for gas, (propane) make sure the supply valve is closed (this is usually determined by the direction of the handle to the valve sitting either in the same direction as the line ""open"", opposite the direction of the line ""closed"").,
Once you have completely disconnected the old water heater you must remove it from it's current parking space and make sure to dispose of it according to the laws in the area you live in.

,
Remove your new tankless water heater from the carton and place all hardware and instructional material close at hand.

,
Determine the location best suited for this appliance and make sure you have allowed for the proper clearances around it to comply with all state and local building codes.

,
Mount tankless heater on wall according to manufacturers instructions, making sure that you have appropriately supported its weight.

,
Now you're ready to hook up all the connections.

,
If you have gas, install ventilation ducting.,
Begin with the supply line (water line).

,
Next should be the heat source.,
Following manufacturers directions, light the pilot on the gas water heater.

,
Now go to your favorite shower location and enjoy an endless stream of hot water.",How to Install a Tankless Hot Water Heater," Please take these things into consideration before you decide to DIY.;
, This will allow for simple, easy de-liming maintenance process in the future.

,, You will probably have some water left in the line even though your main has been shut off. Place a bucket underneath water bib to catch any spills.

, For and electric water heater, simply unplug the appliance from the wall outlet.

,,,,,, Typically tankless water heaters requires larger flue or special stainless steel flue.

,, If your water heater uses electricity, plug it in to the wall.* If your water heater is gas, you will need to hook up a gas supply line from the stub at the wall to the new water heater. Open the valve so that the handle is in the same direction as the line.

,, All that work was well worth it!

Gather up the tools necessary for winterizing your bike.,
Give your bike a thorough cleaning.,
Add a fuel stabilizer to the gas tank.,
If you have a carburetor, drain your float bowls.,
Once the engine is warm, you can change the oil and filter.,
Using an oil-squirting device, put oil over the stationary tubes on the front forks.,
Remove spark plug wires, and carefully with a spark plug wrench remove the plugs.,
You may want to remove the battery.,
If your bike has a liquid cooling system, check it’s level of anti-freeze with a hygrometer.,
Lube your cables.,
Clean and treat all leather with a high quality dressing.

,
If your storage location is bare concrete, we suggest using a piece of plywood, MDF, or old thick carpet.,
With a clean cloth, wipe good quality light machine oil over all the metal surfaces, except the disc brakes.,
Do not run the engine for short periods of time over the storage period, this can lead to condensation due to engine and combustion byproducts in the oil.

",How to Winterize Your Motorcycle," You will need, cleaning cloths, spark plug wrench, a trickle battery charger, four or five quarts of high quality oil, new oil filter, oil can or device to get oil in the cylinders, chain lube (if you have a chain drive), fuel stabilizer, spray can of WD40, a breathable motorcycle cover, kitchen plastic wrap, rubber bands, vinyl or plastic gloves, items to clean and wax your bike. Lastly a nice location for the bike to spend the winter, a heated secure garage would be ideal. Avoid wind, dripping water, vermin, mildew, and chemical fumes.;
, A gentle wash detergent and water will suffice. By removing road grime and insects you will protect the finish of the bike. Avoid spraying water directly into the opening of the muffler. If baffles get wet and are not dried prior storage, internal rust could result. Likewise avoid moisture in the air cleaner housing. If the housing becomes saturated, it could act as a choke, making cycle difficult to start. Dry completely with a good chamois. Clean and polish all aluminum and stainless surfaces with the appropriate metal polish. Finally finish up with a coat of good wax polish on all painted and chrome surfaces. Clean the chain (if you have one). Spray off all the built up residues with WD40. Lube the chain.

, Fill your tank with gas as full as it can go. This is very important. As fuel ages, more volatile components tend to change, leaving sludge and gummy substances that can affect the carburetor. Run the bike so the gas and fuel stabilizer get to the carburetor and fuel injectors.then turn off the fuel and run it dry

, Shut off the gas petcock and drain the gas from the carburetor bowls. Consult your manual for location of drain screws. Of course if you have a fuel-injected bike, there isn’t anything to drain.

, Oil chemistry changes over periods of extended storage. Old oil can develop acidic qualities, which can corrode engine parts.

, Get on the bike, hold the front brake and bounce the bike up and down to work the front suspension. This will keep the rubber seals from drying out and protect the exposed fork tubes.

, With your oil-squirting device, get some motor oil in the cylinders. Approximately one teaspoon of oil will work well. Tuck the plug wires away somewhere safe so they do not arc, then spin the motor with the starter for a few revolutions to get the oil spread around. Remember to keep your face away from the spark plug holes. Oil will squirt out! Clean and gap the plugs and put them back in. Replace plug wires.

, Some batteries may require charging every four weeks with a “Battery Tender” type of charger. Built up sulfates on the plates can ruin a battery during cold storage and inactivity. A thin coat of Vaseline to the terminals on the battery can prevent corrosion. This small step will mean an easier spring start up and no extra cost of battery replacement.

, Drain, flush and replace antifreeze if necessary. We suggest this replacement be done every two years. Do not leave the antifreeze level low or empty, this could lead to rust or corrosion of the cooling system. Check all other fluid levels at this time.

, Lube suspension and pivot points. Lube the drive shaft (if you have one). Check the air cleaner and the fuel filter. Look at brake pads. Give your bike a good once over.

,, This will insulate the bike from becoming damp. We also suggest storing your bike with all the weight removed from the wheels. A bike stand or some blocking works if you have a wheeled lift. A center stand and some blocking will work too. Do not store your bike near any ozone emitting devices, such as motors, freezers, furnaces or electric heaters. The gasses created by the above will deteriorate rubber parts.

, Spray a little WD40 in the tail pipe(s). Cover your tail pipe opening and the air intake with plastic wrap and a rubber band. You can also cover drain hoses as well. This will prevent any opportunistic pests from making a cozy winter home in your bike.

Start winterizing buildings in the summer.,
Consider installing double-paned windows in your home.,
Clean out your rain gutters in the fall after the leaves have fallen.,
Wrap pipes in unheated locations, such as crawl spaces beneath your house or in your garage, with foam insulation, pipe wrap or heat tape.,
Close outside vents to your house as soon as it starts to get cold.,
Install storm windows, if you have them.,
Reverse the direction of your ceiling fan, if you have one.,
Adjust your wardrobe.,
Eat right.,
Add another blanket to the bed.,
Disconnect, drain, and store any garden hoses.,
Shut off your sprinkler system, if you have one.,
Be sure that you lawn is properly graded away from your home.,
Use stakes to mark important locations in your yard, such as septic system keys, water meters, and in-ground electrical/irrigation boxes.

,
If you have a driveway plowing service, use stakes to mark the edges of your driveway.,
Prepare an “emergency” kit, keep it well-stocked and educate everyone in your household where it will be stored.",How to Winterize Your Home," The cost of heating your home can take a big bite out of your paycheck very quickly. (If you’ve moved from a very warm or hot region, you’re probably familiar with what air conditioning can do to a utility bill. This is the same; in reverse.)


Add more insulation to your attic, if you have one. Heat rises, and will escape through a poorly insulated attic. Fiberglass insulation comes in rolls with paper backing that you can roll and tack up to winterize your home.
Caulk cracks around windows and doors to eliminate drafts. Use water resistant caulk on the outside of buildings.
Add weather stripping to doors and windows when winterizing buildings.
Install outlet gaskets to electric outlets located on outer walls. The gaskets will eliminate drafts when you prepare your house for winter.
Clean your furnace, if you have one, and replace the air filter. Dirty air filters clog the flow of air and could start a fire.
Service your wood burning stove. Have a professional chimney sweep come out to clean and inspect your wood stove when preparing your house for winter.
Close off rooms that are not in use. Try to confine areas in your home that don’t require heating.;
, Have 1 window installed at a time if you can't afford to have them done all at once. Double-paned windows will help winterize your home.

, Leaves and other debris will clog your gutters, which could create an ice dam on your roof.

, When preparing your house for winter, you need to protect water pipes and prevent them from freezing and bursting.


Heating tape is an electrical wire that attaches to a thermostat to keep your exposed pipes heated to a specific temperature.
Read manufacturer's directions when installing insulation products to winterize your home, and remember, if you use heating tape, you will need to connect it to electricity.

, Closing the vents will help winterize your home. However, you should never block roof vents, chimneys, flues, dryer exhausts, or plumbing vent stacks.

, If you don't have storm or double paned windows, you may put plastic on the windows when winterizing buildings.


Obtain winter plastic wrap and weather tape if you don't have storm or double pane windows.
Cut the plastic wrap with a utility knife to fit your window frame.
Use weather tape to secure the plastic to the inside of your window frame. Apply heat with a hair dryer to shrink the plastic wrap when winterizing buildings.

, In the hot summer months, the fans are tilted to provide an air conditioning effect, and in the winter, you can turn the fan in the other direction to circulate the warm air.

, For sleeping attire; get out your “longies” and flannel pajamas. Keep a robe handy to your bed for use when you get up. Put your flip-flops in the closet and get out some slippers with a sole and a warm lining. Wear heavier socks. Winter months mean storing your T-shirts and shorts away and switching to sweats, lightweight but warm sweaters with long sleeves. (Keep a couple of those T-shirts on hand to wear as an undergarment.) Invest in thermal undergarments.

, A hot breakfast versus cereal with cold milk can make a big difference. Oatmeal, eggs and toast, pancakes or waffles or even a bowl of soup will take you farther. (Sprinkle some freshly made popcorn over a bowl of tomato soup for breakfast or lunch. It’s a treat that will help keep you warm.) Keep your carbs up. Hot pasta dishes, a stove-top stew of potatoes and chunky vegetables are great tummy warmers. (Afraid of added weight? Your body will burn those carb calories keeping you warm. Or get out there and move some snow; it’s great exercise.)

, Down-filled bedding is pricey, but well worth the investment. Consider flannel sheets and/or a quilt.

, This will prevent them from bursting or leaking during the winter.

, Use an air compressor to force water out of the pipes. This will prevent freezing.

, If it is not, water could enter your basement/crawlspace when the snow melts.

,, Doing so can help prevent lawn damage.

, Keep it within reach of anyone over three feet of height. Your kit should include:


Flashlights and batteries
Candles and a lighter or plenty of matches. (Wrap them in a plastic bag to help keep them dry) You might have a battery operated lamp or an oil lamp. (Do not store an oil lamp with oil in it. Keep this flammable liquid tightly sealed and separate until you need to use it.)
A battery operated radio
Foodstuffs – Keep foods on hand that can be eaten cold.
Canned fruit
Canned meats such as tuna or shredded beef
Cereals that can be eaten dry
Chocolate bars or a couple bags of chocolate chips
Plenty of water
A small, propane operated camping stove and at least two extra canisters of propane. Be sure to operate this according to the manufacturer's instructions.(Do not use a charcoal-type camping or cooking unit indoors!)

There are a few things that you should do to winterize your evaporative cooler, or swamp cooler as some call them.,
Cut off the power supply before working on the cooler.,
Turn off the valve supplying water to your swamp cooler.,
Drain the cooler.,
Change the cooler pads in the fall when winterizing the unit.,
Install a cooler cover.",How to Winterize Your Evaporative Cooler," Winterizing the Cooler can not only save you more maintenance during the next summer, but can actually help to make the unit last several years longer. Here are the few easy steps that you should do in the fall that will be well worth your time.;
, You do not need the power on to winterize the unit and it is always safe practice to disconnect the power source before working on any appliance.

, The water line must also be drained to prevent freezing during the winter. This can be done by disconnecting the water line at the supply valve and the Cooler. If the water line does not slope all one way the water will not drain by itself. If that is the case, go to the highest end and blow through the line to force the water out of the line.

, The pan should be drained every fall and the drain left open to allow any rainwater to escape throughout the winter. Even after draining you will find dirt and mineral sediment in the bottom of the pan. This should always be cleaned out. In your Cooler the water has been evaporating all summer while the minerals continue to build up in the Cooler pan. I like to use my shop vacuum to remove all of the dirt and minerals. Then with the drain remaining open, I hose out the pan with fresh water to make sure the minerals are completely out of the pan. This will help to prevent rusting of the metal pan through the winter.

, Most people think of doing this in the spring when starting the cooler up. Keep in mind, the old pads have had minerals building up in them all through the summer. The way the louver panels are originally built, they cause any rainwater to flow into the Cooler and run down the pads. The pads are pressed against the metal louvers and can speed up the rusting all throughout the winter. With fresh new pads installed in the fall, you will keep the louvers from rusting all throughout the winter.

, It stops the outside air from entering the home or building being supplied by the evaporative cooler. Most home Coolers have a damper that can be closed that will prevent most of the air from entering the ducts and getting into the building. A cover is especially needed if you do not have this damper or if the damper is not tight enough to stop any air from seeping in.

Get an appropriate size.,
Pick from either cool mist or warm humidifiers.,
Get a humidifier that has a minimum of one-year guarantee from its manufacturer.,
Is noise a big situation for you?,
Examine the receptacle size.,
Some humidifiers may perhaps will need replacement wicks or filters.",How to Choose a Dehumidifier for Your Home," Humidifier size is an enormous consideration when getting a unit. Exactly where will you put the unit? On a tiny bedroom? The spacious living place? Choose a humidifier that can manage the area of the area that you simply might be installing it in. A narrow-range humidifier in a big space won’t be efficient and would just be a waste of funds. Tiny rooms also are bad areas for wide-range humidifiers mainly because it is going to create condensed normal water in the window panes. This is also another result in for bacterial development.;
, Some people pick the warm type because they're a bit quieter compared to cool mist types and they are also effortless to breathe. The drawback though is that they require a lot more constant cleaning. In the event you forget to often clean a heat humidifier, the unit can turn into a breeding ground for germs.

, You by no means know once you may have to replace some random areas.

, Can you tolerate a whole lot of noises? Humidifiers differ in the level of sound they generate. Test before getting.

, Unique humidifiers mean diverse h2o receptacles sizes. Get a big one particular if you don’t have time to refill the bucket just about every couple of hours or so.

, How often these sections need to be replaced and understanding the value of these parts will assist you to ascertain the 'true' value of your humidifier.

Estimate your average hot water consumption.,
Decide between a centralized or point-of-use installation.,
Plan for the ventilation of the exhaust gas.",How to Buy a Tankless Gas Water Heater," Sizing and positioning your tankless water heater begins with knowing how much hot water you will need. Water consumption can be measured in gallons per minute (gpm) or liters per minute (l/m).

Begin by estimating the water usage of each fixture in your home. Reasonable guidelines for water consumption are: 2.5 gpm (9.5 l/m) for a shower, 2.5 gpm (9.5 l/m) for a washing machine, and 1.0 gpm (3.8 l/m) for a sink.



 


Next, determine how likely you are to use these fixtures at the same time. For example, if your maximum water consumption at any given time means running 1 shower and 1 sink, then your total hot water need is (2.5 gpm + 1.0 gpm) or 3.5 gpm (13.3 l/m).





;
, Because tankless water heaters can only handle a limited flow, it may be necessary to use more than one. Centralized installation works well for small apartments and condos, while a multiple-unit setup may be better suited to a large home.

Centralized installation is usually the simplest and least expensive. In this setup, a single water heater is installed that services the whole home. Because tankless heaters can rarely handle more than 5 gpm (19 l/m) of hot water, this type of installation won't be able to meet large water needs.






Point-of-use heaters are installed in close proximity to a hot water source. For example, you might install a separate water heater in each bathroom of your home. This setup is more labor-intensive and expensive, but it ensures that each tap will receive adequate heating and eliminates long pipe runs that cause a significant delay when waiting for hot water to flow.






Your current utility setup will influence which type of installation is easiest. Installing new gas lines to service multiple point-of-use heaters will significantly increase the amount of work and money needed. In this situation, you could consider installing a large, centralized gas heater and supplementing it with several electric point-of-use heaters.







, Gas water heaters, unlike their electric counterparts, produce exhaust gas that must be vented to the outdoors. This is accomplished using stainless steel venting lines and running them through a wall or through the roof.

If you are replacing an existing gas water heater (tankless or not) with a new one, you will likely be able to use your existing exhaust setup. Consult the installation guide included with your new heater to ensure that your current exhaust lines are adequate.






If you are installing a new gas water heater, you can usually purchase a venting kit from the same manufacturer. This will ensure compatibility with your heater, but you should consult with a contractor to ensure that the kit works with your installation location.

If water has remained cool, continue troubleshooting steps below.
, Most water heaters are supplied by voltages that can cause shock, burns and even death should an energized conductor come in contact with the body. Shut off power in the electrical panel by removing fuses or by moving the handle of a switch or circuit breaker dedicated to the water heater to the Off position. Completely remove and ""pocket"" the fuses or otherwise secure or lock the panel and place a note on the cover to alert everyone that work is being performed on the water heater circuit. This will prevent the accidental energizing of the circuit while you are working on it., The metal covers are usually held in place with screws. Remove the screws and save for reinstallation when done. Use a voltmeter or test light to check between wiring terminals and the grounded metal case of the tank to be sure that the power is off. If power is still on, do not proceed until you locate the fuse or circuit breaker supplying power. Lock off or secure the circuit breaker or remove fuses to prevent someone from turning the circuit on while you are working on the water heater., Once the thermal insulation has been removed, plastic shock protectors are visible. Carefully fold any wires away from the protective cover. Lift the tab at the top away from the clip and remove to access terminals.

View with plastic shock protector removed:







, Water heaters can leak as a result of a failing tank - but also due to poorly fitted or soldered cold water supply pipe / hot water output pipe or a poor seal between tank opening and heating element. If allowed to continue to leak, it will cause internal damage to the controls should water enter them.

Rust coats wires and controls - both outside and inside






Rust is conductive - even when on the wire insulation. This can lead to potentially deadly shocks, heating and melting insulation and even burns. Sooty, black carbon deposits on surfaces indicate a short circuit. Chances are there is an exposed copper wire that may be difficult to see due to the carbon deposits that resulted from the short circuit.
Wires may have been damaged and now suffer with a reduced circumference that is needed to safely carry the heating element electrical load. This point of damage also becomes a source of heat. It is very important to repair or replace all parts that have visible forms of water and short circuit damage. This includes wires, wire insulation, jumpers and the controls themselves. As mentioned above, rust is a conductor and provides unintended and unexpected paths for electricity. These unintended paths can be dangerous and make troubleshooting very difficult to perform.
Here, the yellow wire between the control and element appears to have shorted to the tank (or other metal) leaving a sooty black deposit on the wire and above. Notice the lower left terminal of the thermostat. Excessive heat has caused the plastic around the terminal to begin to melt.







, Usually, the top two terminals have wires that go up to the field wiring compartment that bring the power to the rest of the water heater's controls and heating elements. The ""upper controls"" consist of the High-Temperature Limit Switch and Upper Thermostat. The ""lower controls"" refers to the Lower Thermostat (there is no High-Temperature Limit Switch for the lower section of most electric water heaters). Three of the four terminals are numbered and visible in the picture (#1, #3, & #4; the #2 terminal is not identified as it is connected directly to the thermostat below via factory installed jumper).







Thermostat: Has a graduated, adjustable dial. The dial may indicate letters ""A"" ""B"" ""C"" etc., ""warm, hot and hotter"" or as in the case of the one pictured, the actual temperature in degrees. The thermostat is located just below the High Temp Limit Switch.







Heating Element: Has two terminals with a wire connected to each. One of these wires is usually connected to the thermostat associated it (in these photos the thermostat is directly above it). It is usually located below the controls and supports the controls with a clip of some type (in this photo, it has two terminals and a gray metal clip attached to support the controls above).







, Set the meter for AC Volts and insert the black probe into the black or common jack, and the red probe into the red or Volts jack., Set the AC voltage range to the highest available. Touch the probes to the top terminals of the high temperature limit switch as shown in the image to the right. If desired, the range may be lowered to any desired - provided the range is greater than the voltage displayed at the highest range. If unable to prove power off, double check circuit panel. Do not proceed unless power is proved off; otherwise damage to meter is likely and shock or burns is possible in the steps that follow.

In the provided picture, the meter indicates 0.078 volts present. This is less than 1/10 of a volt, and is considered ""off"".

, Observe the meter indication. If an analog type, the needle or pointer will be resting at over the higher resistance values (left-most position) this is an ""open circuit"" indication. If digital meter is used, it may display ""OL"" or ""1"" (""1"" without trailing or leading zeros). This OL or 1 indication represents a value greater than the meter is capable of displaying (similar to the way a calculator does) for ""overload"" or ""infinity"". Infinity in high resistance range is also called an ""open circuit"" or ""Open Loop"" (OL). Take note of this open circuit indication for this meter (when in a voltage or current range is selected and the meter displays OL or 1, the measurement should be taken again after adjusting the range upward). If you are unsure what your meter should read in an ""OL situation"", just leave the terminals unconnected to anything and not touching each other and switch the meter on, it should then indicate the resistance of the air between the terminals which should be infinity in normal conditions.,,,, If the meter being used does not provide for range selection, it is likely an ""autoranging"" type. This simply means that the meter will automatically adjust the range up or down as needed without any intervention by the user. This feature is far more common on digital meters than analog types. Most analog meters that do not provide manual range selection likely support only a single range. These meters are much more accurate indicating low values (such as 0 through 500k or 1M ohms) than higher values (such as those above 1M), but will work well for this procedure. Pay close attention to the display of an auto-ranging digital meter when reading - there is a huge difference between 20, 20K and 20M ohms. A ""K"" indicates thousands, and an ""M"" indicates millions. The examples above would correctly be read as 20 ohms, 20,000 ohms (20K ohms or 20 kilo ohms) and 20,000,000 ohms (20 meg ohms or 20 million ohms). Each is 1000 times larger than the previous., The analog meter pointer should move to lowest values of the resistance scale (or fully to the right). The digital meter should indicate 0 or a ""very low"" value approaching zero. Locate the ""Zero Adjust"" knob and turn so that the the meter indicates ""0"" (or as close to ""0"" as possible). Most digital meters do not have this Zero Adjust feature. Once ""zeroed"", this needle position on the dial is the ""short circuit"" or ""zero ohms"" indication for this range of this meter. The meter must be zeroed if the resistance range is changed. Measured resistance values will be inaccurate if unable to properly zero the meter.

In the example picture, the meter indicates 0.2 ohms resistance - or zero. The meter can not display a value lower than this value, since there is no zero adjust feature it is considered 0.

, If unable to obtain a zero ohm indication on an analog meter, this may mean the batteries are weak and should be replaced. Retry the zeroing step above again with fresh batteries. Digital meters often graphically display the battery's level of discharge or simply an indication to replace the battery. Check the meter manual for help determining the battery charge state., Read the meter display. Look for a range multiplier (a ""K"" or ""M"" in the display) to be sure the value displayed is really ohms, not kilo ohms (K) or meg ohms (M).

In the provided picture, the meter indicates 12.5 ohms resistance, and since is within acceptable limits of the calculated 12.2 ohms value, it is considered ""good"".

, To determine the resistance value for a good element, use this online calculator. Provide the voltage (likely 240)and wattage (likely in the range of 1000 to 5000) ratings from the nameplate and click on the ""calculate button"".

The picture displays the ""nameplate"" information of the water heater. Two different wattage ratings are provided (4500 / 4500 and 3500 / 3500). The ""4500 / 4500"" rating is the wattage rating for the upper and and lower element respectively, when connected to a 240 volt supply. Alternatively, the ""3500 / 3500"" rating is the wattage of the upper and lower element respectively, when connected to a 208 volt supply. Most residential applications are 240 volts, but 208 volt and 120 volt types are also found.

, Prepare the meter by setting the meter to highest resistance scale., The analog meter pointer should move fully to the lowest values of the resistance scale (to the right). The digital meter should indicate a ""low"" value very close to zero. Locate the ""Zero Adjust"" knob and turn so that the the meter indicates ""0"" (or as close to ""0"" as possible). The digital meter may not have this Zero Adjust feature. Note that this position is the ""short circuit"" or ""zero ohms"" indication for this particular resistance range of this meter. Always ""zero"" the meter when changing resistance ranges., Press the black probe firmly against the metal tank or the heating element mounting nuts or screws (not the other terminal screw). Scrape the metal to ensure a good contact. The meter should display the ""infinity"" indication as described above in the meter setup. If the meter displays a value other than a very high value (millions of ohms), preferably infinity, the element should be replaced, described later.,,

Lower access panels removed, exposing the plastic shock protector:






#* Remove protector as done for upper access point above to expose the terminals. Notice that there is no reset button (high limit) on the like the top:






,,, If the tank is cold or very hot, it may be difficult to get the expected changes when dialing in different temperatures on the thermostat., The rest of the steps have power on for continued testing. Use extreme caution as the risk of shock injury is greatly increased if not fully paying attention. Ensure all wires are reconnected to respective terminals and there are no ""accidental conductors"" anywhere that could cause a shock or short circuit.
,, As mentioned earlier, common voltages for residential (and mobile home / RV) type water heaters are: 120, 208 & 240, with the most common being the 240 volt variety. When steps below discuss measuring ""line voltage"", substitute the voltage for your particular water heater instead., Line voltage is likely 120, 208 or 240 in the U.S.

The line voltage in the system under test is 208 volts. Since 203 is within a few percent of 208, this example indicates full power available to the element and if it passed the resistance or ohms test above - is heating the water in the tank.

, It is a button either red or black, located directly above the thermostat. It most likely has ""RESET"" printed on it. With a screwdriver or pencil, GENTLY but firmly press in. If it is tripped, a mechanical ""click"" should be felt or heard. A tripped high temp switch is indicative of a thermostat that will not open. More on this, later.,,, Check the heater's ""field wiring compartment"" (usually located on the top of the heater), along the length of the cable that feeds the heater, and lastly inside the electrical panel. Remember, unless power is shut off at panel, this circuit is live at some point between the fuse or circuit breaker and the water heater. Tighten any and all wirenuts and connections in the wiring compartment and inside any junction boxes between here and all the way back to the terminals of the circuit breaker or fuses in the electrical panel. Replace open fuses or reset any tripped circuit breaker if off. Check for power at fuse or circuit breaker. A circuit breaker that immediately trips after resetting indicates a short circuit or less likely, defective circuit breaker., Read the rest of this step slowly and carefully (and repeatedly if needed) until it makes sense as it is the ""why and how"" the thermostats work together. The key is to understand how the two thermostats interact and function differently. The top thermostat has 2 positions - it can switch voltage to ""one position or the other"": (position 1) to the top element or (position 2) to the lower thermostat. The lower thermostat also has 2 positions but it is ""on and off"", not one or the other like the top thermostat: (position 1) to the lower element or (position 2) prevent voltage from reaching the lower element or anywhere else for that matter. In order for the top element to have voltage and heat the water, the temperature of the water in the top of the tank must be lower than the temperature setting of the top thermostat. Once the water in the top part of the tank has reached the temperature value determined by the top thermostat setting, the top thermostat (is considered ""satisfied"") switches power from the top element to the lower thermostat. If the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat's setting, the lower thermostat remains ""off"" and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element. If however, the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is lower than the setting of the lower thermostat, the lower thermostat switches ""on"" and sends voltage to the lower heating element (a thermostat that has switched power to a heating element or cooling compressor is said to be ""calling"") and heats the water. The voltage will remain on the lower element until either (a) the bottom thermostat is satisfied or (b), the top thermostat detects that the temperature of the water in the top of the tank has fallen below the temperature setting of the top thermostat. When this occurs, the top thermostat switches the power from the lower thermostat back to the top heating element. This operation continues until the water in both halves of the tank is equal to the settings of their respective thermostats. Setting the top thermostat higher will not cause the top element to turn on if the water temperature in the top of the tank is already higher than the highest setting of the thermostat. If this conditions exists, no click will be detected when turning the temperature setting up and down. It will be necessary to lower the temperature of the water in the tank. The easiest and quickest way to do this is to allow hot water out of the tank by simply opening a hot water faucet. Cold water will enter the bottom of the tank and mix with the existing hot water in the tank, lowering the overall temperature.,,,,, These will be the common screw terminals. The other screw on the thermostat and heating element will be the power screw terminals. Touch red probe to the power screw terminal of heating element and black probe to the power screw terminal of thermostat. Expect line voltage.,,,, If line voltage is present on a heating element, it must heat the water unless the element has failed., While water boils at 212 degrees, a water temperature of only 150 degrees takes just two seconds to cause a burn. When the water is 120 degrees, just 30 degrees cooler; it takes 10 minutes. The skin of children and infants is more sensitive than that of an adult, and will burn more easily. Because of this, selecting a temperature closer to 120 degrees may be a better choice. Lower temperature settings translate to reduced energy costs, too.,,, For this reason, the water level in the tank must be lowered to a point below the level of the element to be removed (otherwise water will leak out as the element is removed). If removing the lower element or unsure how much to drain, emptying the tank's entire contents will prevent unexpected spilling of water., Open the nearest hot water faucet to relieve vacuum pressure and allow air into the tank as it drains. Connect a garden hose to the drain valve at bottom of the tank and extend the hose to a floor drain or some other point that is lower than the drain valve as the tank will only drain down to the highest point of the hose. Open drain valve at the bottom of the water heater and drain the tank.,,, The first method is by bolts that are installed through holes in a flange around the element. Simply use a socket and ratchet or other suitable wrench to remove the 4 bolts and remove the element. The second method is by a threaded portion of the element body that is found under a hex shaped flange of the element. Usually, a 1-1/2"" socket will fit perfectly. If a socket of that size is not available, use of a water heater element wrench, channel-lock style pliers or adjustable wrench will get the job done quickly. Twist the element counter-clockwise until it is loosened enough to spin out completely by hand., It is important that all gasket material, filings, rust etc., be completely removed to reveal as smooth a surface as possible. A wire brush and / or sandpaper rubbed over the opening should make easy work of the job., It would be best to bring along the old element for comparison to the new element. Both the upper and lower elements are the same.,,, Make sure the element is snugged tightly against the tank opening, otherwise water will leak out when the tank is filled and under pressure. it will be best to tighten these bolts the way lug nuts on a tire are tightened - one nut, then the opposite nut, repeat as needed. Do not over tighten., At first, only air will be heard escaping out of the hot water faucet. As the tank continues to fill, the hot water faucet will sputter air and be followed by dirty water. Continue fill the tank until the discharge water from the hot water faucet runs clear and without sputtering (steady stream of water) .,, Tighten as needed to stop the leak and wipe dry. Repeat as necessary. Any leak that can not be stopped will require disassembling and cleaning the tank opening and element to ensure a 100% seal when reinstalled., The heating elements must be completely submerged in water before applying power. Failure to completely fill the tank prior applying power will result in instant heating element burnout and will require replacement - again.,, Start with the lowest level faucets and work up to the highest level faucets. Optionally remove shower head(s) and aerators from sink faucets and spray heads to prevent sediment from clogging them.,,, Label the terminals and the wires by either 1) writing numbers on masking tape and apply to the wires and terminals, or 2) apply color coded tape to wires and terminals, or 3) other identifying means, before disconnecting., No screws are used. To remove the controls after removing wires, lift the steel retaining ""fingers"" on both sides of the control away from the tank slightly and slip the controls out. Excessive force on the fingers may damage them and prevent the controls from seating properly. A poorly seated control prevents it from properly detecting tank temperature, as it relies on firm physical contact with the tank for heat transfer. Removing the controls from a hot tank and retesting will insure tank temperatures were not causing a normal cutout., It may help to bring along the old controls for comparison to the new controls., Remove any rust, debris and dirt.,,"

Replace your windshield wipers and wiper fluid.,
Check the tire pressure on all of your tires.,
Give your car a good coat of wax before winter weather arrives.,
Make sure your lights are working.",How to Winterize Your Car1," Poor visibility is extremely dangerous while driving, especially in winter, so it's important to ensure that your windshield wipers are in good working condition.


Old blades are prone to cracking, tearing or simply not working when faced with the icy precipitation that's beating against your windshield. Examine yours to see whether the rubber is cracked or frayed, and keep in mind that wiper blades are supposed to be replaced every 6 to 12 months. You could also consider buying wiper blades specifically designed for winter weather.Fill the windshield washer reservoir with fresh washer fluid. Some washer fluids have a defroster additive and a lower freezing temperature, making them a good choice for the cold winter months.;
, Maintaining the correct tire pressure for your vehicle is very important during the winter months. Deflated tires have decreased traction, making them more prone to slipping on icy surfaces.


Keep in mind that your tire pressure will be affected by the decrease in temperature — in fact, for every 10 degree F drop in temperature, the air pressure in your tires will be reduced by about 1 PSI. Therefore, it's important to keep an eye on your tires throughout the winter months.
Use a tire gauge to see if your tires meet the standards set for your vehicle. If you're not familiar with the proper level for your vehicle, check the inside edge of your driver's side door frame. There should be a sticker there that indicates several things, including suggested tire pressure.
If you do not have a tire gauge, you can usually find one at your local gas station, where you can also fill your tires with air. This is usually free or costs very little.
While checking the air pressure, it's also important to check how your tires are wearing. If they need replacing or rotating, do this before winter weather hits.

, A waxed surface repels snow, dirt and salt better than a non-waxed one. It will help your car look better and protect the paint.


Before you apply the wax, make sure to give the car a thorough wash. Don't forget to rinse the underside of the car to remove any sand or salt residue.
Try to wax the car before the first snowfall hits, or before the temperature drops below 55 °F (13 °C). This will protect the paint, while also making any snow or ice easier to brush off.
While you're at it, now is a good time to clean the inside of your car. Remove any clutter, vacuum the floor and seats and use an upholstery cleaner if necessary. You may also want to replace the carpeted floor mats with some water-resistant ones, to protect your floors from melted ice and snow., As mentioned above, having good visibility is very important, especially on the dark winter evening.


However, it's not only important that you can see, it's also imperative that you can be seen. This is why ensuring that your lights are in proper working order is essential.
Get somebody to help you do a visual check on all of the exterior lights on your car — including your headlights, taillights, backup lights and signal lights (including hazards and brake lights).
You should also be aware that the lights will be greater burden on your vehicle's electrical system in the winter, due to shorter and darker days. You'll need to take this into consideration when testing your battery.

Change your engine oil.,
Check your belts and hoses.,
Replace old coolant with antifreeze.,
Make sure your 4-wheel drive is working.,
Check your battery.,
Check your defrosting and heating units.",How to Winterize Your Car2," As the cold winter months approach, it's a good idea to check your engine oil and decide whether it needs to be changed.


Dropping temperatures cause the oil in your engine to become more viscous (thicker). When this happens, the oil flows too slowly from one part of the engine to another — this prevents the engine from being properly lubricated, leading to overheating and an engine that won't start.
Therefore, it is often advisable to switch to a thinner oil during the cold winter months, in order to keep your engine sufficiently lubricated. If you're unsure about what type of oil to use, check the owner's manual for more specific instructions on what type of oil is best for your specific car, under certain temperatures and weather conditions.It's also important to remember that, as a general rule, the oil in your car should be changed every 3,000 miles (4,800 km), or once every three months.

, Your car's belts and hoses are susceptible to general wear and tear and are particularly affected by the cold weather.


If your car isn't due for its 30,000-mile full-service tune-up this winter (where the belts and hoses are often replaced) then it's a good idea to check them yourself for any signs of damage and get them replaced if necessary.
This step should not be neglected, because if something snaps while driving, you'll have no choice but to call a tow truck — which is far from ideal in the middle of winter., It's highly important that your engine contains the correct ratio of anti-freeze to water before the cold winter months set in, otherwise the coolant could freeze, causing the engine to overheat and potentially blow a gasket.


A ratio of 50% anti-freeze to 50% water is recommended for most cars, though in some circumstances this is increased to 60% anti-freeze, 40% water. Luckily, you can buy pre-mixed bottles of anti-freeze and water at the gas station.If you're not sure about the current ratio of antifreeze to water in your car's radiator fluid, you can pick up an anti-freeze tester at your local auto parts store for relatively cheap.
If the ratio is incorrect, you will need to flush your coolant system before you can refill it with the correct ratio. If this is not something you know how to do, take your car to a mechanic or oil change location. There is, however, no need to flush your system if you drain and refill on scheduled maintenance.

, If your car has a 4-wheel drive function, it's important to get it checked out to ensure that it's working properly, especially if you haven't used it since the previous winter.


Have a mechanic check the 4-wheel drive to ensure that the system engages and disengages smoothly, and that the transmission and gear fluids are at the correct level.
At this time, you (and any members of your household) should also review how the system works and understand the conditions under which it should be used. 4-wheel drive can improve your tires' traction on snowy or icy roads, thus decreasing your chances of getting stuck.
However, this doesn't mean that you should drive any faster or less safely than you normally would in unfavorable conditions.

, It's essential that your battery is in good working condition before the winter months — in cold weather, your battery takes more time to generate power, while the engine requires more current from the battery in order to start. If your battery is in poor condition, it won't be able to handle these requirements and your car will fail to start.


Keep track of how old your car battery is — they usually last between 3 to 5 years, so if yours is somewhere in that range it may be time to get a new one. You can also ask your mechanic to perform a battery load test to determine whether your battery needs to be placed.
Even if it doesn't need to be replaced, you should give your car battery a once over to check for any corrosion on the battery's posts and connections and for any fraying on the cables.
You also need to check the fluid level if your car is relatively old — you can do this by unscrewing the caps on top of the battery. If the fluid level is low, you can fill it with distilled water. Just be careful not to overfill it. However, most (if not all) new batteries are maintenance-free and do not require distilled water to be added. In fact, there are no caps to take off.

, The defrosting and heating units on your car are essential for your visibility and comfort while driving, so it's important to ensure that they are functioning normally.


The defroster helps to clear condensation from the inside of the windshield by blowing warm, dry air onto the glass. If it's not working properly, the windows can fog up and obstruct your view of the road. Have a mechanic check the defroster to ensure that it's working properly. If you find the window is still fogging up, you'll need to check your doors and windows for air leaks that could be letting in moisture.
It will become pretty obvious if your heater isn't working once the cold winter weather hits, but it's important to get this fixed as soon as possible. It may be necessary to replace the heater coil — this can be expensive, but it will be worth every cent on those cold winter mornings.
It's not just your comfort that's at stake, it's also your safety. If you're too cold while driving, this may affect your steering ability and attention to the road. Having a functional heating system could also save your life if you get stranded somewhere in your car.

Make sure your spare tire is ready to use.,
Keep your tank at least half-full at all times.,
Put together an emergency kit and keep it in your trunk.,
Consider getting snow tires.,
Know what to do if you get stranded.",How to Winterize Your Car3," During adverse weather conditions, it's essential to have a spare tire in the car at all times.


You should inspect your spare tire periodically to ensure that it's in good working condition — you don't want to blow a tire only to find that the spare isn't working!
You should also ensure that your jack, wrench and wheel lock tool are all in a safe, secure position inside the car and that everyone in your household knows where this is.

, When your gas tank is at least half full, there is less of a chance that your fuel lines will freeze up in cold weather.


This happens when condensation forms on the sides of a near-empty fuel tank, drips down into the water, sinks to the bottom and freezes due to icy conditions.
Keeping your gas tank at least half full at all times reduces the chances of this happening and also limits the possibility of getting stranded somewhere when you run out of fuel.

, It's a very good idea to keep an emergency kit in your car in case it breaks down and you get stranded in bad weather conditions.


The kit should include: boots, gloves, hats, some wool blankets, ice scrapers, defroster, a flashlight, salt or cat litter, jumper cables, a first-aid kit, some flares, bottles of coolant and washer fluid, and a radio.
You should also include some non-perishable snacks (like unsalted canned nuts and dried fruit) and a bottle of water. Even if the water freezes, you can thaw it out or eat the ice in order to stay hydrated.
You should also keep a phone charger in the car for your cell phone.

, If you live in an area that's covered in snow and ice all winter long, you should consider replacing your regular tires with snow tires during the colder months.


Snow tires are softer and more flexible that regular tires and also have a different tread shape, which gives them greater traction on snowy and icy surfaces.
Alternatively, you could keep a set of tire chains in your trunk for driving in snowy, icy conditions. These are particularly necessary in mountainous regions.
You could also consider carrying a traction pad or scrap piece of carpet with you — this can help you to free your wheels if your car gets stuck in deep snow.

, Despite your best efforts to winterize your car, sometimes things will still go wrong and you may end up stranded. It's important that you know exactly what to do in order to stay safe and warm if this situation should ever arise.


Firstly, you should never leave your car unless you know exactly where you are and how far you will need to walk in order to find help. If you don't know where you are, light a flare on either side of your car to draw attention to your location.
Try to keep yourself as warm as possible by putting on any extra clothes and using any available blankets (wool is best for heat). If you still have gas, run the heater for ten minutes every hour to raise the temperature in the car (as long as you are certain that the gas pipe is not blocked).
Despite the cold, you should keep one window at least partly open at all times to prevent heavy snow or ice from sealing the car shut.
Keep yourself hydrated by drinking water or eating ice, and suck on a hard candy to prevent your mouth drying out.

Pour about 3 cups (.72 liters) of antifreeze into the toilet and in each drain.,
Take the water line out of the antifreeze jug, and reconnect it to the fresh water tank.








,
Locate the water heater, remove the plug and drain it.,
Remove all food, laundry, and valuable items.,
Fix anything that's broken.,
Cover all vents and holes.,
Take the weight off the tires.,
Cover it with a breathable material.",How to Winterize an RV," To drain the water from your RV, you'll need to open what's called the ""petcock."" Do not be tempted to drain the water heater yet -- that has to be done after you add antifreeze.






;
, You should also flush both tanks at this time.









If your RV does not come equipped with a built-in system, you should clean the tanks out with a wand or a product designed to clean both of the tanks.
Take all the tanks' contents to your local dump station.

, That includes those for the sinks, toilet and shower. If you don't, air can't come out the other end!









Flush your toilets a few times to make sure all the water's gone!

, This is commonly known as a ""blowout plug."" It can be purchased at all hardware stores and probably even your local Walmart.









Technically, it's attached to the ""Water Intake Fitting.""

, The air from the compressor will force any remaining water out of the lines. This isn't 100% necessary, but it helps to keep your antifreeze from becoming diluted.









Pressure should be 30 pounds per square inch (maximum of 50 psi)., Reclose your petcock, too.








, And the compressor along with it!








, There are three ways to do this:









From the inside using a water pump conversion kit
From the outside with a hand pump
With or without a bypass

We'll be addressing the water pump with a bypass method. The science behind the pumps is the same. However, without a bypass, you just have to add much, much more antifreeze. Regardless of whether or not you have a bypass, do not drain your water heater before adding the antifreeze.



, Attach the pump upstream of the water tank. That is, the antifreeze will go in before the tank.








, This will save you gallons and gallons of antifreeze. You don't have to do it, but it makes everything much simpler. A few RVs have them built in, but most do not. To bypass your water heater:









Turn off the water heater
Disconnect the water supply (the above step)
If installing for the first time, disconnect the hot and cold lines going in and out of the water heater
Connect the bypass, following the instructions on the package
Close off the same hot and cold lines and open the bypass

, That's the pink kind, not the green kind. The pink kind is RV antifreeze, which is GRAS -- generally regarded as safe. The green kind is toxic. Not that you'd be swallowing any, but, you know, just in case.









Approximately 2 to 3 gallons (7.6 to 11.4 liters) of antifreeze should be enough to fill the RV’s entire plumbing system, provided a bypass is installed. If you don't have one, you need as much antifreeze as the water heater can hold, usually 6 to 10 gallons., Alternatively, as discussed, use a hand pump connected to the city water hookup.








, You'll probably start at the kitchen sink -- turn on the hot faucet and run it until it turns pink -- that is, filled with antifreeze. All the water has been flushed from the system! Then, run the cold faucet until it's pink, too.









The general order is kitchen sink, bathroom sink, shower, toilet, and outdoor shower. Run each of these until you see a strong shade of pink in each.

You may need to flush the toilet several times until the RV antifreeze comes out at a steady rate.



, This includes the washing machine, ice maker, and outside shower! Don't forget about those. The specifics of your RV will need to be taken into account here. Refer to your manual for more specific guidelines.








,, This is always done last.







, Kind of a big duh, huh? The last thing you want is an exploded two-liter of orange soda all over your fridge. Not to mention mice and ants.









And as for valuable items, why would you leave them in an RV for six months? And the laundry, well, it's just best to leave everything clean so when you come back in the spring, there's a lot less work to do.

, Your RV is going to be sitting and stewing for a while -- not good for any machine (or human for that matter). To make sure it makes it through, fix everything now. You'll be glad you did.








, Hopefully you already have some type of mesh guard for your exhaust pipe and whatnot to protect against mice, but make sure all the vents and holes are covered now. You don't want birds (think of the roof), rodents (pipes), or bugs (seams) making your RV home.









Check the entire RV for places that bugs or animals may be able to get into. Just because you're not using it doesn't mean they should get to!

, If you leave that much weight on the one side of the tires, they could grow weak over time. So leave your RV on blocks, taking the pressure off the tires.








, While you don't want snow and rodents getting into your RV, you also don't want mold and mildew to start growing underneath your tarp. So if you do cover it, cover it with a material that breathes.









You may want to put rags on top of the sharp corners of your RV so that breathable material doesn't rip. For good measure!

Flush the engine with fresh water.,
Stabilize your fuel.,
Fog the engine cylinders and carburetor intakes.,
Flush your engine block with antifreeze.,
Change the oil.,
Drain and replace the gear case lubricant.,
Disengage the battery and store it in a safe, dry place for the winter.",How to Winterize a Boat1," This process will flush salt, dirt, and other contaminants out of your engine in order to prevent blockages and corrosion. Depending on what kind of motor you have, there are a variety of ways to perform a flush.For older outboard motors, get a pair of boat engine “ear muffs” and attach them to the water intakes on your engine. Attach a water hose to the opening on the ear muffs, turn on the water, and let the engine run in neutral until the water runs out clean.
Some newer outboard motors have built-in water hose attachments and a flushing system that can be used without running the engine. If you have this type of motor, you can attach a hose directly to the motor and let the water run for about 10 minutes. Check your owner’s manual, if you have one, for the correct flushing procedure.;
, Unstabilized fuel can degrade during the winter, causing gummy buildups that can clog up your engine supply lines. Fill your gas tank with fuel to about 95% of your tank’s capacity. Add a gasoline stabilizer, like Pennzoil Fuel Stabilizer, PRI-G, or Stabil. Follow the directions on the stabilizer packaging to determine the appropriate amount to add. Run your engine for 10-20 minutes after adding the stabilizer in order to distribute the stabilized fuel.Alternatively, you can drain your gas tank and supply lines completely and leave your tank empty over the winter., Coating the inside of your engine with fogging oil will help prevent corrosion. Check your owner’s manual or engine manufacturer’s instructions to determine the best type of fogging oil to use and the proper procedure for fogging your engine.For some types of engines, you can simply spray fogging oil into the engine air intake while it is running. Spray a generous amount of fogging oil into the intake, then disconnect the fuel line. Continue spraying fogging oil into the air intake and allow the engine to continue running until it dies. The engine will probably put out a lot of white smoke during this process.
Alternatively, if you have completely drained the fuel from your engine, you can remove the spark plugs and spray fogging oil directly into the spark plug holes. Spin the engine by hand several times to coat the spark plugs. Put the plugs back in but do not connect the wires. This will keep your boat's pistons from being subjected to air, dampness and other caustic materials when not in use.

, Using antifreeze will prevent damage that can result from water freezing in your engine block. Antifreeze containing propylene glycol is environmentally friendly and recommended by nearly all manufacturers. Use the highest concentration of antifreeze available (-100). The procedure will differ depending on whether you have an inboard or outboard motor.


If you have an outboard motor, you can connect an antifreeze kit to your engine’s water intake after flushing with fresh water. Leave your engine running after performing the fresh-water flush, disconnect your water hose, and connect a hose attached to a tank of antifreeze to your water intake instead. Let the engine run while connected to the antifreeze tank until the tank is empty.For an inboard motor, take a large bucket of antifreeze (usually about five gallons) and insert the end of the water intake hose from the seacock into the bucket. Let the motor idle until you see antifreeze coming out of the exhaust outlet for at least 30 seconds. Replace the intake hose in the seacock., If you have an inboard motor, you should change the oil in your engine and transmission. This works best right after running the boat, while the oil is still hot. Hot oil flows more easily, and any contaminants or impurities will be suspended, making it easier to remove them. This is also a good time to replace your oil filter.Check your owner’s manual for recommendations on which type of oil to use. Engine oil is available in a variety of viscosities and service ratings, and different engines require different oil properties.
If you can, drain the old oil by removing the sump plug and allowing the oil to run out into a drainage pan or a cardboard box lined with a garbage bag.
If this method is not convenient, you can pump the old oil out with a hand pumped or electric oil extractor. Some oil changing devices can both extract the old oil and refill your crankcase with fresh oil.Dispose of your used oil at a recycling facility.

, This will flush out water and other contaminants that can cause rusting and corrosion. Get your engine hot before draining your gear case lubricant, as this will help the lubricant flow more easily and stir up any settled contaminants.If the lubricant looks cloudy or if you see metal shavings suspended in it, it may be time to get your gear case serviced.

, The battery should be fully charged when put away. Retain the charge and maintain the water level while the battery is in storage.

Protect your electronics and electronic fixtures.,
Inspect your vessel's propeller and hub.",How to Winterize a Boat2," If you see any cracks in your hull, these may be indicative of a more serious problem and should be evaluated by a professional. If you find blisters in the gelcoat on your hull, puncture them, drain out any water, and patch them with an epoxy-based filler like West System or West Marine Gelcoat Repair Kit., If you have scum and barnacles adhering to the bottom of your boat, you may wish to use a scraper to remove the barnacles and a pressure washer to blast off dirt and scum.If you choose to do this, be conscientious about local laws governing boat pressure washing procedures.You can prevent future scum buildup by treating the bottom of your boat with boat wax (such as 3M Marine Ultra Performance Paste Wax)., Use a gentle all-purpose cleanser to wipe down interior surfaces and get rid of grime. If necessary, vacuum and wash any carpets.If your boat has any interior vinyl components, treat them with a vinyl cleaning and protection solution like 3M Marine Vinyl Cleaner.
Remove any obvious mold and mildew with a mildew cleanser, such as Star brite Mildew Stain Remover.

, Remove whatever electronics you can and store them in a dry environment. Spray any exposed electronic fixtures with a moisture displacing lubricant, like Corrosion X or WD-40., Look for dented or bowed blades and widespread wear. Change damaged parts and perform needed repairs when winterizing your boat.

Decide between wet or dry storage.,
Store your boat in a climate-controlled setting, if possible.,
Cover your boat.",How to Winterize a Boat3," Dry storage may ultimately be less expensive than storing your boat in the water, and dry-stored boats are less likely to develop blisters on their hulls. However, dry-stored boats may be more susceptible to damage from sudden freezes than boats stored in the water. Consider your local climate and discuss your options with boating experts in your area., You may wish to rent a climate-controlled storage unit, store your boat in a heated garage on your property, or store your boat in a dry-stacking facility. These options will help protect your boat from the elements, and may be especially important in areas where hurricanes and winter storms are a concern., This is a good idea even if the boat will be stored in a heated garage or another type of storage facility. Your cover should be tight fitting, waterproof, and strong enough to hold up if snow or debris falls on it. Whichever type of cover you choose should be well ventilated to prevent trapped moisture inside your boat.A few popular types of boat coverings are:Shrink wrap. The major downside to shrink wrap is that it can trap moisture and lead to mildew if not properly treated and ventilated.
Custom fabric covers. While the up-front cost of a fabric cover may be high, it can be re-used for many years, and will ultimately cost you less than repeated applications of shrink wrap. Fabric covers also have the advantages of being well-ventilated and easy to remove and replace.
Polyethylene tarps. Tarps are a fairly inexpensive boat covering solution, but the tarp you select should be thick, and must be supported to prevent damage to your boat from accumulation of snow and debris. You may need to build a frame out of wood or PVC pipe that can be fitted over your boat to support the tarp cover."

Turn off the water at the exterior.,
Open all faucets and drain all waterlines.,
Turn down the thermostat.,
Unplug all appliances.,
Don't forget the gas.",How to Winterize a Vacant Home2," Make sure that the water supply is turned off completely at the main supply point. If the furnace should fail on a very cold day, water in a pipe could freeze and burst the pipe.;
, If you live in an area where freezing pipes can be a problem, drain the toilets, the water heater (turn off the gas or electric supply first) and the expansion tank.


Get an air compressor to blow the lines of excess water. Eliminate or dilute the water in drain traps by pouring an ""RV"" type antifreeze solution into them, as directed by the instructions.
Close the sink and tub drains.
If a house is to be vacant for a long time, you may prevent water in a toilet’s trap from evaporating (and thereby permitting sewer gases to enter the home) by raising the toilet’s lid and seat and covering the bowl with saran wrap.
If you have an indoor or outdoor pool, drain the water.
Turn off and drain fountains and other sources of standing water.
Drain water from dishwashers and pour RV antifreeze. with refrigerators (with a water dispenser or an ice maker) and washing machines, following the manufacturer’s directions. Remove the water filter from inside the refrigerator.
Remove and empty any ""whole house"" or ""in line"" type filter canister.

, Set your thermostat to a level adequate to keep the inside temperature above freezing and to keep things dry. If the home is located in a warm, damp climate, you should have a humidity indicator installed and set to maintain a reasonably dry interior.

, If you leave the electric power on, unplug electric appliances, including microwave ovens and TVs, to avoid the risk of fire in the event of a faulty switch or a rodent gnawing the wires.

, For long absences, some experts recommend shutting off gas hot water heaters completely.

",How to Winterize a Vacant Home3," Don't keep anything that is likely to go bad during the time you are away.


Empty the freezer. Don't leave anything in it in case the electricity is off for an extended period of time; you won't necessarily be aware if this occurs, and the food will have thawed and refrozen, which is very dangerous.
If you must keep frozen food, here is one method for determining if your freezer has warmed during the winter: freeze a container of water solid, then place a coin on the surface of the ice; if the coin has sunk into the ice when you return, then the freezer warmed, letting the ice melt and then refreeze.
Wash the refrigerator and freezer thoroughly. Prop open their doors, the better to forestall mold and mildew (which like to grow in the dark) and their odors, which may transfer to the refrigerator’s plastic parts.
To further thwart odors, place an open bag of activated charcoal on the inside of the open refrigerator.

The following steps are presented in order of least expense and / or level of difficulty to perform or operate, down to most expense and difficulty.,
Explain the problem to your oil dealer.,

Install the oil filter indoors.,

Wrap fuel lines with insulation that do not absorb moisture.,
Install larger fuel lines.,

Add K-1 (kerosene) to the home heating fuel tank.,
Install an electric heat sheet to the outdoor oil tank.,

Build a room around the tank.",How to Prevent Fuel Oil for an Oil Furnace from Freezing," Even if properly implemented, none of the steps (except for possibly the last) can be considered ""guaranteed to work"". If the right combination of low temperature and length of time were to occur, eventually the cold would penetrate the insulation and cool the oil lines.
, He might be able to solve the problem for you. If he can't, you can contact another dealer to hear the solutions they offer. The most common fix consists of a liquid additive that is formulated to reduce or eliminate gelling when added the tank (preferably immediately before refilling). Most dealers offer these additives for sale in 16 oz (or larger) containers; but others provide the additive premixed with the fuel in the delivery vehicle's tank. If you find that you have to solve the problem yourself, be aware that there are many different types of additives available that perform one or more functions. Be sure to select an additive that targets the prevention of gelling or waxing of fuel oils. Read the label and use only as directed., The felt filter media of an oil filter can quickly become clogged with wax crystals in winter if located outdoors. Moving the filter indoors will get it into an area that is warmer than the outdoor temperature. Simply install a new filter housing and filter in the indoor location and then remove the filter media from the outdoor filter housing. You can leave the outdoor filter housing in place without a filter., Minimize the amount of pipe exposed to the cold temperatures by completely insulating or moving them indoors when possible. Carefully seal all openings and seams in the insulation to prevent exposure to cold temperatures., Because it will take longer for larger diameter fuel lines to become clogged completely, a fuel line with a diameter that is larger than the standard 3/8"" type will allow oil to flow for a longer period of time when compared to smaller diameter lines. Sometimes, this additional time is long enough to ""ride out"" a period of extreme cold., This will mix with fuel oil and lower the ""freeze"" point, as the freeze point for K-1 is about -20F. K-1 will burn successfully in just about any home heating fuel oil furnace, but the downside is the expense (historically, K-1 can cost a 20% to 30% higher than fuel oil)., These work best installed on the bottom of the tank and are types that are secured with RTV adhesive (as opposed to straps and clamps). Installing on the bottom of the tank helps distribute the heat because heat rises. This rising heated oil will thermally ""stir"" the contents of the tank. Make sure the heater selected is appropriate for the location of the tank (such as wet or outdoor). The cost of operating this heater will be reflected in your electric bill and because of this, it should be a ""last resort"" type fix. These heat sheet products are available at industrial supply stores and may also be called ""drum heaters"", While this is the most expensive solution, it will nearly always work. Add a small heat source, or if connected to the home, provide a small amount of airflow between the room and the rest of the home to prevent gelling of the fuel."

Use your windows and blinds to warm your room with sunlight.,
Wear layers for energy-free heating.,
Put hot water bottle in your bed.,
Plug drafts with spare blankets.,
Make the most of existing heaters or radiators.,
Invite people into the room.,
Get a hair dryer and lightly blow the bed with the dryer.",How to Warm up a Room1," One of the easiest ways of all to keep your room warmer is to use the sun, mother nature's original space heater. In general, you'll want to allow as much warm sunlight into your room as possible during the day and to prevent that warmth from leaving at night. For best results, you'll also need to know which windows in your room the sun shines through — generally, these are south-facing windows in the Northern Hemisphere and north-facing windows in the Southern Hemisphere.Here's simple sample schedule you may want to use:



Morning: Before you leave for work or school, close all of your room's windows. Open the blinds all the way.

Afternoon: Leave your blinds open until sun stops shining into your room. As soon as it starts to get dark and cold, close the blinds.

Night: Keep the blinds and windows closed throughout the night to preserve heat.;
, In a world where the climate impact of household practices is becoming a bigger concern, many environment-conscious consumers are choosing to heat the person, not the room. Wearing a coat, a jacket, or some sweat pants indoors is a great way to stay warm without using an ounce of heating energy (or spending a penny on your heating bill.)


If your room is especially cold at night, you might try wearing layers at night. Though some people find this uncomfortable, soft garments like sweatpants and ""hoodie"" sweatshirts usually give the most warmth without sacrificing much comfort.
Artificial fabrics that don't ""breathe"" like polyester, rayon, and so on generally trap the most heat (this is why they're so uncomfortable in the summer).

, One of the worst feelings in the world is navigating an ice-cold room in your pajamas only to slide into a sub-zero bed. While your bed should heat up once you're in it, you can avoid this awful feeling by heating it up before you get in. A hot water bottle is one great way to do this — simply fill it with steaming water, close the lid tight, and leave it in the center of your bed under the covers 15 minutes before you go to bed.. As it cools, it will dissipate heat into your bed, leaving it nice and toasty when you get in.


Medical water bottles are available at many pharmacies for around $15 or less.
If you're using a microwave to heat your water, be sure to use a microwave-safe container (like a glass or ceramic bowl).

, The last thing you want when you're trying to heat a room is a draft (sometimes spelled ""draught""), a spot where cool air can leak into the room. Keep any drafts plugged up with spare rags or blankets while you're waiting for a more permanent solution (like replacing a leaky window, etc.) When drafts are especially bad, this simple fix can make a big difference.


Not sure whether you have a draft? There are several ways to discover them. One is simply to hold your hand near a crack in a window or door and feel for the motion of air. You can also use a candle — if its flame flickers near a crack, you have a draft.
Try the U.S. Government's draft-detecting tips at energy.gov for more ideas.

, Do you have a heater or radiator in your room that doesn't seem to be making a difference when it comes to keeping you warm? Use these tips to increase their effectiveness (and save you money you'd otherwise be wasting):


Make sure there are no pieces of furniture between the heater or radiator and yourself. For instance, many older houses hide radiators behind couches.
Put a sheet of tinfoil behind a radiator (use a sheet about the same a size as the radiator itself). This reflects heat that would normally be transmitted into the wall, heating the rest of the room.
If your heater is portable, use it in the smallest space possible so that it can most effectively heat you. For instance, a space heater will heat a small bedroom much better than it will heat a large living room.

, It's easy to forget that human beings are essentially walking, talking, biological furnaces, constantly emitting heat into the air around them. Bringing an extra person or two into the room can make a noticeable distance — your combined body heat and the heat of your exhalation will help warm the room.


Two things are important to keep in mind with this method: the smaller the room and the more physically active the people in it, the warmer it will get. In other words, a lively party in a small room will produce a lot more heat than a few people sitting on couches in a large living room.
If your friends are busy, even pets can make a room a little warmer (unless they're cold-blooded — fish and lizards aren't helpful here).

, This trick may seem a little ridiculous, but it does work. After all, a hair dryer is essentially a small space heater with a fan in it. You can blow hot air directly onto your bed or lift up the covers and point the hairdryer underneath to create a pocket of warm air for you to lie in.


Be careful not to touch the hot metal elements at the end of your hair dryer with your bedsheets, especially if they're made of a fabric that's prone to melting (like polyester, etc.)

Plug-in heating devices, which can usually be found at most department stores, are available in a wide range of sizes and power levels, making them a reasonable solution for any size room (and any budget).


Keep in mind that space heaters tend to use a lot of electricity. While you may be able to make up the difference by turning off your central heating, frequent space heater use can affect your utility bill.
Always adhere to the basics of heater safety: don't leave space heaters on unattended (including while you sleep) and don't use space heaters that burn fuel indoors, as these pose a carbon monoxide hazard., Though they were once considered unfashionable, electrical blankets are making a comeback thanks to the comfort (and savings) they provide. The devices can make for an exceptionally comfortable slumber when it's cold in your room. Best of all, they tend to use significantly less energy than other plug-in heaters — one consumer study found that they usually saved about one-half to three-fourths of the energy.For the most comfort, start the electric blanket a few minutes before you get into bed. To save energy, turn it off before you fall asleep.

, For some, there's nothing quite as comfortable as the feeling of being under a heavy pile of blankets when it's cold. The more layers of blankets you use, the more of your body heat will be trapped in the bed. Additional layers create pockets of ""dead heat"" — air that has a hard time leaking out into the surrounding cool.


In general, thicker, fluffier materials (like wool, fleece, and down) are warmest. Air gets caught in the tiny spaces in these materials, trapping more heat next to the body.
Don't forget that you can even wear blankets around the house — perfect when you don't want to give up the warm comfort of bed just yet.

, Windows are one of the most frequent sources of heat loss for rooms.To counteract this, try hanging thick, heavy curtains around your window and closing them as soon as it starts to get cold in the evening. The heavy material of the curtains will help slow the heat loss through the glass, keeping the room warmer, longer.


If curtains aren't in your budget, you can get a similar effect by hanging old blankets in front of windows.

, Smooth, hard surfaces like wood, tile, and marble tend to retain much less heat than carpet. In fact, un-insulated floors can account for 10% of a room's total heat loss.If you're tired of freezing your toes off when you get up in the morning, consider laying down a rug or even having carpeting installed. This will also help keep your room warm once you've heated it — a carpeted room will stay warm longer after you turn off the heater than a room with a bare tile floor.


You can even sometimes get away with covering some of your walls with carpet-like materials to increase this effect. Things like tapestries and decorative rugs can look great when they're hung from the wall and can keep your room slightly warmer at the same time.

, Though it's a major investment, getting new insulation in your home can be a project that pays for itself in the long run, as this can dramatically reduce heating bills (especially for older, draftier houses).Another benefit, of course, is that you'll be warmer and more comfortable. Below are a just few types of insulation you may want to consider:


Wall insulation (fiberglass, etc.)
Window insulation (double and triple-paned windows, protective films, etc.)
Door insulation (draft guards, floor seals, etc.)
Every house is different, so the amount of work required can vary wildly from house to house. Before you make any concrete decisions, talk to an experienced contractor (or several) and get an estimate for your project so you can determine what the best decision for you is

Keep track of how the wires are connected to the back of your old thermostat.,
Keep the wires from falling back into the wall.,
Put up the replacement wall plate, if there is one.,
Connect the wires from the wall to the thermostat.,
Attach the thermostat face to the new wall plate.,
Turn the electricity back on to the furnace and air conditioner.,
Test the thermostat by causing the furnace and air conditioner to come on at various temperatures.",How to Wire a Thermostat," Before wiring a new thermostat into your wall, review all tips, suggestions and pictures provided in the instructions. Take heed to any special directions given for your particular model.;
, Flip the switches at the breaker box that corresponds to your furnace and air conditioner. Turning the electricity off helps to avoid any electrical problems or injuries.

, The thermostat will usually slide up to come off the wall plate. Loosen and remove the screws that hold the wall plate in place.

,


Label or make note of which wires were connected to the letter designations on the old thermostat. If there are stray wires that are not connected to anything, label those, too.
Disregard the colors, except for your own labeling and referral purposes. While professional installations are usually color-coded, not all thermostats were wired by professionals originally.

, Tie or bundle the wires together. If they still won't stay in place, tape them to the wall. Wires that fall back into the wall must be fished out in order to complete the wiring installation.

, Mark new holes to match the holes in the wall plate. Use a level to ensure that the wall plate is straight. Drill the holes for the new plate. Screw the new plate onto the wall.

, Refer to your labels or the notes you made to connect them correctly. Twist the wires to the connectors on the back of the thermostat or follow the directions provided with the manufacturer's instructions.

, Push all wires back into the wall, and slide the plate onto the wall plate. It should sit flush against the wall and be straight.

, Flip the switches in your breaker box to restore the electricity to the items.

, Review all steps if the thermostat fails to work.

Take insulation off windows.,
Clean the inside of windows.,
Clean the outside of windows.,
Check caulking and weather stripping.",How to Dewinterize a House1," If you've put up insulation film on the windows, you'll need to take it down before you can open the windows. Leaving insulation film up after the winter will make it stuffy and hot inside your home.Use a hairdryer to heat up the double-sided tape along the perimeter of the windows.Once the adhesive agent is warm and soft, you should be able to pull the plastic straight off the window frame.Use the hairdryer once again to soften any adhesive that was left on the window frame.Use warm water and soap or a spray-on cleaning agent to scrub off any traces of adhesive on the window frame.;
, Once the insulation is off, you'll need to clean the windows. It's best to clean both the inside and outside of the windows, since it's probably been a while since the windows were cleaned.Use a spray-on cleaning agent or cold, soapy water and a sponge for washing the inside of windows.Use clean paper towels or a clean, lint-free cloth to wipe the inside of windows dry., The outside of windows can be washed using the same spray-on cleaning agent or cold, soapy water. If you are cleaning the outside of windows on a two- or three-story house, it may be difficult or even unsafe to wipe down the windows. In this case, you may want to wash the windows using a hose, angled upward from the yard., Once you've cleaned the windows, you may want to check the caulking and weather strips around the windows. Caulk and weather strips can wear down over time, and if you use air conditioning in your home during the summer an air leak can cost you money and energy.Choose a caulk that is waterproof to ensure that no moisture gets into your home.Clean the edges that are to be caulked. Scrape away old, peeling caulk or paint with a putty knife or flathead screwdriver.Hold the caulk gun at a 45 degree angle around the entire window.Apply the caulk in a continuous, straight stream to every joint in the window frame and to the joint where the wall and window frame meet.Be sure that the caulk is adhering to both sides of the seams.Use a putty knife to place any errant caulk into the seam where you want it.Allow caulk to completely dry before painting or touching the caulk. Drying times vary depending on the type of caulk used, but most caulks will be completely dry within 24 hours."

Test smoke and CO2 alarms.,
Change furnace filters.,
Clean out the fireplace.",How to Dewinterize a House2," Smoke and carbon monoxide alarms should be tested every month, but it's especially important if you haven't inhabited the house for an extended period of time.Test alarms by pressing the test button.Replace any batteries that are dead or dying. Most smoke alarms require a nine volt battery.Vacuum around the vents of smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms to remove any dust that has built up around the sensors., The filter on your furnace traps dust, dander, hair/fur, and other particulates in the air inside your home. Basic fiberglass or paper filters typically need to be changed every one to two months, and electrostatic or HEPA filters need to be cleaned or changed every two to four months.Even though you won't need the furnace during summer, it's a good idea to change old filters. If a cold snap hits in the spring and you turn the furnace back on, you'll want to ensure that the furnace isn't loaded up with dirt, dust, and other particulates.


Be sure the furnace is turned off.Remove the service panel. If you cannot find it, consult the manufacturer's guide.Slide out the old filter. Filters are typically located near the fan inside the furnace.Insert a new filter, then close up the service panel., If your home has a fireplace, it's a good idea to clean it out as part of your spring cleaning and dewinterization routine. Much like the furnace filter, you want to ensure that the fireplace is clean, in case a cold snap hits in the spring and you need to have a fire.


Move anything that might be blocking the fireplace, and put down old sheets or a plastic shower curtain to catch any ash and soot.Use a wet paper towel to wipe down the grate inside the fireplace.Use a shop vacuum to remove as much of the ash, soot, and wood fragments as possible. Do not use a regular household vacuum, as the material you vacuum from the fireplace might clog the filter of the vacuum.Scrub the walls and floor of the fireplace with a handled brush and a mixture of warm water and a gentle soap.Have a professional chimney cleaner scrub out your chimney to prevent the risk of fire."
"
Dust any ceiling fans.,
Sweep and vacuum the floors.,
Mop the floors.",How to Dewinterize a House3," You can use rubber bands to fasten paper towels or a cleaning wipe to a paint roller, which can then be rolled across the fan blades.If you don't have these materials you can use a broom to dust the blades of a ceiling fan.

, You'll need a broom to sweep wood and tile floors and a vacuum to clean any carpets.


You can sweep from end to end, or start along one wall and clean the perimeter of the room, working your way inward.Use a similar method for carpeted rooms.

, Once you've swept the floors, you may need to mop to clean up any dirt and dust that accumulated over the winter.


Fill a bucket with warm water and a cleaning agent like Murphy's Oil or Pinesol.
Dip a mop into the bucket, ring it out thoroughly, and work your way across the floor. Start in the corner farthest from the door you'll use to leave the room, so you don't have to walk across a wet floor.Use short strokes and move with the grain of the floor, if the floors are made of wood."
"
Turn your water back on.,
Check pipes for leaks.,
Inspect the foundation.,
Clean the gutters.,
Check the roof for damage.,
Clean the garage and driveway.",How to Dewinterize a House4," If your water was turned off for the winter, you'll need to turn the water back on. This should be a fairly simple procedure, unless your home is very old.


The inside valve may be located under the kitchen sink, in a cupboard, or underneath a removable floorboard.The outside valve, also called a stopcock, is usually located with the water meter or near the edge of your property, under a cover.Turn the valve counterclockwise to open the valve and return water flow to your home., After a harsh winter, it's possible your pipes might have frozen and cracked. Cracked pipes can cause leaks that could damage your home and will lose a lot of water if left untreated..


Find your home's water meter. It is located outside the house, usually near a gate or fence if you have one.Turn off all the taps in your home, except for the stop taps at the toilet and next to the water meter.Make sure no one in your home uses any water while you test the pipes.Record the numbers on your water meter dial.Wait two hours, then record the number on the water meter again. If any of the numbers are different, there may be a leak. Call a qualified plumber to assess any damage and make repairs as necessary., After a harsh winter, it's important to check your foundation for any cracks or separations. Walk around the perimeter of the house. If there are any cracks, or if the foundation and wall are disjointed, it should be readily apparent. Call a qualified contractor for any damage to the house's foundation., After the fall and winter, many gutters become clogged with leaves and branches. Cleaning out the gutters will help reduce the chances of your home incurring water damage due to clogged gutters and drains.


Secure a ladder in front of your gutters. If possible, have someone with you to hold the ladder in place.
Wear yard gloves to protect your hands.Use a small hand trowel to scoop out leaves and mud. Scoop debris into a garbage bag.Use a hose to clean the downspout., While you are on a ladder, you may want to examine your roof to look for damage. Roofs frequently lose shingles during bad weather, and may be susceptible to holes or water damage. Use caution when examining the roof. If there is any risk of damage to the roof, do not walk, sit, or climb onto the roof at all.


Visually examine the roof, looking for any shingles that are missing or damaged. If possible, check for loose nails.Visually scan the roof, looking for any dents or dips, as these could indicate a leak.Call a qualified roofer if you believe there is any structural damage to your roof.

, It's important to thoroughly clean out your garage floor and your driveway to ensure that any sidewalk salt is properly rinsed away. Sidewalk salt can cause cracks and etches in the concrete, and the problem gets worse the longer salt sits on the concrete.Sweep the garage and the length of the driveway with a push broom. Then rinse the garage floor and driveway thoroughly using a hose."

Read the manufacturer’s instructions.,
Choose the right fuel.,
Open all the controls.,
Put in some kindling.,
Light the fire.,
Add some small logs.,
Keep the door closed.,
Add larger logs.,
Close the air intakes partially.,
Use fans to circulate the heat.,
Use proper safety precautions when using the wood stove.,
Burn seasoned wood only.,
Clean out the ashes regularly.,
Clean the firebox weekly.,
Have the stove inspected annually.",How to Use a Wood Stove," Many wood stoves come with specific directions from the manufacturer. You should read these before starting a fire in your wood stove to ensure that you're doing it properly and safely.If you don’t have the manual for your stove, check the manufacturer’s website for a copy.;
, The best wood to use is seasoned wood that’s been drying for at least six months. Fresh wood contains too much water, and burning it will waste wood and money. Moreover, wet wood creates lots of smoke, and lots of creosote buildup.


Creosote is a combination of chemicals made up of unburned fuel. This material can build up in your chimney and can lead to chimney fires.
In terms of type of wood, you can choose between hardwood and softwood. Hardwoods that come from deciduous trees are denser and produce a hotter and longer burn, so they're ideal for cold winters. Softwoods are less dense, so they produce a cooler fire that’s great for cool spring or fall nights.Fireplace wood can be found at many convenience stores, gas stations, hardware stores, grocery stores, garden centers, wood suppliers, and online.

, Oxygen is one of the things that a fire needs to burn, and many wood stoves have one or more levers you can use to control valves that allow air into the firebox. When you're starting a fire, you want all the valves fully open.The primary source of air in many wood stoves is an air intake under the grate that provides oxygen to the fire bed. Many wood stoves will have a lever under or beside the door that controls this valve.
Stoves may also have a secondary air valve above the firebox to provide oxygen to the flames, as well as a damper that opens and closes the flue.

, The best way to get a fire going in a wood stove is to start with small pieces of wood that can increase the temperature inside the firebox and get the flames burning. To set up the kindling:


Crumple up five or six pieces of newspaper. Make sure the paper is dry.
Place the newspaper balls into the center of the firebox.
Lay up to 15 pieces of kindling on top of the paper. Make sure the pieces of wood are dry and small., Use a lighter or match to ignite the newspaper under the kindling. Light the paper in a few places, starting at the back and working your way toward the front. This will prevent you from burning yourself as you pull your hand out of the firebox.


Leave the door to the wood stove open for about five minutes to ensure the fire gets enough fresh air.As the paper burns, it will ignite the kindling pieces on top, and this will get the fire going.

, Once the kindling has begun to burn, you can add some smaller logs to the fire when the original flames start to die down. Add at least three small logs to the fire, one at a time to avoid smothering the flames.


When you add wood to the fire, loosely stack the logs so that air can surround them as much as possible.
Close the door most of the way, but leave it unlatched for about 15 minutes to prevent the fire from being smothered as it establishes itself.Once the fire is fully established, after about 15 minutes, you can close and latch the door.

, Each time you open the door, it allows heat to escape from the stove, and this will result in a cooler and less efficient fire. Moreover, opening the door can allow smoke to escape into the room too, which is bad for people’s health.


Once your fire is burning, the only time you should open the door is when you're adding more wood.Open the door slowly to prevent a blast of fresh air from rushing into the stove and creating smoke.
Keeping the door closed will also prevent sparks and embers from shooting out, and this is important because these can cause burns or start fires.

, After you’ve added some small logs and let the fire establish itself, you can add larger logs to the fire. When the flames from the smaller logs start to subside, add about three larger logs to the fire.


When those logs have burned down and are mostly embers with some visible flame, then it’s time to add more logs.Don’t add more than five logs at a time. Adding too much wood at once will partially smother the fire and leave fuel unburned, and this leads to smoke and creosote buildup.

, After about 20 minutes, when the fire is established and burning well, reduce the amount of air going into the firebox. This will provide the fire with enough air to keep burning, but will stop it from blazing and burning too quickly.Close the air valve levers so that they're open about one-third of the way. This includes the primary air, secondary air, and the damper.
Never close the secondary air valve or damper completely. This can lead to tar, soot, and creosote buildup in the chimney., The point of a wood stove is to heat a house, and you can help this process along by using fans to blow hot air from the stove around the house.There are many stovetop fans you can buy that sit on top of the wood stove and blow the heat outward.

, Fires are great for providing comfort and warmth, but fire can be dangerous and must be treated as such. There are many things you can do to keep your home and family safe, including:


Keep children and pets away from the stove when there's a fire burning. The metal of the woodstove will be extremely hot, and can cause burns. The easiest way to keep kids and animals away from the stove is to install a fence or safety gate around it.
Keep all combustible materials at least 3 feet (90 cm) away from the wood stove. This includes fuel, kindling, papers and books, and furniture.
Have a fire extinguisher installed in the same room as the wood stove.
To have an overnight fire, open the air valves and add some large pieces of hardwood to the fire. Let the fire burn for about 25 minutes, and then close the valves to their regular spot. This will prevent smouldering, which leads to smoke and creosote buildup.Let the fire die out naturally rather than throwing water on it. Once the fire has died down and there are only embers left, you can leave the fire to die out on its own.

, For the health and safety of your home and family, and the maintenance of your wood stove, you shouldn’t burn anything but seasoned wood in your stove. You can use plain paper or newspaper as kindling, but don’t burn things like:Wood that’s wet, green, painted, or pressure treated
Garbage
Plastic
Cardboard
Coal
Particle board or plywood
Wood pellets
Gas, lighter fluid, or any other fuel

, When the ashes build up under the grate or in the bottom of the firebox, you should clean them out. Too much ash in the bottom will impede the airflow, meaning your fire won’t get the oxygen it needs. To clean the ashes, use a shovel or brush to sweep the ashes into a metal bucket. Take the ashes outside immediately and add them to your garden or compost.


Always leave a one-inch (2.5-cm) layer of ash in the bottom of the fireplace for insulation.Never clean out the ashes right after a fire. Wait at least 24 hours to give the ashes time to cool completely., When you're using the wood stove on a regular basis, clean inside the firebox once a week. To clean it, scrub the inside with a stiff-bristled brush to remove soot and other residue.


When you’ve scrubbed the inside, vacuum out any ash and soot from around the base of the stove.

, To make sure your wood stove is properly cleaned and to prevent chimney fires, call in a professional chimney sweep once a year. This person can also inspect the stove, pipes, and other components for damage and corrosion.


The best time to have your chimney swept is before summer, because heat and humidity can mix with carbon residue and create acids that eat away at your wood stove components.
You should also inspect your wood stove regularly for rust, cracks, and other signs of damage."

Assuming that a visual inspection of the element has been done or isn’t possible.,
First we need to know what the resistance of the element should be this can be calculated using known values:

,
R = (V x V) / P (An example calculation is shown in the tips section)

,
Now we Know what resistance we are looking for we can check the element.

,
Set the multimeter to the resistance setting with an appropriate measuring scale selected.

,
With the power off, Unplugged or by other means disconnected from the mains.,
If the reading is the same or very close to that of the calculated value then the element is OK and the fault lies elsewhere.

,
If the reading is a lot higher than the calculated value the element is failing and won't be heating fully.

,
If the reading is a lot lower than the calculated value the element is failing and will be heating to much or not at all if part of the element has shorted or exploded.

Purchase a replacement thermostat that will work with your system.,
Review the manufacturer instructions for wiring your replacement thermostat.,
Shut off the power to your thermostat.,
Remove the old thermostat from the wall.,
Pay attention to how the old thermostat was wired as you disconnect it.,
Keep the disconnected wires hanging out of the wall.,
Install the replacement wall plate.,
Hook up the thermostat to the wires.,
Place the thermostat on the wall.,
Activate the power back to the thermostat, furnace and air conditioner.,
Check to make sure your replacement thermostat is working.,
Program your thermostat.",How to Replace a Thermostat1," Review the compatibilities listed on the packaging of the replacement thermostat. Most replacement thermostats are compatible with all common systems.


However, if your system is unique, finding a replacement thermostat may be difficult. Here are your basic options (information that should be easily found on the packaging):""Works with 1 stage heating or cooling"": Used when you have separate heating and air conditioning units

""Works with 2 stage or multi-stage heating or cooling"": Used for heating or cooling units that have designated high and low speeds

""Works with Direct Line Voltage"": Used with 110 or 240 direct current power sources to power the thermostat (generally seen in older homes)

""Works with 24mV"": Used with fireplaces, floors, or wall furnaces

""Zoned HVAC"": Used when both heating and cooling are individually controlled in different areas from the same system

;
, Most thermostats utilize similar installation methods; however, it's beneficial to read all materials and preview all pictures provided for how to install your new thermostat. Or you risk literally being stuck in the cold!


Reading instructions is a total drag, yes. But this is not something you want to mess up! Read them and study the pictures. You want yours to match detail for detail.
It’s also a smart idea to always take pictures of the existing wiring before you start.

, Turn the switches off at the breaker box that pertain to your thermostat, furnace and air conditioner. Turning off the power to the thermostat reduces the chances of electrical injuries as you remove the old thermostat and install the new one.








, Most thermostats slide upward from where they are attached to the wall. Loosen the screws that attach the wall plate to the wall, if there is one.









Some thermostats have a base and sub-base. You need to remove the entire thermostat -- all you should be left with is exposed wires and a bare wall, nothing else.
If the wires you expose are corroded and there is enough wire length, re-strip the wires. Otherwise, scrape the ends with a utility knife until they are shiny.

, This is the most important step. Most thermostats wires are coded, but some (if done by an amateur previously) can be coded incorrectly. To make sure you're doing it right:









With a piece of tape, write a letter on each wire, matching the letter of the connection on the thermostat base. If the blue wire was in connection B, write ""B"" on the piece of tape, and put the tape on the wire. Label or designate any wires that were loose and unconnected to your thermostat as well.
Ignore the colors of wires, except for your own identification purposes. Thermostats wired by non-professionals do not usually adhere to codes, so the colors may not match what they should.

, Tie the wires together or tape them to the wall to keep them from falling back into the wall. A lost wire will turn this rather easy process into quite the debacle.









Pro tip? Wrap all the wires around a pencil. The weight of the pencil is just enough to keep the wires from going anywhere.

, Use the new wall plate as a template to mark where the holes you need to drill for the screws will be. Use a level if necessary. Then, drill the holes, and screw the replacement wall plate into its new position on the wall.









If your new thermostat has a mercury tube (that is to say, if your new thermostat is rather old school), your device needs to be completely level or it won't render accurate readings. Using a level is very important in this scenario and is not just for aesthetic reasons.
Make sure you're drilling holes that match the size of your screws. A 3/16"" drill bit is fairly standard.
Your thermostat definitely comes with screws, and probably comes with anchors. Make sure to use the anchors, too. They support the system on the wall.

, Use your notes or labels to re-connect the wires to the thermostat – or, follow the pictures you took of the pre-existing wiring. You can twist the wires onto the thermostats connectors, or follow the directions manual provided by the manufacturer.


Your new thermostat should have the same corresponding code on the back, unless otherwise noted in the instructions. If you're at all in doubt, contact a heating and cooling company.
Some thermostats are as simple as a two-wire system. Some have 5. If you have empty ports or connections, don't worry. Your thermostat is most likely fine.

, Replace all wires back into the wall, if extra length is exposed. Place the thermostat flush against the wall, slightly above the wall plate. Slide it down so it catches the grooves (or screws) on the wall plate to sit in place.









If your thermostat isn't in a good location (it's exposed to drafts or heat, which can mess up the readings, or it's too high or low for you), you'll need to contact a professional to have wires moved.

, Switch on the proper switches in the breaker box to restore power. Give it a minute to kick on.









And don't forget to install the batteries! Most systems require 2 AA batteries to work. Make sure the batteries aren't old, they're in place, and the polarities are correct

, Set the thermostat so the furnace and the air conditioner will come on at different times. Give your furnace and air conditioner at least 5 minutes each time to activate. If the thermostat does not work properly, retrace your steps to see where you made a mistake.









You may need to hit the reset button on your new thermostat. Some will not start until this button is pushed.

, Each type of thermostat is different, so read your manual if you have questions. Just remember that a programmable thermostat can save you loads of money -- have it be cooler when you're gone and warmer when you're there. It'll turn off without you, saving you money and saving energy to boot!

, The thermostat and radiator hose are linked to your car's cooling system; if you don't drain out the coolant, you're gonna get water everywhere when you start disassembling. Here's how:


Place a bucket (or some sort of container) underneath your radiator. You'll have somewhere between 4 to 8 cups of fluid pouring out, so don't skimp on the size of your container.
At the bottom of the radiator, there should be a draining screw or cap (technically, it's a radiator drain cock). Twist this to the left, opening it up.
Let all the water and coolant flow out. Keep the cap somewhere you won't lose it.

, Every model of car is different. Some thermostats you could spot from a mile away, others will be an obstacle to even the most trained of eyes. If looking at your car's engine is like reading gibberish, find the radiator hose and follow it to the end -- that'll be where your thermostat is located.


The body of the thermostat is probably metal with a bit of gold in the center and possible a rubber ring around the edges. It resembles a top or dreidel in shape and size, or, a small plunger.
If you're not quite sure what you're doing, consult your manual or look up the location online. It's better to know what you're looking for instead of poking around and possibly injuring yourself.

, The hose is most likely clamped to the thermostat casing. Unscrew this and set it aside. Move onto the thermostat casing, exposing the thermostat itself. You will definitely need a screwdriver, and you may need pliers, for the record.


Most vehicles have a two-bolt or three-bolt system for the thermostat casing.
If corrosion and gunk is building up prominently, clean up the area before you go about adding your new thermostat.
A bit of water will probably come out with removal of the hose. This is normal.

, Is it possible that your thermostat works, it's just stuck closed or a different part of your vehicle is starting to kick the bucket, affecting your thermostat's ability to make accurate readings? If so, it's very easy to test your thermostat. Here's how:


Get a pot of water boiling.
Insert your thermostat. The thermostat should open at around 190 ºF (88 ºC). Since water boils at 212ºF (100ºC), this is more than enough.
If the thermostat doesn't open in the water (and then close when it cools), you need a new one.

, From here on out, it's mainly a matter of reassembly -- the easy stuff. Replace your thermostat just like it the old one was positioned. If applicable, replace the rubber ring, too, sealing the edges.


If the area is building up dirt and grime, wipe it down with some cleaner first. You want to maximize the life of your thermostat and not have to deal with this again anytime soon.

, You remember what everything looked like, right? Here's a brief checklist:


Make sure the thermostat is snug and in place.
Bolt down the thermostat casing over top of the thermostat. Finger start your bolt and then bust out your pliers or socket wrench and get to tightening. Be careful not to strip the bolts.
Replace the radiator hose and clamp. The radiator should be snug on the outside of the thermostat casing and the clamp must be well-tightened.

, If the coolant you just drained out was fairly new, just use the same stuff in the bucket and add it back in. If it was old, you may be better off throwing the contents of the bucket out and just using new coolant. Either way, replace the coolant and make sure the radiator drain cock is on tight.


Once replaced, check for leaks. Your car needs coolant to operate safely. If yours is leaking, you literally won't get very far.

, You're done! Now all you have to do is keep an eye on your temperature gauge. If it's acting up, do a double check to make sure you secured everything appropriately. If so, you may need to consult a mechanic -- the problem probably lies elsewhere.

Turn on power (and adjust thermostat if required) to allow the burner start and allow to run for at least 15 minutes to cure water glass.,
Inspect floor and fuel lines for evidence of leaking fuel oil.",How to Replace the Combustion Chamber of an Oil Furnace," Most furnaces have a service switch on or near the boiler itself designed specifically for service personnel to use that ensures the power remains off while they are working on the equipment. If unable to locate the service switch, shut off power one way or another to prevent furnace from starting. Place a note on the electrical panel explaining the the circuit is off because the furnace is being serviced.
,,, You risk injury from burns if you do not allow enough time for the furnace cool down before attempting this work., Most modern furnaces have the oil burner supported through an opening in a hinged door. Take a photo with your cell phone or camera before beginning to help you remember how to reconnect the lines and cables later. If the fuel line must be removed, be sure also shut off the oil supply valve at or just before the point of disconnect. Many times, the easiest point and method to disconnect is by unbolting the fuel pump cover from the furnace motor itself. Gently move it out of the way and try not to move the fuel lines any more than necessary to help minimize the chances of kinking lines or disrupting the mating surfaces between flared ends of the lines and compression fittings. Remove and (clean or) have a replacement filter ready to install when reassembling later., The door has an important gas-tight seal that is maintained usually by a hex nut or bolt that squeezes the door seal against the furnace opening. If it is undamaged and you are not interested in replacing it, try not to disturb it., Wear personal protective equipment consisting of safety glasses, long sleeve shirt, protective gloves and mask to prevent inhaling fibers and getting them in your skin. Wetting the inside of the chamber with water will help prevent fibers from becoming airborne but also reduces the ease with which a vacuum will be able to pick up the debris in the next step., Remove the soot, rust and other debris that has collected or formed on the floor and walls of the chamber. A soot vacuum or HEPA vacuum is recommended if the inside hasn't been wet down in the previous step. If it has been wet down, a common shop vacuum will do., Reach in and pull the preformed refractory lining from rear wall and blanket material on the floor out of the chamber. Use a screw driver to gently break and scrape off the old lining material completely and then use a wisk broom to sweep all pieces into the garbage bag. Gently clean steel surfaces with a wire brush. Do not wedge screwdrivers and similar objects between boiler sections. Wisk broom or vacuum all surfaces once again., There may be small liner blanket behind the preformed refractory liner that should be removed as well. Clean the area the same as the inside of the chamber and vacuum., If the seal is undamaged and you do not want to replace it - you can skip this step - and those appearing later that describe replacement. Run a screwdriver around the recessed channel to scrape it clean and then wire brush and wisk broom this area clean.,, You may need to tip it to get it into proper position. Make sure it is all the way back against the rear wall by pressing with palms firmly all the way around., Orient the the blanket as per instructions and lay it inside the chamber. Butt the blanket up against the bottom edge of the rear wall refractory liner and extend it out of the chamber. Mark the blanket to indicate where it meets the outside edge of the opening to the chamber. Arrange the blanket so the sides extend equally up the sides of the boiler wall. Make a mark on the blanket and chamber floor so you can place it in the same position later., Use a straight edge and razor knife so it fits the chamber as per the instructions., The water glass is wet and sticky and will harden like glue when heated.  Pour about 3/4 of the water glass onto the chamber floor and then spread it with gloved fingers. Save the rest of the water glass to help secure the rope seal into the recess of the door in a later step. If you are not replacing the rope seal, using more than needed to cover the area needed by the blanket will only drip and leak out the front of the chamber., Hold the blanket inside and above the chamber floor (above the water glass covered surfaces). Align the marks on the blanket and the chamber floor. When satisfied with the position, lower and press it into place .,, Some liners come with paper strips to help it slide over rough edges of the cast iron door. Use them as needed to prevent cracking or breaking of the liner while pressing to fit. The liner is considered in position when the burner opening is flush with the liner to as much as 1/4"" recessed behind the liner - or as the instructions indicate with your liner kit., This step should be skipped if you did not remove the undamaged rope seal in a previous step. Remove the paper backing from the rope seal and press the adhesive side into the recess - starting with the middle of the rope seal at the mid point at the top of the door. Press the rope seal into the recess all the way around both sides of the door from top to bottom. Cut the rope seal to allow them to overlap slightly at the bottom middle of the door.,, Try not to move the fuel lines any more than necessary to help minimize the chances of disturbing the mating surfaces between flared ends of the lines and compression fittings. Wipe away any excess oil from lines, fittings and floor., Visually check for oil leaks at all fittings and correct as needed.,  If the burner fails to start and locks out, the oil pump may need to primed.  The priming procedure can be found here: Restart-a-Furnace-After-Running-out-of-Oil

Learn the differences between settings.,
Turn on the fan.,
Set the air conditioner.,
Set the heat.",How to Set a Thermostat1," If your home has central heating and cooling, then you most likely have a central thermostat to control it. Thermostats, whether programmable or not, will have many similar settings, including fan options, heating options, and cooling options.
, With fan options, you will most likely have “on” or “auto.” By choosing “on,” you will engage the fan on your system to circulate air through the home without heating or cooling it. The fan will run for as long as the “on” option is engaged. The “auto” option will only engage the fan when either the heat or air conditioning turns on and needs to be circulated.

The “on” option for the fan is generally considered an energy waster since it will require a decent amount of energy to move that much air on a constant basis. Due to this most people only ever leave the fan set to “auto.”
Many people use the “on” option simply to flush air out of a house—if something burned while cooking and you want to circulate enough air to clear the smell, for instance.

, Depending on your model of thermostat, you will likely either have a small switch on the thermostat’s faceplate or a cycle button to cycle between heating, cooling, and off options. You can prep the system to cool the home by moving the switch or pressing the button until you reach the “cool” setting. You will see a number on the thermostat display. This number is the ambient temperature in your home. Use the up and down arrows on the thermostat to set the temperature you want the home to reach. You will see a different display number come up that corresponds to the temperature you set.

You will likely hear the system click as it engages and turns on the air conditioning to lower the temperature in the house to what you have set.
The system will run until the house reaches the chosen temperature, and then it will automatically turn itself off and only reengage when the internal thermometer registers that the home is warmer than the set temperature.
You can use the same switch or button to cycle the system to “off” at any time.

, Setting the heat for your thermostat is very similar to setting the cooling option. Use the same switch or button to cycle through until you reach “heat.” You can then use the same set of arrows you used to set the cooling temperature to set the heating temperature. Again, the system will only run when the internal thermometer registers that the ambient room temperature is colder than the set temperature.

You may also see an “EM heat” or “emergency heat” setting on your thermostat, especially if you live in an area prone to bitter cold conditions. This setting corresponds to a separate electric heating unit in the home in the event that the larger system breaks or freezes over during winter.While it does not hurt to test the emergency heating option periodically, you should stick to the standard heat setting for day-to-day use.

Read the manual.,
Determine your schedule.,
Program time and date information.,

Repeat the process for the weekend.,
Press the “run” button to initiate.",How to Set a Thermostat2," While all programmable thermostats have roughly the same functions, they aren’t universally operated in the same manner. If you have the manual for your thermostat, keep it handy in case it has a unique set of operations.

, Track when you leave the house (or workplace) and are away regularly for at least 4 hours. Make notes about your schedule for 7 days, including all 24 hours each day.

, The current time and date must be entered into your programmable thermostat for it to function properly. Nearly all thermostats have a button that reads “set” or possibly even “day/time”Press this button and a clock will appear on the display for you to set the time and the date. Use the up and down arrows to set the items and press the same “set” or “day/time” button again after each step to proceed to the next.


Prompts will indicate whether to enter the time as a twelve-hour increment or as a twenty-four-hour figure.
You may also need to set the day of the week, but it will follow in the same process after the time and date., Once you have the date and time programmed, you are ready to program the thermostat’s schedule. Some brands will have an actual “program” button, whereas others may require you to scroll past the time and date information by hitting the “set” button several times.You will reach a screen on the display where it prompts you to set a “wake” time for weekday mornings.You may actually want to set the time very slightly before you wake up so that the system is already running.


Most thermostats will allow you to schedule weekdays and weekends separately, whereas some may allow you to schedule each day separately.
Again, you can use the up and down arrows to cycle through the time.

, With the “wake” time set, you will now have to set the “wake” temperature. Press the respective button for your model thermostat again and the temperature will begin blinking. Use the up and down arrows to find the temperature you want.Some models may allow you to set a temperature range so that you don’t have to reprogram the thermostat with each season. For example, it may prompt you to set both a wake summer and winter temperature. This will ensure that the system heats when the ambient temperature is below a certain threshold and cools when above another threshold., With the “wake” time and temperature set, the thermostat will prompt you to schedule the time you leave for the day during the week. Most people set these temperatures much higher during the summer or lower during the winter to conserve energy and run the system less while no one is home. Use the same process of hitting the “set” or “program” button and the up and down hours to cycle through and find the settings you want.


If you don’t want the system to run at all while you’re away, you can simply set it to turn on at a temperature that you know your home won’t reach.

, The next time and temperature setting the thermostat will request is for what time you return home during the week. As with the “wake” setting, you may want to set the time fifteen-to-thirty minutes before you get home if you want to ensure that the home has already reached the temperature when you arrive.

, The fourth and final weekday setting the thermostat will request is for the time you go to sleep at night.Since many people might open windows during summer nights or pile on extra blankets during the winter, you can save money and energy by respectively raising or lowering the overnight temperature setting.


Wherever you set this temperature will hold over until the “wake” time and temperature you have set for the following morning.

, Once you finish setting the weekday schedule, the thermostat will prompt you to set the same four times—wake, leave, return, and sleep—for the weekend. As with the other settings, keep using the “set” or “program” button in order to advance the menu and keep using the arrows to adjust the times and temperatures.

, Depending on your thermostat model, once you hit “set” or “program” on the final weekend “sleep” settings, it may return you to the current day, time, and temperature and begin following the schedule. Other models may have a “run” button that you must press to initiate the schedule."

Check your work.",How to Move a Radiator," Measure your radiator, and decide on a new location. Remember, you must account for the pipes, as well, so you should find a space where they have room to go under the floor or in the wall. Also, many times, radiators are placed in front of windows because they help warm up cold drafts coming in from outside.If you're unsure how much space you'll need, consult with the plumber who will do the piping work.
You can also look at the positioning of your old radiator system to get an idea of how much space pipes will take up.;
, If you can, extending the old pipes will be the easiest bet. If you can't do that, you'll have to think about how much space new pipes will take up in the new spot.Once again, it's best to consult with the plumber if you're unsure.

, This valve is the one you use to adjust the temperature. It's often on the bottom right of the radiator, where the radiator meets the pipes.Turn the valve off by rotating it clockwise until it stops.Use a dust cover if necessary. Some thermostatic valves don't have an off switch. You need a little cap to fit over them in place of the thermostatic device. You can find one at the hardware store if you don't have one., The lockshield valve will have a plastic cover on top, and it's often on the bottom left of the radiator. Take the cover off. Use a spanner/wrench to turn the valve clockwise, counting turns as you go. You count turns so that you can open the valve the same amount when you move the radiator somewhere else., Once you turn it off, let the radiator cool for a bit. You don't want the water in the heater to be too hot to work with., Open the bleed valve a little bit to see if water comes out. You will need a radiator key to turn it. If water leaks out, water is still going through the radiator. Make sure the valves are closed as much of possible. If they are, you'll need to drain the radiator., You'll need two plumber's wrenches. You are pulling the radiator up from its risers at the bottom. Have something to catch the water ready. Hold the manual control valve with one wrench, while you use the other to unscrew the nut that holds them together.Water will drain out as you loosen it, so be ready.Do the same with the other valve, the lockshield valve., Now you can move the radiator off the supports. However, be aware more water will drain. In addition, radiators can be very heavy, so have someone to help you if possible.You may also have to lift it off of wall brackets., Before moving the radiator, close the bleed valve. You don't want any random dirty water dripping across your home if any is left inside.Tilt the radiator to make sure you get all the water out, which will come out the other valves.Make sure to put something under the radiator, as it's likely not clean.In fact, it's best to turn it upside-down so you don't drip sludge on the floor., Unless you're extremely confident in home improvement, it's best to have a plumber do the next part. You need to have pipes put in the new position. They can be extended from the old position, or you can have new ones put in, which of course will be more expensive.

, Once again, radiators are very heavy. Many are made of cast iron. It's best to have a dolly and someone to help you move it where you want it to go.

, Go clockwise around the threads. Tear off any extra, and flatten down the end., In the new position, set your radiator into place. The valve lines need to line up with the valves on the radiator. Also, make sure you get it back on its wall brackets., Just as you loosened the nuts under the valves, it's now time to tighten them. Use a plumber's wrench to hold a valve, and turn the nut with another plumber's wrench until it's tightened., Turn the lockshield valve counter-clockwise. Remember to do it the same amount of turns to open it as you you used to close it before., Again, turn counter-clockwise. Doing so will open the valve, releasing water or steam into your radiator., Open the bleed valve momentarily to let out any trapped air. Once the radiator has filled up again, you can close the valve again., Make sure none of the valves are leaking. If the are, turn them off and tighten the nuts some more."

Find an air compressor that no longer works, and remove the motor/compressor assembly.,
Figure out how you want to configure your wood heater.,
Lay out a door opening on the side of the tank.,
Mark two vertical lines at 1/3 points of the tank's diameter (or the width of the end of the tank if horizontal).,Using a steel cutting wheel on a grinder or saw, cut one side you have marked for the door of your heater.,
Fasten hinges centered on the cut you have just made.,
Cut the remaining three sides of your door.,
Cut some 1/8 to 3/16 flat stock one inch wide to weld along the inside of the door opening.,
Drill a 5/16 inch hole through the edge of the door opposite the hinges near the center.,Keeping the pencil rod tight to the inside of the door surface, weld a 5/16 flat washer on both the inside and outside of the door to hold it in place.,
Weld two 1/2 inch steel bars cut to fit across the side of the tank about 3 inches below the bottom edge of the door.,
Cut a piece of heavy gauge steel expanded metal to lay on the bars welded in place in the previous step.,
Cut a hole in the top of the tank on the opposite side from the door for your flue.,
Weld or rivet the stove pipe to the flange at the flue hole you created at the top of your tank.,
Cut a three to four inch piece of pipe about 5 inches long for an air inlet/damper assembly underneath the fire grate below the door.,Weld the air inlet pipe/damper assembly to the tank, centered on the hole cut earlier.,
Attach legs/a base to the bottom of the tank to support it at the height you want.,
Install a section of stove pipe to the flue on top so that it has enough height to draft (draw smoke up through it).",How to Make a Wood Burning Heater from an Air Compressor Tank,"  This should leave you a steel tank with a few holes you will need to deal with later.
, Horizontal heaters can handle longer wood, but have a larger foot print, vertical ones take up much less space, and as mentioned, have a smaller fire box diameter/dimension., For a vertical heater, come up about 1/3 the tank's height, and make a level line (perpendicular to the tank sides). For a horizontal, on one end, make a level mark about 4 inches up from the tank's lower side.

Keep in mind that once you begin laying out your cut lines, you need to maintain an orientation so all cuts will be square/plumb/level in relationship to each other for a good fit and neat appearance.

, Then make a top mark, level again, for the top of the door.,, You can tap screws through the metal, or simply weld the hinges in place. Make sure the pins are aligned and the hinges seat flat to the side of the tank., Having installed the hinges prior to cutting the whole door out will insure the door is aligned properly., This will create a door stop, and also help seal the door opening so sparks/smoke will be less likely to escape., Then insert a 5/16 pencil rod (cold rolled steel rod) through the hole. It will be bent 90 degrees nearly flush with the inside face of the door, and have another 90 degree bend on the outside. This will act as the latch.,, These will be for the firewood to rest on as it burns, and will keep the wood above the ash settling on the tank bottom.,  This is optional, but will support small kindling wood when lighting your fire. This piece will just lay in place, since it must be removed to remove ash after your fire has died down., For simplicity, we will describe using a single-wall thin gauge flue pipe, available at hardware stores. Buy the stove pipe before cutting this hole and you can use it to scribe the exact diameter/location for the flue. Notch the metal near the edge of the hole, so these pieces can be bent upward to provide a surface to fasten the flue pipe to.,  This attachment needs to be tight, if the cut is sloppy, use fire caulk or chimney sealant around the seam to prevent sparks and smoke from escaping., Use it to scribe a matching hole which you will cut into the tank. Cut a round piece of sheet metal to fit inside the pipe, then drill a hole through the top and bottom of the pipe to fit a rod to fasten this damper to.,, Make sure the legs or base is secure and support the tank in a plumb/level position., You can now test fire the wood heater. Assume any paint still on the tank may emit toxic fumes, so test the stove out out doors where there is plenty of ventilation."

Use the proper amount of detergent.,
Regularly clean the combination filter.,
Check and clean spray arm jets to remove any soil that may have collected.,
Regularly clean rubber seals.,
Give your unit a bath.",How to Maintain Your MIELE Dishwasher," Miele dishwashers use 1/3 the amount of water used by most units so you don't need much detergent. For best results only use the manufacturer's dishwasher tabs. All other tabs should be avoided as they contain up to 3 times the amount needed. Due to the high concentration of detergent in GEL, DO NOT use more than 1 teaspoon per load. DO NOT USE GEL TABS. When using POWDER detergent DO NOT use more than 1.5 tablespoons (22.2 ml) per load.;
, Food particles, oils and detergent can coagulate to create a glue-like bond that will clog them. To clean, remove filters from the unit and rinse with warm water. If needed use a soft bristle toothbrush to gently rub off any remaining debris. This should be done at least once a month.

, Buildup of particles will diminish the spray arm's performance. To clean, remove the spray arm by unscrewing the locknut. Place it under warm running water. If needed, use a toothpick, paperclip (extended), or tweezers to remove lodged in particles.

, Soiled seals will deteriorate from left over detergent residue and develop odors from food particles. To clean the door seals wipe them off with a baking soda & water, or vinegar & water solution.

, Run a sanitize cycle at least once a month using distilled vinegar in an empty unit.(See Tips) The purpose of this “vinegar bath” is to breakdown detergent buildup.

Keep anything too hard out of the disposal.,
Do not put fibrous or starchy items in the disposal.,
All the above are easily composted - see the composting note and link below.

,
Avoid placing trash or hard items down the disposal.,
Cut large items into smaller pieces.,
Run cold water while the disposal is on.,
Clean it regularly.",How to Maintain a Garbage Disposal," The shredder will dull and become less efficient. Small hard objects can also get stuck and jam the rotating parts. Each garbage disposal has its own capacity for hard objects. The more expensive models of the same brand tend to have higher hardness capacities. The instruction manual usually specifies a list of objects to avoid. You can also gain experience with your own garbage disposal. Strong vegetable fibres can jam some garbage disposals, as well. If something may be harder than what the disposal handles, just put it in your trash can or think about setting up a worm composting bin. Some items to avoid are:


hard shells from shrimp, crabs and other shellfish
unpopped popcorn kernels
hard bones;
, Both can cause particularly stubborn drain blockages (fibers get tangled, and starches get thick). The following items should be put in the disposal in minimal increments, preferably cut into small pieces, or not at all:


banana peels
celery
potato peelings
corn husk or corn cobs
artichokes
coffee grounds (in quantity) or coffee filters
fruit pits and hard seeds from things like avocados or peaches
onion skins (unless you're especially careful to completely remove the thin membranes of each, which can wrap around the shredder ring)
egg shells should not be put in the disposal as they turn into a sand-like substance that clogs piping.

,, Common sense will go a long way, but here are some examples of items to avoid:


twist ties, pull tabs, rubber bands
glass, screws, nails,
utensils
cigarette butts or bottle caps, paper, plastic, or other trash
fabric, string, rags, or sponges
plant or flower clippings
children's toys
hair
grease

, If they are too large, like the skins of melons, cut them into smaller pieces and put them one at a time into the disposal instead of trying to shove a large amount in at once.


If you find yourself with a lot of larger pieces to cut up, it may be best to place them in the compost or trash instead.

, Keep disposer and water running for 30 to 60 seconds AFTER the waste matter has cleared your drain. The waste still has a distance to go. Cold water keeps the motor, bearings and shredder assembly from overheating. It also lets the waste go down easier because the water is pushing it down. Don't use hot water, because it can melt fat and allow it to re-solidify as a blockage further down in the drain.

,


With the disposal off, clean the inner side of the rubber in the center of the sink leading to the disposal. It gets very dirty, and gives off an odor when not cleaned. Just wipe it with a paper towel.
Throw some ice down once in a while. While ice will not sharpen the shredders (as is commonly believed) it does knock off any debris buildup on the sharp edges that keeps them from grinding food properly. For better results, make special ice cubes from pure lemon juice or vinegar, or alternate with biodegradable cleanser (label them in your freezer!) Cover and seal ice trays used in your freezer for cleanser, and do not reuse trays for food or drink after having been used for cleanser. While using the disposal, be sure to run cold water at the same time.
Dispose orange peels, or any citrus rinds, to freshen the disposal and keep it smelling clean, but cut them into slices first as large pieces of citrus peel, e.g. half a lime, can jam a disposal. You can also use pieces of citrus fruit that may be too old to consume, as long as they're not too spoiled to smell nice. You can freeze these pieces first, if you wish.

It pumps vapor refrigerant through the system and maintains the internal pressure of your home unit based on the temperature of it surroundings.;
, This is where the refrigerant goes once it leaves the compressor. The gas refrigerant enters as a high pressure, superheated gas. As the gas works its way through the Condenser it begins to cool. (It cools from air being blown over the outside of the lines. From a fan that forces air that is cooler over the hot lines that the gas is running through. As the gas cools it starts to transform back into a liquid. By the time the refrigerant is leaving the condenser. it should about 100% liquid.

, The next step of the refrigeration process where it passes through what is called a capillary tube, or a Thermostatic Expansion Valve (TXV). This device meters the amount of refrigerant going through the system, based on how much demand is placed on cooling or heating. Too much liquid, or too little liquid going through could result in damage to the system, or insufficient cooling or heating of the system. This is important because the liquid refrigerant leaving the Metering Device then goes to the Evaporator Coil.

, This is where the cooling inside the living area comes from. As the Liquid going through the Metering Device that we talked about in the last step enters it quickly undergoes a state of change back from a liquid to a gas. The transformation occurs from cool air being blown over the coils from the indoor unit. The air coming into contact with these coils cools the air as it passes through the system before being returned back into the area that is being cooled. The gas leaves the Evaporator as a low pressure, low temperature, and sub-cooled vapor. The vapor then returns back into the compressor to start the whole process over again.

Don’t measure the entire open space of the window, rather, measure from the first inner lip on the interior frame of the window.
Do this to ensure that your built box overlaps the window frame, rather than falls through it.
This flush (even edges) construction also makes sure that the window remains weather-sealed.
Make sure your measurements account for any abutting vinyl ridges or channels within the window frame.;
, Prior to using any power saws, ensure that your measurements are exact and that you are safe from any debris or wood chips.


If your measurements are not exact, your entire box will be a waste of effort.
Follow the old adage: measure twice, cut once.
Mark your measurements on your plank of wood, drawing out lines that indicate the height and width of your backplate.

, Following the lines you marked, use your saw to cut your plank of wood down to a size that will fit perfectly in your window.


Choose a track saw to ensure your line is as clean and straight as possible.
If you do not have a track saw available, you can use a regular circular saw.
Be aware that using a circular saw will be more difficult and result in a more uneven cut.
Save the excess wood, because it is the same length as your backplate and can be used later.
Wear safety goggles to protect your eyes from any flying wood particles.

, Measure the width and the height of the air conditioning unit to know how large of a hole you will need to cut in the backplate.


Measure the width at its widest consistent point, not where the sides of the unit begin to curve in towards its face.
Take any pieces jutting off of the unit into consideration to provide enough clearance.
This will make sure the unit can pass through the opening of the box you will create.
Take measurements of the flanges on the bottom and top, because your wood panels will need to incorporate two indented portions to accommodate the flanges and secure them in place.
Pencil these measurement marks onto your backplate with a carpenter's square and straightedge to make sure you have lines to follow when cutting.

, Using the measurements you took from your AC unit and the widths of your boards, find the proper cutting dimensions for your wood.


For example leave 3-1/4 inches at the top to catch the window and clear the flange, 11-3/8 for the height of the unit, and then 1-1/2 at the bottom for the lip. This makes a total of 16-1/8 inches for the weight of the cut hole.
Add a little to ensure clearance, bumping up the cutting measurement to 16-1/2.
Mark your wood with a pencil at 16-1/2 on both sides of the wood to align the track for the saw.

, Trace the lines where you will cut, along the straight edge, to ensure that you will cut at the proper places.


Make sure your measurements are accurate, using a straight edge and carpenter’s square to align the measurements on both sides of the wood.
If you ever realize that you made a mistake in the measurements, be sure to erase your old lines to avoid following them with the saw.

, Drilling holes in the corners of where you want to cut out the center of your backplate allows the jigsaw blade to get started without cutting in from the side.


You can’t cut in from the side, because that would cut an entire piece off of the wood that you need.

, Insert your jigsaw into the first pilot hole and follow your traced line to cut out the box from your backplate.


Hold the jigsaw steady to ensure a clean line.
Jigsaws have a tendency to “walk”, meaning they can start moving in other directions if you aren’t careful.
If you have a track saw, use that for a cleaner, more stable cut.

, To determine whether or not you need to make measurement adjustments, put your backplate over your AC unit and see if it bumps anything.


If anything sticks, or if the AC unit doesn’t fit at all, you know you need to cut a bit more from the backplate's interior edges.

, The horizontal window catch is a narrow strip of wood that will abut the lower edge of the window's sliding portion, to lock the box in place.


Use your carpenter’s square and straightedge to measure out a strip that will be attached the backplate to provide a ridge accommodating the flange on the top of the AC unit.
If you have a table saw, set it to a fenced 1-1/2 inches and cut the strip.
Then, use a miter saw to cut the strip down to the length of your frame.
This strip will be sandwiched between the backplate of your box and the vertical window catch, to provide an area for the window to lodge in.

, Using the previously drawn line that represents the flange, align the strip you just cut with its proper location on the backplate.


Make sure the strip you cut for the flange and the box’s backplate are even.
Clamp the strip to the backplate to ensure easy attachment.
On the backplate's edges, mark the location where the screws will go.
Use a countersink bit to create a clean pilot hole for the screws and add a taper to let head of the screws fit flush against the wood.
Once you’ve drilled the pilot holes, drive screws into the wood to attach the strip to the backplate.

, The vertical window catch will ensure that the box cannot simply fall backwards and out of the window.


Cut a piece of wood, equal in length to the horizontal window catch, but wider, to act as the back of the channel.
Drill pilot holes through the vertical window catch, to the horizontal window catch you just attached.
Space the pilot holes roughly every 6 inches (15.2 cm), and leave an inch or so at the end to provide clearance space.
Look on the opposite side to make sure you won’t hit any of your other screws.
Use screws to attach the vertical window catch to the horizontal window catch.

, These pieces will make sure that that the bottom of the box fits snugly and securely in the bottom of the window.


Measure and cut a piece of wood that will act as a gap bridger (spacer), between the backplate and the sash filler.

This piece should provide just enough clearance for the sash filler to lock into the bottom channel of the window.


Then measure and cut a sash filler (a small piece) that will hook inside the bottom plastic lip of the windowsill.
Use your track saw for a clean cut.
Make sure the piece of wood is thick enough to catch the lip or nub on the inside of the bottom of the windowsill.

, Use screws to attach this pieces to the bottom.


Attach the gap bridger directly to the bottom of the backplate, and then attach the sash filler on top of that.
Make sure that the screws have at least a half-inch of bite, which will ensure that they stick properly.
Now, your box should be complete.

, When placing the box into your window, make sure that it fits flush and does not wiggle or fall out.


Remove the screen before placing your box into the window frame.
The sash filler you built into the bottom your box should accommodate the ridges of the windowsill, fitting together like two pieces of a puzzle.
The catch on the top of your box (created by the vertical and horizontal window catches) should provide a snug place for the bottom edge of the window to slide down into.

, If the box fits well in the window, you can now secure your AC unit to the box.


On the top flange of the AC unit, there should be a single hole meant for one screw.
This is usually used to attach the AC unit to the window frame, but in this case you should put a screw through the hole into your box.

, Using a putty knife, smooth some Spackle over the screw holes to make them look natural and flush.


Make the holes smooth with a putty knife.
Let it dry.
Sand it down to make it smooth.

, Fill the edges with caulking to provide a seal against drafts and to keep your cold air in your house.


Caulking the edges makes sure that the AC unit does not leak air.
Make sure you want to keep the AC in the box before you caulk, because this can make it a semi-permanent fixture.

, Priming and painting the box will make sure that it can withstand the test of time.


Let the primer dry for an hour if there is low air humidity.
This will make sure that rain and humidity do not rot your wood box.

, It should be located close to your AC compressor. This feeds the unit the voltage necessary for it to run. Often you will see a cable running from this breaker box directly to the AC compressor.

, There is a latch on the box (either on the side or bottom) that unlocks it. Once the door is in the open position, push it in slightly and it should lock in place.

, Set the breaker aside in a safe place.

,, Use the appropriate bit with a bit driver to remove the screws. Typically there are four 5/16"" hex screws that attach the side panel to the rest of the unit. Place the screws in a secure location so as not to lose any.

, It will have a cylindrical, canister-like shape. It will have three terminals on top. There will be colored wires coming from the AC Unit to some if not all of the terminals on the capacitor.

, The top of the run capacitor should be perfectly flat. If you see that the top side is bulging upwards in any way, it needs to be replaced. If this is not the case, a faulty capacitor may not be the source of the issue. You may need to contact your local HVAC professional.





, The three terminals on the capacitor are labeled HERM, FAN, and C. Take a picture with your smart phone to record how everything is installed to make sure the new capacitor is connected in the same way. Jotting down these details on a piece of paper will also work.





, Inspect your insulated flat-head screwdriver. A properly insulated screw driver should have a entirely rubber handle. Ensure the handle has no exposed metal parts or cracks., To do this you are going to create a bridge between the C terminal and the HERM/FAN terminals, one at a time, using the metal part of the screwdriver. Ensure you are not touching anything metal. With the metal part of the screwdriver, touch a metal prong on the C terminal AND another from the HERM terminal at the same time, creating a bridge between the two. This may produce a shock. Do this two more times to ensure the terminals were completely discharged. Do the same to the C and FAN terminals.





, Use the appropriate bit and the bit driver to remove the screws. These are typically two 1/4"" hex screws but this may vary. Set the screws and the bracket in a secure location.

, To be safe, always treat the capacitor terminals as live terminals. Remove the old capacitor., They can be purchased at your local HVAC Supply Store or they can also be purchased online through Amazon, eBay, etc... The simplest way to make sure you buy the correct one is to order the same model number from the same manufacturer. There are occasions where another brand might be more affordable.

, Remove the filter to expose the cooling coils. Additionally, some models require that the front cover or bezel be removed to allow full access to the coil. Usually the cover is secured by screws - some of which become visible only when the filter is removed.

, Home Depot and many other home supply centers and hardware stores sell products expressly for this particular job. These cleaners will help remove odors from deposits of dirt, mold, mildew, cigar & cigarette smoke, etc. from the coils. Use care to see that only the coils are covered with the cleaner. Prevent foam from spraying electrical wires, controls or other parts. Foaming type cleaners will work best only when used as directed.

, Clean the filter with plain water or replace if missing. A clean filter is a must. It is far easier and cheaper to remove and clean the filter every 15 hours (more or less depending of dust / dirt levels in the space) than to clean the air conditioner with a foaming cleanser. If the filter is suspected of contributing to odors, soak and wash with a small amount of scented dish soap or laundry detergent.

,, Set the unit to ""Cool"" and adjust the thermostat to coldest setting. Warm, humid air in will condense when passing over the cold coils. The condensate will rinse the dirt and foam from the coils, and collect in the drip pan. The drip pan will drain outside - but only if the air conditioner is installed properly (back tilted slightly downward to the ground).

, If the air-conditioner has been neglected, it may require a second application to produce cold air and be free of odors. Wait until the coils are free from foam before re-applying. If the unit makes cool air but fails to make condensate to wash the coils, it may be due to low of humidity. In low humidity conditions, it will take longer to rinse the coils. If the unit fails to make cool air, it has likely lost the refrigerant charge or the compressor has failed.

,,, The outside coils are exposed to rainwater and may not need cleaning. If unsure, or in a dusty or dirty area, it may help to clean them. Apply foaming cleaner with the unit off. Allow 10 - 15 minutes for the foaming cleanser to work., Since no condensate is formed on the outdoor coil when the unit is run, it will need to be rinsed manually. Do not force a direct a stream of water into the coils, but merely allow the foam to float away as the water is allowed to flow over the coils., Set to cooling and adjust thermostat to a low temperature. The discharge air should be cold and smell clean. If not, it is probably time for service or replacement.

If you're interested, buy some quality heat-blocking shades for the windows. Wood shades or thicker, light-colored drapes will do the trick. They may not look very good, so add a curtain on top of the shades to cover them up if desired.;
, If you're still rocking old school, high-wattage light bulbs, you've probably noticed how easily they heat up. And while it may seem insignificant, their power really does add up, especially if you have several. Turn them off and keep them off as much as possible.


Desperately need lights? Look into energy-saving, dimmer bulbs that don't give off as much heat (and are better for the environment). LED lights are getting cheaper and cheaper, too., Opening upstairs cold air supply registers fully and all but closing downstairs air supply registers helps direct the cold air upstairs. You are literally rerouting the circulation of the air pushed out through your air conditioner.


Be careful not to fully close all downstairs air supply registers. Enough air must go through the air conditioner in order to work efficiently.

, Rearrange furniture so that air supply registers are fully uncovered. Also remove blockages from air returns in all rooms. This ensures that good air circulation occurs in the upper floor.


Take these items and move them to open walls. By placing things like bookshelves or tapestries against the walls, you can help keep cool from escaping.

, Floor fans help circulate air in a room, especially if placed well. They help prevent the cold air from settling near the floor of the upstairs rooms, whisking it up in an airy cycle. Place it in the corner where it can move the air across the room via an unobstructed path (tidy up a bit if need be). Then it can mix all the air, lowering the temperature.


If you're in a spot, put a bowl of ice cubes in front of the fan and then let it blow.Immediate arctic wind, ready for deliver.

, With fewer objects in the room, air is allowed to flow, not get stale and stagnant, and get cooler. Tidy up the room, getting as much surface area in the open as possible. And now you can place your fan in the best possible place in the room, circulating the air around and around. A clear space can feel several degrees cooler.

, Attics need R30 insulation (at least) to keep heat out in summer and heat indoors in winter. In the long run, you can save money in both seasons by insulating your attic. Just make sure you get the right insulation; if it is not rated high enough or not thick enough it can allow the summer heat down into the house.


If you have an attic, buy half inch plywood and lay it in between the trusses over the insulation. It will give you a walking/storage surface as well as enhancing your ability to block heat transfer. Insulation alone doesn't stop the heat from going into your house; it only delays the transfer until the attic cools at night when the heat flow slows down.

, Leaking windows and single pane glass let cold out and heat in. Consider Low E glass for window replacements and double or even triple-paned windows.. This will keep you cooler in summer by not letting the cold air warm up and warmer in the summer by not letting the hot air ""leak"" out.


If there are any cracks or space between the windows and the walls, that's hot and cool air escaping like sands through an hourglass. Even if you don't upgrade your glass, make sure to cover any structural spots that need taken care of.

, There are a number of things you can do to your house that can keep it cool. Consider painting walls white or another really light color as light doesn't absorb a lot of heat like darker colors do. This goes for your roof, too – though a white roof may seem a little less than fashionable.


You could also consider adding awnings or even extending the roof line so that the sun, in the summer, is blocked by the roof and is prevented from entering the windows.

, If the air conditioner is big enough to cool the whole house then air circulation is most likely the trouble. Hot air rises and cold air sinks. By replacing the register covers with register/fan units more cold air is forced out of the upstairs ducts. These units can be purchased at large hardware stores or home-centers.


Try adding a couple of ceiling fans in the upstairs rooms or over a large open 2 story room such as a loft. Many fans have a switch that controls how it works – one blows air down and the other sucks air up. You want the fan to suck the cold air up and spread it over the house again.

, Blocked filters prevent cold air circulation. Replace filters at least every three months to keep them working at 100%. Go into your basement and you'll find the filter on the bottom of the filter casing. Make sure the new filter you bought fits your HVAC unit.


You can do this yourself. All you need to do is take out the old filter and place in the new one, making sure the arrows on the sides are pointing in the right direction (they're to indicate airflow. It's a job that takes a whole 30 seconds., Rinse the outside unit with a garden hose (gently) to remove dirt from the coils. Remove leaves and debris from inside the fan area. The unit MUST be off to do this. It's possible gunk and grime is keeping your air conditioner from running at full potential.

, A hot attic makes for a hot upstairs. Add a ridge vent or power vents if needed to bring down the attic temperature. If you're not sure how they're operating, don't hesitate to call in a professional.


Soffit vents aren't only for your comfort; they're to lengthen the lifespan of your roof. So will it could be an expense now, it could save you thousands in the long run (a roof that constantly overheats is not a long-lasting roof)., The air conditioner may leak small amounts of refrigerant over time. A heating and cooling contractor can check and refill the air conditioner, if needed, to maximize cooling.


If you're quite handy, you can do this yourself. Take a look at wikiHow's Charge a Home Air Conditioner for more information.

, Many heating and cooling contractors will do a survey and make recommendations for a small fee. Always get more than one opinion and work with reputable professionals that have references. Check the Better Business Bureau (US) before working with anyone as this can be an expensive endeavor that you want to get done right.


Air conditioners should be placed close to the ceiling as cold air sinks and hot air rises. It needs to be placed in a well ventilated place to ensure maximum results – if this does not describe your air conditioner, consider getting it moved for more efficient results.

Have Your Unit Serviced Regularly.,
Perform Regular Maintenance.,
Check the ducts for air leaks at least twice a year.,
Check the external unit at least once a month.,
Use high quality air filters.,
Dust and clean your vents and ducts regularly.,
Know what to do when Preventative Maintenance Fails.,
You want to be sure that the air conditioning service company that you choose is licensed and insured.,
Read customer reviews for the company you are considering!,
Compare costs.",How to Keep Your AC Running Strong,"


One of the best things you can do to ensure that your air conditioner remains functional is to have the unit serviced on a regular basis. Regular service is important, because it will keep the unit performing optimally. Also, service and repair should always be performed by a licensed technician. Performing maintenance on your own could lead to more severe problems, and could void any existing warranties on the unit. 
Having a professional service your air conditioning unit regularly is also one of the best ways to prevent issues from arising. A technician will be able to diagnose any existing issues with the unit before they become serious. Furthermore, a technician will be able to assist in maximizing the efficiency of your air conditioning unit, and greater efficiency will lead to lower energy expenses.;
,


Most people know that they need to change the air filter on their air conditioner regularly. However, people are less aware of other regular maintenance that can help prevent needing a technician. Here are a few basic maintenance tasks that can help prevent the need for more professional help:

, Frequently check your attic. You want to make sure that wildlife is not setting up shop in your vents. Also, you will want to be sure that no personal items are interfering with air flow.

, You want to be sure that the elements are not interfering with performance. Make sure that your unit is clear of any unwanted plant growth. Also, make sure the unit is clear of ant hills. Ants can cause issues with the unit, and should be taken care of immediately.

, A top of the line air filter will produce greater air quality, and will also help to increase the efficiency of your unit.

, Dirty vents and ducts can cause poor air flow, and could lead to potential health risks. You will want to be sure that there is no moss and/or fungi growing in your vents and ducts.

,


Sometimes regular maintenance is not enough. As with anything mechanical, parts wear out over time. Once professional assistance is needed, the best thing you can do is to call a Mobile, Alabama air conditioning repair company. Once again, performing serious repair and maintenance on your own is not advisable. Attempting to perform serious repair without the assistance of a professional could cause serious damage to the unit, or even yourself.
While it may be tempting to call the first company you can find for air conditioning maintenance and repair, there are a few things you will want to consider. Here are some tips for finding the right air conditioning service company for your needs:

, This will help to ensure that you are receiving professional assistance and quality work. Also, professional air conditioning service companies often provide warranties for their work. A warranty from a professional can help prevent costly expenditures on future repairs.

, Customer reviews are often the most overlooked, but most beneficial resource when selecting a company or product. Reviews are not advertising, and when trying to make the best selection, it is often times wiser to trust an existing customer as opposed to a salesman. However, be sure to investigate multiple reviews before making your decision.

, Find out if a company charges hourly for service and repair, or if they charge a flat rate. Also, ask if the company performs estimates. A company may not be able to give you an exact price, but an estimate will help you to prepare for the cost of moving forward with your repair.

Before installing the pump, let the air conditioner run a few cycles so that some condensate collects and to remove any oils that are left in the system. 
,Make sure that all of the packaging is removed from the pump, and that all venting slots are clear from debris.,
Set up the electrical connections.,
Check the local codes to make sure you are hooking up your wires correctly. ,
Hook up the power cord to the specified voltage. ,Make sure it is connected to a constant power source.,
Check the pump for a safety switch and wire it accordingly.,



 

Connect the pump to the wall by using screws.,
Make sure that the pump is close to the air conditioning unit, installed below the coil drain, and that the pump unit is level.,
Use some sort of flexible tubing, if possible, as the drain pipe for the pump.,
Once the pump has been installed, turn the power back on and run the a/c unit.",How to Install a Condensate Pump,",,  It is always important to make sure that you turn then power off at the fuse box before installing any electrical components of appliances. ,,,,  After all of the electrical is done, move to the next step.,  The pump should have slots built onto the unit that will allow it to be mounted.  ,  If the pump isn’t level, it will not function properly.  It is also important to make sure that the unit will not spray or splash when it is running.  Once the pump is mounted correctly, you are ready to pipe the unit.,  This pipe should be installed so that gravity will do the work when the pump is draining the system.  The inlet pipe should be on an angle where it enters the tank and should not interfere with the operation of the float valve that the pump uses.

  It may also be a good idea to install a check valve somewhere on the discharge line to avoid backflow of the discharge water so it can’t be sucked back into the a/c unit.  The discharge line should run into a line that goes to the city’s waste, once again to avoid contamination of fresh water.

,  Watch the pump and make sure that it is working correctly.  Ensure that the electrical units are working correctly without sparking and that the piping is not leaking in any area."

Plan to keep the bottom of the unit 1 to 5 feet (30 to 150 cm) from the floor to minimize dust from the floor clogging the filter, and condensation forming on the ceiling.;
, Use a stud finder, visually inspect baseboards for nail heads, or rap on the walls with your knuckles—you can hear the sound change from hollow to solid as you rap over a stud. (Commonly, studs are 16 inches apart in the U.S.)


Lightly indicate with pencil on the wall where these studs lie.






Roughly indicate the layout of the AC unit on the wall, in such a way that the number of studs to be removed are minimized.







, Remove any molding above and below the intended opening location.


Remove the drywall between those studs indicated from the floor to the ceiling first by scoring the wall with a razor blade (utility knife) along the inside of the studs.






With a hammer or gloved fist, knock out just enough drywall to locate any wires or other obstructions that could be damaged with a saw.






Use of a utility knife works surprisingly well on drywall, and will result in the least amount of dust and risk of damaging wires and pipes in the wall space. To use the knife, repeatedly score the wall top to bottom. You do not need to completely penetrate through the drywall—just get through 1/2 to 3/4 of the thickness. A sharp hit on the wall with a gloved fist will break the drywall along the scored line.






Alternately, you can saw out the drywall by cutting as close as possible to the side of the studs. Use of hand saws made for drywall will minimize dust. If using a Sawzall or similar, a helper with a vacuum following your cutting path will reduce dust considerably.






Remove the insulation.






Remove the center stud(s) if needed to accommodate the AC unit.







,


Set the placement of the exhaust opening so that the top will fall just under the edge of a full clapboard, shingle, or other siding section—wherever it will be most aesthetically pleasing (or rather, least aesthetically displeasing).

, Mark the outside opening using a template if provided by the AC manufacturer, or draw one in.


If you draw your own template, use a framing square and level to ensure that your opening is level and square.
Add 1/4 inch to the height of the opening. This additional 1/4 inch will allow the unit to be angled slightly downward on the outside to prevent condensation and rainwater from collecting in the unit and leaking inside the house. If you have a specific point for the top of the opening, add this 1/4 inch to the bottom for the new line to cut.
Carefully create the opening by cutting along the lines with a Sawzall.

, Cut a stud to fit against the two studs that make the sides of the opening created for the AC unit.


Level and install at the bottom edge of the AC unit location.
Cut a board to fit between the wall stud on the floor in the wall space and the bottom AC support installed in the previous step.
Screw or nail these studs to the existing studs. There should be three (possibly four if the unit is very large) new vertical studs in the space below the unit; all of which run from the bottom to the underside of the horizontal support; one in the middle, one against the existing left stud and one against the existing right stud.

, It will be the top of the framework for the opening.

Cut two (2 x 4 construction) or three (2 x 6 construction) pieces of the same length from a 2-by. Cut one or two (again, 1 for 2x4 or 2 for 2x6 construction) strips of 1/2"" plywood the same size as the 2-bys.






Place the plywood strips between the 2-bys and nail or screw together. The completed header thickness should be very close to 3-1/2 or 5-1/2 inches (for 2x4 or 2x6 construction, respectively).






Cut two 2-bys equal to the opening height. Secure them against the existing studs in the space for the unit, by resting on the bottom horizontal support previously installed and nail or screw in place.






Rest the header on top of the vertical supports installed in the previous step.






Secure the header by nailing or screwing in place.







, Cut a 2-by to fit between the header and the top plate (the 2-by that the left- and right-most studs are secured to at the top) plus 1/8 inch at the left-most stud and nail or screw into place.


Hammer these studs into position.
Repeat for the right-most stud and for at least as many vertical studs installed in previous steps below the unit, in the space above the new header. If one stud was cut and installed in the middle of the wall space for the bottom support of the unit, then at least one (but more would be better) will be required above the opening as well. These studs above the header should fit tightly. If not a tight fit, cracks may develop on the wall surface as the weight settles on the new framework in the wall.

, Cut two 2-bys equal to the height of the opening. Making this cut a little long (1/16 inch or so) will help ensure settling will not reduce the opening and minimize any movement. Hammer these 2-bys along the left and right side of the opening. Nail or screw in place.

,


If the unit is high on the wall, consider installing an appropriately rated switch at this time for the outlet, as this will make powering the unit on and off easier. It will also reduce the chance of damage during electrical storms if set to off.

,

Reinstall the insulation.






Install the drywall.






Tape, mud (joint compound) and sand when dry.






Paint wall and reinstall all molding.







, Remove unit front cover and screws that hold the unit inside its case.


Pull the unit forward while an assistant holds the case, until it is fully withdrawn.
Install the case or sleeve into the opening. Allow several inches of the case or sleeve to protrude from the wall into the room.
Measure the amount of protrusion at one of the top corners, and start a screw through the sleeve or case close to this corner into the framework to keep it from moving.
Move the case or sleeve in or out so that the other top corner has the same amount of protrusion. Start a screw through the sleeve or case close to this corner into the framework to keep it from moving.
Repeat this procedure for the bottom corners, but remember to have the protrusion here 1/4 to 1/2 inch greater than measured at the top. This creates a position for the case or sleeve that is tipped downward to the outside and will minimize the chance for condensation and rainwater from collecting and leaking inside.
Once the case or sleeve has been tacked into position, firmly secure it by driving at least two screws into each of the four sides.

,


Caulk around the inside and outside of the unit by running a generous bead between the unit and the surrounding surface. Extra time spent here will ensure a seal that will help keep water out. Do not scrimp—use a high quality 30-year (or more) caulk rated for use outdoors. Make sure it is paintable.

, Add trim around the unit inside by cutting appropriate length boards at a 45-degree. Secure with finish nails. Set and fill nail heads and paint.

Read the instructions that came with your portable air conditioner carefully.,
Choose a location for your portable air conditioner.,
Determine if the window adapter kit will work with your window.,
Connect the exhaust hose that came with the portable air conditioner to the air conditioning unit.,
Secure the exhaust hose window connection in place.,
Plug in your air conditioner.",How to Install a Portable Air Conditioner1," Save these instructions and any associated warranty information for future use.;
,


Place the air conditioner near both a window and an electrical outlet.
Ensure that the air conditioner will not be a tripping hazard, and that the airflow will not be obstructed by furniture, plants, etc.

, Almost all portable air conditioners come with a window adaptor kit that will work, however in some cases the kit is missing or not right for the window, and you will have to improvise a bit.


For the unit to function well, the gaps between the window adapter for the vent hose and the sides of the window must be sealed off.
Measure your window opening to determine if the window adapter kit can be expanded or trimmed to fit correctly.
If the window adapter kit that came with your portable unit is missing or does not adequately fit your window, take careful measurements of the opening you need to accommodate and have a piece of Plexiglas cut to size at your local hardware store.
You can also use a piece of plywood, or even cardboard, to fill the gap. These options are less attractive, but will work in a pinch.

, This may be a single hose with connectors already attached, or you may have to first attach an exhaust connector to the unit, and then attach the hose to the connector. Follow the directions that came with your unit.


Connect the window connection bracket or adapter to the other end of the exhaust hose, if it is not already attached.
Run the exhaust hose to the window, and place the window connection bracket or adapter into the open window.

, Adjust the included window kit sliders or panels until they completely fill the gap between the window connection bracket and the sides of the window.


If you are using a piece of Plexiglas, simply slide it in the windowsill next to (or above) the exhaust hose window connection, and hold it in place until the window is closed.
Close the window so that it fits snugly against the exhaust hose window connection, and holds everything firmly in place.
In some cases, it may be necessary to use duct tape to seal the gaps around the exhaust hose window connection, and hold the window kit firmly in place.

, It should now be ready to use!

Have yearly professional service.,
Keep the area around your air conditioner clean.,
Keep the doors and windows closed when the AC is on.,
Change the filters.",How to Keep an Air Conditioner Running Smoothly," Having a professional HVAC technician come to your home and inspect your air conditioner is important. They will make sure that all the parts to your air conditioner are working correctly and that there are no faulty parts. They can also check your thermostat to make sure that your air conditioner does not turn on at odd hours. The air ducts are also checked to make sure that there is no blockage in the air ducts that is preventing cool air from getting to parts of your home.

Oftentimes the people who installed your air conditioner are qualified to do this.;
, Your AC unit pulls air into it to cool your home off. If you have a unit that sits on the ground, there is a higher likely hood that it will pull dirt and debris into the unit. This can cause damage to the parts inside of your air conditioner. Make sure that you clear the area around it about once a month. If you have a unit that sits on your roof, this is not as much of a worry for you., This may seem like common sense, but a surprising number of people will open doors and windows even when their AC is on. Having doors and windows open means that you are letting all of the hot air inside your home, which heats it up. This will cost you money because your air conditioner will turn on more often. It can also cause wear on the parts, which may eventually create the need for a replacement AC. So keep those doors and windows closed., Make sure that you change the filter inside your home about once a month or so. These filters collect dirt and debris and prevent them from coming into your home. If you do not change them, the dirt can get backed up and either go into your home or into your air conditioner. Prevent any damage from occurring and change your filters."

However, you will probably need to buy a piece of Plexiglas to fill the gap between the exhaust hose and the top of the door. It will also make using the door very inconvenient.

,


In office environments where outside windows are not present or accessible, portable air conditioners can be vented through a drop ceiling. Commercial ceiling vent kits can be purchased online or from your local HVAC retailer.
There are a number of potential risks and inefficiencies involved with this procedure, so be sure to check with your building's maintenance personnel before proceeding.
It is also possible to vent a portable air conditioner into an attic, however to avoid property damage or inadvertently heating up other parts of the house, it is advisable to get professional advice from an HVAC specialist before proceeding.

, If a window is not available, and a long term installation is desired, a licensed contractor can cut a hole through an exterior wall and install an exhaust port for your portable air conditioning unit.

, In homes that have chimneys, it is possible to vent a portable air conditioner through a fireplace.


Use the supplied window adapter kit, or custom-cut Plexiglas to fill in the gaps around the exhaust hose and the fireplace opening.
Make sure that your chimney is clean and not obstructed by soot, and that the flue is open. "

Determine if you can clean your filter.,
Turn the air conditioner off.,
Access your filter.",How to Clean the Filter on Your Air Conditioner1," Some air conditioners have filters that can be cleaned. But other types of air conditioners have filters that are meant to be disposed of after a given amount of time. Consult your air conditioner’s instruction manual to determine whether cleaning your air conditioner’s filter is an option., You should never clean your air conditioner’s filter with the air conditioner on. This will cause a rush of unfiltered air into your residence and cause your air conditioner’s evaporator coils and other internal parts to collect dirt and particulate matter.Do not use your air conditioner until you’ve replaced the filter.

, On large central air conditioning units, you should be able to locate your filter by looking along the return duct’s length. You might need to unscrew a few screws to access it. In small window-mounted air conditioning units, you’ll have to pop the front face of air conditioner off with a putty knife.In wall-mounted air conditioners, you might have to slide the front panel off in order to access the filter.Consult manufacturer directions for more information on how to access your air conditioner’s filter.

Use a vacuum cleaner for routine cleaning.,
Rinse the filter for a deeper clean.,
Hose your filter down.,
Use the automatic cleaning function.",How to Clean the Filter on Your Air Conditioner2," Just pop the filter out or unclip it (depending on the make and model of your air conditioner) and use the tube extension on your vacuum cleaner to suck all the grit and dust out of the filter. Replace the filter when you’ve finished cleaning it.If you’ve taken good care of your air conditioner’s filter, you might not see a visible change in the filter when cleaning it. Rest assured, it is getting clean.
On the other hand, you might not be able to get all the dust and grit out of the filter. Just use the vacuum to suck up as much as you can.This method is best for giving your filter its regular cleaning.

, If, after you’ve vacuumed your filter, it still has a good deal of particulate attached, try washing it. To get started, remove your air conditioner filter. Mix one part vinegar and one part water. For instance, you might mix five cups of water and five cups of vinegar. Pour the mixture in a tub or a wide sink that can accommodate your filter.


Submerge your filter in the mixture for at least one hour. If it is exceptionally grimy, leave it in for two hours or more.
Drain the water and vinegar solution and dry the filter on a rack. Replace it when dry.
Instead of water and vinegar, you could mix a small amount of detergent or liquid dish soap into a volume of water that will cover your filter when it is submerged., If the weather is nice and your filter is too large to fit in your sink, take your filter outside and lean it against a wall. Spray your hose on the filter. Do not use a pressurized hose nozzle or you might risk tearing or damaging the flimsy filter.You could also hose your filter down in your shower. Just prop the filter up in your shower and, using your shower’s detachable shower head, spray the filter’s entire surface, front and back, in a zig-zag motion.
After hosing your filter down, allow it to dry, then replace it.
For added effect, you could sprinkle a few spoonfuls of baking soda over your filter before spraying it down.

, Some modern air conditioners might be equipped with a function that cleans the air filter for you. These air conditioners use an internal cassette and brush device to remove particles from the filter, then deposits the dust and particles in a small chamber from which they are blown outside. If your air conditioner has such a feature, set it to clean your filter regularly."
"
Clean your filter regularly.,
Discard your filter if necessary.,
Clean the condenser coils.",How to Clean the Filter on Your Air Conditioner3," Different air conditioners have different filter cleaning requirements. Some filters need to be cleaned once every two weeks.Some manufacturers recommend cleaning just once every 30 days.Still others require cleaning only one to four times per year.Consult your manufacturer’s directions for information about how often you should clean your filter.
You should clean your filter more frequently if you have pets or allergies, or if you’re using your air conditioner regularly.

, Despite your careful and regular cleaning, your filter will eventually wear out. If you notice and tears, holes, or damage to your filter, replace it with a new one.You can buy an air conditioner filter at your local home appliances store or online.

, Cleaning the condenser coils can make your air conditioner more efficient and improve its lifetime. If you have a window-mounted air conditioner, you’ll need to blow compressed air in short bursts at the back end of the unit (the part of the air conditioner that sticks out the window).Alternately, use a soft-bristled brush to scrub between the grating of the air conditioner’s intake. Be careful not to bend any of the coil fins.
If you want to clean the condenser coils of your large central air conditioner unit outside, remove its outer case, then blow compressed air across its surface in short bursts. You could also choose to use an industrial-strength vacuum fitted with a soft-bristle brush attachment to suck the grime and dirt from where it has collected between the coils."

, Each has fans, electrical relays and various connections. Both might be in the same unit as in a window unit.The evaporator is inside the building to intake air and exchange the heat in that air to the cooled evaporator coils -- and they in turn cooling the air to be recirculated into the conditioned air space. This part called the ""cooling unit"" can seen inside the building (indoors part of a window A/C unit, for example).






The condenser is outside to disperse collected heat into the exterior air. That is the ""radiator"" like coils that are on the outdoors (back, of a window unit, for example). This may be a standalone box-like fixture with the compressor, louvers and grill like vents -- and its job is sending chilled water or compressed refrigerant (such as freon) to the evaporator through tubing or pipes (some systems use highly toxic ammonia as refrigerant, instead of safer freon).







, It is usually located in a convenient place, easily accessed (in a wall, mechanical room door or a ceiling for example). This maintenance is crucial, because when the filter is clogged the system becomes inefficient. If a system were ever operated with a torn, ill-fitted or missing filter -- the evaporator could become clogged with dust and fungi, and ducting could become dirty and all require extensive cleaning.

, The thermostat is the control inside the house that allows you to make a setting for ambient temperature (air temp) and select the air flow option inside your home. If this is broken, controlling the air temperature becomes impossible. This may mean that your air conditioner stops running entirely, it runs continually, or it works in rough starts and stops. Either way, it can end up costing you a lot of money, which is why it gets fixed so often.

, Refrigerant is a compressed gas that cools down the air by being pump through your A/C condenser and evaporator. There is supposed to be a certain amount of refrigerant inside your air conditioner at all times. When it gets low, your air does not get cooled down quite as much as it should.

, There is usually a pipe connected to your air conditioning evaporator unit that drains all of the condensation water that builds up while it is running. If the pipe is not draining correctly, water can leak on your floor, in attic space/ceiling, basement or on your roof. This can cause a lot more problems if not detected quickly and repaired (window A/C units usually drip outside, directly below the widow unit).

, The fan motor is what draws in the fresh or recirculating air through the cooling coils to cool down the air. If this is not working correctly, then your home will not be near as cool as it could be.

, If your air conditioner is making more noise than usual, it may be because your air compressor is becoming worn out. This means that noise is increasing, which can be annoying. This is why noise is a common air conditioning repair problem.

, In some cases, the electricity running through your air conditioning unit can overwhelm the fuses located in your breaker box on in the A/C unit. Having someone come out and look at the electrical circuits for the air conditioning equipment is an important choice -- so you do not end up hurting yourself.

, If necessary, contact a professional or ask a friend who knows more about home/appliance repair than you do.

Wipe down the fan coil unit.",How to Clean Split Air Conditioners," These are available online and are custom bags designed to catch the waste water that accumulates when you clean your air conditioner.;
, Avoid the foam type coil cleaners because they can be messy and spread foam everywhere. Foam sprays also may not penetrate the coils or rotor fan blades properly. So stick to liquid solution sprays.


Beware of buying harsh chemical cleaners that are designed to attack organics, as they may damage newer air conditioners. Newer split air conditioners often come with their cooling coils coated with a blue-colored hydrophilic layer (which keeps the condensation flowing over the coils easily to improve airflow strength).

, This way you do not need to tear the system down like professionals do.

, Try to spray at an angle onto the cooling fins' surface as well as directly into the coils. Make sure the solution can reach as far into the coils as possible. One good suggestion is to put the nozzle as close to the fins as possible.

, To get good results, you will need to use a far-reaching spray nozzle much like those of the pressure garden sprayer. Make sure to coat all the blades with the cleaning solution.

, Then flush the coil and rotary blades with a water sprayer and see all the dirt and grime flow into the aircon wash bag. Note: some of the water from the coils will flow via the air conditioner's drainpipe.

, Turn on the air conditioner and lift up the front of the bag to allow all the rinse water to spray into the bag. Now remove the wash bag by the ends carefully and dump the waste water. Get the satisfaction of seeing all the filth and dirt that comes out of your air conditioner!

",How to Clean Air Conditioner Coils," Most central air conditioners have a shutoff box outside near the unit itself. You may have to pull out the shutoff box, flip a switch or remove a fuse. If there's no shutoff box, find the circuit breaker panel that controls the air conditioner and turn off power there.;
, Take care that any cuttings from grass, flowers, bushes or weeds don't get inside the unit. Trim foliage to be at least 2 feet (60 centimeters) away from the unit.

, Depending on the fasteners, you'll need either a screwdriver or nut driver to do this.

, Depending on how the air conditioner is constructed, this may mean lifting the fan assembly off with it. If your air conditioner is constructed this way, be careful not to stretch and damage the fan wires.

, Clean dirt off the fan blades with either a rag or whisk broom and use a shop vacuum to clean dirt off the fan motor and shaft. If the motor is designed to require lubrication, apply a small amount of oil to each of its lubrication ports. (Fans without lubrication ports are designed to be maintenance-free.)

, Use a whisk broom or stiff brush for this.

, You can do this with just water, or if the dirt is considerable, a biodegradable foaming cleaner mixed with water. Spray the cleaner from the outside in and let it soak in for 10 to 15 minutes. You may wish to re-apply the cleaner and let the second application soak for another 5 minutes.


Before you spray the air conditioner, cover any electric wires or motors with plastic.

, Spray the rinse water from the inside to the outside so that the dirt is pushed away from the air conditioner coils instead of toward them. Continue rinsing until the runoff is clear.

, If any of the coil fins appear bent, they can be combed straight with a special ""fin comb,"" available from an air conditioning supply store.

, Unlike window units, portable units do not need to be mounted in a window. They are usually on wheels and are vented through a hose placed in a window. Wall units are placed in holes cut into exterior walls.

, Choose an air conditioner with the right cooling capacity for the space. A unit with too high of a cooling capacity for the space can turn off and on too often.

, This is measured in BTUs per hour; higher BTUs mean more cooling capacity.

, The EER is required to be displayed on modern air conditioners. Units with higher EER ratings use less energy.

, Air needs to be aimed at the center of a room to provide adequate cooling. If the window is off-center, the vent will need to be adjusted to the correct position. Some models have rotating louvers to circulate air.

, Some air conditioners have remote controls, making it easier to adjust the settings from across the room. Timers are another beneficial feature; they allow you to program different power levels for different times of the day or turn on the air conditioner before you get home from work. Look for filters to remove dust, odors and allergens.

, Read reviews and model comparisons from reliable sources and consumer sites. Be on the lookout for complaints about specific models or companies. Ask for advice about how to buy an air conditioner from family and friends who have recently purchased one.

, Use it in the store to check on the noise level and ease in operating.

, Some air conditioners require additional hardware or 220 volt electrical wiring. Make sure the unit is the right size for your window or opening.

Perform routine maintenance first.,
Check for any obstructions, including buildup of debris on the air handler blower fan and make sure the condenser fan is operating correctly.,
Conduct a thorough inspection of the rest of the components of your system.",How to Charge a Home Air Conditioner2," Before you recharge your AC, it is very important that you perform standard maintenance on it.


Replace the air filter
Clean the evaporator and condenser coils—if any of the above are dirty, it can cause symptoms similar to a unit that is low on refrigerant. If refrigerant is added under these conditions, the unit may be damaged.

, These must move sufficient air through their respective coils to effectively handle the heat produced (removed from your home's interior) by the air conditioner's operation.

, Missing insulation, leaking duct-work joints, poor electrical connections, and other minor problems won't change the refrigerant requirements of your air conditioning system, but they can reduce the efficiency of the system.

"
"
Determine the type of refrigerant you need for the AC system.,
Determine what type of charging connections your system is equipped with.,
Turn your air conditioner off at the thermostat.,
Turn the power off on your air conditioning system.,
Take a reading on the gauges.",How to Charge a Home Air Conditioner3," This can be done by consulting the equipment's operating guide, often found inside the electrical control box or the air handler unit. Many systems also have a label on the unit's cabinet that will have the manufacturer's specifications. Refrigerants commonly used in fairly modern systems are R-22 (HCFC-22)and R410A, sold under names like SUVA410A and Puron. This is important in order to make sure you get the right type of refrigerant and the correct charging manifold set for charging.

, Normal inverted flare schrader valve connections can be equipped with quick connect adaptors to lessen the loss of refrigerant during the connecting process, and they will decrease the chance of injury from liquid refrigerant contacting your skin in the process. Which ever connection you use, understand that even with a system switched off, the refrigerant is under high pressure, and it is dangerous.

, The thermostat and its related circuitry are the on/off switch for your system. You will be turning off the power to the unit itself in the next step, but you want to start and stop the unit using the thermostat, not the disconnect, as this is not what the disconnect is designed for.

, The outside unit should be equipped with a fused disconnect or circuit breaker located near the unit. Remove the fuses or turn the breaker off before continuing.


With the AC unit off, hook up the gauges according to instructions. This will be with the low pressure side (the small hose/blue hose) on the gauges and the high pressure side of the system (the red hose). Older manifold gauges may not have color coded hoses, usually, the low pressure gauge and connector is on the left facing the gauge, the high pressure is on the right, and the supply hose, which is connected to your refrigerant tank, evacuation pump, or other attachment, is in the middle.
With the gauges hooked up, turn on the AC and wait 15 minutes for the system to stabilize.

, The blue gauge should have dropped if the system needs to be recharged.


To verify this, use a temperature gauge with a probe attached to the low pressure side - or return line—which is the larger of the two lines.
Recharge if the temperatures on the blue gauge do not correspond to the number recommended in the equipment manufacturer's specifications.
Use the site glass. Another way to determine if your system needs recharging is using the site glass on the unit. Many residential units are not equipped with site glasses, but if your unit has one, it will be on the outside of the unit on the return line between the inline dryer and the compressor.

Once you have located the sight glass and cleaned the view port, look into it while the unit is running. See if there are bubbles mixed with the liquid refrigerant. A properly charged AC unit will be free of bubbles. You need to recharge the unit if there are bubbles mixed with the liquid coolant. Note that on a unit that has been improperly charged, bubbles may result from air or moisture trapped in the hermetically sealed refrigerant system.



"
"
Take the following steps.,
Attach the hoses from the gauge manifold to your system's pressure ports.,
Turn on the AC.,
Check the temperatures.,
Determine your metering device.,
Check for leaks.,
Connect the charging or supply hose from your manifold to the refrigerant container with the container in an upright position.,
Add refrigerant.,
Observe a complete cooling cycle.",How to Charge a Home Air Conditioner4," To recharge the refrigerant in your air conditioner, first shut down your AC unit, then follow the steps below:

,


The low pressure hose is normally blue and is connected to the suction line—the larger of the two pipes.
The high pressure hose is generally red and is connected to the liquid line, which is the smaller of the two pipes.

, Let it to run for at least 15 minutes so that the system can reach steady state operation.

, This will give you a comparative analysis of how the system is performing, with the following measurements:


The outdoor air temperature
The return air temperature at the furnace/air handler
The suction line temperature
The liquid line temperature
Newer units will usually have a label inside the electrical cover with specific instructions for your unit. It will typically tell you to measure superheat or sub-cooling. It will also give you a chart that has values for superheat or sub-cooling for a given outdoor temperature.

, Check the charging procedure chart in your unit to determine what type of metering device your system uses. It will either be a thermostatic expansion valve or a restrictor orifice.


If your system uses a thermostatic expansion valve (TXV), use the following values:

System superheat: 18°F (-7°C)
System sub-cooling: 25°F (-4°C)


If your system uses a restrictor, you can use the table below as a guide. It contains recommended superheat values for given indoor and outdoor air temps:
To find the required superheat value, draw a line from the outside air temperature down to the return air temperature. The value in that row/column is the required superheat temperature.

, If the tests show that refrigerant is required, check for evidence of leaks and repair them. Leaks can typically be found around any joints or connections:


Welded or brazed joints
Pressure ports
Threaded tubing connectors
Any place where refrigerant lines may vibrate or rub against the unit chassis or other components.

, Do not tip the refrigerant container, as this will introduce liquid refrigerant into the suction side of the compressor, and can result in damage to the unit.

, Slowly, and in small amounts, introduce refrigerant into the suction line of the system, and allow 5 to 10 minutes for the system to stabilize between addition of refrigerant. When charging a new system, or recharging an evacuated system, the refrigerant is added by weight, according to the system specifications, but trimming a unit, or adding to an existing refrigerant charge, is less precise.


Check pressure and temperature readings, and determine if more refrigerant is needed. Repeat until everything looks normal.

, When the AC has completed a cycle, turn off power to the unit, and remove the gauges.fh

Clean reusable air filters twice a year.,
Clean the drain.,
Trim plants and foliage around the condenser.,
Wash pollen and dust off of the condenser.,
Have the unit professionally inspected and cleaned annually.",How to Clean a Central Air Conditioner," There should be an outdoor shutoff near the condenser unit. This will resemble a square box on the wall of the apartment or house. Inside, look for a switch that you can slide to the “OFF” position. If there is no switch, you’ll need to manually pull the plug which feeds power to the condenser.Before you begin disassembling any portion of the condenser, it’s crucial that you disable the power supply.
If you cannot find the power outlet where the compressor unit is plugged in, or if you’re inclined to be extra cautious, you can simply flip the switch to “OFF” in the circuit breaker box which controls power to the AC condenser.;
, The fine, narrow slats of metal which line the sides of the compressor unit are called “fins.” You can clean the fins by running the nozzle of a vacuum cleaner over them; this will remove the debris and allow the condenser to pull in air without obstruction. A wet/dry vacuum is the tool best suited for this job.The condenser unit sucks in air through these fins. Over the course of time, these will become dirty with bits of leaves, grass, and dust.
If you don’t have a wet/dry vacuum, see if any of your friends or neighbors have one. You may also be able to rent a wet/dry vacuum from your local hardware store.

, Often with normal wear, some fins on the condenser can become bent. If you notice that any of the fins are crooked or have been twisted, you can use a knife or kitchen utensil to gently straighten the fins. Apply gentle, steady pressure to bend the fins back into position.If you use excessive force, you risk snapping off the fins or damaging them further.

, The fan unit sits on top of the compressor, and is typically covered by metal wiring or a grate. Using a screwdriver, remove the wiring on top of the fan, and then unscrew and remove the fan itself.Due to the wires connecting the fan motor to the compressor unit, you may not be able to fully lift off the fan. You’ll simply have to lift the fan as far out of its housing as possible.

, Using your garden hose, rinse any debris (bits of leaves, grass, dust, or pollen) from the blades of the fan. To make sure that the fan blades are clean, you can also wipe them off with a clean cloth or rag. Then, use the hose again to spray water through the compressor’s fins from the inside of the unit.Rinsing the fins from the inside will make sure that any obstructions are cleared, and the unit can effectively draw in air.

, Once you’ve finished cleaning the fan blades and the interior of the compressor, you’re ready to put everything back together. Set the fan back in place, and re-insert the screws holding it to the metal frame. Do the same thing with the metal wiring over the top of the fan.At this point, you can also turn the power supply back on.

, To change the filter, remove the metal grate which covers the filter. Then pull out the air filter, and set in a replacement unit.The air filter is located indoors, and will typically be close to the evaporator unit. It’s about two feet (0.6 meters) wide and 1 foot (0.3 meters) high.


Over time, the air filter will become clogged and dirty with all of the dust and dirt particles that it has filtered out of the air. A dirty filter will obstruct airflow within the AC system, and will cause the system to function with much less efficiency.

, If your AC unit’s air filter can be washed and reused, you can simply clean it and place it back in the unit rather than disposing it and purchasing a new one.To clean your reusable filter, follow the manufacturer’s instructions. Most reusable filters are cleaned by running them under lukewarm tap water, and a gentle application of dish soap.


To quickly tell a disposable from a reusable air filter, inspect the material it’s made from. Disposable filters will be made of thick, papery material, while reusable filters are made of a rubbery frame and metal mesh.

, As the evaporator unit cools and de-humidifies air from outside, it produces runoff liquid. In most air conditioner units, this air runs down from the top of the evaporator in a thin, plastic pipe, and runs through a drain in the floor. To make sure that the drain hasn’t gotten clogged, you can run a stiff wire through the drain.If the plastic pipe is flexible, poke the wire into the bottom of the pipe as well, to make sure that it’s not clogged.
In some more modern units, the pipe which drains water runs directly into the floor, and does not have a drain. In this case, you do not need to clean the setup.
Call a AC professional cleaner—or your landlord—if you notice water pooling around the base of the evaporator unit, or see water-damaged flooring nearby.

, Although condenser units are often viewed as an eyesore, they need to be surrounded by open space in order to function properly. If you have weeds, vines, or bushes encroaching on your condenser unit, use a pair of garden shears and trim the plants back. Make sure that you have a space of about two feet on all sides of the condenser unit.This space will maximize the unit’s efficiency by allowing plenty of free-flowing air.

, Rinse the condenser by spraying it with water from a garden hose. Work the spray from the hose over all sides of the condenser unit. Rinse from top to bottom, so that runoff from the top portion of the condenser does not stain the bottom portion.Over the course of time, the outdoor condenser unit can become covered in a layer of dirt and pollen kicked up by the wind. This coating of dust can reduce the efficiency of the condenser unit by blocking the unit from pulling in air.

, While maintaining the function of the air conditioner unit should keep it functioning efficiently, it’s still smart to have it inspected by a professional. Plan to schedule your inspection in spring, before you start using the AC unit heavily in the summer. AC professionals will be able to inspect all parts of the air conditioning unit—including the evaporator coils and the air compressor—and can prevent or repair any problems early on. If you live in an apartment or a rental house, the landlord or property owner will likely have annual inspections performed. If you notice that your AC unit is not working properly or seems to be broken, contact your rental agency.

Assess the problem.,
It's not working at all: the condenser (for an outdoor unit) or air handler/furnace (indoor unit) are not running.,
Check your fan blower belt for excessive slack, damage, or breakage.,
Check the coils and filter.,
Call for service.",How to Check Your Air Conditioner Before Calling for Service1," Is the unit simply not working at all, is it not cooling the air much, or is it simply blowing around warm air?;
,


Make sure it's plugged in. This may seem obvious, but there are occasions when this is exactly the problem. Whether kids, dogs, or an accidental tap with the vacuum cleaner, the plug could be partially or completely dislodged.
Check the circuit breakers and fuses. Make sure they are in place, turned on, and functioning properly. Circuits, especially with older homes, are easily overloaded if the air conditioner shares a circuit with appliances such as irons, refrigerators, or microwaves.
Check your thermostat (cooling control) and make sure it is set to cool at the current temperature, and working properly. As with plugs, sometimes settings can change by accident.

, This can cause low air flow which allows ice to form, and thus causes low cooling performance.


Repair or replace the blower belt. Allow the ice to melt before restarting the AC unit.

, If they are caked with dust and debris, clean them thoroughly. Make sure you let any ice melt before restarting your unit.

, If you've verified that everything is connected, powered, set up properly, and clean, it may be time to call the service department.

You’ll also want to figure the distance to the nearest electrical outlet and determine whether other items share the same circuit.






Consider whether the room is self-contained with a door that closes or part of a larger area. Window air conditioners work better for small areas. If you need to cool a large area that makes up your living room, dining area and kitchen, make sure you consider the entire space, as well as the height of the ceiling.;
,


If it’s a simple rectangular room, this is easy. Measure the long wall and the wall adjacent to it. Multiply the two measurements to get the square footage.






For a more complicated area, draw a rough diagram. Divide the area into squares and rectangles. Measure the sides of these and multiply to determine the size of each. Add each section to get the total.

,


A small 8 x 8 foot room would need a window air conditioner rated at 5,000 BTUs.
A room that measures 250 to 300 square feet needs one with a rating of 7,000 BTUs.
A large area measuring 500 to 600 square feet should have an air conditioner rated at 12,000 to 14,000 BTUs.

, Keep the measurements with you when you go to the store to make sure you don't buy one that won't fit in your window.

, Air Conditioners have Energy Efficiency Ratios (EER), which equal the BTU rating divided by the wattage. A higher number means better energy efficiency, but it will generally come with a higher cost.

, Some models offer different features that you may want. Before you buy a window air conditioner, you may want to consider whether this style is the best ones for your needs.


Models with a thermostat allow you to adjust the level of cooling, which can make the unit more effective.
A fan speed can help you adjusting the speed of the air. If you want to consider an option with a fan, also look to see whether you can adjust the louvers directing the flow of air.
Filters can help clean the air pulled in by the window unit. You may want to find out where the filter is and determine how easy it will be to clean.






If possible, determine the noise produced by the unit during operation.

, Determine how much you're willing to spend and factor in operating costs. Decide whether you can wait until the end of the season to get one on sale or whether you need it sooner.

, Compare warranties of different models you are considering. Does the store offer a service plan? Where would you have to take it for repairs?

, This may help you decide between one store and another. If you will need help installing it, find out how much the store charges for the service.

, Consumer websites test and rate appliances such as window air conditioners.

Be particularly attentive if your condenser is close to a dryer vent, or if your neighborhood is full of cottonwood trees. These two items are ""air conditioner killers"".

, This simple step alone can increase the efficiency of your air conditioner. It will also run less, increasing the life span of your equipment.


A good sign that your filter needs changing is the fact of ice forming inside your inside cooling unit (evaporator section).
This may be difficult to see as the unit is sealed, but touch the outside metal and feel for a noticeable temperature difference. You may also see ice on the large line going to the outside unit (suction line).
If ice is forming, it is possible that your air filter is severely dirty and restricting your normal air flow. This allows ice to form due to the fact that not enough heat is being introduced to your cooling section.

Buy some stainless steel contact paper.,
Find a friend or family member willing to help you with this project.,
Clean and dry the surface you wish to cover.,
Measure the length of surface you wish to cover, add 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters), then cut your contact paper accordingly.If your contact paper has a grid on the back, use that as a guide, otherwise, use a straight edge.,
Starting from the top, peel the backing down by about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters).You will be working one small section at a time.,
Place the contact paper against your appliance, making sure that the top edges align.,
Run the edge of a credit card across the surface of the contact paper, making sure to smooth out any air bubbles.,
Unpeel the contact paper a few more inches, and smooth it down again.,
Flatten the side edges down, if needed.,
Trim any excess away with a craft blade, if needed.Unless your measurements were precise to the last millimeter, you may end up having some excess contact paper hanging over the edges.",How to Fake Stainless Steel Appliances1," You can find it at your local home improvement store or online. How much you buy will depend on which appliances you plan on covering.


Stainless steel contact paper is plastic-based, so it cannot withstand heat. It is not suitable for surfaces that get hot, such as stovetops.;
, Having someone help you will not only make your work go by quicker, but also make it easier. You will also get a nicer finish with fewer wrinkles and air bubbles.

, This is very important. If there is any dirt or grease on your appliance, the contact paper may not stick. Use a high-quality appliance cleaner that can cut through grease, and scrub your appliance clean. Be sure to wipe it dry with a clean cloth afterwards.

, This will ensure that your lines are straight and even. If you are covering a very wide appliance, you may need to cut two strips of contact paper.


The grain on the finished piece will be running vertically. If you want the grain to be running horizontally, cut your contact paper accordingly.

, It will take a while, but this will lessen the chances of wrinkles or bubbles forming.

, If you are covering an appliance door, make sure that there is enough contact paper hanging over the edge to cover the side. This will typically be around 2 inches (5.08 centimeters).Have a friend or family member hold the rest of the contact paper away from the appliance's surface; this will prevent wrinkles and air bubbles.

, If you don't have a credit card, you can use any other thin, plastic tool, such as a scrapper or spatula. Avoid anything made out of metal, as this can tear the contact paper.


For added security, consider wrapping the credit card in a thin cloth to further prevent any rips or tears., Keep doing this until you reach the bottom of your appliance. If you get any air bubbles, push them to the side of the appliance, or carefully lift the contact paper away and smooth it down again.If you need to use a second sheet of contact paper, overlap the two edges slightly., If you are covering an appliance door, you will have some excess contact paper hanging over the edges. Carefully flatten these flaps down onto the sides of your appliance's door. Run the credit card from front to back in short rows. Start from the top of the door, and work your way towards the bottom.

, Simply trim the excess away using a sharp craft blade.

Pour the cleaning solution into the machine.,
Let the solution sit for several hours.,
Dump out the cleaning solution.,
Flush with clean water.,
Wipe down the outside regularly.,
Rinse the steamer with fresh water after each use.,
Store the steamer properly.",How to Clean a Steamer," Whenever you want to clean your steamer, you need to first make sure that the machine is completely turned off and unplugged from any electrical source. Cleaning the machine while it is on could lead to a potentially dangerous situation.Cleaning the steamer while it’s on could lead you to hurt yourself, damage something nearby, or even ignite a spark.;
, Use a damp washrag to wipe down the exterior of your steamer. This should be strong enough to clean off any minor dirt and grime that has built up during use. Be sure to use warm water when you dampen the washrag.If this doesn’t seem to work, you can add a few drops of white vinegar to the damp washcloth to give it a more powerful cleaning.

, If your steamer has a hose attachment, you should clean that, too. Simply detach the hose and flush it with water. You can do this outside with a garden hose, or carefully in the kitchen sink or shower.


Flush the hose several times, or until the water runs clear once it filters out of the hose attachment.
You should also clean out any debris that has lodged itself in the bristles of the hose., Combine 1 ½ ounces of baking soda with 4  c (950 mL) of water. This will be your cleaning solution.Make sure the baking soda dissolves into the water before you begin.

, Locate the water cup on your steamer and empty out any remaining water. Pour your cleaning solution into the water cup and return it to the steamer machine.The water cup is usually located on the steamer base.
You may want to perform this cleaning activity outside (or in the garage) to avoid making a mess on the floor of your home.

, Once the cleaning solution is in the water cup of the steamer, you’ll need to let it stay in there for 3-4 hours while it does its job. Sit the steamer on a solid surface during this time so it won’t tip over or spill the cleaner.Be sure not to run the steamer (or even turn the machine on) while the cleaner is inside the machine, as this could potentially damage items it comes into contact with.

, Remove the water cup from the steamer and dump out any remaining cleaning solution. Rinse out the water cup to make sure it’s fully clean and doesn’t have any residue left inside.


Be sure to dump the cleaning solution out in the sink or shower. Don’t dump it outside as this could ruin your grass.

, Once you have completed the cleansing process, pour water back into the water cup and turn the machine on. Let the machine run so that some of the water comes out and filters out the rest of the machine.Repeat this process several times, or until the water being rinsed out doesn’t look dirty anymore.
If your rinsing water continues to look dirty as you pour it out, you may need to repeat the process with the cleaning solution another time.

, Buildup of grime and dirt can, over time, cause your steamer machine to function less effectively. If you simply take a few moments to wipe down the outside of the steamer with a damp washrag, this can help prevent future damage and extend the life of your steamer.Try to remember to wipe down the exterior of the steamer after every use for best results.
You should also wipe the steamer down if it has been stored for a long period of time without being used.

, After you use the steamer, you should rinse the machine out with fresh water. This will help prevent sediment buildup on the inside of the steam cleaner and keep your machine fresh for longer.Do this after each time you use the steamer to make sure your machine stays as clean as possible.

, Whenever you aren’t using the steamer, you should store it in a cool, dry place to prevent any mildew or mold from forming. You should try to cover the steamer with plastic so that the amount of dust that settles on the machine is minimal.


Storing your steamer properly will help prolong the life of your machine.

Buy some stainless steel paint.,
Prep your appliance by pulling it away from the wall and removing any handles or plaques.,
Scrub the entire surface clean.,
Apply painter's tape to the areas you do not want painted, including the magnet strips.,
Shake the paint can for about 2 minutes, stir it with a paint stick, then pour a little bit of it into a painting tray.Cover your paint can so that the rest of the paint won't dry out.,
Use a paint roller to apply a thin coat of paint, going from top to bottom across the surface of your appliance.,
Drag an 11-inch (27.94-centimeter) wide foam brush across the wet paint.,
Wait for the paint to dry, then repeat the painting and dragging process one to two more times.,
Apply one to two coats of clear sealer.,
Replace the handles and plaques, and remove the painter's tape.",How to Fake Stainless Steel Appliances2," You can find it online or at your local home improvement store. You may also find it labeled as ""liquid stainless steel."" Note that this will not change the texture of your appliance, just the color. This means that if your appliance has a wrinkly texture on it, your finished product will also have that same wrinkly texture.


Some places also sell kits that contain most of the supplies you need for your project. You might want to buy some extra foam brushes in different sizes, however.

, If there are some items that you cannot remove, don't worry about them for now; you will be covering them with painter's tape later.


If you are painting a refrigerator, it might be a good idea to take the food out, and put it into an ice box.
If there are any rusty spots, be sure to clean and sand them., This includes the parts what the door seal/magnets touch. Also, make sure to clean off all bits of grease and grime, as they will prevent the paint from adhering. When you are done, spray the appliance down with some window cleaner, then wipe it dry.If you are painting a fridge

, This will keep the door from being pulled shut while you are working on it. If there were any plaques or handles that you weren't able to remove, you should cover them with painter's tape as well.Consider spraying any metal parts with rust-inhibiting primer. This will not only help keep the rust at bay, but also prevent it from coming back.Painting can be messy. It would be a good idea to cover the floor around your appliance with newspaper, butcher paper, or a cheap tablecloth.

, You will be painting your appliance in two sessions, so if you pour all of your paint out now, it will dry out before you use it all.


If you plan on keeping your paint tray, line it with a sheet of aluminum foil. This way, all you have to do is throw the foil away when you are done.

, It is very important to apply a thin coat of paint. If you apply the paint too thickly, you will end up with paint streaks. The thin coat will look messy at first, but the more coats you apply, the smoother your finish will look., This time, go in the opposite direction you painted in: bottom to top. Try to drag the foam brush in a smooth, single stroke without any stopping. Instead of holding the brush by the handle, consider holding it by the edges instead. This will give you more control over direction and pressure.The foam brush will help give you that streaked texture stainless steel has.
Take your time, and try to make the strokes as straight as possible.

, Always let the paint dry before applying another coat; depending on the brand that you are using, it may take around an hour for it to dry.When you get to smaller areas, don't hesitate to switch to a smaller paint roller and a smaller foam brush.
While you are waiting for the paint to dry, keep your paint covered with plastic wrap and your brushes inside plastic bags. This will prevent the paint from drying out and ruining them.
As you continue to work, your foam brush may start to collect too much paint. If this happens, place the brush over the lip of your tray, and drag your paint stick over it, squeezing the excess paint back into the tray., Wait for each coat of sealer to dry before applying the next. Depending on which brand you are using, it will take about two hours for it to dry.You do not need to drag a foam brush through the sealer; simply apply the sealer with a clean foam brush., For a nicer touch, coat the handles with spray paint before attaching them. This is not necessary, but it can add a bit of freshness to your appliance.

You don't need to remove the internal latch (that thing that keeps the door shut). Only remove the two screws holding the lever to the sides of the doors.;
, Use an Allen Wrench to loosen the Emtek knob or lever's turn post. You need to do this until you can pull the turn post (that brass post with a spring wrapped around it) out of the lever. If you don't have an Allen Wrench that fits your Emtek hardware, you can order one online.

, Now that you've loosened the Emtek lever or knob with the Allen Wrench, you can remove the turn post and the spring from the lever.

, You should now be able to see the inner mechanical parts that keep your Emtek lever stiff. If your entry set is sagging, you should still see these parts for the inside lever. If your hardware doesn't look like this, stop now. You might be using a type of Emtek product that this fix-it guide will not show you how to correct.

, Once you loosen it up, you should be able to pull it out with your finger. This part keeps the torsion spring and keyed washer pressed together.

, After removing the clip, remove the washer underneath it. (This is not the keyed washer that might be broken.)

, Shown here is one of the top offenders for a saggy Emtek lever or loose knob. The green arrows point out the two places in the spring that usually break. If you're still not sure if your torsion spring is broken, it will not be sitting tightly in place. Take it out and examine it. The picture below shows an Emtek lever with a new spring. If yours is broken, you need to buy one, but it's important that you keep reading and make sure that your keyed washer is not also broken.

, We still need to check the keyed washer. Pry out the torsion spring with a screwdriver. If it's stiff and hard to pry out, that's a good thing. That means that the spring is still strong and does not need replacement.

, This is the piece that the torsion spring pushes against. Look at the picture to see where this washer may be broken. Many Emtek keyed washers break in the middle. The two keyed pieces become weak over time. If any part of this is broken, you'll have to buy a new one.

, If the keyed washer looks broken or cracked, remove it with a screwdriver.

, Follow the steps below to reassemble the Emtek lever or knob, then see if it continues to sag. It's possible that the torsion spring just slipped off and needs to be placed on securely. However, if these steps don't reveal the true cause of your saggy lever, you might want to try contacting Emtek and find out if they can help.

Tighten the bolt with an Allen wrench.,
Place your fixed lever or knob back on the door.",How to Fix a Sagging Emtek Door Handle2,", This step is going to make your fingers hurt. (Sorry!) Basically, once you get the torsion spring in place, you use one or two fingers to push the top part of the spring all the way around to the spring's catch. It hurts like hell, but that strong tension is what keeps your Emtek lever or knob from sagging. Look at the pictures to see someone else's fingers suffer through the process. If the torsion spring or keyed washer didn't look broken, it's possible that the Emtek spring just slipped off its mount. If that's the case, make sure that you put the spring on correctly in this step.

, After placing the Emtek torsion spring back into place, you need to set the washer that goes on top of it. This washer keeps the spring in place and gives the top clip something to press down on.

, This is the piece that holds the washer, torsion spring, and keyed washer together. You can start sliding this in with your fingers, but eventually you will probably need a screwdriver to get it tightly in place.

, Put the spring on the turn post and hold it in place with one finger. You will need to hold it in place until you use the Allen Wrench to tighten the lever.

, To put the Emtek lever or knob back together, tighten the bolt with an Allen wrench. At this point you should be able to tell if the new parts fixed the lever. If it feels stiffer than before, you've fixed it. No need to buy a new Emtek lever!

, If your lever is stiff, place it back on the door the same way you took it off. If this guide didn't fix your Emtek door hardware, be sure to call Emtek!

Figure out the size of the opening where you want to place the door.,
Locate the materials you will use for the door.,

Install hinges on the door in preparation for hanging it.",How to Build a Greenhouse Door," If you have a standard height top plate in the wall in which you are framing the door, you can build it 6 foot 8 inches or 7 foot tall (2.07 meters or 2.13 meters), the same height as standard doors. For custom sizes, you will have to work out the size you require for yourself by taking accurate measurements.;
, The door that you see in this article's illustrations utilized an old window from a salvage yard; the frame was sized to fit the window and a frame was built to accommodate the door. For the project here, 2X4 (38 x 89 mm) treated southern yellow pine boards and half inch plywood (also treated) were used as well.

, You will need to make sure it is level and sturdy so that the door will fit together correctly.

, Again, you will need to figure out the length of the cuts through your own measuring, so that the finished door will sit properly in the opening.


Allow for the stiles to be cut for tenons at each end. A 1 1/2 inch (3.8 cm) tenon on each end of the stile will need to be 3 inches (7.6 cm) longer than the finished length of the stile, less the width of the two rails.
For a 40 inch (101.6 cm) door with 3 1/2 inch (8.9 cm) nominal rails, cut the stiles 36 inches (91.4 cm) long. This will allow for the tenon cuts on each end.
For a 6 foot 8 inch (2 meters) tall door, the rails, of course, will be 6 foot 8 inches (2 meters).

, You will need to divide the thickness of the stile by three, and leave the middle third as the tenon.

, For a normal door, you will want a top, middle, and bottom stile, so you need to cut a total of three mortises wide enough to fit the tenoned ends of each stile. Cut the mortises slightly deeper than the tenons; this will ensure that they will fit tightly and leave a clean joint.

, This mortise will usually differ in width and depth from the stile mortise, in order to accommodate the different material. Any exterior material or siding can be used for the panels, as long as it is reasonably weatherproof and stable.

, Mark any notches or other modifications you need to make for it to sit properly in the door's frame.

, Leave clearance at the top for the top rail, then fit the top rail into position. Slide the intermediate rail up to the base of the window panel and check its fit. Check the assembly at this point to make sure it is square.

, Any oversized dimensions can be trimmed with a circular saw prior to installing the hinges, so don't worry if the finished door is a bit too large.

, Apply a liberal amount of quality, weatherproof wood glue to all the joints, being sure each side of each tenon gets sufficient glue on it to bond it in the mortise.

, Fit them tightly together, then clamp the frame to hold everything in position while the glue dries. Nails or screws can be used in each joint if the appearance is not important to you, and large wood screws can be used to reinforce the corners; however, this should not be done until any trimming of the finished door is completed.

, You may use standard door butt hinges, or flat surface hinges, depending on your preference. Hang the door, and complete its installation by installing door stops, a threshold, and a latch as you prefer.

, Notice in the photo the heavy carbon-buildup on the glass Chimney Collar...this unit will require maintenance., Grasp the Grill and gently lift while tilting and sliding the assembly forward to clear the Wick Control Knob, the Shut-off Lever, and the Igniter Button., Prior to disengaging the spring case, depress the shut-off lever to insure that the wick assembly (chimney) is fully in the down-position, otherwise there could very well be tension on the spring case which could lead to personal injury or damage to the spring case when it is disengaged. If you are just replacing the wick the spring case can be left on the shaft in the disengaged position, otherwise slide the Spring Case off the shaft.

The wick-controlling spring case serves as a spring-tensioner against the wick assembly when the it is in the raised (up) position. This allows spring-action to rapidly lower the wick when either the shut-off lever depressed (without controlling the spin on the wick control knob), or in the event the heater is tilted or jilted enough to the point where the emergency shut-off device (also known as the wick control assembly) is tripped and the heater is automatically shutdown.

,, Prior to lifting off the plates, be aware that:

The plates themselves are two-halves joined together by interlocking tabs (we are removing these as a single assembly), and
The Ignition Device Assembly is still attached to the Battery Holder by its two electrical wires. If just replacing the wick, the plates can be gently lifted straight up off the mounting studs and placed safely off to one side to allow further work.

, Grasp the gear-shaft and pull outwards until it cannot go any further. This will disengage the raise/lower control gear on the end of the wick control gear shaft from the wick assembly.,, The actual wick itself is held inside the wick Holder by a number sharp metal ""spikes"" that pierce the wick material to hold it in place. Remove the old wick by compressing it off the ""spikes"" and properly dispose of it. To install the new wick, refer to the manufacturers instructions and follow accordingly (see the photo for an example). Once the wick is properly positioned inside the holder, simply press the wick against the spikes until they pierce the outer material and the wick is firmly impaled and cannot slide up and down inside the holder., At this point, should the user only be replacing the wick, no further disassembly is necessary. Reassembly of the heater is essentially the reverse of those prior steps that apply only to the wick replacement objective with a few minor precautions discussed in subsequent steps below. Recommendation to the user is to review these precautions to insure a smooth and trouble-free reassembly."

Remove grill from its base.",How to Maintain an Aladdin TR5000 Kerosene Heater3," After loosening the fuel cap, gently squeeze the retainer on the end of the fuel cap chain and remove it from inside the tank., Twist the fuel gauge assembly clockwise until the tabs allow the gauge to be removed.

When unlocking the gauge from the tank, do not turn the gauge more than 1/4-turn or damage may result to the fuel gauge float should it come in contact with the sides of the fuel reservoir.
When removing the gauge, again use caution and remove it slowly at a slight angle as the fuel gauge float may become damaged.
Allow time for any fumes or residual fuel in the tank to dissipate before proceeding.

, Holding the grill handle perpendicular to the grill, gently pull both ends of the handle out through their keyed-slots., Using a Phillips screwdriver, remove the screw from the center of the wick control knob. Note that the control-knob screw is machined with left hand threads! To remove the screw it must be turned to the right. After the knob has been removed, also remove the control dial directly behind the knob. This dial-indicator has a large spring behind it that keeps it snug to the rear of the control-knob., Remove the gear assembly by pulling the gear itself off the gear-shaft. Be aware that the metal tabs in front of the gear are actually a part of the assembly and care must be taken as to not bend, twist, or otherwise damage these tabs. Also, there is a coil-spring loaded into the face of the gear and care must be observed as to not allow the spring to disengage form its securing pins or become disengaged from the gear-face., Removal of the wick guide cylinder top requires special attention due to the type of screws that are used to fasten the top to the guide cylinder. These screws (as shown in the photo) have a smooth shank between the threads and the head of the screw which prevent them from inadvertently backing out caused by repeated heating and cooling. To remove these screws, lift and hold the screws up as far as they will go and then using a Phillips screwdriver, remove them., Using a 3/4"" wrench, loosen the nut through which the wick control gear shaft passes and is holding the emergency shut-off device assembly to the fuel reservoir (the nut itself cannot be removed from the shaft from either end unless the rolling pin piercing the shaft is also removed). Once the nut has come loose, pull the gear-shaft out and then lift off the emergency shut-off device., The battery holder is fastened onto the fuel reservoir by a single 9/32"" nut. Remove it and lift the holder off the stud taking care that it is also still attached to the ignition device assembly and the insulation plates., There are two additional grill base mounting brackets besides the battery holder bracket, that serve to hold the grill and its base. These brackets are held down onto the fuel reservoir by 9/32"" nuts. NOTE: The photo shows how the brackets are situated when they are reinstalled (with the small tabs facing outwards and serving as a seat for the grill base)., There are four (4)-9/32"" brass nuts that serve as shims for the grill base mounted down flush on studs. These should be removed if the heater is being thoroughly cleaned and maintained., In order to separate the grill from its base, four (4)-5/16"" sheet-metal nuts located on the underside of the base are removed and the grill separates. Care must be taken when removing and reinstalling these type nuts as they are inherently fragile in the nature of the material by which they are made.

This section deals with the steps necessary to disassemble the Aladdin TR5000 Kerosene Heater Chimney Assembly.,

REMOVE CHIMNEY WIRE COIL: Begin this subsection by gently removing the Chimney Wire Coil from the assembly.,



REMOVE CHIMNEY ROD RETAINING WASHERS: Two metal rods that crisscross the bottom of the Chimney Assembly hold the entire assembly together as one unit.,

DISASSEMBLE CHIMNEY ASSEMBLY: Once the rods have been removed, the entire assembly freely comes apart.,



CLEANING OF CHIMNEY ASSEMBLY: The most common need for disassembly of the Chimney Assembly is to remove excessive carbon buildup.,

REASSEMBLY OF CHIMNEY ASSEMBLY: Assembly of the Wick Chimney is reverse of its disassembly.,
CLEANING OF THE FUEL RESERVOIR: The fuel tank can usually be cleaned with a soap and water solution or a mild solvent.,
CLEANING OF GRILL, GRILL CAP, GRILL HANDLE: These parts over time will develop corrosion and rust due to being repeatedly exposed to rapid heating and cooling.,
REASSEMBLY OF THE HEATER: Reassembling the Aladdin TR5000 is essentially the reverse of the above steps.,
REASSEMBLY CHECKPOINT #1: Insure that the Chimney Assembly is put together correctly if it has been taken apart.,
REASSEMBLY CHECKPOINT #2: When reinstalling the Chimney Assembly, make sure that the assembly is firmly and properly seated on top of the Wick Assembly.,
REASSEMBLY CHECKPOINT #3: When reinstalling the Wick Assembly, make sure that it freely moves up and down on the Wick Guide Cylinder without any sort of binding or hesitation.,
REASSEMBLY CHECKPOINT #4: When the Wick is installed into the Wick Holder double-check that it is installed and fully seated on the spikes at its correct position as specified by the manufacturer,
REASSEMBLY CHECKPOINT #5: Spring Case is properly functioning by setting the Shut-off Lever, running the wick all the way up, depressing the Shut-off Lever, and then observing that the Spring Case freely brings the Wick Assembly rapidly down to its full-bottom position (shutoff position).,
REASSEMBLY CHECKPOINT #6: It is CRITICAL to verify that the Emergency Shutoff Device is properly functioning.,
REASSEMBLY CHECKPOINT #7: After refilling the Fuel Reservoir, wait a minimum of two-hours before attempting to ignite the Wick to insure that the Kerosene has had time to fully wick-up into the material, otherwise damage to the Wick can occur.,
REASSEMBLY CHECKPOINT #8: Visually inspect the Ignition Glow Plug to make sure it is in good working condition.",How to Maintain an Aladdin TR5000 Kerosene Heater4," Overhaul of the Chimney Assembly is usually unnecessary except in instances when there is excessive carbon buildup or damage to the assembly at some point has occurred.,, These rods are held in place by two(2)-pressure washers that must be carefully removed without damage. The tool shown here is a typical metal pick manufactured by Stanley Tools and is used to gently lift the tabs one-at-a-time working the washer off the rod. Once the washers have been removed, the rods can then be extracted from the Chimney Assembly. CAUTION! Take care when the final rod is removed and the assembly comes apart that the tempered-Glass Chimney Collar is not allowed to break...they are somewhat EXPENSIVE!!, The individual parts should be arranged according to their position in the assembly and closely inspected for any damage or possible material failures (cracked metal, glass, etc.) If any damage or failures are found, the part must be replaced as this assembly receives the most stress during its operational lifetime and in not doing so may possibly result in failure of the heater which becomes a potential fire hazard!, Excessive buildup is the direct result of (1) Old or dirty wicks, (2) Old or contaminated Kerosene, (3) Excessive Wick height due to improper installation or incorrect Wick model, or (4) Chimney Assembly not seated down properly onto the Wick Assembly. This carbon can be removed with mild-soap and water. CAUTION! The Carbon buildup is an extremely fine residue...take safety precautions to prevent inhalation, contact with the skin, or contact with clothing as it is difficult to remove., NOTE: Trial and error is usually a requirement when reinstalling the rods in getting the correct combination of holes to line up through all sections of the assembly...take your time and have patience...they'll go in there!, If there are more severe issues such as rust, corrosion, or etching there are methods on the Internet that can be used to remove such as these but serious safety consideration in replacing the Reservoir should be taken into account., Rust can be removed using various grades of wire-brushes and in delicate areas, scouring-pads work well. After brushing down the rusted areas they should be cleaned with a mild soap and water. If repainting is desired (such as the Grill-Cap) a heat-tolerant paint is required!,, Make sure that the rods are fully inserted, tight(do not move), and that the Chimney Rod Retaining Washers are firmly attached and seated., Also, insure that the Wick moves freely upwards into the Chimney without it binding or disturbing the assembly. If it does, some trimming of the wick-top may be necessary.,,,, The Tilt-Weight (situated on top of the Emergency Shut-off Device...aka Wick Control Assembly) properly functions by setting the Shut-off Lever, running the Wick all the way up, and then tapping the Weight with your finger. When the Weight ""bobs"" or falls-over it should trip the Spring Case and as a result, lower the Wick Assembly to its full-bottom position (shutoff position).,, The coil element should not be ""bowed"" in shape, or ""sagging""...if so, it must be replaced."

Measure the door opening.,
Check the floor.,
Purchase a door.,
Mark the door for trimming.",How to Hang a Door1," Using a tape measure, measure the height and width of the door opening. Write the measurements down.






;
, Check the floor for level and the jambs for plumb. Measure the exact amount that the floor is off-level. The opposite jamb must be cut by this amount to level the door in the opening.








, The door should be 2"" smaller than the rough opening (jack studs). It should be slightly (1/4"") smaller than the finished opening to allow a margin for closing the door. There is some leeway to also purchase a door that is a little larger since you will be trimming it.








, Use a pencil to apply the measurements. Generally, allow for a 2mm (1/16 inch) space between the door and the top and sides. The bottom of the door should be 6-12mm (1/4-1/2 inch) up from the floor ( If your measurements were 1992 mm (83 inches) high and 768 mm (32 inches) wide, for example, mark the door so that it's 1984 mm (82 2/3 inches) tall (1992 mm minus 2 mm for the top and 6 mm for the bottom) and 764 mm (31.8 inches) wide (768 minus 2 mm for each side).









Keep in mind whether your door will be going over a carpet or a wooden floor.

Trim the jamb.,
Trim the door.,
Check if the door fits.,
Place the hinges.,
Cut hinge recesses (mortises).,
Drill pilot holes.",How to Hang a Door2," Mark and cut the jamb on the high side with your saw. If you cut more than 1/4 in. from the jamb, you might need to trim the bottom of the door so it conforms to the floor slope.








, Saw or plane up to the pencil marks, then sand the edges until they are smooth. Keep in mind that you're better off trimming too little rather than too much.








, With shallow wedges underneath the door and someone else to help you hold it up, place the door in the frame and see if it fits properly. If it doesn't, you will need to trim again until the fit is perfect.








,









Determine in which direction the door will open. The door should open in to the room and hinge placement should be such that the light switch is accessible on the side opposite the hinges. If, as you enter the room, the light switch is inside on the wall to your right, then the hinges should be on the left. As you push the door open to enter the room, the switch should be immediately accessible on the knob side of the door.
Place the door on its side with the hinge side upwards. Measure and mark 15 cm (6 inches) from the top and bottom of the door. This mark represents the bottom of the hinge at the bottom of the door, and the top of the hinge at the top.
Open a hinge and place it on the door in line with the mark you have just made. Draw around it with a pencil. Repeat this for the other hinge.

, Use a chisel to make shallow recesses, called mortises, in the door within the pencil marks. Strip away the surplus wood and trim the recess until the hinge is flush with the wood.









Be conservative. If you chisel out too much, it will be very hard to fix.

, With each hinge flap in its mortise, mark the screw positions with a pencil. Remove the hinges and use a drill bit that is slightly narrower than your screws to drill pilot holes where they are marked by the pencil. To center the pilot holes perfectly, use a special bit called a Vix-Bit, available at any hardware store or home center. When using a Vix-Bit, drill through the hinge's screw holes with the hinge in its proper location on the door. Keep the bit perpendicular to the door.

Screw on the hinges.,
Mark the hinge positions on the frame.,
Chisel hinge recesses.,
Fix hinges to the frame.",How to Hang a Door3," This is best done with a drill, but can also be accomplished with a screwdriver if necessary.








, Place objects such as screwdrivers or shallow wedges at the bottom of the doorway. Have somebody hold the door in the frame in exactly the position that you want it to hang. The hinge knuckles should be parallel with the frame. Draw around the hinges with a pencil.








, After carefully putting the door aside, cut mortises in the door frame in the same way that you did on the door itself. Hold the door against the frame again to test the placement and make sure the hinges are flush.








, Mark pilot holes on the frame with a pencil and then drill through these marks in the same way you did for the door. Put the screws through the pilot holes to affix the hinges on the frame.

Unplug your humidifier.,
Remove and empty the water tank.,
Take out the dirty filter.,
Rinse the filter with cool water.,
Allow the filter to dry completely.",How to Clean a Humidifier Filter1," Before you disassemble your humidifier unit, make sure it’s turned off and disconnected from the wall outlet. You’re going to be handling a lot of wet parts, so this will help you prevent any accidents or damage.Choose a flat, water-resistant surface as your work area. A countertop near the sink is optimal.;
, You can usually access the tank by opening the top compartment of the humidifier. Most water tanks will lift straight off the base. Drain the old water out of the tank and set it aside.It may be a good idea to lay the water tank in the sink or on a folded towel in case it continues draining after you’ve emptied it.
You can clean and rinse the tank separately later if needed.

, Removable air filters can most often be located inside the humidifier’s motor housing. Remove the outer casing of the unit and slide out the old filter. Look over the filter to see what level of cleaning it will require.Filters that are mildly dusty can be rinsed clean. If there’s mold or an excessive amount of mineral buildup present, you may need to use a vinegar or bleach-based cleaning solution instead.Disposable paper filters can simply be thrown away and replaced.

, Rotate the filter under the stream to dislodge any traces of dust or dirt. Lightly brush away stuck-on debris with a soft-bristled brush or fingertip, but be careful not to apply too much pressure to the mesh. Once the filter looks clean, shake off the excess water.You should only ever use fresh water to rinse your humidifier filter.

, When it comes to drying a clean filter, air drying is the safest option. Attempting to speed the drying process along using another tool, such as a hair dryer, may cause permanent damage. Set the filter on an absorbent towel and check back in 1-2 hours.Mold needs moisture to thrive. Reloading your humidifier with clean water and a dry filter will prevent mold from returning.
Once the filter is dry, you can reassemble and start using the humidifier again.

"
"
Fill a sink or bucket with warm water.,
Pour in distilled white vinegar.,
Soak the filter in the vinegar solution for 30-45 minutes.,
Run clean water through the filter.",How to Clean a Humidifier Filter2," Run enough water to completely submerge the filter. For deep-cleaning tasks, warm or hot water will work best.Make sure you unplug and drain the humidifier before removing the filter.

, Add one part vinegar for every two parts water. Mix the vinegar and water gently by hand. This solution will be effective for cleaning and disinfecting filters with small amounts of mildew or discoloration.Vinegar is naturally acidic, making it a safe alternative to harsh chemical cleansers.Especially moldy filters should be treated with bleach or thrown away.

, Submerge the filter and leave it to sit. The vinegar will gradually begin working to dissolve small mold spots and other stuck-on residue.You should let the filter soak for at least half an hour, though you can also leave it for an hour or more.Never use formulated cleaning solutions on a humidifier air filter. These can deteriorate synthetic materials.

, After the filter has had a chance to soak, remove it from the vinegar solution and rinse it thoroughly under the faucet. Try to wash away as much loose gunk as you can. Give the filter a shake and set it aside to air dry.Smell the filter after rinsing it to make sure you’ve gotten out all of the vinegar.
Do not squeeze or wring out damp filters."
"
Fill a large container with water.,
Add a splash of bleach.,
Soak the filter in the diluted bleach for 10 minutes.,
Rinse and dry the filter.",How to Clean a Humidifier Filter3," Run a couple gallons of lukewarm water into a sink or bucket. Since you’ll be working with bleach, you’ll need a higher concentration of water than you would when cleaning with vinegar. Make sure there’s nothing in your work area that might be damaged by spilled bleach.


Bleach will need to be used to clean humidifier filters with extensive mold or mildewing.Avoid using hot water, as steam can cause the release of bleach fumes., You’ll only need to use about a teaspoon of bleach for every gallon of water. This will sufficiently dilute the bleach so that it can be used as an effective yet non-harmful cleaning agent. Be careful not to overdo it—too much bleach may eat right through a plastic filter.When handling bleach, always wear gloves and work in a well-ventilated area. If possible, equip a respirator and eye protection.Avoid coming into contact with the bleach solution with bare skin.

, Dunk the dirty filter into the solution and make sure it’s fully submerged. Bleach has potent cleaning and sterilizing properties, so no scrubbing is necessary. After a short soak, your humidifier filter will look as good as new.If there’s any mold, mildew or mineral deposits remaining after the initial soak, mix up a fresh batch of solution and soak the filter for another 10 minutes., Carefully remove the now-clean filter from the bleach solution and rinse it under warm water. Turn the filter slowly and aim the stream so that it flows through the filter from every angle. This will ensure that it comes out free of both mold and bleach. Air dry the filter, then return it to the humidifier.You can also make sure the filter has been properly rinsed by swishing it through a sinkful of clean water.
It’s important that you wash away every remaining trace of bleach, or it could be released into the air when you operate your humidifier again."

Use the wrench to tighten the nuts at the top of the valve.

, If you do, you will need to remove them and replace them with a regular cap to turn them off.


Use the caps that came with your radiator or use caps from a nearby radiator if they will only be used for a short time.
Screw the caps on tight by hand and then with an adjustable wrench., Along with proper precaution, it will prevent damage to your room.

,,, Turn it counterclockwise until it starts to drip water. Keep turning until the flow is slightly larger.

, Unscrew it a little more when the flow stops. When you have no more water coming out, you can unscrew the cap nuts completely so that the radiator is no longer connected to the base.

Do a visual check of your heating/hot water systems every month or so.,
Look for any gauges, namely dials with needles indicating pressure and temperature.,
Check the filters.,
Vacuum dirt and dust around the sides and bottom of your heating and hot water appliances.,
Be aware of potential hazards for gas sourced heating.,
Find a local well respected heating company in your area to associate with.,
Consider updating your heating system.,
Expect a lot from your heating system.",How to Keep Your Heating System Efficient," This will go a long way to knowing that all is well in heating land.


Check for moisture, dust and dirt under or around your equipment systems. Moisture or rust is a definite sign that you need to have a check-up done by a professional familiar with the equipment.;
, These are good things to be aware of and what they should read. Ask your servicer about what they should indicate and what to look for. A little knowledge of your heating system's working process goes a long way to preventing problems in the future.

, One of the most important things you can do to maintain a forced air heating system is a quarterly check of your air filter. If there is a slight build up of dust on the filter, change it or wash it, depending on what type it is. If you don't know where it is, call for a maintenance and have a technician show you, or a neighbor if you are not so mechanically inclined. This pays back in spades for efficiency, longevity and comfort from your furnace.

, This prevents such material from entering into the combustion process when your equipment is running.


Do not stick hoses or brushes of any type into the appliances while cleaning, as you may damage something.

, If, for any reason, you start to notice any pungent smells or see moisture on windows or walls in the vicinity of your furnace or anywhere else that is not normal, this could indicate a dangerous condition where sometimes old brick chimneys clog up or the inside of heating/hot water equipment has become blocked. If this should occur, call your local utility and or servicer and don't run the equipment until they confirm that it is safe to do so. This can be an emergency condition where you should not even be in the house. This isn't being alarmist but you need to be alert. This does not apply to an all-electric house.


Another very helpful protection to this is to have CO detectors on every floor of your home. This is not 100 percent protection but it goes a long way towards ensuring safety first.

, Look at reviews for heating companies, talk to their service manager. Find out rates, get comparisons. Try to find one who charges fairly by the hour, plus parts. Flat rate pricing does not always work out in your favor. Sometimes it sounds good upfront but in the long run, the price is usually fairer in time and materials.

, If your system is  20 or more years old (sometimes less), you are probably due for an updated heating unit. If it is an old cast iron boiler, they can go for 40 plus years, if kept up, although they are less efficient than the new high efficiency ones available today. Just bear in mind that with high efficiency comes more complex, more expensive parts to maintain and repair as they get to a few years old. Be aware that all new units are not all created equal. Some are much less reliable. Make sure whoever is installing the equipment services them also, this makes for a better installation as they know the problems that do arise with poorly installed equipment.

, A warm and comfortable house is a wonderful thing.  A heating system should not be problematic, should be quiet and not very noticeable when running. Although if you have an old heating system and are putting in a new furnace, the technician cannot be a miracle worker when he or she is just replacing the furnace (heart) and the arteries may not be optimum. The arteries are what get the heat out to the extremities––if they were not done well originally they will still not perform better than before the heart was replaced. This to be a good analogy of how a heating system performs. If you have all the pipes and ducts replaced, then you can expect a fully functioning system, as the the whole body has been redone.

Finish the project.",How to Install a Gas Fireplace," Be sure to consider a variety of factors when deciding where your fireplace should go. The fireplace should enhance the design and character of the room but it should also be placed where installation of a gas line, an electrical circuit, and an exhaust pipe will be most convenient if at all possible.


It is usually easiest to install stand alone gas fireplace on an exterior wall, as the venting pipe can go straight out the wall. Also remember that the pipe will need to go between studs, so you should take that into consideration when picking an exact location.;
, There are many styles to choose from. It may be helpful to go to a fireplace showroom, so that you can see all the different styles that are available to you.


It may be easiest to order all the parts you will need for your exhaust piping when ordering your fireplace. This will include pipe between the fireplace and the wall, a wall-pass-through, and exterior pieces for the pipe.

, The actual fireplace unit is fairly small and it is dangerous to have it sit directly on the floor. To get the fireplace off of the floor, you will need to build a platform. Use materials that match the décor of the room but that will create a non-combustible surface for the fireplace to sit on. This could include masonry or ceramic tiles for example.


Fireplace companies may have pre-made platforms for you to purchase. It may be most convenient to order a platform when you order your fireplace.
Be sure to consult any manufacturers instructions regarding how the platform should be installed and what it can be made from.
You will also need to allow for any clearance around the fireplace that is required by the manufacturer's instructions. This will probably include clearances from combustible surfaces in the room and positioning so that the exhaust pipe can be appropriately installed.

, When you have found the spot in the room where you want to place the fireplace and placed the platform, set the fireplace on top of the platform. Make sure that it has the clearance it needs from any combustible materials and that its position looks good in the room.

, Attach as much as you can up to the section that goes through the wall. This will allow you to figure out where the hole through your wall should go exactly.


You will begin by attaching a straight pipe to the starting collar on top of the fireplace using stove cement. Different fireplaces require different gaskets to completely attach the pipe to the collar. Be sure to follow manufacturer's instructions for this step.
Once you are able to determine where the hole for the exhaust pipe will go, use a pencil to trace a circle around the pipe at the wall. Then move the fireplace platform and the fireplace out of the way so you can have easier access the wall when cutting the hole.

, This hole should be the size of the wall-pass-through that came with you ordered with your stove. The pass through is designed to keep all heat away from combustible wall materials, making it a very important part of keeping risk of fire damage at a minimum.


Before just cutting all the way through your wall, make sure that there are no electrical lines or pipes in the area you are cutting out. Use a drywall saw to carefully cut a square hole around the tracing you made. Remove the drywall so that you can see into the wall, making sure all utilities are clear from the area.
Drill a hole from the inside through the outside wall to show you where the corners are on the outside of the wall. If your wall-pass-through is square, it's easiest to drill a small hole at each corner.
On the outside wall, use the appropriate tools based on your materials to complete the hole you started on the inside.

, The framing you insert will create a base on which the pass-through can be attached. Follow manufacturer's instructions when determining materials and size to make the finished hole.

, Inside the house, put high-temperature caulk on the inside surfaces of the hole you created. Install the wall-pass-through by pushing it into the hole, which will press it into the caulk and make a seal around the pass-through. Then screw it into place., Install all remaining piping inside and outside of the house.


Place the stove back onto the platform and secure all piping between the stove and the wall-pass-through, always following manufacturer's instructions.
Use high-temperature caulk to seal the area around the pipe and the fire stop.
Outside, install the exterior fire stop and drip cap using appropriate tools for your type of exterior wall.

, Depending on where you placed your fireplace, you may need to run new electrical outlets and you will almost certainly need to run a new gas line. Unless you are qualified to handle these steps yourself, hire a licensed contractor to complete them.

, While many gas fireplaces do not need a mantle or frame around them, some will. A decorated lumber frame, including surrounds, mantel, hearth, and any wood decorations you want, will help the fireplace and surrounding area to match the rest of the room. See How to Install a Fireplace Mantel for more information on how to build a frame around your new fireplace.


Remember to follow manufacturer's recommendations for maintaining space between the fireplace and the frame. This is very important!

, Replace any drywall you removed during the project and paint or otherwise finish the fireplace frame and wall to make it match the room.

Plan the installation based façade material.,
Purchase the correct Tyvek product.,
Position the Tyvek.,
Unroll and attach the Tyvek.,
Cover doors and windows.,
Overlap additional rolls of Tyvek to cover the whole wall.,
Cut off excess Tyvek.,
Cut out windows in an X shape.,
Cut out doors in a capital i shape.,
Seal the wall wherever necessary.",How to Install Tyvek1," Building codes and material manufacturers recommend adjustments when installing Tyvek under certain materials, for maximum air and water barrier effectiveness. Consider these tips if you plan to use these materials over the Tyvek, as they affect your construction plans or the amount of Tyvek you need to buy:









Stucco and stone veneer do best with two layers of Tyvek.

Brick and foam sheathing should have an air space between it and the Tyvek.
Other materials may be installed as usual, although measures that reduce moisture in contact with the Tyvek are always recommended.;
, Tyvek HomeWrap is suitable for most residential houses. Tyvek ThermaWrap will also help maintain desirable indoor temperatures, while Tyvek DrainWrap includes vertical grooves for increased drainage when high moisture is expected. If you are constructing a commercial building, or a building more than four stories tall, consult an experienced construction expert or DuPont representative for information on more specialized products, such as Tyvek Fluid or high-performance Tyvek. Purchasing Tyvek tape as well is recommended to help seal your wall more effectively, as described below.









You may be able to purchase your Tyvek with stud marks printed on the surface at a specified width, which will make it easier to line up with your wall.

, Begin by placing an edge of Tyvek at one end of the wall, leaving a 6–12 inch (15–30 cm) overlap over the corner. If stud marks are printed on your Tyvek product, line them up with the first stud of your wall. The first roll should be plumb with the bottom edge of the wall.









If the wall has not yet been raised, let the Tyvek overhang the bottom edge of the wall and fasten it there with Tyvek tape or sealant., Unroll so the Tyvek is taut, but not so much that it gets stretch marks or tears when fastened. Have a second person secure the Tyvek with a fastener every 6–18 inches (15-46 cm), over the wall studs.Choose your fastener depending on the material you are covering:









Over masonry, temporarily attach with vertical strips of an adhesive containing polyethylene, elastomeric, or latex, roughly 24 in. (61 cm) apart. Once the whole roll is attached, use cladding fasteners to attach it permanently.
Over wood, gypsum board, and most other wall materials, use large head or washer head nails.
Unless installing over foam sheathing, you may use staples with at least 1 in. (2.5 cm) crowns.

, Ideally, install Tyvek before installing the doors, windows, or window flashing.However, no matter what stage of construction these areas have reached, you may cover them completely with the Tyvek while first installing. You will make adjustments to these areas once the wall is covered as described below.








, If the wall is higher than the width of the Tyvek roll, unroll additional Tyvek higher than the first, moving upward. Overlap the Tyvek rolls by at least 6 inches (30 cm). Make sure to cover the entire wall surface thoroughly, or air and water protection could be significantly reduced.









Use portable scaffolding, not a ladder, when covering Tyvek over high areas. Tyvek rolls are slippery and large, so secure footing is highly recommended when handling them.

, Use a sharp box cutter or utility knife to remove excess Tyvek from around the wall. Make sure to fasten the Tyvek in place at the end of the wall before cutting, including along unusually shaped areas of the wall such as gables.








, Cut a large X from one corner diagonally from one corner to the other. Now fold the flaps to the inside and tack them down. If window flashing or a window apron has already been installed, instead cut out the entire outline of the window. Take care not to cut into the flashing itself, if it has been constructed out of a flexible material.








, Cut an opening for the doors shaped like a capital ""i,"" including the top and bottom horizontal bars of the letter. Cut from the corners of the door openings to each corner of the ""I,"" with the top and bottom of the ""I"" located approximately 8 inches (20.32 cm) above and below the door opening. Once the cut has been made, fold the Tyvek over the door openings and tack it down on the inside of the framing.








, Use Tyvek tape or a sealant product vetted for Tyvek to cover any areas that require additional protection, forming an airtight seal. Be sure to apply tape or sealant to the following areas:









The entire outline window openings except the sill (base).
Vertical and horizontal seams where Tyvek rolls overlap.
Any tears, puncture marks, or other damage the Tyvek suffered during installation. Larger holes may need a small piece of Tyvek wrap taped over them.

Purchase Tyvek FlexWrap.,
Check the slope.,
Clean the sill.,
Cut the FlexWrap.,
Apply primer in certain conditions.,
Lay out the FlexWrap.,
Stretch and fasten the FlexWrap over the corners.,
Make adjustments while install the window or door.",How to Install Tyvek2," This is a Tyvek product that can easily be stretched to cover the corners of window and door openings. Choose a width, typically 7–9 inches (18–23 cm) that can easily cover the sill and provide a couple inches (several centimeters) of overlap. While ordinary Tyvek wrap is typically cheaper, it will not provide as durable and effective a water barrier for window sills.








, The windowsill should be level or sloped slightly outward, to provide adequate drainage. If it is sloped inward or sloped severely in either direction, install a sloped sill pan before continuing.







, Wipe the sill and surrounding surfaces with a dry cloth to remove all moisture, grease, dust, and frost from the area.







, Cut the FlexWrap at least 12 in. (30 cm) longer than the sill surface. This extra space ensures the entire sill will still be covered once the Tyvek FlexWrap is stretched around it and fastened.








, Primer is only necessary in areas of severe weather conditions, severe cold temperatures, or certain building materials. Apply primer if the sill is made from concrete, masonry, or fiber-faced exterior gypsum board. DuPont, the manufacturer of Tyvek, recommends using a DuPont-approved primer for this purpose, such as the following:








SIA 655 or Perma-grip 105 (Henkel)
Hi-Strength 90 (made by 3M)
Butyl Primer (Denso)

, Place the Tyvek FlexWrap over the sill, so it completely covers the base and hangs over the surrounding vertical sides. Do not stretch the Tyvek while laying it across the sill. Smooth it out with your hand or a roller to make it flat and even.








, Hold the FlexWrap in place over the sill, then pull one corner to stretch it onto the surrounding wall surface. Use a staple, washer head nail, or other fastener to attach the FlexWrap over the wall. Repeat for the remaining corners.








, Follow the window or door manufacturer's instructions for installation. However, make sure not to caulk the FlexWrap base of the sill. After installation, you can provide additional protection by installing FlexWrap strips over the exterior jambs (sides), then cover them with a strip over the head (top) of the window.

Research the equipment you want to use to install central heating in your home.,
Create a map of the central heating system you want to install.,
Buy all necessary parts to install central heating.

,
Install the radiators.,
Lay the pipes from the radiators and faucets to the boiler.,
Install the control system.,
Shut off the water and gas supply and install the boiler.,
Commission the central heating system by closing all of the vents on the radiators, filling the system with water and allowing each radiator to vent through.",How to Install Central Heating,"

Choose a gas boiler that is large enough to heat your home and supply hot water to the sinks and bathtub, yet isn't too large. Choosing a boiler that is too large will result in higher monthly expenses due to loss of heat from the boiler. If you feel this is an issue, then consider purchasing a new energy efficient boiler.



 


Select radiators that offer adequate heating capacity while complementing the interior of your home. The most effective types of radiators use fins to radiate heat into the air.






Choose a control system that comes with clear instructions for installation. If you're not sure it's clear enough, call the manufacturer and ask for a detailed description of the installation process.






Gas boilers and radiators include specifications about their heating capacity. Make sure you choose parts that add to a total heating capacity that is adequate for your home.






When assessing the necessary heating capacity, remember to take into account that windows, doors and exterior walls all loose heat in the colder seasons.





;
, This will serve as a blueprint for installing all of the separate parts.


Plan to install your boiler at a spot in your home that allows for easy connection to the water pipes, as well as the gas main, and offers a ventilation shaft to the roof.






When choosing where to install radiators, it's important to note that most radiators are installed beneath windows to combat heat loss through the window. However, if your windows reach to the floor, place the radiators adjacent to the window for the most effective heat control.






Plan to lay the pipes either along the walls or under the floor. If you're going to lay them under the floor, make sure to clearly mark where they will be so you don't hammer nails through them when laying the flooring.







,, They'll need to be about 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) from the floor to leave room for the valves to the pipes and allow for cleaning. Install a wheel valve on the flow connection and a lock shield valve on the return connection. This allows you to regulate the water flow.

, You'll need copper pipes with either compression or capillary joints. Make sure the pipes vent to the radiators in order to avoid air locks and malfunctioning of the system.

, Follow the manufacturer's instructions.

, Again, follow all of the manufacturer's instructions. Remember to have a certified contractor perform the connection to the gas main.

, Activate the heating pump and re-vent the system. Then switch on the boiler and balance the flow of heated water to each radiator by using the lock shield valves.

Increase the efficiency of your radiator.,
Cover wooden or tile floors with carpeting or rugs.,
Open your blinds to let the sun in during the day.,
Invest in curtains with thermal lining.,
Watch out for draughts.,
Shut up rooms that you don't use.,
Consider insulating your home yourself.,
Get warmer sheets.,
Turn off those bathroom fans.,
Try arranging your furniture differently.",How to Keep Warm1," Move furniture away from your radiators. Opt for curtains that don’t wrap around the radiator. You should avoid putting anything on the radiator itself at all costs, but placing a shelf above it, if you have room for it, can help stop the air from rising directly above it and can bring more warmth to your home.


Better yet, place a layer of heat reflective aluminum behind your radiator. If the radiator is connected to an outside wall, the heat will reflect into the room, instead of absorbing into the wall itself.;
, Carpeting is a great way to insulate your floors. If you like the look of hardwood floors, buy an area rug to use in the winter. Any exposed wood will be less effective at trapping heat than a nice, warm rug; in fact, up to 10% of heat lost in homes comes from the uninsulated floors.

, Close them immediately when the sun goes down to lock the heat in your house.

, If you like your current curtains, purchase thermal lining at your local fabric store. Attach a layer to the back of the curtains with self-adhesive Velcro, and then remove the lining in the spring. If you don't want to pay up for new curtains, you can line them yourself with cheap fleece or other less costly materials.You can also place curtains in front of doors or smaller windows to add more protection from the cold.

, The letter box on your front door may be letting in the cold; put up an extra barrier in front of it and find another place to receive your mail. If you have a chimney but aren't using it, you can also invest in a chimney balloon to keep it from letting in the cold and releasing the warmth in your home. Also, if you frequently step out to smoke or just have people going in and out of the house all the time, make sure that the door is open for as little time as possible.If you want to get fancy, you can even invest in (or make) a draught excluder, which is a stuffed piece of material made of cotton that is placed at the bottom of doors to keep out the cold. Sometimes they are shaped like little dachshunds or have cute patterns like stars or hearts on them, and they can add a nice decorative element to your home.

, If you have a larger home with one or more rooms that you don't use regularly (such as a guest room), then keeping those doors closed will help the rest of your home keep warm because the unused rooms won't be using up the warm air circulating throughout the house., Though insulating your home professionally can get expensive, doing it yourself can be done as well, as long as you're prepared, and it can make a big impact on the temperature in your home. You can use things like rolls of foam, mineral wool, glass fibre, and recycled paper products. Just make sure that you wear goggles or a face mask and protective clothing when you do it., Investing in a down comforter, flannel sheets, and some extra blankets and pillows can go a long way in keeping you warm when you sleep. Though it may cost some extra money up front, you'll find that you won't have to turn up the thermostat as high as you normally do when you sleep., Exhaust fans in your bathrooms, as well as in your kitchens, actually pull hot hair that rises to the ceiling out of your home, which is the last thing you want when you're trying to stay warm. If you do use them, then make sure you only do it when it's really necessary., You may not know it, but the way you have your furniture arranged may be keeping you cold. Avoid placing furniture directly in front of a large window, or pushed up against an outside wall, or you'll feel colder when you sit on it than if it were placed in a more central, warmer part of the house.

Heat yourself, instead of heating the room.,
Make soup and tea a regular part of your diet.,
Eat nuts.,
Work out.,
Snuggle with your loved one.,
Take a warm bath.,
Spend time with friends.",How to Keep Warm2," If you want to stay warm while saving money on heating bills, invest in an electric blanket or heating pad that you can sit on or wrap around yourself as you snuggle on the couch or work at your computer. This will not only save money, but can prevent power outages in cold areas where everyone is using his or her thermostat.You can find fairly efficient warming mats for outdoor pets. Place the warming mat on your chair and a wool blanket over your lap to create a warmer environment.
At night, use a hot water bottle. You can purchase them for $10 or less online.
Also, wearing an extra layer of clothing, such as leggings under your pants, or a wool sweater, can go a long way in keeping you warm inside your own home.
Instead of turning your thermostat up higher, turn it on earlier to give your house time to heat up. You may be making it hotter than necessary because you want your home to get warm as soon as possible.

, Hot water and broth raise the temperature of your hands as you hold the bowl or cup. Then they heat your body from the inside for 30 minutes. Drink a cup of tea in the morning to get warm as you get out of bed and include soup into your lunch or dinner plans.

, High protein levels and healthy fats increase circulation. People with low iron levels should take extra care to eat foods rich in protein and improve their circulation.


You should also consider throwing some ginger into that nutty trail mix. Ginger has been shown to get blood circulation going and to raise your temperature as well., Exercise also improves your circulation. Whether you exercise at home, in a gym or in the snow, doing 30 minutes per day will keep you warmer inside and out. This will keep your body temperature higher than normal even after you have finished your workout., If you're feeling cold, just cuddle up on the couch with your loved one, spending some time getting close. Just the act of snuggling and touching another person creates warmth. Soon, you'll stop feeling chilly and will feel your body -- and your heart -- getting warmer.

, Studies show that the body temperature naturally lowers when you get ready for bed, so you can counteract this by taking a nice warm bath a few hours before bed to raise your body temperature. If you take a warm bath right before bed, it might actually make your body temperature too hot, leading to a restless sleep, but taking a warm bath a few hours before sleeping should do the trick., One study found that being by yourself literally makes you colder, and that spending time with friends will help you get warmed up. The next time you're deciding between a date at home with your electric blanket and a day out with your friends, decide in your friends' favor if you want to stay warm."

Stay hydrated.,
Invest in base-layers.,
Keep your feet dry.,
Wear mittens.,
Heat your torso.,
Reduce the amount of skin you have exposed.,
Purchase an engine heater.",How to Keep Warm3," The more hydrated you are, the better your body will be able to control your temperature. Better yet, grab a hot green tea or herbal tea to heat your body up before you go out., Choose undershirts and leggings that wick moisture away from the skin. Synthetic layers are less bulky and more efficient than wool or thick cotton.


If it’s been a while since you have updated your long-underwear, many brands like Uniqlo, Cuddle Duds, and REI are offering extremely comfortable and form-fitting layers that can go under work or workout clothes.

, The best way to stay warm is to keep your body from getting wet. Always wear waterproof, insulated boots when you go out into rain or snow. Wearing thick, protective socks can make a big difference, too. If you know you'll be out for a while, pack an extra pair of socks in your coat pocket -- if your socks get wet, you'll be cold for the rest of the time you're out.

, They keep your fingers together, conserving body heat. Gloves restrict your hands and your circulation, resulting in colder fingertips, though wearing gloves is better than not covering your hands at all.

, Invest in a down coat and take a thick sweater. The warmer your torso is, the warmer your extremities will be. That's why packing on those extra winter pounds is a great way to stay warm during the winter.


When your temperature in your torso drops, your body will draw circulation away from your extremities. If it needs to, your body will sacrifice a few fingers and toes to frostbite in order to save your life., Purchase a balaclava that covers the majority of your face, wear hats, thick socks and mittens. Exposed skin can get frostbite quickly. Forget the myth that says that 70% of your body heat is released from your head; instead, focus on having as little exposed skin as possible if you want to stay warm., If you rely on your car for a commute in cold weather, invest $30 to $50 to plug in your engine overnight. Your car will be more likely to start in the morning and when you get out of work.

A 12 foot (3.7 m) by 12 foot (3.7 m) room has 144 sq/ft. Assuming a ceiling height less than 8 feet (2.4 m), this room should be heated comfortably with 1500 watts of heat. 1500 watts of heat is a total of 6 feet (1.8 m) of heat, assuming ""standard density"" baseboard heaters are selected for installation. Standard density heat is rated at 250 watts per foot. There is one other type of heat called ""high density"" (HD). HD heat has more than the 250 watts per foot that the standard density heat has, but does not heat quicker nor is operated for any less. HD merely provides more heat with a smaller footprint., All of the considerations above (windows type and number, insulation, etc.) will come into play when purchasing heaters. The baseline wattage should be increased by up to 100% if the room suffers from all of the considerations. It is important to note that adding additional heaters will not increase the cost of operation. Additional heaters allow the room to maintain desired temperature during the colder days, as opposed to having the minimum heat (or baseline) installed. If only the baseline calculated amount of heat were installed, it would not be able to replace the heat as quickly as it was lost due to lack of insulation, single pane windows, etc. A room that ideally requires 1500 watts of heat might need as much as 3000 watts if it suffers from all the issues listed above. This applies to ALL types of heat (and cooling in the summer for that matter), regardless of fuel type or technology. Insulation is inexpensive over the long run., The heat can be installed one of two ways. In the example room, install (1) 1500 watt heater or install 2 or more heaters totaling 1500 watts. The latter method can be employed for rooms at the corners of a building - having 2 exterior walls. Typically, heaters are installed below windows, where most of the heat loss occurs. Adding more watts of heat will allow the room to reach the desired temperature faster than if no additional watts of heat were installed., Installing 240 volt heaters is best as wire sizes and number of circuits are significantly reduced. The National Electrical Code allows a 15 amp circuit to carry up to 12 amps, and a 20 amp circuit may carry up to 16 amps. The total watts allowed to be connected can be determined simply by multiplying volts by amps only because this is a purely resistive AC circuit (AC wattage calculations are much more complex for inductive and capacitive reactant circuits that exist in appliances and electronics). The 15 amp circuit is 240 x 12 = 2880 watts. The 20 amp circuit is 240 x 16 = 3840 watts. This is a maximum of 14 and 19 feet of 240 volt, standard density heat, respectively., The thermostat should be located on an interior wall. It should never be located above a heater or other heat source, or in a dead air space such as behind a door., Cut the wall open with knife or hand saw., This may require fishing or snaking of the cable between the points, and will probably be most time consuming. For this reason, many times a single heater sized to heat the entire space is often selected so that fishing or snaking is minimized. Indicate this cable as the ""LINE"" so it can be determined as such after it has been installed in the box for the thermostat., Examine the heater(s) and remove BOTH front covers from both ends of each heater. Place the heater(s) against the wall at the desired location., Because they are provided, no box(es) need be installed in the wall. Simply create a small hole in the wall for the cable from which to emerge and pass through appropriate connectors at the back of one of the compartments to allow the cables to enter. Connections are to be made in the compartments. This is detailed below., Indicate this cable as the ""LOAD"" so it can be determined as such after it has been installed in the box for the thermostat., Continue to daisy-chain between successive heaters as needed.,, Push the cable into the connector until 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of the jacket is inside the wiring compartment.,,,,,,,,,,,, Connect ALL the bare and any green wires together with a wirenut. Install a short piece (8"") of bare wire between the bare and green wires to the green screw on the thermostat if it is not already connected., Carefully inspect the thermostat for ""LINE"" and/or ""LOAD"" markings., Each of the black and white wires from the panel must connect to one LINE wire or terminal. Under no circumstances should the black and white wire from the panel be connected together., Connect it in the same manner as the LINE side.,"

Practice switching the boiler controls to off before attempting to top up the pressure.

,
Make sure the pressure gauge can be monitored whilst accessing the filling loop.,
Keep an eye on the pressure gauge as it slowly creeps up to the green area or the 1.5 bar marker.,
Turn the handles back into the original position.

",How to Increase and Manage the Pressure in Your Combination Boiler," Combination boilers work on what’s known as sealed central heating systems. Meaning they are completely free of Tanks, and natural air supply. This is essential not least because if a mains water holding component within that boiler became defective and thus enters the Heating side of the boiler there would be potential for all sorts of problems with floods in the loft area and much more. There are many advantages of sealed central heating systems. So we need to manually regulate the amount of water actually circulating your radiators. And this is achieved through a filling loop, usually located close to the combination boiler.;
,,, The biggest mistake that can be made is over pressurizing the boiler; this is usually caused by not monitoring the gauge as you increase the pressure. If this is not achievable then ask for a friend or family member to assist by looking at the gauge as you take care of the filling loop.


The ideal pressure for any sealed system is 1.5bar (displayed on the pressure gauge).
The filling loop will have a silver flexible tube with two handles on each side of it. When the handles are in the off position they will be across the flow of the pipe. You will need to slowly turn them so that they straighten up in line with the pipe.

By now you should hear the water flowing through into the boiler.



, Anywhere between 1 bar and 2.2 bar is fine.

Conceal radiators under a desk or vanity.,
Stash radiators in multi-purpose covers.,
Tuck away radiators under covers with cut designs.,
Unify hardwood home themes with a wood cover.",How to Cover a Radiator1," This technique may be impossible for radiators that are especially tall. However, smaller radiators usually fit neatly beneath regular sized desks and vanities.


This is an especially good idea if you work at your desk frequently and suffer from coldness in your feet and toes.
If your radiator is of the tall variety, use a tall accent table, like one intended to display photos, knickknacks, plants, and so on, to hide it.;
, Multi-purpose radiator covers really help to optimize space in your home. Some radiator covers have built in shelves for displaying personal items or holding books. Storage bench radiator covers, sometimes called banquettes, will give you extra space to stash items while creating a cozy sitting area.If there’s an avid reader in your household, a banquette can be a warm and pleasant place to wind down with a book.
When looking for a multi-purpose radiator cover, try doing an online keyword search for things like, “radiator cover bookshelf,” “radiator cover storage bench,” and “radiator cover banquette.”, There are companies that use lasers to cut designs into metal radiator covers. Some designs are stock varieties, while others are made-to-order. These designs range in complexity.


Some examples of these kinds of designs include simple line motifs, repeating diamond patterns, or more elaborate classic screens.
When searching for these kinds of services, try a keyword search for “laser cut radiator covers.”
You may be able to find a non-laser based personalized radiator cover provider by searching instead for “personalized radiator covers” or “made to order radiator covers.” These may be expensive., Especially if your household has wood flooring or accents, choosing a similar kind of wood radiator cover will allow it to blend in seamlessly. Two common kinds of wood cover you might want to look into include:


Bamboo, which matches many kinds of light colored wood well. Staining this wood is a good way of modifying its color, should you need to.
Oak, which is naturally darker than bamboo. Oak can also be modified to better fit the tone of your existing wood with proper staining."
"
Match your home color scheme with a decorative cover.,
Add a classic appeal to your radiator with marble.,
Extend built in features to cover your radiator.,
Integrate covered radiators with bookshelves.",How to Cover a Radiator2," There are many simple radiator covers that you can likely find at your local hardware store, big box home center (like Lowe’s, Home Depot, etc.), or online. Though these designs may seem run of the mill, they often come in various colors, which means you can choose the one that best matches your home’s color scheme., If you don’t mind the look of your radiator but want to dress it up a little, use a marble radiator cover. This small slab of marble will not hide your radiator from view, but it’ll give the radiator a more a classic appearance. This look would likely work well in places like bathrooms and kitchens.


Be sure to only do this for suitable, sturdy radiators. Marble is quite heavy. Installing your marble cover on unstable radiators could result in damage or harm., If you can extend the surface of an existing feature in your home so it overhangs your radiator, this can effectively camouflage your radiator. Prime features you can use in this way include things like counters, sills, and so on. Similarly, you can top and hide radiators under material similar to that used in desktops, sills, and shelves in a room. This will make the radiator seem like a natural part of the room's decor., Bookshelves generally have a rectangular or square shape, much like radiator covers. Because of these similarities, covered radiators can often be easily integrated with bookshelves. This will make covered radiators less obtrusive."
"
Prevent direct contact with your radiator.,
Prioritize cover material that is well ventilated.,
Leave ample margin between covers and radiators.",How to Cover a Radiator3," Heat can cause some materials to warp, peel, or otherwise degrade. Many kinds of plastic, in particular, should not be put in close contact with your radiator. This will often cause the plastic to bend and change shape.


Heat resistant padding can be used to create a safe barrier between sensitive material and direct contact with a radiator.
A cloth, like a towel, specially designed heat resistant fabric (like potholders), and flame retardant fabric can be laid on top of radiators to protect covers from direct contact heat damage.
Wood, for example, is often susceptible to heat damage. If you plan on laying wood on top of your radiator to create extra shelf space, suitable cloth padding can help maintain its condition for longer.

, The purpose of your radiator is to provide heat to your home. A radiator cover with poor ventilation can greatly diminish the spread of heat throughout your home, which can be especially uncomfortable in northern or mountain climates.


If you love a particular cover but it doesn’t have good airflow, you may be able to improve this situation by using a small fan.
Most covers will decrease the heat output of your radiator, some as much as 30%. Improved ventilation will decrease heat loss., Some radiator covers are built out of special, heat resistant or fireproof material. These will require little to no space between the cover and radiator. Other materials, like wood covers, should be larger than your radiator so that the cover does not come into contact with the radiator on any side.


Radiator covers should come with care and user instructions. Always follow these for the safest, best results. If your cover did not come with instructions, look up the product online and find out that way.

Locate the access panel on the outside of the furnace.,
Remove the filter by pulling it up and out of the tracks.,
Inspect the filter for dirt or damage.,
Place the new or newly cleaned filter back into the furnace.,
Remember to inspect your filter regularly.,
Unplug your furnace.,
Remove the front panel of the furnace.,
Slide the fan unit out of the furnace.Most fans are secured to the furnace by a track, which allows it to slide in and out easily.,
Clean the blower assembly.,
Vacuum the assembly.,
Put the fan blower assembly back into the furnace.,
Turn the furnace off.,
Clear any dirt off of the block.,
Vacuum the block assembly.",How to Clean a Furnace," This is below the return-air duct, between the blower system and the duct. Usually, the filter is found inside the front of the furnace.You may need to unscrew the front panel from the furnace or remove it from hooks that hold it in place in order to access the filter. Your furnace filter may also have its own access door.


Make sure to turn of the furnace and/or HVAC system before opening it.;
, Generally, the filter should come out quite easily. To prevent damage to the filter and/or furnace, don’t force the filter out. If it seems stuck, look carefully and see if anything (like dirt or debris) is blocking it.

, If the filter appears dirty, it needs to be cleaned or replaced, depending upon the filter type.If you are unsure whether your filter is dirty, hold it up to the light, and look through it. If you cannot see the light, the filter is dirty and needs to be replaced. A dirty filter will circulate dirt and dust through your home instead of usable, clean air and will force your furnace to work harder to push air through the grime.
If your filter is not disposable, it must be cleaned. First remove any dirt or loose particles. Generally, a mild soap and tap water can then be used to rinse and wash the filter.Make sure to let the filter dry thoroughly before putting it back in the furnace.
Many furnaces use a disposable filter. If this applies to yours, take the old filter to a hardware or appliance store (or record the size and/or model number), and purchase a replacement filter of the same type or model.

, Slide the filter back into the furnace so that it fits securely. Then close the access door or reapply the furnace’s front panel using the hooks or screws.


If the filter doesn’t seem to fit properly, make sure that no dirt or debris is blocking it. If you have a new filter that doesn’t seem to fit right, double-check that you purchased the correct type or size.

, Furnace filters will need to be cleaned or replaced three or four times a year.Set reminders on your calendar to inspect yours regularly. For instance, you can check your filter on the first day of each season of the year., Make sure that all power sources that run to your furnace unit, including battery backup systems or electrically generated power, are unplugged.Failure to turn off any source of power before cleaning the assembly may result in electrocution and/or serious bodily injury.

, To clean the blower assembly, you will most likely have to remove the whole front panel, even if your furnace has an access door for cleaning the filter. To remove the panel, you may have to loosen the screws that hold the panel in place or take the panel off its supporting hinges.

, The fan may also be connected by wire connections. If so, make a note of where each wire connects to the fan before removing them. This will make it easier to reassemble the unit.


You can wrap a small piece of tape around each wire and label it, to make reassembly easier—just make sure to remove the tape labels before reattaching the wires to the blower fan.
Some fans are held in by screws or bolts; remove these with a screwdriver or ratchet in order to take the fan out. Keep the screws or bolts in a safe place so you won’t lose them before you are ready to put the fan back.

, A mild soap, and water are usually sufficient for cleaning the blower, although a toothbrush may help you to clean the fan blades and the small spaces between them.The blower assembly is the component that pulls air in through the back of the furnace, pushes it out of the front, and creates the heat. If the blower assembly is dirty, your furnace will push dust and dirt out through the vent system of your home. Thus, it is very important to clean the assembly well.

, Running a handheld vacuum on low power over the fan blades and belts will help ensure that all dirt is removed. If you do not have a vacuum, you can also wipe any belts clean with a damp cloth.

, Once the assembly is clean and thoroughly dry, slide it back onto its track so that it fits into the furnace again. If you had to disconnect any wires to remove the assembly, reattach them, making sure to connect them to the right location.


Remember to plug your furnace back in and turn it on after cleaning the fan blower assembly.

, Unplug all power connections running to your furnace. If it is a gas furnace, you should also turn the gas off., Use a brush to loosen the black build-up off of each chamber of the block. You can also use a damp cloth to remove this buildup., Using a narrow vacuum attachment, thoroughly clean all chambers of the heat exchanger block assembly.Using a vacuum will help ensure that all of the debris you loosened off of the assembly is removed.


Remember to plug your furnace back in and turn it on once you have finished cleaning and vacuuming the heat exchanger block.

Be wary of any filter capacitors or other elements that require an inrush (surge) current when switched on.",How to Use a Multimeter," This has the arc-shaped scales visible through the window and a pointer which will indicate the values read from the scale.The arc-shaped marks on the meter dial face may be different colors that indicate each scale, so they will have different values. These determine the ranges of magnitude.
A wider mirror-like surface shaped like the scales might also be present. The mirror is used to help reduce what's called ""parallax viewing error,"" by lining up the pointer with its reflection before reading the value the pointer is indicating. In the image, it appears as a wide gray strip between the red and black scales.
Many newer multimeters have digital readouts, rather than the analog scale. The function is basically the same, you'll just get a numerical readout.;
, This allows you to change the function between volts, ohms, and amps, and to change the scale (x1, x10, etc.) of the meter. Many functions have multiple ranges, so it's important to have both set correctly, otherwise serious damage to the meter or harm to the operator may result.


Some meters have an ""Off"" position on this selector switch while others have a separate switch to turn the meter off. The meter should be set to ""Off"" when stored and not in use.

, Most multimeters have several jacks used for this purpose.


One is usually labeled ""COM"" or (-), which stands for for common. This is where the black test lead will be connected. It will be used for nearly every measurement taken.
The other jack or jacks should be labeled ""V"" (+) and the Omega symbol (an upside down horseshoe) for Volts and Ohms, respectively.
The + and - symbols represent the polarity of probes when set for and testing DC volts. If the test leads were installed as suggested, the red lead would be positive as compared to the black test lead. This is nice to know when the circuit under test isn't labeled + or -, as is usually the case.
Many meters have additional jacks that are required for current or high-voltage tests. It is equally important to have the test leads connected to the proper jacks as it is to have the selector switch range and test type (volts, amps, ohms) set. All must be correct. Consult the meter manual if you're unsure which jacks should be used.

, There should be two test leads or probes. Generally, one is black and the other red. These are used to connect to whatever device you're planning on testing and measuring.

, This is usually found on the back, but is also sometimes on the side of some models. This holds the fuse (and possibly a spare), and the battery that supplies power to the meter for resistance tests.


The meter may have more than one battery and they may be of different sizes. A fuse is provided to help protect the meter movement. Likewise, there is often more than one fuse. A good fuse is required for the meter to function, and fully charged batteries will be required for resistance/continuity tests.

, This is a small knob usually located near the dial that is labeled ""Ohms Adjust,"" ""0 Adj,"" or something similar. This is used only in the ohms or resistance range, while the probes are shorted together (touching each other).


Rotate the knob slowly to move the needle as close to the 0 position on the Ohms scale as possible. If new batteries are installed, this should be easy to do - a needle that will not go to zero indicates weak batteries that should be replaced., Turn the meter on if it has a separate power switch. When multimeter measures resistance in ohms, it can not measure continuity because resistance and continuity are opposites. When there is little resistance, there will be a great deal of continuity, and vice versa. With this in mind, you can make assumptions about continuity based on the resistance values measured.


Find the Ohm scale on the dial. It is usually the top-most scale and has values that are highest on the left of the dial (""∞"" or a sideways ""8"" for infinity), gradually reducing to 0 on the right. This is opposite of the other scales, which have the lowest values on the left and increase going right., If the test leads are not in contact with anything, the needle or pointer of an analog meter will rest at the left-most position. This represents an infinite amount of resistance, or an ""open circuit."" It's safe to say there is the no continuity, or path between the black and red probes.

, Connect the black test lead to the jack marked ""Common"" or ""-"". Then, connect the red test lead to the jack marked with the Omega (Ohm symbol) or letter ""R"" near it.


Set the range (if provided) to R x 100.

, The meter pointer should move fully to the right. Locate the ""Zero Adjust"" knob and rotate it so that the the meter indicates ""0"" (or as close to ""0"" as possible).


Note that this position is the ""short circuit"" or ""zero ohms"" indication for this R x 1 range of this meter.
Always remember to ""zero"" the meter immediately after changing resistance ranges or you'll get a faulty reading.
If you're unable to obtain a zero ohm indication, this may mean the batteries are weak and should be replaced. Retry the zeroing step above again with fresh batteries.

, Locate the two electrical contact points of the bulb. They will be the threaded base and the center of the bottom of the base.


Have a helper hold the bulb by the glass only.
Press the black probe against the threaded base and the red probe against the center tab on the bottom of the base.
Watch the needle move from resting at the left and move quickly to 0 on the right.

, Change the range of the meter to R x 1. Zero the meter again for this range and repeat the step above. Observe how the meter did not go as far to the right as before. The scale of resistance has been changed so that each number on the R scale can be read directly.


In the previous step, each number represented a value that was 100 times greater. Thus, 150 really was 15,000 before. Now, 150 is just 150. Had the R x 10 scale been selected, 150 would have been 1,500. The scale selected is very important for accurate measurements.
With this understanding, study the R scale. It is not linear like the other scales. Values at the left side are harder to accurately read than those on the right. Trying to read 5 ohms on the meter while in the R x 100 range would look like 0. It would be much easier at the R x 1 scale instead. This is why when testing resistance, adjust the range so that the readings may be taken from the middle rather than the extreme left or right sides.

, Set the meter to the highest R x value possible and zero the meter.


Loosely hold a probe in each hand and read the meter. Squeeze both probes tightly. Notice the resistance is reduced.
Let go of the probes and wet your hands. Hold the probes again. Notice that the resistance is lower still.

, It's very important that the probes not touch anything other than the device being tested. A device that has burned out will not show ""open"" on the meter when testing if your fingers provide an alternate path around the device, like when they are touching the probes.


Testing round cartridge type and older style glass automotive fuses will indicate low values of resistance if the fuse is lying on a metal surface when under test. The meter indicates the resistance of the metal surface that the fuse is resting upon (providing an alternate path between the red and black probe around the fuse) instead of trying to determine resistance through the fuse. Every fuse in this case, good or bad, will indicate ""good,"" giving you a faulty analysis.

, Many times, the voltage to be measured has a value that is unknown. For this reason, the highest range possible is selected so that the meter circuitry and movement will not be damaged by voltage greater than expected.


If the meter were set to the 50 volt range and a common U.S. electrical outlet were to be tested, the 120 volts present could irreparably damage the meter. Start high and work downward to the lowest range that can be safely displayed.

, Insert the black probe in the ""COM"" or ""-"" jack. Next, insert the red probe in the ""V"" or ""+"" jack.

, There may be several Volt scales with different maximum values. The range chosen by the selector knob determines which voltage scale to read.


The maximum value scale should coincide with selector knob ranges. The voltage scales, unlike the Ohm scales, are linear. The scale is accurate anywhere along its length. It will of course be much easier accurately reading 24 volts on a 50 volt scale than on a 250 volt scale, where it might look like it is anywhere between 20 and 30 volts.

, In the US, you might expect 120 volts or even 240 volts. In other places, 240 or 380 volts might be expected.


Press the black probe into one of the straight slots. It should be possible to let go of the black probe, as the contacts behind the face of the outlet should grip the probe, much like it does when a plug is inserted.
Insert the red probe into the other straight slot. The meter should indicate a voltage very close to 120 or 240 volts (depending on type outlet tested).

, Rotate the selector knob to the lowest range offered that is greater than the voltage indicated (120 or 240).

, The meter may indicate between 110 and as much as 125 volts this time. The range of the meter is important to obtain accurate measurements.


If the pointer did not move, it is likely that DC was chosen instead of AC. The AC and DC modes are not compatible. The correct mode must be set. If not set correctly, the user would mistakenly believe there was no voltage present, which could be a dangerous mistake.
Be sure to try both modes if the pointer does not move. Set meter to AC volts mode, and try again.

, Whenever possible, try to connect at least one probe in such a way that it will not be required to hold both while making tests. Some meters have accessories that include alligator clips or other types of clamps that will assist doing this. Minimizing your contact with electrical circuits drastically reduces that chances of sustaining burns or injury.

, You need to determine whether or not the circuit is AC or DC by measuring the voltage of the circuit as described in previous steps.

, If the circuit to be tested is AC but the meter will only measure DC amps (or vice versa), stop. The meter must be able to measure the same mode (AC or DC) amps as the voltage in the circuit, otherwise it will indicate 0.


Be aware that most multimeters will only measure extremely small amounts of current, in the uA and mA ranges. 1 uA is .000001 amp and 1 mA is .001 amp. These are values of current that flow only in the most delicate electronic circuits, and are literally thousands (and even millions) of times smaller than values seen in the home and automotive circuits that most homeowners would be interested testing.
Just for reference, a typical 100W / 120V light bulb will draw .833 Amps. This amount of current would likely damage the meter beyond repair.

, Ideal for the homeowner, this meter were to be used to measure current through a 4700 ohm resistor across 9 Volts DC.


To do this, insert the black probe into the ""COM"" or ""-"" jack and insert the red probe into the ""A"" jack.
Shut off power to the circuit.
Open the portion of the circuit that is to be tested (one lead or the other of the resistor). Insert the meter in series with the circuit such that it completes the circuit. An ammeter is placed in series with the circuit to measure current. It cannot be placed ""across"" the circuit the way a voltmeter is used (otherwise the meter will probably be damaged).
Observe the polarity. Current flows from the positive side to the negative side. Set the range of current to the highest value.
Apply power and adjust range of meter downward to allow accurate reading of pointer on the dial. Do not exceed the range of the meter, otherwise it may be damaged. A reading of about 2 milliamps should be indicated since from Ohm's law I = V / R = (9 volts)/(4700 Ω) = .00191 amps = 1.91 mA.

, Even if the operating current is low and within the range of the meter fuse, the surge can be many times higher than the operating current, because the empty filter capacitors are almost like a short circuit. Blowing the meter fuse is almost certain if the DUT's (device under test) inrush current is many times higher than the fuses rating. In any case, always use the higher range measurement protected by the higher fuse rating and be careful.

Rinse the filter.,
Wash the water tank.,
Wipe down the frame.",How to Clean Out a Humidifier1," Unplug the humidifier first, then remove the filter. Hold it under the faucet and rinse it with cold water to wash away any impurities. Set it on a clean towel to dry while you clean the remaining parts.


Don't use cleaning solution to clean the filter. Chemicals can permanently damage the filter so that it will no longer work properly.
You may have a model of humidifier that requires you to change the filter every now and then. If this is the case, check the manufacturer's instructions and change the filter as often as is recommended.;
, Remove the tank from the humidifier and pour out the old water. Fill the tank with 3 cups of vinegar, swish it around so that it covers the bottom and sides of the tank, and let it sit for at least 1 hour. The vinegar acts as a natural cleanser that loosens buildup from the bottom of the water tank. Rinse the tank thoroughly when you're finished.


If necessary, use a scrub brush to scrub away some of the grime at the bottom of the water tank.
Using another type of cleaner could have negative consequences, since the liquid from the water tank gets pumped into the air. Stick with vinegar to make sure you're creating a safe environment for your family.
If the water tank does not have access for a brush, put in a few tablespoons of rice with the vinegar and cold water to make a loose slurry. Close the tank and agitate vigorously for a minute or so and then let stand for a while. Repeat until the grime has been dislodged. Rinse thoroughly to make sure all the grains are washed out.

, Use a sponge dampened with vinegar and water to wipe the remaining parts of the humidifier. This prevents dust and other debris from entering the water tank, and inhibits the growth of mold or bacteria.

Use a bleach and water solution.,
Use peroxide.,
Do a deep clean with vinegar.",How to Clean Out a Humidifier2," Pour a gallon of water and a teaspoon of bleach into the water tank. Let the solution sit in the tank for an hour to completely sanitize the inside of the tank. Pour out the solution and rinse with clean, cold water.


Be sure the tank has been thoroughly rinsed before you replace it on the humidifier frame.
Don't let the bleach sit in the humidifier for more than an hour, or it could damage the machine.

, Pour a few cups of peroxide into the water tank. Swish it around so that it covers the bottom and sides of the tank. Allow the peroxide to sit in the tank for an hour, then pour it out and rinse the tank with cold water.

, Fill the water tank with a cup of vinegar and a gallon of water. Plug it in outside and let the humidifier run for an hour. After an hour, pour out the remaining liquid from the tank, rinse it with clean water, then fill it with clean water and run the humidifier for another hour. Rinse out the tank one more time before using.


Don't run the humidifier indoors when you're using vinegar in the water tank. It will make your home smell like vinegar.
Don't use bleach or any other chemical to do a deep clean through the working part of the humidifier. Turning the humidifier on and running chemicals through the system could cause permanent damage.

Change the water often.,
Clean the humidifier every three days.When the humidifier is in heavy use during the winter or when a family member has a cold, clean it every three days with a simple vinegar or hydrogen peroxide rinse.,
Replace the humidifier when necessary.,
Keep the area around the humidifier dry.,
Store the humidifier properly.",How to Clean Out a Humidifier3," Leaving water to sit in the water tank for long periods of time causes mineral deposits to collect on the bottom and sides. The longer you leave the water sitting there, the more deposits will collect and the harder they'll be to remove.

, Do a deep clean every two weeks or so.

, Old humidifiers that have gotten a lot of use may start to break down over time. The worn-out parts will be more prone to hosting bacterial growth.


If you've had your humidifier for more than a five years or so, you might want to consider replacing it.
If you aren't ready to replace your older humidifier, make sure to clean it with bleach or peroxide every few weeks.

, If the humidifier is causing the area around it to become damp, turn it down. Surrounding the humidifier with dampness can lead to the growth of bacteria and mold.

, When it's time to put the machine away after the winter, clean it thoroughly and make sure it is completely dry before putting it away. When you take it out again next year, clean it again before using.

Replace the radiator.",How to Fix a Radiator," A sure sign that there’s an issue with your vehicle’s cooling system is finding a puddle of coolant under your vehicle. Remember that there are a number of fluids in your engine that could feasibly leak, so check closely to confirm if the puddle you find is coolant, oil, or possibly even just water from running the air conditioner.Touch the puddle with your finger, then wipe it on a white sheet of paper to see what color it really is.
If it is green or orange, it’s likely a coolant leak.;
, If you believe your vehicle may be leaking coolant, check the coolant reservoir in the engine bay. Most coolant reservoirs have “fill lines” labeled on the container that will let you know if the coolant levels are low in your vehicle. Check the coolant level in your vehicle and top it off with a water/coolant mixture if it appears to be low. Check it again after a few days to see if the level has changed.Make sure to check the coolant levels with the vehicle at about the same temperature each time (either warm from driving or cool from sitting).
Dropping coolant levels in conjunction with puddles means a coolant leak is very likely.
Check in the owner's or service manual for your vehicle to locate the coolant reservoir if you are unsure of where to find it.

, If your engine is low on coolant, or the coolant needs to be changed, it will struggle to maintain a proper running temperature. Keep your eye on the temperature gauge in your vehicle. If it begins to run consistently warmer, or begins to overheat sporadically, there is an issue with your cooling system.Failing to adequately cool your engine could mean your coolant levels are too low.
Coolant can eventually go bad. If the coolant levels are still high but the engine is overheating, one issue may be that the coolant needs to be replaced.
If you are uncertain of what the symbols on your gauges mean, refer to your vehicle's owner's manual to determine which is the temperature gauge.

, If you suspect that your coolant system may be leaking, spray the engine with a hose to remove any existing signs of a leak. Then start your engine and visually inspect the engine bay, looking closely for signs of a leak. Coolant is usually under pressure, so a leak could spray out or it may only trickle. Wear safety glasses and exercise caution while looking around the engine bay with the engine running.Do not put your hands inside the engine bay with the engine running.
Look for any new signs of coolant leaks then follow the coolant to the highest point to locate the crack or hole.

, The coolant system is under pressure while heated and opening the radiator cap or petcock while the system is under pressure could result in serious burns. Allow the car to sit for a few hours to make sure it’s completely cool before coming into contact with any parts of the coolant system.After a few hours, lightly tap the top of the radiator to see if it is cool to the touch. If it’s warm, the coolant inside may still be quite hot.
Opening the coolant system while hot will result in heated coolant spraying out, which is extremely dangerous.

, In order to access the bottom of the radiator to drain the old coolant, you’ll need to raise the vehicle to a height that allows you to work and place a container beneath it to catch the draining fluid. Locate the designated jack points for your vehicle by consulting your owner’s manual to avoid doing any damage to the vehicle while you jack it up.Once the vehicle is high enough to slide your container underneath it, place jack stands beneath it to support the weight of the vehicle.
Never work under a vehicle that is supported only by a jack. Jack stands will prevent the jack from losing pressure and lowering the vehicle while you’re beneath it.

, Locate the petcock on the bottom portion of the radiator. The petcock often looks like a spout with a valve you can turn to open it, and it should be on or near the bottom of the radiator to allow it to drain. Once you have located it, make sure the container is positioned properly beneath it and open the valve.The coolant should be cool coming out of the radiator, but you should still take care to avoid letting it come into contact with your bare skin.
Check your owner’s manual for the vehicle’s coolant capacity and make sure you have a container large enough to hold it all at least twice.

, Once you’ve finished draining the radiator, there will still be a great deal of bad coolant remaining in the system. Close the petcock and fill the coolant reservoir with water. Start the engine and allow it to run for a few minutes before draining the radiator again. You should repeat this process two or three times.If you only allow the engine to run for a few minutes each time, it should not get too warm to drain the radiator.
The water will flush out the rest of the bad coolant from the engine.

, Most vehicles require a 50/50 water and coolant mixture to maximize the coolant system’s efficiency. You can purchase pre-mixed coolant, or choose to mix it yourself. Fill the reservoir until it is an inch above the “full” line, then start the engine. As it warms up, the thermostat will open, allowing coolant to flow in. As the coolant level drops in the reservoir, continue to add to it. Add the mixture to the radiator or reservoir until you reach the maximum suggested capacity.If you do not have your owner’s manual, check the vehicle manufacturer’s website for fluid capacities.
It may take a few minutes for the coolant to drain into the system, so be patient as your pour the new coolant in.
If your vehicle’s radiator has a bleeder valve on the top, open it and allow the engine to run for ten minutes to allow any excess air to escape.

, A common point of failure on radiators is the cap itself. Radiator caps are designed to allow excess pressure to escape to avoid damage to the coolant system, but over time they can become oxidized, full of grime, or just worn out. To replace your radiator cap, simply wait for the engine to cool completely and twist the old cap off. Screw the replacement on in its place. You can purchase replacement radiator caps at your local auto parts store.
Make sure to ask for a cap that fits your vehicle’s exact year, make and model.

, Commercial leak sealants are sold at most auto parts stores and can help resolve a radiator leak if you’re in a bind. However, it’s important to note that these leak sealants aren’t designed to be permanent repairs. To use a leak sealant, simply open the radiator cap on a cool engine and pour it in. Top off the radiator with a coolant and water mixture if it is low as a result of the leak You will likely still need to locate and repair the leak, or replace the radiator after using a leak sealant.
Leak sealant is a great option if you need to get your vehicle home or to a repair facility.

, If you are able to locate a crack in your radiator, you may be able to repair it using an epoxy. First clean the area around the crack thoroughly, as any dirt or grease may prevent the epoxy from establishing a seal. Use a spray on brake cleaner and a rag to remove any stuck on grime, then allow the cleaned area to dry completely. Use your hands to knead the epoxy until it becomes malleable enough for you to spread it out over the entire crack.Allow the epoxy to set overnight before starting the vehicle.
Radiator epoxy can be purchased at most auto parts stores.

, If there is a crack in your radiator, it is highly likely that you may need to purchase a replacement for it. To replace your radiator, drain all of the fluids from it and disconnect the hoses leading into and out of the radiator. Unbolt the brackets that hold the radiator in place and slide it up and out of the front of your vehicle. Different vehicles will have different mounting hardware, but it’s common for radiators to be held in place by four to six bolts. Slide the new radiator into place and secure it using the same bolts.You may have to remove body or trim panels to access the radiator bolts or to remove the radiator from the vehicle.
You can purchase a new radiator from the vehicle manufacturer or most auto parts stores.

Use the hand test to find air leaks.,
Find smaller leaks with the candle test.,
Depressurize your house to find links all over your home.,
Use an air leak detector to find your leaks.,
Hire a contractor to do a blower door test.",How to Find Air Leaks in Your Home,"


On a cold day with the heat on inside your home, place your hand around the edges of all exterior doors, windows, and bathroom and kitchen air vents and fans. If you feel cold air on your hand, then you have an air leak.
You can also use the hand test to detect leaks around electrical outlets.
The hand test is best for finding large leaks of air coming into the home.;
,


Light a candle and walk around your house to places that you think may have air leaks: electrical outlets, light fixtures, around baseboards and crown molding and phone jacks.
If you are conducting the test on a warm day, turn off your central air conditioning. If it is cold outside, turn off your central heating system before conducting this test. Place the candle near the potential leak, if the light dances around slightly, you have a small leak.

,


Choose a day that is cold and windy to complete this test. Turn off the furnace and close all of the windows and exterior doors. Turn on all of the fans in your bathrooms and your kitchen.
Walk around your house with a lit stick of incense. Pass the incense over the edges of doors, windows, vents and other areas in your house where you suspect air leaks. If the smoke is blown into the house or sucked out, then you have a leak.

,


Turn the device on and point it at the areas where you suspect leaks. A small light coming from the device will scan the area you are pointing at. If there is a leak, the light will turn blue if the leaking air is cold, it will turn red if the leaking air is warm. If there are no leaks the light will not change.

,


The contractor will place a blower door fan in the front entrance of your house to suck out all of the air inside your home (depressurize). This allows outside air to enter the home through the leaks.
While the house is depressurized, the contractor moves through the house to detect the leaks in the air ducts, dropped ceilings, around utility and plumbing openings, and from interior wall and ceiling joints and floor joists.
A contractor can also detect air leaks around electrical and gas devices, cable and telephone lines, in air conditioners, and in basements and attics.

Consider the savings and how to minimize heating costs.,
Know how infrared heaters work.,
Choose the infrared heater that is right for your needs.,
Select the method of powering the infrared heater that suits your needs best.,
Select the best model size.,
Consider portable options too.",How to Buy an Infrared Heater," Saving on heating cost is a subject that every homeowner is interested in.


Most homes have different heating zones for each room or a limited number of rooms on a single zone. This is much more efficient than heating rooms that are not occupied.
There are other choices available for heating different rooms with different types of heat. In houses where boilers provide hot water heat to baseboard units, air handlers are also used whereby the hot water in converted to forced hot air for a portion of the house.
In addition, infrared heating zones are often used in single rooms as stand-alone heating units.;
, Infrared heaters work on infrared light. Infrared light isn't visible because it's beyond the spectrum that we can see; therefore the heat that is produced is a product of light that is invisible to our eyes. Basically an infrared heater heats the object in a defined space. We get warm from an infrared heat because our skin and clothes absorb the infrared light and the heat is transferred to our body. It's like the difference between being directly in the sunlight versus sitting in the shade. We feel warm in the sun because the light that hits our clothes and skin keeps us warm.

, There are several different kinds of infrared heaters on the market today.


Some direct their infrared light straight into a room or space to create heat on the object it reaches.
Other infrared heaters contain three parts that create heat: infrared light bulbs, a heat exchanger (such as a good metal conductor like copper) and a fan that blows air onto the exchanger to create the heat.

, Depending on the application, infrared heaters can use propane gas, natural gas, and electricity. For homes, the most common heat source for infrared heaters is electricity as stand- alone heaters. Stand-alone infrared heaters can save you as much as 50 percent on your home heating bills. They can pay for themselves in just a few weeks use. They are much less expensive than propane or pellet stoves, cost nothing to install or maintain, and can keep you warm for pennies a day. You can turn your central heating system down low and only heat the room that is in use.


The big advantage of a stand-alone heater is that you can move it from one room to another as you change rooms. It takes just a few minutes to get a room warm and comfortable.

, Stand-alone portable heaters range in model sizes that can heat from 300 square feet up to 1000 square feet. Many models have a programmable thermostat to start the heater just before you get home and your favorite chair will be warm and ready for you.

, Portable infrared heaters are ideal for single rooms, garages, workshops, basements, and cold spots in your home. Even though they produce a lot of heat, the type that have cabinet enclosures don't feel hot to the touch. They don't require clearance space around them and you don't have to worry about your children or pets getting burned. They are much more effective than regular electric space heaters, safer, and are much less expensive to operate.

Determine if portable is better than permanent.,
Decide on how large of a dishwasher you can accommodate.,
Consider the capacity you will need.,
Select the features you want in a dishwasher.,
Consider the effort required to use your portable dishwasher.,
Consider aesthetics.,
Shop at department and appliance stores such as Sears, Lowe's and Home Depot.,
Shop online.,
Ask about delivery, set up, and other logistics.",How to Buy a Portable Dishwasher," You are a good candidate for a portable dishwasher if you are renting and unable to renovate the kitchen, or if you lack the space to fit a built-in dishwasher.


Be sure you are willing to put effort into using your portable dishwasher. You will need to physically move it (unless you keep it in one place) and hook it up every time you use it.;
, Most portable dishwashers are 18 inches (45.7 cm) wide. Some models are larger, at 24 inches (61 cm) wide.


Try moving the dishwasher before you buy it to make sure it is not too heavy.

, The capacity will depend on the number of dishes that you will want to load into the dishwasher. Most portable models are smaller than built-in dishwashers, but Frigidaire makes one that can hold as much as a built-in dishwasher.

,


Look for a stainless steel tub to prevent rusting or cracking.
Find a dishwasher with multiple wash cycles if you need them. Some models come with rinse and hold cycles.
Decide what rack features you want. You can find dishwashers with adjustable racks or a removable upper rack.
Browse selections that include advanced features as well, such as a delayed start option, or a mechanism that grinds food before the dishwasher is turned on.

, Some models are more complicated than others, and depending on your home, you may need to connect multiple hoses and power sources.


Consider storage. When you are not using the hoses and coils, you will want to keep them out of the way so they do not just drag on the floor. Some models allow you to hang or clip them on the back of the dishwasher.

, Many portable dishwashers have finished sides and tops. Look for a color or finish that matches your kitchen.

, The most popular makers of portable dishwashers include General Electric and Frigidaire.

, For a larger selection and more competitive pricing, search online for portable dishwashers. Check sites for major brands, or consider buying a used model from retailers such as eBay or Amazon.

, Before you buy, make sure you can return the dishwasher if it is damaged or you do not like it. Inquire about warranties as well.

Check and replace your furnace filter.,
Inspect the heat exchanger for cracks, rust or other damage.,
Check the venting system for leaks, holes and blockages.,
Inspect the burners for damage or to see if they need to be cleaned.,
Make sure that all of the heating vents are open and unblocked.,
Upgrade your heating system.",How to Check and Maintain Your Heating System," A clogged furnace filter will no longer filter the air supply and will greatly reduce the efficiency of your furnace. Your furnace filter should be checked regularly to make sure it’s not blocked.;
, A crack in the heat exchanger can cause a burner or pilot light to be blown out, which will result in a no-heat situation. A larger crack could upset a steady flame in the furnace or cause the burner flames to flicker out of the burner opening. In a worst case scenario, it could cause a fire.


If you suspect a crack, have it replaced.

, Check the furnace ducts for any disconnected or crushed sections. Inspect the entire length of the duct work for seal leaks and repair them with a duct mastic sealant. If you’re not sure how to access the ducts, or make these repairs yourself, contact a heating and cooling contractor.


The vents could be blocked by improperly installed duct work insulation that has gotten in, blown pieces of your old furnace filter or other debris. If it's not cleared, it could impact the heating's efficiency or cause a room to not heat up at all. Having a heating contractor conduct a full duct cleaning every fall will ensure there are no clogged vents and that the heating system is running at maximum efficiency.

, If the burners look dirty and are not firing up in proper sequence, they probably need to be cleaned out. You can clean the burners using a vacuum or toothbrush.

, Remove furniture or other items from around your heating vents to ensure evenly distributed airflow. Clean and remove dust from vents or along baseboard heaters.

, If you’re still running a 1970’s gas furnace, you can be losing some serious energy. Modern high efficiency gas furnaces can achieve efficiency ratings as high as 97 percent. Replacing your old furnace could literally cut your natural gas use in half and result in great savings each winter. Besides the energy savings, a new furnace will ensure your family's safety and eliminate the need for costly furnace repairs.

If you can not afford to heat your home, contact a few energy suppliers.",How to Stay Warm at Home Without a Heater," This includes making sure storm windows are installed and closed in place if you have them. Windows should be latched. Open them during the day if the outside temperature is higher than the inside temperature.


Keep your windows air-tight. You may want to purchase removable window caulk or plastic to better seal them. At a minimum, stuff a towel or shirt in front of any noticeable leaks.;
, This will keep the cold air out, and the warmth from the sun will heat your house without cold air coming in. You could also cover your windows with clear plastic sheets.

, A set of heavy curtains can block heavy drafts of air. Open them when the sun is shining and close them when it's not.

, Check around the door frame and also under the door. You may want to buy weather stripping or a door sweep. Again, at minimum, make a draft dodger or stuff a towel at the bottom of the door.

, Check for obstructions (e.g. plants, sheds) that might keep the sun's rays from reaching your house. Remove items leaning against walls on the sunny side of your house. (Ideally, put them back again at night for additional insulation).

, The closed door makes that room another barrier between you and the frigid outdoors. It also stops air from circulating as much, which reduces heat loss.


Home improvement stores sell magnetic register covers to 'shut off' forced air furnace registers in unused rooms. That way when the heater does click on, only the registers in the rooms you use will pump out heat. This makes for more efficient use of the heater.
Check that all heat registers are adjusted open, especially where plumbing pipes might freeze. Unblock cold air returns in heated rooms (they may be blocked with furniture or rug) so heat can circulate efficiently.

, Rugs and carpets help prevent heat loss through the floor. They are generally warmer to the touch than wood or stone, and so offer a warmer surface to walk on.

, A lot of heat escapes through the attic, as warm air rises and cold air sinks. Make sure that your attic has enough insulation.

, If you have a fire place, you can heat your house by lighting a fire. If there is no fireplace, you might consider installing one. Always supervise the fire while it is lit., Cooking can help you to keep warm as an activity, through the oven's warmth and by eating something nice and warm after.


Bake cookies or a pie. Your oven will help to dry the air and heat the kitchen. The kitchen will be warm while you are cooking, and then you can have a great home cooked meal too!
After, leave the oven on and open the oven door to let some heat in the house. Only leave the oven on for 10 to 20 minutes, so you don't waste energy.
Limit cooking that gives off steam, as this will increase the humidity in the air and make your house damp. Lowering humidity in the wintertime helps you to feel warmer. Water vapor (humidity) has a greater heat capacity (ability to absorb heat) than dry air. As a result, humid air feels colder in winter than does dry air and it takes more heat to make damp air feel comfortable.

, A candle/candles can produce a lot of heat, just be mindful of where they are placed and do not leave them unattended. A trip to most any grocery store or discount store can provide you with a number of candles cheap!


Use a candle heater. It doesn't create as much heat as a fireplace or real heater, but will create warmth very cheaply.

, The average incandescent light bulb releases up to 95% of its energy as heat rather than light, making it an extremely efficient heat source.Compact Fluorescent and LED lights are not helpful in warming your room, so save them for warmer days and use the money you saved to pay the heat bill.

, Warm beverages will raise your core temperature. The process can be very relaxing and even stimulating. Make a cup of tea or coffee. Sip on some warm broth.

, A lot of people say you release most of your body's heat from your head but despite common belief, you release heat equally throughout your body. Either way, a hat is a good friend at a time like this. A turtleneck sweater or 'onesie' can also work wonders. Dress in layers, especially with wool or cotton clothing. Wear slippers or warm socks. When you are sitting still, wrap a thick pure wool blanket around you. You also may want to consider purchasing a thermal shirt as wearing one under your sweater makes for a comfy shirt and a great amount of warmth.


If you still get cold legs, you could buy a 2-pack of black tights from your local shop. Make sure they are opaques. Wear one or more pairs over each other under your clothes; this will provide your body with another layer of clothing to trap in warm air. Men can use long underwear in lieu of stockings.

, If, for example, you have a bedroom that is much smaller than your living room you could choose to use it as your bed-sitting room.

, 20 minutes of vigorous exercise can warm you up and keep you warm well after the exercise session. Plus, a healthy body is generally more tolerant of the cold.


Be active. Moving around produces body heat! The more active you are, the better your blood circulation will be. This means that warm blood gets to your fingers and toes, keeping them warm.

, The living body of any warm-blooded animal is a furnace unto itself. Snuggle with your cat or dog to keep each other warm.

, Quickly spot-heat parts of your body, or your cold shoes or clothes before donning. You might use it to warm your bed before you get in it. Never cover it! It could overheat and cause a fire.

, Rather than heating the whole house or room, sit on a low wattage heating pad. You can also make your own heating pads:


Use a hot water bottle. It's great for warming your hands and lap while sitting; also put it under the covers at the foot of the bed.
Microwave socks or small homemade ""pillows"" (also known as heat packs) filled with rice, dried corn, or beans for one minute in the microwave and use as a heating pad or bed-warmer.

, Think of it as a big, fluffy blanket with sleeves. They are very warm and comfortable, and you can even sleep in them!

, Purposefully spend time in a location that is heated at no cost to you: library, church, a friend's house, etc.

, An electric blanket can keep you very warm and comfortable in the night and it is more economical that an inefficient and expensive old wall heater. Over-the-knee versions for sitting up are available, usually covered with a nice, fluffy and warm fabric.

, You don't need to go camping to use a sleeping bag. A zero-degree sleeping bag can keep you warm while you snooze at home. Roll out the sleeping bag on your bed to keep you warm and insulated all night long., If you are suffering a cold house due to an energy blackout, the above tips will help you get through this short term emergency. But if you are living with a non-working heater because you don't have enough money to pay for heat repairs, you will need to start saving money in the bank for exactly this type of emergency. Pay yourself first so that you can get through any and all emergencies as they arise. Don't leave yourself out in the cold.

, They might work with you to find a payment plan you can afford. In addition to this, you may be eligible for federal assistance to help pay your bill.

Diagnose your radiator.,
Find a radiator key.,

Open your radiator's valves.,
Catch drips from the valve.,
Wait for water to squirt out of the bleed valve.,
Repeat this process on all the radiators in your house.,
Check your boiler's pressure level.",How to Bleed a Radiator1," A radiator that needs bleeding has cool air trapped in its upper portions. Thus, when you turn on the heat, either the entire radiator will feel cold or the top of the radiator will feel cold while the bottom feels warm. Unfortunately, a cold radiator can also signify other problems. Before proceeding, check for these other common radiator issues listed below. If none seem to fit, your radiator probably needs a simple bleeding. Be careful - radiators can get quite hot. Protect your hands when you're feeling a radiator for warmth.


If you have multiple radiators in your house and all of them are cold or lukewarm, you probably have a larger issue with your heating system - your water heater may be malfunctioning or you may have a buildup of sludge or sediment somewhere in your heating system (see: How to Flush a Water Heater.)
If your radiator problem is accompanied by an accumulation of water beneath the radiator, your radiator has a leak. Try turning your heat off, then tightening the nut(s) on your radiator's inlet valve. If this doesn't fix the problem, the nut may be corroded - replace them or call a professional.
If the radiators on the upper floors of your house aren't heating up but the radiators on the lower floors are, your heating system may not be operating at a high enough pressure to get hot water to the top floors of your house.;
, If you've decided to bleed your radiator your first step should be to find something to open the radiator's ""bleed valve."" Look for a small valve at the top of one end of your radiator. On this valve, there will usually be small square bit which can be turned to adjust the valve. Radiator keys, cheap metal implements designed for opening and closing radiator valves, are available at most hardware stores. Find a radiator key that's the correct size for your valve or, alternatively, search your tool chest for a small wrench or other tool that's the right size to turn the valve.


Some modern radiators are equipped with valves that are designed to be turned with a simple flathead screwdriver.
Before proceeding, make sure you have a radiator key, a screwdriver, a wrench or some combination of implements so that you'll be able to open the valves on every radiator in your house. When bleeding one radiator, it's best to bleed every one in a house.

, Ensure that your central heating is switched off before bleeding, as an active heating system can introduce more air into the system. You want your radiator's contents to settle completely before releasing the air trapped within. Allow time for the heat in your system to dissipate, then feel all over your radiator for heat. If any part of your radiator is still hot, wait for it to cool completely before proceeding to the next step.

, Ensure that both the intake and exit valves of the radiator are turned to the ""open"" position. Then, insert your radiator key (or screwdriver, etc.) into the the bleed screw in the bleed valve at the top of the radiator. Turn the screw counter-clockwise to open the valve. You should hear a hissing sound as air escapes from your radiator.


Opening the bleed valve allows trapped cold air to escape, which is replaced with liquid from your heating system via the pipes connected to your heating system.

, As air escapes from your radiator, water will likely sputter from the bleed valve. Hold a kitchen towel or cloth under the bleed screw to catch any drips. Alternatively, use a small bowl or dish.

, When a steady stream of water (not a sputtering mixture of air and water droplets) squirts through the bleed valve, you've released all of the air trapped in your radiator. Re-tighten your bleed valve (turn the bleed screw clockwise) and ensure that there are no leaks. Use a rag to wipe up any water that's splashed around your radiator.

, To ensure all excess air has been drained from your heating system, it's best to bleed all of your radiators, even if you've only been having problems with one. For a well-maintained heating system, you should try bleeding your radiators regularly. An annual bleeding plus a bleeding after any repairs or modifications to your heating system is usually plenty.

, By releasing excess air from your radiators, you've lowered the overall pressure of your house's heating system. If the pressure's fallen too low, heat might not reach some of your radiators (especially ones on the top floors of your house.) To restore your heating system's pressure, it may be necessary to top off your boiler with water.


For residential heating purposes, a pressure level of around 12-15 psi should suffice. The higher the pressure, the greater the height the height that heat from your system will be able to travel. Especially short or tall houses may require lesser or greater boiler pressure, respectively.
If your boiler has an automatic fill system, your boiler should maintain a pressure reading of about 12-15 psi without any work on your part. If not, add water manually - open the boiler's water feed valve until the pressure gauge reads about 12-15 psi.

Look for symptoms that your car's radiator isn't working.,
Locate and loosen your car's bleeder valve.,
Start the car with the radiator cap off.,
Elevate your car.,
Perform a ""flush and fill.""",How to Bleed a Radiator2," A car's radiator needs bleeding for the same reason that a home's radiator does - pockets of air have become trapped in the car's cooling system. This prevents antifreeze from circulating effectively, causing the car to overheat. If you observe one or more of the following symptoms, your car's radiator may need bleeding:


Abnormally high temperature readings on your dashboard temperature meter.
Fluid boiling out of your radiator.
Odd smells from your engine, especially sweet smells (caused by antifreeze leaking and/or burning up.)
Additionally, it can be a good idea to bleed your radiator after performing maintenance or part replacement on your cooling system. Air can be introduced to the system during maintenance work - keep an eye on your temperature gauge after modifying your cooling system in any way.

, Some cars have bleeder valves incorporated into the cooling system which function by releasing trapped air, just like the bleeder valves on a home radiator. Consult your owner's manual to find the precise location of this valve - usually it's located at your cooling system's highest point to most effectively release air, which naturally rises.


To bleed a car's radiator via a bleeder valve, simply loosen it until you hear the hissing sound of air escaping. Use a cloth to catch any sputtering coolant, then re-tighten the valve when the valve releases a steady stream of coolant.
Some cars don't have special bleeder valves. Don't worry - it's still possible to bleed these cars' radiators via other processes (see below.)

, Another easy way to bleed the car's radiator is simply to allow it to idle with the radiator cap removed (this is also a great option if your car doesn't come equipped with a special bleeder valve.) Remove the radiator cap, then allow your car to run for about fifteen to twenty minutes. The air pockets should be forced through the cooling system and bubble out of the car's radiator.

, Air naturally rises, so by raising the front of your car, putting the radiator at a higher point than the rest of your cooling system, you can speed the release of air from your system. Carefully use a jack to raise your car - most cars come with one, but if yours didn't, they're available at auto supply stores. Ensure your radiator cap is loosened or removed before lifting the car.


In certain special car varieties, the radiator may not be located at the front of the car - consult your car's owner's manual if you're not sure.

, After you've bled a car's radiator, it can be a good idea to add new coolant. Trapped air can artificially inflate a car's coolant reading - you may be running low on coolant without having realized it. Drain old coolant from your system and add fresh coolant, observing any special instruction in your owner's manual. Below are general instructions for replacing your car's coolant:


Allow the engine to cool completely.
Place a drainage pan under your radiator's drain valve to collect old coolant.
Add water to the car's radiator until it's full, then allow it to drain out of the drain valve under the car.
Close the drain valve and add fresh coolant, generally a 50/50 mix of antifreeze and distilled water (not tap water, which can form mineral deposits.)
Bleed your radiator again to eliminate any air introduced during the flush and fill.

Review the instructions included with the new thermostat.,
Make sure you select a thermostat that matches the control voltage of your heating system.,
Determine if you need a ""Heating Only"" or ""Heating and Cooling"" thermostat.,
Turn off all power at main electrical panel.,
Remove cover and control panel from old thermostat.,
Label wires according to their current position, and remove them one by one.,
Remove old thermostat base plate from the wall.,
Secure the new thermostat base plate to the wall.,
Reattach the wires according to their label and the corresponding spot on the new thermostat base plate or to the thermostat directly - depending on the model you have.,
Attach control panel and faceplate for new thermostat.,
Turn power back on and program new thermostat according to manufacturer instructions.",How to Install a Programmable Thermostat," This is an important step - even if you do not understand everything you are reading. Some thermostats have a few straight-forward options that are set by jumper(s), switch(es), etc. that help it work properly with your particular heating system. A common such setting is one that selects GAS or ELECTRIC heat.


Failure to select the proper setting is an avoidable problem if you take the time to read the manual first. Most reputable manufacturers that sell thermostat models at hardware stores, ""big box"" stores, etc. will usually include a combination of one or more: email address, website and even a telephone number you can call if you need help. Nearly always both the call and help are free.;
, There are basically just two types: a ""line voltage"" type that works with heating system control voltages of 120 volts or more and, a ""low voltage"" type that works with heating system control voltages around 30 volts or less. Most low voltage types use small #18 gauge wires (like those on a doorbell button or chime unit) while ""line voltage"" types use traditional #14 and #12 gauge ""building"" wire sizes (like those used to connect outlets, switches and light fixtures).


To be absolutely sure about which type is used in your home, bring the old thermostat into the store you will purchase the replacement (leave the base plate with wiring in place or be sure to label or photograph wires before disconnecting) and ask an employee for assistance. If you can't bring the thermostat in - consider taking a couple of digital photos of it with a camera or cell phone. If possible, take a photo that shows your thermostat manufacturer's name and model number.

, If the thermostat only controls the of heat in your home, you can save money by selecting a ""Heating Only"" thermostat. These thermostats are often nearly identical in appearance to their ""Heating and Cooling"" counterparts, but cost less because they do not include the additional circuitry and components needed to control a central air conditioning system. It is important to understand that both thermostats are functionally identical when working in Heat mode.


Purchase a ""Heating and Cooling"" thermostat only if your old thermostat controls both the heating and cooling, if the thermostat you have selected is not available in a ""Heating Only"" version or you currently use the thermostat to control only heat - and: a.) plan to add air conditioning soon and b.) would like to control it from the same thermostat.

, Some instructions advise to simply turn off power to the room you are working in, others suggest throwing the main switch. To lean towards safety, turn everything you can find on the electrical panel to the “Off” position.

, The cover and control board on most models snap off. Look for a recessed lip around the sides or bottom of the original thermostat where you can grab and remove the faceplate and control board. Take care setting this aside as you may have to reinstall if something goes wrong further in the installation.

, Most new models of programmable thermostats come with sticker labels that you can use to wrap around the wires coming from the wall. If your package doesn’t contain pre-printed labels you can substitute with masking tape and a permanent marker.

, Be sure not to let the mess of wires drop back into the wall when unscrewing the old base plate. Some instructions recommend taping a group of wires to the wall, but if the wires are so stiff that simply spreading them out a bit adequately prevents them from dropping back into the hole in the drywall, this shouldn't be necessary.

, Most of the time a new model’s base plate will not match up to the existing holes from the old thermostat. If so, simply drill a couple holes for the new thermostat, and insert the drywall anchors that came in the new packaging (don’t worry, the instructions should account for this by indicating the drill bit size to use, etc.).


Go ahead and insert batteries if your model requires them. The model used in this example required two AA batteries (installed just above the wire connections), others use the base plate only to support the thermostat and for wire terminal connections. The batteries would be installed in the thermostat itself.

, This may very well be the most difficult part of the entire project because there isn’t much room to work with, and depending on your heating/air conditioning system you could have several wires to attach.


If your previous thermostat was a non-battery operated and the new one takes batteries you may have one wire from furnace that is not needed. 24v negative. This will usually be a blue wire. Tape off and leave disconnected. This is to power a digital non-battery type thermostat and is not needed if your new one uses battery.

, Make a handwritten note of the wires you attached (C, G, Y, R, etc.) before covering with the new control panel and faceplate. You’ll need to know this to properly program your new thermostat based on the type of system you have.

, In the summer time, you might choose to let the temp get a little higher at night and sleep with ceiling fans running. Before you wake up, program the thermostat to cool things down for getting ready for work and school, and then return to a higher temperature for the day. In the winter, reverse this process by letting things cool down after you are tucked away in bed, and warm things up during the early morning hours.

Replace your oil filter, if necessary.,
Call a professional, if necessary.",How to Restart a Furnace After Running out of Oil," If your furnace has a reset function, there should be two copper lines running from your oil tank to the pump. If your pump does not have pipes, the oil may bleed from a fixture. You may need to put a container underneath this fixture to catch bleeding oil., Some furnaces may not be equipped with a reset button. However, if yours has this feature, you should find it located on the furnace, usually close to the oil tank. In most cases, this button is red. Push it once or twice.If you cannot easily locate the reset button on your furnace, consult its user instructions. This part should be described or clearly marked on diagrams.

, If the furnace doesn't come on in 60 seconds after pressing the reset, check the furnace fuses and circuit breaker. Replace or reset necessary fuses. Try to reset the furnace one more time. If the furnace does not relight, bleed the fuel line as described.


When your furnace is running, a lack of oil spray on the inside of the furnace is another indication that you need to bleed the fuel line., You may have some of these supplies already in your household. Those you are lacking can be bought at your local hardware store or home center. To bleed your furnace you'll need:


¼ in (.64 cm) flexible tubing
Container (like a coffee can or a liter soda bottle, to catch oil)
Oil absorbent material (like sand, non-clumping clay, or cat litter)
Rag (to wipe up excess oil)
Suitable wrench (generally 3/8th's size), There should be a toggle switch on the furnace for this. Toggle the furnace to ""Off."" The reset button may have automatically turned off your furnace. If so, this is usually indicated by a red ""On"" light next to the reset button.


When the auto-shut off for the reset button is engaged, you don't need to turn the main On/Off toggle switch to ""Off."", This is generally positioned on the side of the fuel pump, usually at 4 or 8 o'clock position. The bleeder looks like a grease fitting with hex nut shape, like one that a 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) wrench might fit.You should find fuel lines leading to and from the fuel pump. The pump is oftentimes located on the left side of the burner unit., Place your container on the floor close to the bleeder. Fit the tubing over the bleeder so it hangs down. The tubing should extend to the bottom of your container. This container will be used to catch the oil.


Choose an oversized rather than undersized container. Oil that overflows your container can make a big mess.
Use a clean, dry container for bleeding oil from the pump of your furnace. This way, you'll be able to return and re-use the oil after it is drained.
Draining the fuel line for your furnace can be messy work. You may want to wear a pair of gloves while bleeding oil., After the tubing is attached to the bleeder, prepare the bleeder by loosening it with a wrench. Turn it counterclockwise to do so. Once broken loose, lightly re-tighten the bleeder with your hands.During this process you might hear a gurgling noise from the tubing. This is completely natural.

, Toggle your furnace from ""Off"" to ""On."" Immediately after doing so, open the bleeder valve a half turn counterclockwise. The tubing should eject a combination of oil and air.


The force of oil and air running through the tubing can cause it to move. You or a helper may want to hold the tubing and container to prevent accidental spills.
It may be necessary to use the reset button to turn on the furnace. Follow your furnace's user instructions for best results.
Opening the bleeder valve more or less will increase or decrease the rate at which the oil drains. Adjust this as necessary for your situation.
The bleeder screw may have to be completely removed to get a good flow. Shut the furnace off once the flow has started. Replace the screw and restart furnace when through bleeding., If you've hit your reset button multiple times, a safety lock out feature may be preventing you from pressing it again. To restore the reset button, press and hold it for 35 seconds, then release., After a few seconds, the bleeder should begin to expel an uninterrupted flow of oil. Allow the line to drain a few seconds after this to ensure all air has been removed. Close the bleeder by turning it clockwise until firm.


In some cases, especially if the pump is far from the oil tank, you may need to bleed your line into your container several times until all the air is removed from it.
If there is no discharge from the bleeder, there may be a problem with the pump, a clog in the filter, or damage somewhere in the fuel line preventing it from draining.
Fuel that has been drained into a clean, dry container can be returned to the fuel tank after it has been drained., The bleeder valve should be returned to the fully closed position you found it in. The furnace should be switched to the ""On"" position. At this point, the furnace should relight.


If the furnace is operating properly, you should be able to view an orange glow or fire through the inspection port located on the front of the furnace.
If your furnace does not relight, drain the line again as described. You may have to bleed the line several times before it begins working again., Crushed, bent, or damaged tubing supplying your furnace with oil may be starving it of fuel. Leaking lines may prevent oil from reaching the burner. Brittle, deformed, leaking, or degraded tubing should be replaced.


Tubing for your furnace can be purchased at most hardware stores and home centers. When replacing tubing, your furnace should be turned off.
Oil remaining in tubing can make a big mess when being replaced. Lay newspaper, a drop cloth, and/or a container beneath tubing you're changing to prevent a mess., If your furnace doesn't restart after bleeding the fuel line, you may need to remove air from the filter. The oil filter is usually found suspended close to the fuel line either near the oil tank or furnace. To bleed the oil filter:


Carefully loosen the 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) bolt on the top of the filter with an appropriate wrench until you hear air escape. Stop loosening when you hear air.
Let the air drain. When oil begins to bubble around the bolt, tighten it closed to the position you found it., Clogged filters can also prevent your furnace from restarting. Filter kits for your oil furnace are available at most home supply stores. Different furnaces will have different filter replacement procedures. Follow the user instructions for your furnace to properly replace the filter.


Replacement kits generally come with new seals and gaskets for the bolts of the filter. Use these new parts for the best results.
When reassembling your filter, it's especially important to make sure that all the fixtures and fastenings are snug and tight., Bacteria or sludge may be clogging the lines of your furnace. This may require a burner technician, who can blow out and clear the lines. Look for contact information for technicians certified to work on your furnace in its user instructions.

Things to know when Looking for the material to build this boiler.,
Now let's look at PVC, it's cheap in cost and light in weight, but will it hold up to the task at hand, this was a big part of the research and reasoning for deciding which pipe would do the job and be at a reasonable low cost.,
Learning about PVC and finding it has everything you need and works much better than you might expect.,
Always be aware of safety issues.,The PVC boiler is built in three stages, first is the 90 degree inlet and its fittings, second, the santee and its fittings along with the heating element and third, the riser with its clear PVC braided hose and all of its fittings.,
Attaching the system to the platform which is a 2'x4' sheet of 3/4"" plywood or OSB.",How to Build a PVC Boiler1," You will find the cost of steel pipe, copper or schedule 80 PVC and their fittings are not in the ""cost"" ball park for this project. Aluminum pipe is a good choice, but again the cost is just too much for this project. Conduct is another possible pipe and cheaper, but it will rust if you just talk about water in front of it., This white pipe just doesn't look like it would do the job at first glance, but with a bit of the proper drawings and instructions as offered here, you will find it to be a good choice for this project. Most of the info on PVC pipe and its properties comes from the ""AWWA Research Foundation"" in Denver, Colorado, 1994. This info will lead you to more info and you will began to see how diverse this stuff (PVC) really is.

If your first thoughts on the use of PVC are of schedule 80, than take a good look at the cost of schedule 80 pvc and the fitting that must be used with it, oh, don't forget that schedule 80 has to have it's own type of cleaner and cement also. So it's on to the next, schedule 40 and its fittings which work very well for this project and at a cost you can live with.
It should be noted here that when your using PVC that you should use the proper PVC fittings of the same schedule and the proper cleaners and cement for that type of pvc. The clear cleaner that goes with the schedule 40 works very well and without the mess of the purple stuff, it just leaves you with a much better looking project.

, A few large white sticky balls were produced while trying different methods of building this boiler, but experimenting proved that the proper placement and type of fittings along with the lengths and the type of heating element made the system work very well and not turn into that white sticky ball.

The trick here is to make something that works not just once, but time after time, safely and without any problems.

, The utmost issue here is 'safety'. This system has been in use for about 1-1/2 years now (at the time of writing this article)and without any problems, when testing the boiler during the construction of this system the results need to show no leaks. (After construction is complete and cement has cured for 24hrs.) Be sure that there is no over heating of the boiler at any point and do all this with complete safety. And no interruption of the steaming when water is added during the steaming process. Here is where one must be ones own keeper, think before you act, if you don't know about something or are unsure, ask questions and get answers!
,, Building a 2x4"" frame under the platform with locking wheels to make it both portable and keep it in place when in use. Note: Never move the platform and system when in use, this is unsafe for you and the system!!!"
"
Start with the 3"" PVC pipe and fittings, stage one, the 3""-90 degree inlet, this is the bottom end of the boiler, this is where the water supply first enters the boiler through reducer fittings and a 3/4"" PVC hose.
,
A short 3"" PVC nipple (3"" pvc pipe cut to about 2"" long) is used at the lower end of the 90 degree fitting and between the 3""-2"" hub reducer by using of the cleaner and cement for the schedule 40 PVC.,
Now add the short PVC nipple at the top end of the 90 degree fitting, this is where the santee will be fitted.,'",How to Build a PVC Boiler2,", Now add the 2""-3/4"" PVC reducer into the 3""-2"" hub reducer, the 2""-3/4"" reducer has a 3/4"" threaded hole to except the 3/4"" hose barb, this hose barb can be steel, brass or nylon. Note: Do not use the cleaner or cement on the hose barb, Use only the teflon tape on the threads of the hose barb., Santee stands for sanitary fitting. The santee is a 90 degree fitting with a Tee fitting built into it. Note: More info and drawings show this arrangement in more detail on the plans sheet.,"
"
Next, assembly of the santee fitting,(the santee is a 3""pvc pipe with a 90 degree opening in the middle of it) this is done in two stages, one adding the 3""-2"" hub reducer to the santee with the short nipple (as used above) between the 90 degree opening and the hub reducer.,
Now cut a hole in the back side of the weatherproof electrical box for the heating element with the o-ring/gasket to pass through.,
Be sure the weatherproof electrical box has a ground screw connection in it, connect the ground wire on the 12/3 electrical cord to this ground screw in the box.,Next, the 1/2"" cord grip connector is added to the bottom of the electrical box, this connection at the bottom of the electrical box helps keep water from entering.,
Connection of the 12/3 cord is done after the boiler is complete to prevent damaging the cord while you build the system.",How to Build a PVC Boiler3," Add a threaded 2""-1-1/4"" PVC reducer, with the 1-1/4"" hole threaded, to the hub reducer. Next,the 1500 watt 120VAC short water heating element is inserted into a hole made in the weatherproof electrical box. Be sure to put the rubber o-ring/gasket on the element before installing it. The electrical box, use a good weatherproof box that has a gasket around the lid or cover, this box should be of metal with ground screw., This hole should be just large enough for the element to fit into and let the o-ring seat against the inside of the electrical box. Now add the teflon tape to the threads of the heating element and set it into the weatherproof electrical box, then a 1-1/4""-1"" steel reducer that is threaded inside and out is screwed onto the heating element. Apply the teflon tape to the outside threads of this reducer. With the element, gasket, weatherproof box and steel reducer fully assembled, screw this assembly into the 1-1/4"" PVC reducer in the hub reducer on the santee., This is a must, it will help insure a safe system!
,, Again, think SAFETY."
"
The third stage is to add the riser to the top opening of the santee.,When installing the hose, use no smaller than a 1-1/4"" hose at the top of the riser or better is a 2"" hose for the best steam flow to the steam box.,
The Clear PVC braided hose attaches to this hose barb and will go up and into the bottom of the steam box, don't cut this hose to length until the steam box has been finished and installed on the platform.,Hold the finished PVC boiler in place ( on the 2'x4' plywood platform) with the use of an upright 2x4 with steel pipe clamps attaching the boiler to the 2x4 upright and attaching the 2x4 upright to the platform with 2x4 bracing.,
This PVC boiler works very well, but before using this system, ensure that there will be no pressure build up, no water leaks and the electrical connections are correct and the ground wire connected.",How to Build a PVC Boiler4," The riser is just a 14"" long 3"" PVC pipe with a 3""-2"" hub reducer and a 2""-1-1/2"" threaded PVC reducer for the hose barb that the steam hose attaches to. Add the hose barb and clear braided PVC hose to complete the riser assembly, don't cut the hose to length until the steam box is in place.,,

All these parts for this boiler, except for the steel fittings are bonded with the PVC cleaner and cement. Use this cleaner and cement as directed by the instructions on the cans. The steel reducers all use Teflon tape on the threaded areas, no cleaner or cement on the steel fittings. This method makes for a very leak proof system.
The 90 degree inlet fitting at the bottom of this boiler has a 3/4"" hose that is attached to it and runs out and up to the through the tank connector on the supply thank. This hose should be about 16-18"" long.
One of the things that makes this boiler more efficient than a can on a gas burner, is that you can add water to the supply tank and not interrupt the steaming process. You can get a constant steam flow for as long as you want.

,, It's a good idea to leak test the boiler by plugging the 3/4"" inlet hole (at the bottom end of the boiler) and filling the boiler with water and standing it upright, then let it set for 24 hours, if there are no leaks, proceed with the construction of the system. A complete drawing of the finished boiler with bracing is shown on the plans"
"
Now you can move on to the next important part, the Supply Tank.,Using a 3/4"" Through the Tank Connector with its seals on the inside and outside.,
Do not glue or screw the supply tank to the supply stand.,
Set the supply tank on the supply stand, the supply stand is a 2x4 box frame with a 18"" square piece of plywood on top of this 2x4 frame and a 3"" hole in the center of the plywood for the Through the tank connector to pass through.,
To ensure the proper water level, put a full line on the supply tank down about 3"" from the top of the supply tank and level with the full point of the boiler, this point on the boiler is about 3"" below the inside top of the hub reducer on top of the boiler.,
Again, check to ensure that the supply tank full line is about 3"" below the hub reducer at the top of the boiler.,
Add water to the supply tank by pouring room temp water into the supply tank slowly, not to over disturb the flow of water to the boiler.",How to Build a PVC Boiler5," It's a plastic container of about 5 gallons (18.9 L). with a smooth bottom.,, It is kept in place by the weight of the water in the tank., Keep the top of the supply stand about 14"" ABOVE the platform or high enough that when the supply tank is set in place the supply tank full level line, lines up with the full level point on the boiler when it is standing in place alongside the supply stand and supply tank. This will ensure a proper water level in the boiler at all times., Now add a fill level line on the supply tank, down about 3"" from the full line. This makes it possible to steam wood for up to 3-4 hours without having to add water to the supply thank. Room temp. water is added to the supply tank when the supply tank level is at the refill line., This helps keep the water level inside the boiler at a safe level and gives max steam., This lets you add water and not interrupt the steaming.

Now you can produce enough steam for a steam box up to 10 feet (3.0 m) long. Your projects may need a longer or larger inside area steam box. It is possible to use up to a 20 foot (6.1 m) steam box, this is done by using 4"" PVC for the boiler, same method, just larger PVC fittings and pipe along with a longer heating element of the same wattage.

"
"
Now if you do a bit of reading and research on steam boxes it will lead you to find that you can build most any type steam box you need.,
One method is to Use 1x8 cedar boards for the sides, the using 1/2"" marine plywood for the top and bottom makes a nice box.,
Next, set the steam box at a slight upward angle upward at the front (about 1"") to induce a good steam flow from back to front.Make the door and leave a 1/4"" gap at the top of the door on the steam box.,
Do not add any locks or latches to the door, it should have a loose fit.,
# There are many methods to generate steam and make steam boxes and most work fine, this is just one method that is safe, easy and reliable to use and will last a long, long time.,To help ensure that you build a great PVC boiler and wood steaming system, There is a free full 28 page set of drawings, instructions and materials list free for the asking, at woodsteamingsystems@yahoo.com",How to Build a PVC Boiler6," Building the steam box is a matter of what you need and what your building. This method below is just one idea, build what fits your needs best., The door on the box should not have any latches or locks, a loose fit here is important. Foam/glass insulation can be used to cover the outside of the box. Keep the wood up off the bottom of the steam box by using 3/4"" dowel rods through 3/4"" holes through the upper sides of the box and about 2"" or so down from the top of the box. This gives you a place to lay your wood to be steamed and keeps it up close to the top of the box where the most steam and heat exist. A hole or two in the back bottom of the box is needed to let the condensate drain as your steaming wood, just make these holes small about 1/4"" dia., This gap ensures good steam flow from back to front and no pressure build up.
, A loose fit ensures no pressure build up!!! Pressure inside the steam box is dangerous, don't let this happen!!!!!!!, Check out PVC and build a great PVC steam boiler and complete wood-steaming system. The steam box can also be built of PVC but you must support the long PVC pipe along it's length to prevent sagging. Remember keep safety as your most important project.,"

Turn the furnace off before starting any work on the fuel pump.,
Locate the bleed screw on the fuel pump near where the fuel line comes in.,
Place a small bucket or pan under the bleed screw.,
Use a small crescent wrench or pliers to slightly loosen the bleed screw.,
Push the reset button on the furnace to turn it back on.,
Tighten the screw as soon as the air stops sputtering out and a steady stream of fuel pours out.,
Let the furnace continue to run.",How to Bleed an Oil Furnace,";
, The screw is usually a small nipple-like screw.

, The bucket will catch any fuel that sputters out as you bleed an oil furnace.


If the screw is in an area that is impossible to put a bucket or small tray under, use a flexible tubing just big enough to fit over the bleed screw. Place the tube over the bleed screw and direct it to an area where you can fit the tray or bucket.

, Make sure the screw remains on the pump and is only a little loose, so it doesn’t fall completely off when you bleed the oil furnace.

, As the furnace starts to suck fuel in, air and fuel will spit out of the bleed screw.


Keep your pliers or wrench on the screw ready to tighten it. This will also ensure the screw remains in place, if you did loosen it too much.
If the furnace cycle ends before the air and fuel mixture stops sputtering, you’ll need to push the reset button again to continue the bleed process until the furnace pushes out all the air from the line.
Some furnaces may have a lockout system that won’t allow you to reset more than one or two times. If this happens, you can override the lockout by holding the reset button in until the furnace kicks in again.

, Be careful not to tighten it too much. Replacing a stripped bleed screw can be a very costly project.

, It should run normally without problems now. If it doesn’t restart the next time, check the line for air again by repeating the bleed process. You may not have gotten all the air out the first time, or you may have a debris blockage in your fuel line.

Identify what the graph represents.,
Check the scale for each graph element.,
Locate the graph element you want information on.,
Read directly up from ""August"" until you find a dot or a slanting line, on a line graph, or the top of a bar for a bar graph.",How to Read Graphs," Most graphs will have a clearly labeled x-element, spaced along the graph's horizontal axis, and a clearly labeled y-element, spaced along the graph's vertical axis.


The graph's title should also tell you exactly what it's about.;
, This applies to both line graphs and bar graphs.


For example, if you're looking at a graph that shows how many salmon returned to a given stream over the period of a few months last year, each increment along the graph's y-axis might represent hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of salmon returning; you won't know which scale numbers apply until you check the graph.

,


For example, you might want to know how many salmon returned to the stream in question in August of last year. So you'd read across the graph's horizontal axis until you find ""August.""
Time elements, such as days, weeks, months or years, are almost always listed along the horizontal (""x"") axis. Quantity measurements are almost always listed along the vertical (""y"") axis.

, Then read straight across to the left until you hit the graph's labeled y-axis. Whatever quantity that line intersects with is the measurement for salmon return in August.


So if you read up to the dot, line or top of the bar for salmon in August then read across to the left and hit ""10,000,"" you know 10,000 salmon returned in August. If you hit a point between any two labeled graph increments, you have to estimate based on where you land between the 2 increments. For example, if you hit a point halfway between 10,000 and 15,000, you can safely estimate that the correct number is about 12,500.

Find your band agreement.,
Find your recording contract.,
Meet with a lawyer.,
Check your state’s law.,
Identify revenue streams.,
Prepare for negotiations.,
Negotiate with the band.,
Sign an agreement.,
Consider a lawsuit if negotiations fail.",How to Secure Royalties when Leaving a Band," Ideally, you would have signed a partnership agreement or an operating agreement when you formed the band or at any point before you released music. If you did, then this agreement will determine what your rights are after you leave the band.You should find your agreement and read it. The band agreement should state whether you are entitled to royalties after you leave.It is not unusual for the band agreement to state that you give up all royalties if you leave the band.Also check if the agreement requires that you do anything in order to leave the band. For example, it might provide steps you need to take. You should follow all steps spelled out in the band agreement.;
, Your music may also be covered by a recording contract. In this situation, the record company holds the copyrights to the music. Accordingly, whether you will get a royalty when you leave the band will depend on what is in the recording contract.


Your band manager should have a copy of the recording contract. If not, you will have to contact the record company and ask for a copy.

, You might have a hard time understanding your band agreement or recording contract. Accordingly, you should schedule a meeting with a music lawyer to talk about your rights. He or she can read the agreement and advise you about whether it protects your right to royalties if you leave the band.


You can get a referral to a lawyer by contacting your state or local bar association.Also see Hire a Music Attorney for additional tips.
Once you have found a music attorney, schedule a meeting with him or her. Ask ahead of time how much the attorney charges.

, If you didn’t have a written partnership or band agreement, then your state partnership law will provide default rules.In the absence of any written agreement defining your relationship, then your band is probably a partnership. Each state has adopted rules for partnerships.


You can find your state’s partnership act by searching “partnership act” and “your state.”
Generally, when you leave a partnership, you have no automatic right to royalties. However, you could still negotiate an agreement for royalties before leaving.

, To prepare properly for negotiations, you need to identify all of the revenue streams related to your music. For example, you should try to get ongoing payment from the band for the following:Record royalties: your share of royalties from sales and licensing of recordings involving your performances.
Publishing royalties: money earned from compositions you helped author, in whole or in part.
Merchandise income: income earned from products manufactured by the band or under a license, especially where the item includes your name or likeness.

, You shouldn’t go into negotiations blind. Instead, you should think about what your strengths are in negotiation. Is there any reason the band should give you royalty payments after you leave? For example, you might hold the copyright on several songs the band performs. In this case, you can agree to let the band continue to perform the songs but, in exchange, you get royalties from the performances and from any recordings sold.


Also think about the minimum you are willing to settle for. Negotiations are voluntary, and you can walk away if the other side can’t meet your minimum. This is called your “walk away” point, and you should know it before going into negotiations.Talk with your music attorney about what a fair royalty would be. If you leave, then the band will probably have to hire someone to replace you. This person will probably want a cut of the royalties as well, so it might not be realistic to insist that you get an equal share of the royalties after leaving.

, You should let your music attorney handle most of the negotiations, which will probably take place at a lawyer’s office. Feel free to attend the negotiations and share with your lawyer any input that you have.


Remember that your lawyer is ethically obligated to notify you of any settlement offer. Your lawyer also must get your permission before accepting or rejecting a settlement., If you reach an agreement on royalties, then you should draft a settlement agreement. This agreement is a contract between you and the band or between you and the record company. Your lawyer should draft the agreement or look over the agreement drafted by the other side’s lawyer.


If either side breaks the settlement agreement, then you can sue to enforce the settlement agreement., Your attempt to negotiate royalties may very well be unsuccessful. The remaining band members have little incentive to try and give you money in the absence of a band agreement that grants you the right to royalty payments. A recording company will likely be equally hostile. You should talk to your lawyer about what other options you have if your negotiations fail.

Chart your data.",How to Read MACD," Most MACD interfaces are set up as two separate graph boxes. The upper box contains a candlestick chart for the security in question. This chart tracks the trading price of a security over time by representing each day as a ""candlestick"" that shows the day's opening, closing, high, and low prices. Below that is the MACD graph that shows several lines and the MACD histogram. These trend lines are the MACD line and the signal line. Overlaid on top of these lines is the MACD histogram., Each part of the MACD interface is the result of price calculations. Understanding MACD analysis requires understanding exactly how each part is calculated.


The candlestick chart is fairly simple to understand: The box represents the opening and closing prices of the security, while the line out to either side (if any) represent the high and low prices.
The MACD line is the difference between the 12-day and 26-day exponential moving averages (EMA) of the security's price. The EMA is like a regular moving average, except more weight is given to newer data.
The signal line is the 9-day EMA of the MACD line itself.
The MACD histogram is a series of bars that shows the difference between the MACD and the signal line., The signal line is so named because it serves as an indicator for timing trades. That is, when the signal line crosses the MACD, you should either buy or sell the security, depending on your position and the direction of the movement. Essentially, it tracks the momentum of the MACD itself, and can show when changes in momentum are able to occur. This then relates to the price, allowing traders to (hopefully) time out price swings.


Specifically, when the signal line crosses MACD and goes below, this is a ""bearish"" signal and it may be a good time to sell. The opposite is true for when the signal line goes above MACD (a ""bullish"" signal)., The MACD histogram is calculated as the difference between the MACD and signal line values for a given day. It's value is positive (above the zero line) when MACD is greater than the signal line and negative (below the zero line) when MACD is less than the signal line. It is zero when the two lines intersect., MACD is a measure of changes in momentum between shorter-term and longer-term price averages. The sign (positive or negative) and magnitude or the MACD line represents the interplay between the two underlying EMAs. This manifests in the following ways:


If MACD is positive, the 12-day EMA is greater than the 26-day.
If MACD is negative, the 26-day EMA is greater than the 12-day.
An increasing positive MACD means that upside momentum is increasing.
A decreasing positive MACD means that upside momentum is slowing.
A decreasing negative (becoming more negative) MACD means that downside momentum is increasing.
An increasing negative (becoming less negative) MACD means that downside momentum is slowing., As previously mentioned, a signal is observed when the MACD crosses the signal line. A bearish signal occurs when the MACD is below the signal line after the cross, where a bullish signal occurs when the opposite happens. However, these signals are not always so clear. For example, a cross at an extreme MACD value (based on historical highs and lows) can mean a false signal. This would represent a drastic movement in the price of the underlying security.


Signal crossovers may occur more frequently or less frequently, depending on the volatility of the underlying security., This type of crossover occurs when the MACD line moves about the zero line. Traders watch for this change to determine simple changes in momentum. There is upside momentum when MACD is positive and downside momentum when it is negative., Divergences occur when the differences between extremes in the price of the underlying security and the MACD are different. For example, imagine that between two low prices on the graph of the security's price, the security experienced a lower low the second time (a lower low). At the same time the MACD experienced two corresponding low points, but the second low point was higher than the first (a higher low). This ""divergence"" shows that there is a downtrend in the price of the security, but that the downside momentum is decreasing. This is a bullish divergence, as the MACD is a higher low.


This may mean that the security's downtrend is coming to an end.
A bearish divergence is the opposite situation. For example, the price graph might have a higher high than the MACD chart., MACD is primarily used to identify the direction and magnitude of short-term momentum in price movements. In other words, it tracks the speed of price changes. In practice it is used more to estimate magnitude than direction. Track this magnitude by using the MACD histogram. The height of the bars represents the strength of the price movement.Slowing upside momentum may mean that a trader should prepare to sell.
Slowing downside momentum may mean that a trader should prepare to buy.

, At signal crossovers, the trader should prepare to buy or sell the security. At a bullish signal crossover, the trader should consider buying. At a bearish crossover, the trader should consider selling. However, this depends on the nature of the crossover. A crossover at the extreme of the MACD should be treated with skepticism., Although a MACD crossover, convergence or divergence can be useful, other resources can shed more light on bullish or bearish signals relevant to a specific time line.


The candlestick chart shows highs and lows for each day of trading in a visual sequence. The chart also shows whether prices trended up or down during a particular trading day.
This allows traders to look at ""flickering"" patterns related to the action of price changes, represented in candlestick charting as ""wicks,"" and make more informed decisions on buying and selling. Many experts consider candlestick charting to be both an important complement to MACD, and more effective than MACD on its own.

, If you don't have access to a pre-created MACD display through trading software, you can create your own using Microsoft Excel. Your starting point should be to locate closing prices for the stock in question. You can get this data from a major financial news site, like Yahoo! Finance or MarketWatch. Many of these sites will also give you the option to download the data as a spreadsheet, so it is pre-formatted for your use.A good starting point is to collect data for three month's worth of trading. This includes closing prices for each day of market activity.
Your data should be formatted with the date in column A and closing price data in column B., The 12-day EMA is the more responsive part of the MACD. This is calculated first as a simple average of the first twelve closing prices, but thereafter as a function of the present day's closing price and the EMA. To get started, start in column C next to the twelfth closing price in your list. From there, type in ""=AVERAGE("" and then the range of data points in column B, followed by a closing parenthesis.


For example, if your data points started in cell B1, you would use the range B1 to B12, expressed as B1:B12. This would give you a completed function of ""=AVERAGE(B1:12)"".
Your function would then be placed in cell C12.
Then, one cell below that function (C13 in the example), enter the following: ""=*(2/13)+*(1-(2/13))"".
So, the example would have, in cell C13, the following: ""=B13*(2/13)+C12*(1-(2/13))"".
Click on this function and drag it down to the bottom of your data to fill in the rest of the 12 day EMAs., This process is identical to entering the 12-day EMA, except for the fact that the equation is slightly different and that you start on the 26th closing price. In column D, next to the 26th closing price (and it's corresponding 12-day EMA in column C), enter the following: =""AVERAGE("" and then the relevant data points, followed by a closing parenthesis. So, in the example, this would be ""=AVERAGE(B1:26)"" in cell D26.


In the next cell down, D27 in the example, type in the following: =*(2/27)+*(1-(2/27))"".
For the example, this would be: =B27*(2/27)+D26*(1-(2/27)).
Click and drag this formula down to fill in the rest of your data., The MACD will be shown in column E. It is calculated by simply subtracting the 26-day EMA from the 12-day EMA. Next to the first 26-day EMA, cell E26 in the example, type in: ""=C26-D26"". The result in the MACD for that day. After that, click on this cell and drag it down to the bottom of the sheet to get the rest of the MACD measurements., The signal line is just a 9-day EMA of the MACD, and is produced similarly to the two previous EMA data points. Start in column F next to the ninth MACD value (cell F34 in the example). Then, type in: ""=AVERAGE(E26:E34)"". You can adjust the range if your first nine EMA values are in different cells. Then, one cell below that (F35), type in ""=E35*(2/10)+F34(1-(2/10))"". Again, adjust the referenced cells if your data are in different ones.


Click on the formula and drag it to the end of your data points to fill in the last of your data., With your completed MACD and signal line data, you can create a MACD display. Use Excel's graph tools to show your MACD and signal lines as line graph over certain time periods. You can also graph the 12 and 26-day EMAs or the price for more data to compare."

Familiarize yourself with the mechanics of refinancing.,
Determine if refinancing your mortgage will be favorable.,
Consider alternatives.,
Decide how much cash you need.,
Apply for a new mortgage.,
Submit all the documents required by your lender.,
Get your home appraised.,
Attend the closing.",How to Refinance and Get Money Back," Before you rush into a huge financial decision just to get some cash, study how the process works. Refinancing a home loan is the process of taking out a new mortgage and using it to immediately pay off the balance of your first mortgage. You are essentially swapping 1 mortgage for another.;
, Based on the circumstances, refinancing could be a great decision or a horrible decision. Refinancing a loan will require you to pay the lender's fees, but it may also save you money on future payments if you can get a lower interest rate. If the savings outweigh the fees, refinancing is a good call.


Refinancing will likely benefit you if your credit rating has improved since applying for your original mortgage, interest rates are low, and you are not too close to paying off your entire mortgage balance.
Refinancing is not likely to benefit you if your credit rating has dropped recently, interests rates are high, or you are already very close to paying off your mortgage.

, Before you refinance your mortgage, make sure another option isn't a better choice. If you need the cash for college tuition, consider a Stafford loan; these loans are easy to apply for and don't require repayment until after graduation. If you just need some flexibility, consider opening a home equity line of credit. These work like credit cards, allowing you to spend money as you choose rather than loaning you a lump sum all at once.

, Formulate a plan for using the money, and make sure you understand how ""cashing out"" will affect your equity.


For example, suppose your original mortgage was for $200,000. Assume that this still reflects the value of your home (note that these calculations will work equally well in other currencies).
Suppose that you have paid off $100,000 of your principle. So, you have $100,000 equity in your home and $100,000 remaining balance on your mortgage.
When you refinance, you will take out a new mortgage in the amount of $200,000. First, you pay off the $100,000 balance on the original mortgage.
You can essentially split your remaining $100,000 between cash and home equity. If you take $20,000 in cash, you will have reduced your home equity to only $80,000. Now your mortgage has a balance of $120,000, so it will take longer to pay off.

, The process will be very similar to the 1 you followed when you took out your original mortgage. Fill out a mortgage application with your preferred lending institution, making sure to tell them you plan to convert some of your home's equity into cash.

, These will generally include W-2s, pay stubs and income tax forms from previous years.

, Lenders require home appraisals to make sure they aren't lending you more money than the home is worth. The appraiser will usually be selected by your lender, and will contact you to schedule an appraisal time.

, The closing will generally be held at a local title and escrow firm. You will receive your cash at the closing.

Identify why you fear a market crash.,
Consider holding money in a savings account.,
Invest in bonds.,
Consider annuities.,
Find safer stocks.,
Change your contributions.,
Diversify your portfolio.",How to Protect Your Finances Against Market Crashes1," You might have no idea what your retirement fund is currently invested in. If not, log into your account and print out the current allocation of investments, which should include the following:


stocks or stock mutual funds
bonds
real estate
money market accounts;
, The economy goes up and down with some regularity, and when the market crashes stocks suddenly become cheaper to buy. For this reason, you might not want to diversify your portfolio. Instead, you can leave your investments as they are.


However, you might want to reduce your exposure to risk if you are nearing your retirement age or have just entered retirement.A major stock market crash could seriously cut the amount of money you have to live on.
Your tolerance for risk might also have changed. If so, then you can diversify your portfolio so that you are comfortable with your investment mix.
It’s impossible to predict exactly when the next recession will hit, so you shouldn’t move money in and out of the stock market hoping to get out just before things turn south. For example, it looked like the U.S. stock market was about to crash in late 2015. Since then, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased more than 20%.

, The easiest way to protect your investments is to get out of stocks and move the money to savings accounts. Consider the following options:High-yield online savings accounts. These accounts will only earn about 1-2% annually, but this amount is higher than most banks offer. Your cash is liquid, so you can access it if needed. Furthermore, your deposit will be protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000.

Money market accounts. These accounts are like bank accounts but with potentially higher returns. You can write checks against the money market account. Open with your bank or with a company like Scottrade or TD Ameritrade.

Certificates of Deposit. Banks and credit unions sell ""CDs,"" which you can buy for a set sum. You are prohibited from accessing the money until the CD matures, but you will earn interest on the investment.

, Bonds are debt. Companies, as well as governments, issue bonds to raise money, and bonds are a safer investment than stock. Consider putting more of your investment into bonds, such as the following:Municipal bonds. State and local governments issue bonds to raise money, and in return the bonds are exempted from income taxes. You can typically earn 3% annually on bonds. They are a low-risk investment, unless the city government is on the verge of bankruptcy.

U.S. savings bonds. These bonds are very safe. With a Series I bond, you get a fixed interest rate, and your return is linked to inflation. With the Series EE bond, you earn an automatic rate of return each month.

Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). The U.S. government offers a fixed interest rate as well as inflation protection that’s triggered every time inflation increases.

, An annuity is a contract with an insurer or financial services company. You make a lump sum payment, and in return you are provided with a fixed sum of money for a specific amount of time.There are several varieties of annuities, which can protect your investments in case of a market crash. For example, fixed-indexed annuities can protect your principal.


Annuities are safer than stocks, but they do have some risks. For example, the company you bought the annuity from could go bankrupt. In that situation, you will no longer be paid. You can protect yourself by doing thorough research and only buying an annuity from a company with the highest rating.
The value of an annuity can also erode with inflation, though you can buy annuities that will protect against inflation.

, Not all companies are the same, and some are safer investments in a down economy than others. For example, you might want to get rid of low-grade stock, such as companies with a lot of debt or businesses in speculative fields like biotech that have not yet produced strong profits.In a market crash, the value of these companies will decline.


Instead, look to high-quality stocks which tend to hold up better. These companies have stable earnings and low debt.
Also consider stocks that pay dividends. Check if you can invest in a dividend exchange-traded fund.

, If you’re not yet in retirement, you should consider changing the allocation of your retirement contributions for the last few years before you stop working. Direct your contributions toward safer investments, such as those discussed above.Changing your contributions will not change the allocation of investments already in your portfolio, so consider diversifying it.

, When the market is good, riskier investments such as stocks perform well. But when the market crashes, you can expect stocks to perform poorly. Accordingly, you might want to diversity your portfolio and move some money out of stocks.


How much to move is up to you. However, you don’t have to get out of stocks entirely. Instead, you could reduce stocks to 30% of your portfolio, and have the other 70% in bonds or another safe investment. In a market crash, your losses will remain in the single digits, and you can move back into stocks after the market improves.If you don’t know what to do, meet with a financial planner who can help you assess your risk tolerance and come up with a plan suited to your needs."

, In addition to your investment accounts, your financial planner will want to know what assets you currently own. Write down your list of the following:Your home

, Your planner also needs to know what you currently have in debt. Gather your most recent statements and compile a list. Include the amount that you owe, as well as your interest rate. Include the following debts:Mortgage
Student loans
Personal loans
Credit card balances

, Sit down and add up all sources of income. Include things such as wages or salary from a job, alimony, child support, and investment income.Break out your expenses between fixed expenses, which don’t change each month, and discretionary spending. Your fixed expenses are things like rent/mortgage, debt payments, and insurance premiums.

, Your planner can help you realize your estate planning goals, such as leaving enough money to your children. Gather the following to show your financial planner:Your will
Any trust
Life insurance policies

, Your financial planner will thank you if you put them all one place. Making digital copies is probably the easiest method of getting organized. You might be able to download some documents in digital form (such as credit card statements). With other documents, you may need to create a PDF.


After digitizing your documents, you can load them all onto your laptop and take it with you to the meeting. When your planner wants to see a document, you can pull it up easily., You’ll get more out of a meeting if you know ahead of time where you financially fall short. Check your bank and credit card statements for the past few months and identify what you spend the most money on.For example, you might be an emotional shopper or someone who overspends on housing or transportation.

, Many financial planners will give you a questionnaire to fill out, which will ask for information about your income, debts, and assets. You will either need to take it to your first meeting or submit it ahead of time. Be sure to complete the questionnaire thoroughly to the best of your ability and keep a copy for your records.

, You may have many goals you need to meet even before retirement. Come up with a list and rank them by priority. Consider the following:


Do you want to buy a home? Do you think you want to buy a bigger home in the future? When do you want to buy?
Do you have debts you want to pay off, such as student loans or credit cards? How important is paying them off early compared to saving for a down payment on a home?, Your financial planner can’t help you plan unless they know where you want to go. One key life event to plan for is retirement. Think about when you want to retire. 55? 60? 70?, If you want to travel the world, then you’ll need more money than if you intend to stay at home and take up oil painting. Think about what you want to do in retirement. Your financial planner can help you figure out how to support your retirement lifestyle., A financial plan won’t succeed unless both spouses work together. Sit down and hash out what your future looks like.Try to find consensus before meeting with your financial planner. They aren’t a therapist who can help couples work through money issues.


It’s okay if you don’t agree on everything. You might not have all the information you need to make an informed decision. After meeting with your financial planner, you both might agree on a course of action.

, You might have set up your 401(k) or IRA without really understanding what you were doing. Now that you are meeting with a professional, you can talk about your risk tolerance.For example, ask the following questions:


“What are the strengths and weaknesses of my current investment strategy?”
“What are the downsides of investing heavily in stocks at my age? Are there any upsides?”
“I’m scared of swings in the stock market. How can I maximize my investments safely?”
“Will more conservative investments help me achieve my financial goals?”

, You might want to retire at 55, but you’ll need to have enough money saved. Ask your financial planner if you can currently meet your goals or if you need to change your time horizon.Ask the following:


“Am I on track to meet my financial goals?”
“How can I change my investments to meet those goals?”
“Would I be better off changing my goals, such as retiring later?”

, You might get married, have a baby, or start a new business. You want to understand how these changes will affect your finances. You might need to change your investment strategies as a result. Ask the following:“Will I need to save more?”
“Should I change the beneficiary designation on my retirement accounts and life insurance policies?”
“Should I change my will or trust?”

, At the end of your meeting, your financial planner will give you a detailed roadmap for achieving your financial goals. However, things change. You’ll want to know how your financial planner will communicate with you. Ask the following:


“Will you update me of changes I should make in my investment strategy?”
“How can I reach you if I have a question? Do you respond to email?”
“Should I schedule an annual financial check-up with you?”

Identify all of your debts.,
Prioritize your debts.,
Create a budget.,
Refinance your mortgage.,
Tackle credit card debt.",How to Protect Your Finances Against Market Crashes2," In a market crash, you’ll need as much cash as possible to pay for living expenses. Accordingly, you want to decrease your debt load as much as possible now. Begin by identifying every debt you have, including any of the following:


student loan debt
credit card debt
home mortgage
car loan
personal loans

, You need to make the minimum monthly payments on all debts. However, you should direct extra money to the debts you want to pay off the most. Accordingly, sit down and prioritize your debts.


For example, if you lose your job, then you can often delay payments on student loans, using either forbearance or deferment. Accordingly, you might not want to pay down your student loans first but instead focus on credit cards, which probably have a higher interest rate.
However, some debts are tied to an asset. For example, you can lose your car or home if you don’t make payment.Paying these debts off early could be a wise choice.

, To free up money to contribute to debt payments, you’ll need to budget. Identify the following:


Your fixed expenses. These are bills that don’t change much month to month. Generally, fixed expenses are also for necessities, such as your rent or mortgage, health insurance premiums, car payments, and other debts.
Your discretionary spending. You can track your discretionary spending over the course of one or two months. Write down what you buy every day and note the price. Alternately, you can buy everything with a debit or credit card and then look at your monthly statement.
Reduce discretionary spending. You need your income to exceed your discretionary spending. To free up as much money as possible, reduce discretionary spending to the bare minimum by giving up gym memberships and cable TV. You can also cut out vacations, entertainment expenses, and meals in restaurants.

, Mortgage rates are still low. If you have a high APR, then consider refinancing into a loan with a lower one. Avoid spending the money that you save and instead funnel it toward debt repayment.


To investigate a mortgage refinance, contact your current lender to check what rate they can offer you. Then compare their rates to others on the market.

, You want a stable balance sheet when the market crashes, so you should reduce your debts as much as possible.In particular, you should pay down high-interest credit card debt. Identify a method of repayment so that you can wipe out these debts as soon as possible:



Debt avalanche. You pay the minimum monthly payment on all credit cards. Then you contribute extra money to the debt with the highest interest rate. Once you pay off that card, focus on the debt with the second highest interest rate.

Debt snowball. Another method is to pay the minimum on your monthly debts but then use extra to pay off the card with the smallest balance first. The debt snowball method is more expensive than the debt avalanche, but it can give you momentum.

Debt snowflake. This method is ideal for people who can’t budget extra money to pay down debt. Instead, you try to save a little bit of money every day and make multiple monthly payments to slowly chip away at your debt.

Build an emergency fund.,
Buy insurance.,
Assess the stability of your job.",How to Protect Your Finances Against Market Crashes3," You’ll need money in case you lose your job or if any kind of emergency springs up. Generally, you should save at least six months of expenses. If possible, save up to twelve months of expenses.


Put money toward your emergency fund every month, even if that means you pay off debts more slowly.
If you are a retiree, then you should try to have two years of expenses saved. When the market declines, you should live off your savings instead of drawing income from your investments., Insurance protects you from any unforeseen accidents that will hammer you financially. In an economic downturn, you’ll need all the money you can get, and insurance will provided valuable protection in case an accident strikes. Consider the following types of insurance:Health insurance. If your employer doesn’t offer it, you can buy it on the government exchanges. Depending on your income, you might quality for a premium subsidy and/or help with out-of-pocket expenses.

Automobile insurance. Your insurance will pay if you injure someone in an accident. Depending on the insurance, you might also be covered if someone without coverage injures you.

Disability insurance. If you are disabled before you reach retirement, you’ll need income to support you. Your employer probably offers disability insurance. If not, you can shop on your own.

Life Insurance. You can replace the income of a working spouse with a life insurance policy. Life insurance is particularly important if you have young children. Calculate how much life insurance you need at lifehappens.org.

Homeowner’s insurance. Your homeowner’s policy covers injuries that occur on your property, as well as any structural damage caused by natural disasters and other accidents.

, In a market crash, many jobs will be wiped out as employers are forced to lay off workers. You need to assess whether your job is stable enough to survive a recession, or whether you should plan on getting a different job.


Look at how many people your employer laid off during the last recession. Were only a few let go? If so, your job might be secure. However, if your employer engaged in mass layoffs, then there’s no reason to assume it won’t happen again.
You can also pick up some freelance or part-time work now. That way, if the market crashes, you’ll still have some income coming in.

Understand why it’s important to clean your planter.,
Clear out your indoor vases and planters too.,
Remove the previous year’s plant remains.,
Scrub the planter.,
Soak the planter if it has had problems with diseased plants in the past.,
Allow the planter to dry.",How to Clean a Planter1," Disease can be transmitted between plants if you don’t clean out a planter, even if you replace the soil in it. Disease spores hide in plant matter and can remain in soil for many years. That’s why it’s important to clear all disease-carrying material out of planters between uses.


Porous planters, such as wood and terracotta, will harbor disease especially well.;
, Aside from garden planters, it’s also important to clean vases and household planters between uses as these can also transmit disease between plants or cut flowers.

, Before the new planting season, empty out the previous year’s plant remains and any soil left in the planter. This soil should not be reused or composted, especially if you have had problems with disease in the past.


You may find that compost in a planter is best replaced anyway because the nutrients will be used up during a plant’s life cycle. Your next planting arrangement will perform better with fresh compost.

, Once empty, give the planter a good scrub using a fairly stiff brush, warm water and liquid detergent. Don’t neglect to clean the outside or any trays, troughs or saucers the planter sits in.


Make sure the planter is rinsed well to remove any cleaning fluids.

, If disease has been a problem in the container before, soak it in a weak bleach solution (about 10% bleach) for roughly an hour.


If you aren’t able to immerse a large pot in the solution, then try making a slightly stronger one and sponge down the inside and outside of the plant.

, Let the planter dry off before replanting it again with fresh soil. Avoid putting soil from the garden into your containers; instead use sterile bagged soil from the garden store or your own homemade compost.

Use caution when making your own compost.,
Keep your garden tidy to reduce the activities of insects.,
Wear gloves when handling compost.",How to Clean a Planter2," If you are making your own compost, it’s very easy to spread disease around the garden. Diseases may spread if you take pruned plant matter from one part of the garden and place it in your compost pile to be used in a separate part of your garden. Avoid composting any material that shows signs of disease.


If in doubt, don’t add it to the compost pile. The heat from a well-constructed compost pile usually kills off disease but this process can’t always be relied on.

, While insects can be beneficial to your garden, some insects may carry diseases that could harm your plants. Activities such as sweeping up leaf litter will remove habitats for small mammals and insects. You’ll need to find your own balance between being a wildlife-tolerant gardener and trying to stop insects from spreading disease.


You might compromise by having an insect-friendly part of your garden that is separated from the rest of your garden.
Don’t blindly spray any insect that comes into your garden and be prepared to lose a few leaves to caterpillars—they turn into butterflies that help your plants after all.

, This article has talked about plant diseases but it’s also important to protect yourself. Plants don’t tend to share diseases with humans but there have been some instances of compost transmitting diseases to gardeners. Rest assured this is very rare. However, it is still good practice to wear gardening gloves whenever you handle compost or manure.Wash your hands after handling compost and avoid situations where you are breathing in compost dust.

Use clean sterilized soil.,
Keep your tools clean.,
Dispose of diseased material.,
Keep your plants healthy by caring for them.,
Space plants well.,
Purchase disease-resistant plants.,
Try to mix up the area where you place certain plants.",How to Clean a Planter3," Replace soil between plantings, especially in containers and especially from plants that are disease-prone.

, It’s a good idea to disinfect digging and pruning tools occasionally using a weak bleach solution (about one part bleach to ten parts water).

, Burn any diseased plant material, or throw it out with household trash. Never compost any plant matter showing signs of disease. Once a plant shows signs of disease, remove it, remove the surrounding soil and do not plant the same variety in that spot again.


Prune off any diseased growth from living plants.

, Plants growing in the right conditions for their variety are more resistant to disease. If plants are stressed (for example, getting too little water) they are more susceptible.

, Circulating air between plants is healthier than crowding. When pruning, try to remove congestion from the heart of a shrub by removing crowded growth.

, When purchasing plants, try to buy varieties resistant to the most common diseases for that type of plant. You’ll often see this marked on the nursery label using abbreviations such as ‘VF’, meaning that the plant has enhanced resistance to Verticillium and Fusarium wilts.


You might also see ‘PM’, meaning that the plant has resistance to powdery mildew. You don’t need to memorize all these abbreviations but if you are finding a particular disease is a problem in your garden, look for varieties resistant to it.

, Avoid planting the same species in an area year after year, especially if it encounters disease issues. Diseases can build up their presence in soil over time, meaning a mild attack one year can affect the crop with increasing severity over the next planting seasons.


If you have a disease problem, change your planting completely and avoid planting the same variety in that area. Ideally avoid planting related plants as they too may be susceptible. If you are determined to continue the same planting scheme in that area, remove the soil to a good depth before replanting.

Give the small parts a deeper clean.",How to Clean a Garden Sprayer," Plan ahead with your herbicide or pesticide so that you’re only filling the tank with as much of the liquid as you need. Spray plants a second time if you need to use up excess herbicide since almost all herbicides are approved to be sprayed twice., Contact your local health department or environmental agency to find a safe way to dispose of this liquid. Do not empty the chemicals onto grass, near any flowers or plants, down a drain or into a water source. Doing so can harm local plants and animals.If you need to empty your sprayer quickly, find an empty plastic or glass container that you can pour the leftover chemicals into (such as the original bottle), then seal and dispose of it later.

, Do not allow the sprayer to sit with herbicide or pesticide in it, even just overnight. Residues from the chemicals you use can build up over time and make your sprayer more difficult to clean., Depending on the chemical, there may be specific instructions for how to clean the sprayer. Follow any cleaning directions on the product's container.

, Since you'll be working with harsh chemicals, make sure you wear rubber gloves and safety goggles. If you have one, wear a face shield to protect yourself from splashes., Fill the reservoir until it’s about halfway full, and then squirt the hot water through the garden sprayer until all the water in the reservoir has been used. Spray the water in a safe location, away from water sources and areas accessible to children and pets.Consider spraying next to or near where you were using the herbicide or pesticide since the chemical residue will be the same.
If you will be using the same type of chemical the next day, you can stop after a thorough flush with water and skip any further cleaning until you’re completely finished with that product., The cleaning solution should contain about 1 ounce (30 mL) of ammonia per gallon (3.8 L) of water. Fill the reservoir about halfway with this solution, and then spray the cleaning solution through the garden sprayer several times to flush the wand and the nozzle.Ammonia is effective for most herbicides, but not all. Research your particular herbicide to see if a bleach solution, powdered detergent, or kerosene solution would be better.You can also purchase a commercial tank cleaner at a hardware or home improvement store. Look for one tailored toward the type of chemical you’re using in the sprayer, and follow the directions on the packaging.

, With the reservoir about half full of cleaning solution, let it sit for several hours, preferably overnight. This will allow the solution to work into the residue in your sprayer and break it down., The next day, spray until you’ve emptied the cleaning solution from the reservoir. Since the sprayer may still contain pesticide or herbicide residue, it’s best to spray it in a safe area away from water sources and areas accessible to children and pets., Fill the reservoir about halfway with water again, and spray the hose until you’ve emptied the remaining water in the reservoir., Take the hose, wand, and nozzle apart to give them a more thorough cleaning. Rinse them with warm, soapy water, and try using an old toothbrush to scrub the small crevices."

The best way to do this is by putting on a pair of heavy duty gardening gloves. Opt for thick leather gloves if possible., You will also want to make sure your eyes are protected while sharpening pruning shears. The best way to do this is to wear a pair of safety glasses or goggles. Protective eyewear will prevent shards of metal or rust from injuring your eyes while cleaning and sharpening the shears., Cleaning and sharpening gardening tools can be dangerous. If you accidentally cut yourself while cleaning or sharpening your pruning shears, you should seek medical attention immediately.

, Before you attempt to sharpen pruning shears, you will need to wash them. Fill a container or sink with warm water and two teaspoons of dish soap. Dip a stiff brush into the soapy water. Scrub each blade with the brush., Once you have scrubbed the debris from the shears with warm, soapy water, you will need to make sure the soap is completely removed from the blades. Rinse each blade thoroughly with clean, cool water. Repeat until they are free from soap., Grab a thick, dry cloth like a towel. Gently wipe the top blade dry with the towel. Then use the towel to wipe the bottom blade dry. Be careful as you dry the blades, making sure you do not cut yourself., Once you have washed and dried the shears, examine each blade for rust. It is common for rust to appear on pruning shears, and it is important that you remove it prior to sharpening them. Take a piece of medium-coarse steel wool and carefully buff off the rust.After you buff off the rust, rinse the blades again.
After rinsing the blades, dry them with a towel.

, If you have a bench vise, you should use it to secure the pruners. This will make sharpening the blades safer and easier. Open the shears wide and make sure the beveled edge of the cutting blade is facing you. Then secure the pruners in the bench vise., You will use a medium or coarse diamond hand file to sharpen the pruning shears. Position the file against the cutting blade. The file should be at the same angle as the bevel. You will maintain this angle as you sharpen the blades., Using one smooth stroke, draw the file along the contour of the blade. Use one smooth stroke to move the file from the base to the tip, in the direction away from your body. Use moderate pressure as you file.Make sure you always keep the file at the same angle during the entire stroke.
Never file toward yourself. Instead, make sure you file away from your body.

, Continue to file in single, smooth strokes until a sharp edge forms on the blade of your pruning shears. This should take anywhere between 10 and 20 strokes. It will take you several minutes to complete the sharpening.If you have bypass or anvil style pruners, you will only sharpen the beveled cutting blade.
For all other types of pruning shears, repeat this step on the opposite blade.

, Once you are done sharpening the blades of your pruning shears, you will want to remove any burrs that accrued on the backside of the blade. Turn the shears over and file the backside with a few strokes to remove the burrs., Once you have sharpened your pruning shears, you will need to wipe linseed oil over the blades to prevent rust. Dip a soft cloth in the linseed oil and gently wipe the cloth over the blades. Store the blades until next use.

Keep in mind that the larger plant or flowerpot is, the larger bottle you will need. Here are some other types of glass bottles that you can use:


Any sauce bottle, such as hot sauce or soy sauce.
Carbonated water bottle
Old-fashioned soda bottle
Olive oil bottle
Vinegar bottle;
, You will be using this later. It your bottle does not have a cork or cap, you can still make it work. Follow the steps for removing the label from your bottle, then click here to learn how to turn it into a plant waterer.

, Fill the bottle with hot water and a few drops of dish soap. Close the bottle and shake it. After a few minutes, open the bottle and pour the soapy water out. Fill the bottle with water again and pour it out. Keep doing this until the water runs clean and there are no soap bubbles left.








, Try using your kitchen sink instead of your bathroom sink; it is more likely to have more space. If you do not have enough room in your sink, use a large plastic bin or bucket.









Consider leaving the label on. Some wine bottles have interesting labels. You can leave it on your bottle for an interesting look. If you wish to remove the label, keep reading.

, Stir the water with a spoon to dissolve the washing soda.

, You want it to be completely submerged. During this time, the hot water and washing soda will dissolve the glue on the label, making it easier to remove.

, The label should slide off on its own. If not, you may have to pull it off. Dry the bottle off with a soft cloth once you have the label off.









If there is any residue, you can clean it off using rubbing alcohol or acetone. Dampen a paper towel with rubbing alcohol or acetone, then rub the residue until there is none left.

, This may make it easier to poke the hole into the cap.Place the tip of a flat-tipped screwdriver between the edge of the padding and the inside of the cap. Gently push down on the handle. This will cause the padding to pop out.


If you don't have a screwdriver, you can use a craft knife instead.

, The top of the cap should be facing you. The bottom of the cap should be facing the wood. This will help protect your table or work surface from getting damaged if you punch the hole too deep.


You can also use an old cutting board instead.

, If you are worried about smashing or hurting your fingers, put on a pair of work gloves.

, Take a sharp nail and position it in the center of the cap. Hold it steady between your thumb and forefinger. Hit the top of the nail with a hammer. Remove the nail when you are done.

, Keep in mind that this will be more effective on plastic caps, and less effective on metal ones. Simply hold the bottle cap between your fingers, and hold the tip of the drill against the top of the cap. Turn the drill on and push down lightly on it until the tip goes into the cap. Stop the drill and pull it out of the hole you made.

, You may have little to no reside if you used a hammer and nail, but you may have some dust if you used a drill. Simply wipe the top and inside of the cap using a damp cloth. This will help prevent any clogs.

, This may help prevent the cork from crumbling when you try to make a hole in it., Keep twisting the corkscrew until the metal spiral goes all the way through the cork. Twist the corkscrew in the other direction to take it out.









You can put the cork into the wine bottle for this step. The neck of the bottle will help keep it steady while you work.

, Use a screwdriver to twist a screw into the cork. Make sure that the screw goes all the way through the cork, from top to bottom. Twist the screwdriver in the opposite direction to take the screw out.

, Place the cork down on a piece of wood and hold it steady between your thumb and forefinger. Place the tip of a drill against the top of the cork and turn the drill on. Gently press down on the drill until the tip goes all the way through the cork. Turn the drill off and pull it out of the cork when you are done.

, You can do this by gently blowing into the hole. You can also place the cork under running water, and let the water flow through the hole. This will help prevent any clogs later on.

, Use the base of the bottle to trace a circle onto some fabric. You will be attaching this to the bottle opening to prevent clogging.You can also use wire mesh instead of fabric.


Try using a thin fabric, such as cotton. Thick fabric, such as linen or canvas will be too thick and won't let the water pass through.

, You can also add some plant food into the water at this point. Do not fill the bottle all the way; fill it up just to where it starts to narrow.








, Make sure that the circle is centered over the mouth of the bottle.

, Press the edges of the fabric circle down against the neck of the bottle. Tie a piece of string around the neck and fabric, just below the lip. If you do not have string, use a rubber band or twist tie. When the bottle becomes empty and you need to refill it, simply pull the string and fabric off. Refill the bottle, then put the fabric and string back on.

, They are shaped like cones, and are made for wine bottle plant waterers. You can find them in nurseries or in the garden section of a home improvement store. Stick the stake into the soil, and place the wine bottle down into it. You do not need to keep the original cork or cap. You also won't need any fabric or mesh.


You may also find these plant stakes labeled as ""Wine Bottle Plant Nanny Watering Stakes.""

, Do not fill the bottle all the way. Instead, fill it up to just where the neck begins to narrow. You can also add some plant food into the bottle at this point.








, If you have a very large plant, such as a tree, you may need to make a second bottle.

, If the soil is too dry, the water in your bottle will empty too quickly., The soil may also get forced into the bottle opening and create a clog.If you are going to use the bottle in a flowerpot, make the hole close to the edge of the pot. Try to make the hole at an angle, with the bottom pointing away from the pot's rim. This will allow you to insert the bottle at an angle, and rest the bottle against the edge of the pot.If the bottle's neck is shorter than 2 inches (5.08 centimeters), make a shallower hole.

, Keep pushing the bottle until it won't go in any further. The mouth of the bottle should be pressed firmly against the soil.








Consider wearing work gloves for this step, in case the bottle breaks., If there are any bubbles or the water level is changing, take the bottle out and try again. This happens when the bottle mouth didn't seal against the soil., This bottle is ideal for the forgetful gardener, or if you are going away on vacation.








, You can find these vase fillers in most arts and crafts stores. You can also find them in the fish department of a pet store. Spread a thin layer of glass adhesive, such as E6000 or Weldbond onto the bottle, and stick the marbles on. Work in small patches, from the base of the bottle to the top. Leave the neck uncovered. Wait at least 24 hours for the glue to cure.If the marbles keep sliding off, try holding them in place with some masking tape. Simply place a piece of masking tape over the marbles. Stick both ends of the tape to the sides of the bottle.
Consider using other items, such as gemstones or sea shells.

, Stick an adhesive stencil onto the bottle. Brush on a thick layer of glass etching cream; you can find it in the glass and mosaic section of an arts and crafts store. Wait 15 minutes, or the amount of time recommended on the label, then wash it off. When you are done, pull the stencil off.To create the designs, you can use adhesive glass stencils. You can also use letter stickers. The area around the stickers will be frosted. The area covered by the stickers will be clear.

, Buff the bottle with fine-grained sandpaper, and wipe it clean with some rubbing alcohol. Shake a can of chalkboard spray paint until you can hear it rattling. Hold the can 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the surface of the bottle, and apply a light, even coat of paint. Wait for the paint to dry before applying a second coat. Let the paint cure for at least 24 hours before priming it.To prime the chalkboard paint, rub a piece of chalk over the entire surface, then wipe it off.
Because you won't be able to see inside the bottle, consider writing down the last time you filled it right onto the chalkboard surface.

, Make a square or rectangle on the bottle with masking tape. Paint over the square using chalkboard paint and a paintbrush. Let the paint dry before applying more layers. Once you are done painting, pull off the masking tape and allow the paint to cure completely. Prime the paint by covering it with a piece of chalk, then wiping the chalk off.Write down the name of the plant or herb on the label. The bottle will double as a plant marker.

, Use flat-backed marbles instead of round ones, as they are less likely to fall out of the bottle. They will not only add color to the bottle, but also help regulate the water flow.

, This can be done by switching off the water pump's breaker, turning its power off at the pump box, or closing the valve manually. Doing so will stop the supply of water to the underground pipes, making for a clean repair with lower chance of self harm. If your water pump starts running during repairs, it will create quite a mess.

,


Carefully dig the patch of grass in a circular motion with a spade shovel around the sprinkler head, being careful to not sever electrical lines or water lines underground. Doing so will leave with with large chunks of sod.
Remove the circular patch of grass and set it aside for when you fill in the hole.
Keep digging by hand until you reveal the piping and wires for your system so you can observe what may have broken.

,

Unscrew the head from the water supply.
If head is on too tight, grab head with tongue and groove pliers and turn counterclockwise to loosen.
Examine the head to identify the cause of the problem.
Abrasions on the top of the head due to mower blades hitting it may be prevalent. The center part of the head may be completely clipped off by a mower as well.
Your solenoid (the part with the wires coming out that opens the valve of the head) may be burnt up. You can determine if the solenoid is burnt up by examining the wires running into it for any burnt marks, examining the solenoid itself by testing the leads with a multi-meter, or seeing if there are any scorch marks on it followed by a burnt smell.
Replacing just a solenoid on an automatic sprinkler head can be much cheaper than replacing the whole head.

,

Often times a mower may have driven over the head and snapped the piping below it. The head may still be reusable.
If no damage to piping has occurred, you can skip the repairing steps.

, Remove the piping with the elbow as a unit. Bring old piping and fittings to your nearest hardware store. They will be able to tell you what size they are and provide you with the same parts.

,

Sand the edges of the PVC pipe where you cut the elbow from to ensure no debris gets into the new head.
Make sure no dirt is inside the piping, it could clog the new head.

,

Apply PVC primer in a circular motion around the piping where the new elbow will be glued.
Cement the outer edges of the water supply pipe where the new elbow will be placed.
Fit the new elbow on the freshly glued surface and make sure it is pointing 90 degrees to the ground (so the sprinkler head is flush with the ground).

,


Add the threaded fitting for the sprinkler head.
Put on your protective eye gear so debris from cutting PVC does not damage your sight.
Cut the new assembly with the head on it to the same length as the old. This will assure that your sprinkler head is the same level above ground as the old one.
If the old head was too far above the ground causing it to be hit, trim down the new assembly slightly shorter to your desired height.

,

Apply PVC cement on the new assembly.
Glue the new assembly into the newly glued on elbow.
Adjust the assembly so the head will sit flush with the grass surface.
Allow proper time for PVC cement to cure. Curing times are listed on the bottle and differ with temperature.

,


Apply thread sealing tape to threads of assembly.
Often times thread sealing tape will include instructions, but if yours does not, stretch the new tape while applying around the threads and overlap the previous wrap by 50%.
Screw on the new sprinkler head.
Connect the new head to the underground leads. Apply new wire nuts to ensure proper connection.

, You want a few strips of foil for every few feet of mulch in your garden bed.

, If you haven’t already laid the mulch, pour mulch into a wheelbarrow and then add foil. Use a hoe or gardening tool to mix the foil into the mulch.


Scatter the mulch in the garden bed. Mingle the foil into the mulch, evenly scattering pieces throughout the garden bed.

, Use a garden hoe to integrate foil into the previously laid mulch, scattering the foil thoroughly.

Measure the base of tree trunks you’d like to protect during the winter.,
Tear sheets of foil according to your measurements.,
Wrap the base of the tree trunk with the first sheet of foil.,
Work your way upward as high as you plan to wrap the tree and then add your next layer, starting with the base of the tree.

",How to Use Aluminum Foil for Gardening2," Small pests/rodents will munch on tree trunks during the winter months. Measure the circumference of the tree trunk and height from the base , 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) from the ground.

, Double each measurement as you will be layering two sheets of foil around the tree trunk for protection.

, Press foil against tree trunk so it adheres to the wood.

, You'll use these for a lot of pruning jobs, so be prepared to spend a decent amount on them. Secateurs are good for fine pruning tasks.

, These should be medium-sized. They are ideal for pruning branches that are thin. You can also use loppers to thin out branches.

, A handsaw is needed for tougher branches and thicker branches. Be sure to check its sturdiness when buying it; avoid anything that is wobbly or bends.

, These are ideal for dead-heading and trimming.

Dig a hole.,
Place the plant in the hole.,
Fill up the hole.",How to Grow Snakegrass1," Whether you’re planting in soil or water, you should dig a hole large enough to hold the rhizome ball that forms at the bottom of all snakegrass. The plant will root from this ball, which allows it to spread wildly.

Snakegrass is a plant that spreads wildly by default, and you don’t need to be too picky about where you plant it. As long as it gets a bit of sun, it’ll have all it needs to grow. You may want to consider building a retaining wall to prevent it from growing out of control.
If planting in water, plant snakegrass in water no deeper than four inches (10 cm).;
, This will be simple enough in soil; just lay the plant in the hole so that the rhizome ball lays at the bottom. In water, you’ll have to keep a hold on the plant to make sure it doesn’t just float away., Pack dirt tightly around the plant, completely covering the rhizomes. You should fill the hole until it’s level with the rest of the ground. If you’re planting in water, you can put a bit of gravel around the snakegrass, keeping the dirt tight around it. Be careful not to crush the plant’s stem if you do this."

Position your tank in a warm, bright place.,
Prepare your medium.,
Check the temperature of the medium.,
Add the spirulina starter.,
Watch your spirulina colony grow.,
Agitate the tank occasionally.,
Harvest your spirulina after about 3-6 weeks.,
Filter your spirulina through a fine cloth.,
Replenish the spirulina colony's food.",How to Grow Spirulina at Home," Most home growers find that a standard size aquarium is perfectly adequate as a space to grow spirulina in. A tank that size will supply a family of four with plenty of spirulina.You can grow spirulina in larger tanks, or even in a basin or pool outdoors (if you live in a warm climate). However, it will be easier to manage the spirulina culture indoors in a small tank.;
, A spirulina colony can appear thick, but it’s mostly water. Once it’s ready to eat or use, you’ll want to squeeze out the excess water. For most home growers who will want to use only a small amount of fresh spirulina at a time, a fine cloth or mesh will work just fine. In addition, you'll need a scoop to get the spirulina out of the tank.If you want to harvest larger amounts of spirulina to dry, get a larger supply of fine cloth or mesh to make things easier.

, Trying to grow spirulina in plain water won’t necessarily lead to great results. To have an optimal colony, you’ll need to add specific minerals. You don’t have to be an expert, though--you can buy premixed mineral “food” for spirulina from health and organic stores as well as online. Make sure that it contains:Sodium bicarbonate
Magnesium sulfate
Potassium nitrate
Citric acid
Salt
Urea
Calcium chloride
Iron sulfate
Ammonium sulfate

, To get your own spirulina colony going, you’ll need a bit of live spirulina as a starter. Check with your local or favorite online health food or organic supplies store and ask for a spirulina starter kit.Spirulina starter cultures are usually as simple as a bottle containing spirulina algae in its medium (water).
Buy spirulina cultures only from sources you trust. Since spirulina can absorb heavy metals and other toxins, you want to ensure that the starter supply has come from a safe source.

, If possible, set your tank so that it is near a south-facing window that gets lots of sunshine. Spirulina algae need plenty of light and warmth to grow well.Some spirulina growers use artificial light, but results will be better with natural light.

, Spirulina growers refer to the “medium” the algae grows in, but this really just means the water in the tank, with the mineral “food” added. Fill your tank with filtered water, and add the mineral mix according to the package instructions.You can run tap water through a standard faucet filter (such as a Brita or Pur filter), and use this for your tank.
If your water is chlorinated, you should de-chlorinate it using supplies found at aquarium supply stores.

, Ideally, the temperature in your tank should be around 35°C (95 F), but above 38°C (100.4 F) is too warm. Use an aquarium thermometer to make sure your tank will provide the right temperature for your spirulina.Spirulina can tolerate lower temperatures without dying, but will do best in warm environments.
If your tank is too cold, you can warm it with an aquarium heater, which can be found at an aquarium supply or pet store., You should follow the exact instructions that come with your bottle of spirulina starter to be sure, but usually it’s simple to add the starter culture. Generally, you just pour one half to three-fourths of the bottle into the medium in your tank., At first, your spirulina colony will seem thin, but over time it will thicken and expand in size. Most of the time, you won’t have to do anything to your colony other than let it grow!If your colony doesn’t seem to be growing well, test the pH of your tank, which should be around 10 when the spirulina is harvestable. If the pH is off, you may need to add more mineral “food.”
You can find pH test strips at aquarium supply stores or online.

, Your spirulina will need oxygen to thrive. Some growers will use an aquarium pump to ensure a supply of oxygen, but this isn’t strictly necessary. To help air get into the water of your tank, you can simply stir the medium occasionally., Once your spirulina is thriving, you can start taking some out to consume. All you have to do is scoop some out! Most people find that about a spoonful of spirulina at a time is enough if you are consuming it fresh., Place the spirulina you took from your tank onto the cloth. Hold it over a sink or bowl and gently squeeze out the excess water. You’ll be left with a thick green paste. Use this fresh spirulina in smoothies, top your favorite foods with it, or enjoy it all by itself!, Each time you take some spirulina out of your tank, make sure to add a bit of the mineral mixture back in, in about equal measure. For instance, if you tank out a tablespoon of spirulina, add about a tablespoon of the medium back in."

Choose the right area.,
Prepare a container.,
Place the plant in your container and add soil.,
Dig a hole and insert the container.,
Fill up the hole.",How to Grow Snakegrass2," Snakegrass is a fairly resilient plant that can thrive in a few different environments. For optimal growing, you’ll want to make sure it gets plenty of sun, though it can also grow well in part shade. Make sure the spot you choose is at least mildly wet.

If you want to plant your snakegrass in water, make sure you choose a spot where the water is no higher than 4 inches (10 cm)., Snakegrass roots tend to ball up as they grow outwards, so make sure to choose a container that can accommodate this. As with any planting container, it should have drainage holes. However, growing snakegrass means you’ll need cover up the drainage holes enough that the roots, or rhizomes, can’t snake out of the drainage holes and spread to the rest of your garden. Lay fine mesh at the bottom of the container to protect the drainage holes.

Planting snakegrass in a container will help prevent it from spreading too wildly. If you want your snakegrass to spread, you’ll instead want to plant it directly in the soil. Be prepared for it to spread more efficiently than you might think., You can use any general purpose potting soil for this; snakegrass doesn’t need any specific nutrients or special soil. Add soil until you entirely cover the plant’s rhizomes. Leave a few inches between the top of the soil and the container’s rim.

If planting snakegrass in water, lay a layer of gravel an inch (2.5 cm) high on top of the soil. This will protect it, preventing it from getting flooded or washing out., The hole should be about 2-3 inches (5 - 7.6 cm) wider and an inch (2.5 cm) shallower than the container you used. Place the container in the hole, checking that it sticks out by about an inch. If it’s a bit too high, you can press down on the container and twist; this will help it dig deeper.

This is only needed if you want to partially bury the pot in the ground., Use the freshly dug soil to fill in the hole around your container. Make sure to pack the dirt tightly around the container. Water the soil around the container to help it settle.

Only do this if you’re looking to partially bury your container in the soil."
"
Check potted plants for growths.,
Prune rhizomes regularly.,
Watch for spores.",How to Grow Snakegrass3," With the drainage holes properly blocked, snakegrass rhizomes may instead try to grow out of the container to spread to the soil around it. You should check your snakegrass at least once a month for sneaky rhizomes., Focus on pruning any rhizomes that have grown from the container and are trying to spread. If the plant isn’t potted, you might still find rhizomes trying to reach towards other plants or into a garden you might have nearby. These will look like tiny vines, and you’ll likely find them poking out of the soil around your plant.

Use rubbing alcohol to disinfect your pruning shears before and after pruning your snakegrass plant., Since snakegrass can release spores, you should keep an eye out for fruiting stems. These stems will have a cone-shaped head, and you’ll usually find them in the spring. Be sure to prune these, otherwise your plant will release spores, likely spreading it beyond the confines of your land.

Be careful handling spore stems; shaking them or dropping them could release the spores and create new snakegrass plants.
It’s important to discard snakegrass prunings properly, as a new plant can grow from them fairly easily. Place prunings in a sealed plastic bag before putting them in the garbage."

Collect approximately 2 cups of willow branches or 3 cups of bark.,
Cut the willow branches into pieces between 3-to-6-inches long.,
Put the willow into a pan or bowl that is large enough to hold the clippings plus a gallon of water.

,
Boil 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water and pour it over the willow clippings.

,
Allow the willow and hot water to brew for 12 to 24 hours.

,
Pour the liquid into glass containers with lids that close securely and discard the pieces of willow.,
Use the rooting tonic when propagating new plants.",How to Make a Rooting Tonic,"


Choose small, young branches that are no thicker than a pencil. The highest concentration of hormone exists in the youngest branches.
You can also use bark from live older willow branches or trunks. If you go this route, you need to use more bark because it contains less hormones.
Do not gather old dead branches from the ground, as they will contain very little indolebutyric acid, if any.;
, If using bark, cut it into 2-to-4-inch pieces.

,,,, You can store the tonic in the refrigerator for up to two months.

,


Soak the tips of your cuttings in the rooting tonic for several hours before planting them.
In addition to encouraging the growth of a strong root system, the willow rooting tonic inhibits the development of bacteria, fungus and viral disease.

Make sure the soil is suitable.,
Give each plant its own space.,
Water the plants well.,
Make sure that your plants get sunlight.,
Remove any nearby weeds.",How to Help Your Small Plants Along," Soil provides the essential nutrients and minerals that your plants need to grow properly. If the soil doesn't contain these nutrients, though, the plant won't be able to grow. Mix in some organic materials like compost or manure to ensure the soil is a suitable environment for the plant.

If a plant species has deep roots, the soil needs to be deep enough to fit these roots, otherwise the plant can't expand its roots to grow. Consider moving the plant if the soil is unsuitable.;
, Every plant needs space, so make sure it is not wedged in with another vegetable or plant. If plants are too close together, it can limit the amount of sunlight and water each plant gets. Read the seed packaging carefully or research on the internet to see how much space should be between your plants.

Certain plants will compete with each other for sunlight, water and minerals. It is important to keep these plants apart as much as possible.

, The plants need new water every day. On especially hot days, they might need more water than usual. On rainy days, you shouldn't need to water them. Having a large watering can that can pour water slowly can quite useful, since you don't want to give them too much water.

Make sure to water the soil, not the plant itself. The plant absorbs water through its roots in the soil, so the water needs to be in the soil. Pouring too much water on the plant can damage it.

, Plants get their energy from sunlight, so they need to be placed in direct sunlight to grow properly. Too little sunlight can cause the plant to stop growing or die. However, too much sun is bad for the plant and it could die.  It's important to find a balance.

Good places to put plants include next to a window or outside. Plants will naturally grow towards a light source, so, at the very least, there should be one nearby.

, Weeds can take all of the plant's nutrients and water and cause the plant to stop growing or die. If there are any weeds near your plant, you should remove them so they don't spread or damage your plant further.

Remember to remove all of the weed, including the roots, not just the part of the weed that's above ground. If you leave the roots under the ground, the weed can grow back.

So you have a waterfarm from Ghe and you are amazed at the results that can be obtained from using one of these ""farms"" , with a few simple to do modifications and a few simple tools you can transform you farm into a combined DWP system as well.,
The waterfarm is essentially two buckets sitting inside each other with the top bucket shorter in length to form a reservoir area at the bottom of the buckets.,
The nutrients etc are pumped up from the reservoir by way of an airstone at the bottom of a white uplift tube and connected to a dripper ring , the nutrients are drawn up the tube and through the dripper ring where they drain through the hydroponic medium and back into the reservoir.

,
The top bucket has holes drilled in the base of the bucket to allow water to drain through , step one in turbo charging your farm is to increase the amount of holes in the top bucket .

,
The more holes the better , this allows the water to drain freely back into the reservoir .

,
Now feed another airline down through one of the holes you have drilled which will connect onto your airpump and also onto an airstone which will sit directly in the nutrient tank.

,
Connect up the airstone to the new airline.

,
Now the only remaining thing for you to do is connect up and good quality twin outlet airpump , connect one outlet to the airstone and the remaining outlet to the uplift tube.

,
Now if you have read this far you will be wondering why these simple modifications can improve such an established hydroponic system such as the Ghe Waterfarm.

,
More holes allow faster draining but also allows more holes for roots to get down into the nutrient tank which is being aerated by the airstone.,
Using a larger airpump allows more nutrients to be fed through the dripper ring and drain through the clay pebbles etc and back into the reservoir, moving water absorbs oxygen which is good for plants.

,
Adding an airstone to the reservoir makes your standard waterfarm instantly a DWP system as well for simply drilling a hole and feeding an airline.",How to Modify a Ghe Waterfarm,";
, Water drains through the top bucket and back into the reservoir area at the bottom of the larger bucket.

,,,,,,,, As soon as the roots hit the nutrient tank watch the explosive growth start.

,, Growers use DWP on their own and achieve amazing results so adding this to the waterfarm's own results is a win win situation.

Make sure that the soil is completely saturated.,
Get a glass bottle with a narrow neck.,
Fill the bottle with water.,
Place your thumb over the mouth of the bottle and turn it upside down.,
Push the bottle neck into the soil, moving your thumb out of the way as you do so.,
Make sure that the water is draining properly.",How to Water Plants While You're Away1," If the soil is too dry, it will soak up all of the water that is in the bottle. If the soil is too dry, water it now., A wine bottle will be ideal, because it will be large enough to water 4 to 6 square feet (0.38 to 0.56 square meters) for up to 3 days. If you don't need to water such a large area, you can use a smaller bottle, such as a soda or beer bottle.Alternatively, you can also use a store bought watering globe or aqua globe.

, Don't fill it all the way; just up to where the neck starts will be plenty. At this time, you can also add additional items, such as liquid fertilizers.

, Position the bottle right next to the plant you need to be watered.

, Make sure that the bottle's neck is several inches in the soil. It's okay if the bottle leans to the side, but it should be sturdy and secure., If the water is not draining at all, the soil might be clogging the bottle. If this happens, take the bottle out of the soil, clean it, and glue a piece of screening over the mouth. Refill the bottle, and insert it into the soil again.Draw a line on the bottle with a permanent marker, right at the water level. Check back after a few hours (or even a whole day). If the water level is below the line you drew, the water is draining properly. If the water level has not changed, something might be blocking it.

"
"
Make sure that the soil is saturated before you begin.,
Place a gallon-sized (3.79 liters) jug next to your plant.,
Cut a long piece of cotton or nylon twine.,
Place one end of the string into the jug.,
Poke the other end of the string into the soil at the base of the plant.,
Fill the jug with water.,
Make sure that the mouth of the jug is above the base of the plant.",How to Water Plants While You're Away2," If the soil is too dry, it will soak up all of the water from the jug before you leave on your trip. By the time you get back, there may not even be any water left in the jug.

, Position the jug so that it is out of direct sunlight; this will reduce the amount of evaporation. If you are only going for a few days and have a small plant, a mason jar will be enough.Don't fill the jug with water yet.


This method will keep your plants watered for up to a week.

, The twine needs to be long enough to extend from the bottom of the jug to the base of the plant. If you can't find cotton or nylon twine, or if it is too thin, braid three strips of cotton fabric together, and use that instead.The string must be able to hold water. If it can't hold water, this method won't work., The string must reach the bottom of the jug. If you wish to water more than one plant, it might be a good idea to set up more jugs, one for each plant. This way, you won't run into the risk of the jug running out of water while you are away.


If you have a few plants that don't require a lot of water, such as succulents, you might be able to get away with a single jug for two or three plants. Even if the jug does run out of water, your plants may still survive because of their water-retaining properties.

, The string needs to be about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) deep.Also, make sure that the string is out of direct sunlight. Partial sun is fine, but if there is too much sunlight, the string will dry out before it can get the water to the plant., If your plants need fertilizer, you can also add some liquid fertilizer into the water at this time. If your plant is in a sunny spot, consider putting a piece of duct tape over the mouth of the jug; be careful not to cover the string, however. This will help slow down the rate of evaporation.

, If the jug is too low, put it on top of a book, a block, or an upturned pot to raise it up a little. This way, the water will be able to drip down the string.

"
"
Make sure that the soil is completely damp.,
Get a plastic, 2-liter (2-quart) bottle.,
Use a hammer and nail to poke 2 holes into the bottom of the bottle.,
Poke a few more holes up the sides of the bottle.,
Dig a hole in the dirt next to your plant.,
Insert the bottle into the hole.,
Fill the bottle with water.,
Put the lid onto the bottle, if desired.",How to Water Plants While You're Away3," If the soil is too dry, it will soak up all the water from your bottle before you even leave for your trip. Having the soil already damp before you begin will ensure that the plant doesn't soak up the water too fast.

, If you have a smaller plant to take care of, a smaller bottle will do just fine. Since you will be burying this bottle in the soil, this method will work best for garden plants or plants in large containers.

, This is very important. If you don't have any drain holes at the bottom of the bottle, the water will sit instead of draining out. This can lead to algae growth., You don't need a lot; 3 to 5 holes will be plenty. If you put in too many holes, the water will leak out too fast, which you don't want.


Focus the holes on one side of the bottle. When you put the bottle into the soil, turn it so that the holes face the plant you are watering.
It's better to start with too few holes than too many. You can always add more holes later if there aren't enough, but it will be difficult to cover up holes that are already there.

, The hole needs to be deep enough to cover the bottle up to the neck.

, Gently pat the soil around the bottle and be careful not to get any inside it.

, At this point, you can also add some liquid fertilizer as well., The lid will help slow down the rate of water flow; this is great for plants that don't need a lot of water, or if you will be gone for a long time. The tighter you screw on the lid, the slower the water will flow out.Make a mark on the bottle with a marker, right at the water level. Check back after a few hours. If the water level has not changed, loosen the cap a little. If the water level has dropped significantly, tighten the cap.

Find a friend or neighbor who you trust.,
Be reasonable.,
Group potted plants together based on watering needs.,
Write down specific care and watering instructions.,
Water your plants well before you leave, and check them for any pests or disease.,
Offer to return the favor.",How to Water Plants While You're Away4," This person will have access to your lawn, and in some cases, your house (if you need indoor plants watered). Make sure that you trust this person. If this person is watering indoor plants, remember to leave behind a spare key so that they will have access to your plants.

, Do not ask someone who lives far away, or for whom getting to your place would be a big deal or hassle. Try to keep the visits to a minimum. Someone might be willing to visit your place once or twice a week, but they might not be willing to visit it every single day, especially if your home is out of the way for them.


Consider using some homemade watering systems as well. This way, your plants will rely on the homemade watering systems, and all your neighbor will have to do is refill the bottles when they get empty.

, This will be easier for your neighbor to keep track of. For example, you can keep all of the succulents in one area, and the ivies in another.To keep your house clean, consider storing the plants on a tray.

, Be detailed, but not complex, and do not make assumptions. Your friend or neighbor may not have the same gardening skills as you do. What might seem like basic information to you might not even cross your friend or neighbor's mind.


An example of specific watering instructions would include: Give this plant ½ cup (120 milliliters) of water every Saturday evening.An example of specific care instructions would include: Tip the excess water out of the basil's dish daily., Watering your plants will reduce the amount of work or visits your plant sitter has to do. Checking your plants for pests or disease will ensure that they are healthy during your trip. If your plants succumb to pests or disease while you are away, your friend or neighbor might be at a loss of what to do. If your plants die while under their care, they may feel guilty!

, Even if you know that your friend or neighbor will say ""no,"" it would still be polite to offer. This will reassure your friend or neighbor that you aren't just using them. They will also be more likely to help plant sit for you the next time you go on a trip. If they do accept your offer, remember to hold up to it!

Place the potted plants on top of the towel.,
Tie the bag shut while making sure to trap as much air as possible inside the bag.,
Move the plants away from direct sunlight.,
Keep bigger plants in the bathtub.",How to Water Plants While You're Away5," The bag will trap moisture released by the plants. This moisture will then drip back down onto the plants, watering them. The bag must be clear in order to allow sunlight to pass through.

, The towel will help the plants retain moisture and prevent the soil from getting too dry.

, Only put in as many plants as you can fit. The leaves should just barely be touching each other. If the leaves are getting cramped, get another bag.

, You can tie the bag shut with a rubber band or twist tie. For extra security, fold the tied part of the bag down, and wrap another rubber band around it., You can keep them indoors or outdoors, but make sure that they are out of direct sunlight—partial sunlight is fine, however. If you keep your plants in direct sunlight, they well get cooked due to the trapped heat., If the plants are too big to fit inside of a plastic bag, simply line your bathtub with a plastic sheet and several newspapers. Place the plants on top, water them until the newspapers get soaked, and close the shower curtains.Leave the light on, if you can.

Check which way your garden faces.,
Look for frost-prone parts of the garden.,
Check the materials or surfaces used in your garden.,
Consider where you live.,
Look to your garden soil.,
Consider the air circulation within your garden.,
Consider modifying your garden's microclimate to eliminate problems and to improve your garden.",How to Work out Your Garden's Microclimate," If this isn't evident to you, look for the direction in which the sun rises and sets. Look for the shadows cast by neighbouring buildings and trees, plus your own house, and be especially interested in the shade conditions at the height of winter when you get the least sun.


In the northern hemisphere, plots facing south-west are always warmer in northern hemisphere countries like Britain than those facing north-east aspects, whereas in southern hemisphere countries like Australia, north-western areas can bake in the sun.;
, If you live where frosts occur, it is worthwhile assessing the frost-prone areas of your garden, as there are bound to be some parts that are more at risk than others. This matters when determining where to plant frost-fragile and frost-hardy plants.


Look for frost pockets. These occur in depressions, dips, dells, downhill, lower valley areas, hollows, or where blockages occur, such as where there is a wall, hedge, or a building that stops the downhill movement of cold air and causes it to pool in one place.Avoid growing early flowering plants in frost pockets.If there are barriers such as fences or walls, small holes in them can help to allow the air to keep circulating rather than pooling and becoming frosty., Some materials or surfaces retain heat while other materials lose heat. A garden with lots of bricks will soak up heat and act like a storage heater. On the other hand, a sparse hedge will allow heat to escape, as will low or no fences.


Hedges can act as filters and walls can act as funnels. Few new plants establish well in a wind tunnel.
Small areas of lawn can act as a cooling effect.Paving or concrete can act as a heat bank.Garden beds close to these will be warmer than garden beds next to soil or grass/lawn.
Areas situated under eaves tend to be hot and dry or cool and dry, depending on the time of year.

, The urban heat effect impacts city gardens, making them several degrees warmer than gardens found in the surrounding countryside or small towns. As well as more heat, urban gardens experience more pollution and often more acidic rainfall. Building heat can radiate onto gardens in urban environments.

, Soil can impact the microclimate through how moist or dry it is; clay soil tends to hold more moisture than sandy soil, while loam soil makes moisture easily accessible to plants.Check other sources of water in the soil, such as local water like streams, local precipitation levels, etc. Adding compost and mulch to soil can increase its moisture-retention capacity.Does the water drain away or is it impeded by the soil texture or terrain?
Is overhead foliage blocking precipitation from reaching the soil beneath?
Is the soil sheltered or exposed?
Is there an area where water never seems to drain? This can be ideal to turn into a bog garden.

, Where do prevailing winds come from? What kinds of protection could you use in those parts of the garden most affected by them?

, One you have worked out what the garden's microclimate is, you can work to change it. At the very least, choose plants that suit each microclimate best, create shelters where they're needed, and remove heat banks or frost-accumulating objects where possible. Improve soil condition to create better water penetration and retention. Walls, pergolas, hedges, fences, etc., can all be used to create more microclimates to your advantage.


A really good time to check for microclimate is after purchasing a new house or prior to landscaping, to give you the opportunity to make the most of your new or changed garden.

Clean pots and tools.,
Sanitize hydroponic water.,
Sanitize seeds.,
Decontaminate growing medium.",How to Use Hydrogen Peroxide in the Garden1," Spray or wipe a 6%-9% solution peroxide on to pots or tools you are reusing. You can also dip tools into the solution while you’re pruning plants. This can disinfect these items and reduce the risk of contamination from other plants or pathogens.Use caution if you want to use a hydrogen peroxide solution over 10%. This can burn skin and plant tissue.;
, Hydroponic plants, which are grown in water, often fall pray to bacteria, root rot, and lack of oxygen. Add 2.5 teaspoons of hydrogen peroxide to each liter of hydroponic water. This can kill bacteria and fungi, prevent root rot, and stimulate oxygen circulation. In turn, your hydroponics may flourish., Soak new seeds in 3% hydrogen peroxide heated to 140F (60C) for 5 minutes. After heating, rinse off the seeds under running water for a minute. This can prevent contamination from foodborne illnesses caused by Salmonella, E. coli, and Listeria., Soak growing medium such as sand or soil in a 3-6% solution of hydrogen peroxide. Allow the medium to sit in the mixture overnight. Turn the mixture once or twice to circulate throughout the medium. This can kill bacteria, mold or mildew, worms and their eggs."

The extra oxygen can promote faster germination and overall health. It can also minimize the risk of fungal or bacterial infections.Use a weak solution of hydrogen peroxide and water to water the plant bed for up to two weeks after sowing the seeds.

, Mix 2 teaspoons hydrogen per gallon of water for plant food. Spray or pour onto your potted plants and garden every 3-5 days or as necessary.This can help maintain healthy soil, allow roots to breathe, and plants to take up vital nutrients., Mix one pint of 3% hydrogen peroxide into a gallon of water. Water the entire plant, soaking the roots thoroughly, once every week. This oxygenates the root area, promoting development during any stage of the plant’s life.Water root cuttings and bare root plants with this mixture.

Repel insects.",How to Use Hydrogen Peroxide in the Garden3," Combine 4 tablespoons of 3% hydrogen peroxide with a pint of water in a spray bottle. Spray this on the leaves and root structures of plants that show signs of fungal infections. These include powdery mildew, rust, and mold.Spray on a small area before applying more generously to larger-scale surfaces. This can prevent chemical burn on your plant tissues.

, Pour or spray a mixture of peroxide and water with an anti-fungicide (benomyl) on to a plant exhibiting root rot. Saturate the plant so that the mixture flushes out stagnant, dead water and can replace it with fresh, highly oxygenated water.This can stop bacterial infections, including root rot, that often turn fruits, flower buds, bulbs and tubers to rot into a mush.Dip bulbs and tubers into this mixture when preparing them for storage. It may prevent a bacterial infection.

, Pour a 10% hydrogen peroxide solution on weeds growing between concrete, flagstone pavers, or brick. Leave the peroxide on the plants to scorch them and then remove the weeds by hand. This can kill any existing weeds in your garden and may prevent them from returning. It’s also a natural weed-killer that doesn’t use chemicals.Pour the peroxide on in the early morning or late evening to prevent the sun from quickly breaking down the solution.
Avoid pouring over weeds that are in pots or plant beds. This may scorch both the weeds and your plants, killing both.
Flush any area of your body that comes into contact with this solution immediately with plenty of cold water.

, Combine one tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide to 8 ounces of water if your plants are infested by pests.This can dramatically reduce the number of insects in your garden. It can also kill the eggs and larvae of moths and other harmful pests.

Test the Ph level of your soil.,
Use baking soda as a homemade plant fungicide.,
Make a natural fertilizer.,
Keep crabgrass and weeds at bay.,
Keep your potted plants fresh.,
Make your cut flowers last longer.,
Use baking soda to sweeten tomatoes.,
Encourage plants that grow in alkaline soil.",How to Use Baking Soda in the Garden1," Wet your soil a bit with distilled water. Sprinkle a handful of baking soda over the damp soil. If it begins to bubble, your soil is acidic, meaning its pH is below 5, and will not be able to support healthy plant growth.If your soil is acidic, you can raise its pH level by mixing ground or powdered lime into the soil. Over time, your soil will become more alkaline. Wood ashes and oyster shell might also help.;
, Mix four tablespoons of baking soda with one gallon of distilled water.Pour the mixture into a spray bottle. Spray it on or near plants you suspect could be at risk for fungal diseases, especially, for instance, roses and grapes.If you have a problem with mildew on your plants, mix one teaspoon baking soda, one quart (one liter) water, and a few drops of liquid soap. Pour this mixture into a spray bottle. Spray the plants that tend to attract mildew., Mix one teaspoon baking soda, one teaspoon Epsom salt, half a teaspoon of ammonia, and one gallon (4.5 liters) of water. Pour this mixture in your watering can and apply it just as you would when regularly watering your garden. It’s especially effective at rejuvenating browning plants., If you have crabgrass or weeds poking up through your mulch or otherwise encroaching on your garden, spray water on them using a spray bottle or hose. Then, sprinkle a thick layer of baking soda over the weeds or crabgrass.If you have weeds sprouting from cracks in your patio, pluck them out, then pour water over the spot they were poking out of. Cover the spot heavily with baking soda.

, Before transplanting flowers or other plants into pots, coat the bottom with a thin layer of baking soda. Add soil and then add your plant. This will prevent wilting and plant death., When you’ve clipped some flowers from your garden for home display, plop them in a mixture of distilled water with a spoonful of baking soda. This will prevent them from wilting as fast as they otherwise would., Sprinkle a bit of baking soda on the soil near your tomato plants. The baking soda will get absorbed into the soil and lower its acidity level, making your tomatoes sweeter., Certain flowers thrive in alkaline soil. If you have begonias, hydrangeas, and geraniums, for instance, mix a few spoonfuls of baking soda into your water can before watering them. This will encourage more beautiful blooms and healthy growth."

Familiarize yourself with the different plant families.,
Determine which crops are heavy feeders and which are light feeders.,
Make a map of your garden on paper.,
Adjust your crop rotation plan as necessary.",How to Use Crop Rotation in Gardening," The vegetables you might grow in your home garden belong to several different families. Knowing these families and which plants belong to them is important for crop rotation because each family of plants depletes different ratios of nutrients from the soil. Crop rotation at its most basic level simply means avoiding growing plants from the same family in the same patch for consecutive seasons.


The nightshade family includes common homegrown plants like tomato, eggplant, potato, and bell pepper.
The gourd family includes all types of melons, pumpkins, and squash.
The legume family includes all types of beans, such as lima beans, snow peas, wax beans, and snap peas.
The carrot family contains carrots, parsley, celery, and parsnips.
The cole family includes many common leafy green vegetables. Common cole crops include broccoli, cabbage, kale, kohlrabi, radish, mustard greens, turnips, rutabaga, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower.
The onion family includes onions, shallots, garlic, chives, and leeks.
The goosefoot family includes plants like beets, Swiss chard, and spinach.;
, Another key distinction for effective crop rotation is heavy versus light feeders. Heavy feeders are those plants that drain large amounts of nutrients from the soil in a single season. Light feeders are plants that use relatively low levels of nutrients. A third group of plants actually builds the soil's health by introducing atmospheric nitrogen into the ground.


Heavy feeders include plants such as corn, tomatoes, cabbage, cauliflower, and squash. Even when these plants belong to different families, you should avoid planting them in the same soil for successive seasons, as they will deplete the soil too rapidly.
Light feeders include potatoes, most root and bulb vegetables, and herbs.
Soil building plants are mostly limited to those in the legume family. These plants perform a process called nitrogen fixation by which they pull nitrogen from the atmosphere and introduce it into the soil for future plants to use.

, After you have gained an understanding of the different types of plants, you can begin planning your garden for crop rotation. Map out your garden with a pencil and paper and divide it roughly into different beds (this will be very easy if you use raised beds). You can then use this bed diagram to determine which type of plant will be planted in each area over each season.


For example, consider a garden divided into beds A, B, C, and D. In the first growing season, you could plant nightshades in bed A, gourds in bed B, and legumes in bed C.
In the second season, you would plant your nightshades in bed B, gourds in bed C, and legumes in bed D. In the third and fourth seasons, plant nightshades in beds C and then D, gourds in D and A, and legumes in A and B.
The unused garden bed in each season would historically have been left fallow to allow the soil to recover. However, it is now known that planting cover crops such as clover or alfalfa in this bed will help keep the soil healthier.

, The rigid plan presented above can be adjusted to your gardening needs. For example, you may want to grow many more plants in the nightshade family than any other plants. This can generally be accomplished by making the beds different sizes. The nightshades can be planted in the largest bed the first season and split into separate beds in successive seasons.

Make a natural pesticide.,
Root out insect infestations.,
Get rid of ants.,
Keep rabbits away.,
Prevent cabbage worms.,
Kill slugs.",How to Use Baking Soda in the Garden2," Combine one teaspoon of baking soda, 1/3 cup (79 milliliters) of olive oil, and one cup (237 milliliters) water. Pour the solution in a spray bottle. Aim the spray bottle at the plants you wish to keep insects away from, then squeeze the handle.Repeat as necessary. It will be necessary to repeat this treatment after it rains.

, If your preventive pesticide spray doesn’t work, you can make a somewhat stronger variant that will eliminate insects. Mix one tablespoon of olive oil, two tablespoons baking soda, and a few drops of liquid soap. Mix the concoction together and pour it into a spray bottle. Spray the liquid liberally about your garden.Reapply once every three days. Continue to apply even after the insects are gone to dissuade them from returning.

, Yet another baking soda insect spray is tailored specifically toward ants. If you have an ant problem in your garden, mix confectioners’ sugar and baking soda in equal amounts. For instance, you might mix five teaspoons of baking soda and five teaspoons of confectioner’s sugar. Sprinkle the powder in the vicinity of the ant hills. The ants will eat the powdered mix and die.You might choose to add a spoonful of water to the mix after you’ve combined the sugar and baking soda to help it clump together.
Don’t use regular sugar, as it won’t cling to the baking soda in the way confectioner’s sugar will.

, Sprinkle baking soda around your vegetable garden. Make a thin but visible ring of baking soda around each plant. This will dissuade rabbits from nibbling on them. You will need to reapply this mixture regularly, especially after it rains., Mix baking soda and flour in equal proportions. For instance, you might mix one cup of each together. Dust the mixture over cabbage, kale, broccoli, and other plants that tend to attract cabbage worms.You will need to reapply this mixture regularly, especially after it rains., Baking soda is useful for killing slugs. When you see slugs in your garden, just sprinkle them generously in baking soda. This will cause them to shrivel up and die."

Scrub objects in your garden clean.,
Clean your hands.,
Eliminate nasty odor in your compost.",How to Use Baking Soda in the Garden3," Baking soda can effectively clean bird baths, clay pots, and garden furniture. Just sprinkle a few spoonfuls of baking soda onto the object you’re interested in cleaning and wipe it down with a damp rag. Rinse the surface with clean water.You can also use this method to get produce clean, making it ready for consumption., Working in the garden is a dirty job. Even wearing gloves often cannot totally prevent dirt and grime from building up. After spraying your hands down with some water from the garden hose or spigot, sprinkle some baking soda on your hands. Rub them together, not forgetting to scrub within the crevices between each finger or the backs of the hands., Compost is a mixture of decaying plants and other biodegradable matter. When processed fully, it can be mixed with soil, returning healthy microbes to the soil’s food web and extending its life. Until it’s ready, though, it will be quite stinky. Sprinkle a few spoonfuls of baking soda into your compost bin to soak up the damp stink."

Calculate the last frost date for your area.,
Plant three seeds per container ¼ in (1/2 cm) deep.,
Keep your seeds in a room at least 70 degrees F (21 degrees C).,
Remove the weakest seedling.,
Acclimate your plants to the outdoors slowly before transplantation.,
Introduce your plants to fertilizer.,
Plant the seedlings with a few matchsticks at the root.,
Water your pepper plants 1-2 in (2.5-5 cm) a week.,
Weed around your pepper plants.,
Harvest your peppers when they reach your desired size.",How to Start Pepper Seeds," Pepper seeds should be planted 8-10 weeks before the last frost date. The Old Farmer’s Almanac can help you calculate the last frost date for where you live to determine what week you should plant your seeds. You will transfer your seeds outside just after the last frost date., Use any pot or vessel the size of a yogurt cup or larger with a hole in the bottom to plant seeds.Use a fine-textured seed-starting mix, such as Black Gold Seeing Mix or Miracle-Gro Seed Starting Potting Mix, that allows a lot of drainage.Water your seeds to the point of dampness but not saturation.


Never allow your seeds’ soil to dry out completely., Pepper seeds require warmth to germinate. Find a room in your house that gets good sun and maintains a temperature of at least 70 degrees F (21 degrees C).You can use a wall thermometer to determine the temperature if your thermostat is unreliable.

, Pepper plants thrive best in pairs, as the two plants can shade each other from excess sun. A few weeks into the seedlings growth, remove the one that is thriving least so the other two can flourish., About 10 days before transplantation (just after your last frost date), place your pepper plants in a sheltered spot outside, such as under a patio awning. Start the pepper plants outside for two hours at a time and gradually increase the outdoor time over the coming days, bringing the plants in for exceptionally cold or rainy weather.This process of acclimating your plants to outdoor weather is called hardening off by gardeners.
Ensure outdoor temps are not cooler than 65 degrees F (18 degrees C) for hardening. If there is no threat of frost, you can even leave the plants out overnight.

, About a week before transplantation, introduce your plants to fertilizer by adding a tablespoon per every gallon of your potting soil.Opt for a low-nitrogen fertilizer, as high levels of nitrogen can keep your plants from bearing fruit., On a good weather day shortly after last frost date, use a trowel to dig a hole for your plants in your yard. Place a few matchsticks in the hole before transferring the plants. The acidic sulfur in the match heads encourages your pepper plants to take to the soil.The size of the hole will depend on the size of your plant, but cover a little of your plant’s base in new topsoil.


If you are transplanting multiple paired plants, space them 18 to 24 in (45 to 60 cm) apart., Watering plants in inches or centimeters just indicates how much rainwater would need to accumulate in a container for your plant to get an appropriate watering. If it helps measure how much water you give your plants, you can put an empty tuna can next to your plants that fills as you water. Water your peppers more frequently if you live in an arid or desert climate. , Weeds compete with your pepper plants for sunlight and nutrients in the soil.Remove weeds at the root to ensure they don’t grow back and disturb your vegetable garden.

, When your peppers look ready, pick them, wash and eat. Fertilize your plants with low-nitrogen fertilizer after your first fruit harvest to keep them growing well."

Decide on the lay out of your beds and estimate how much compost and / or card you will need.,
Cut weed growth back as short as feasible on the new area.,
Mark out beds.,
Consider weed suppression.,
Compost all plant material and manure prior to application.,
Fill and firm the compost.,
Remove perennial weeds (such as dandelion, couch grass and bind weed) with a trowel.,
Dress the bed with more compost annually.,
Mulch the paths.",How to Start No‐Dig Gardening in a Temperate Climate," Obtain required materials.

For example, a bed 4x8ft (1.2x2.4m) needs over 1 tonne compost for 6in (15cm) depth. Filling beds with compost gives better growth than with soil, compost is the best investment you can make. Beds of 4ft (1.2m) width is good for starting but beds can be narrower or wider. No-dig beds have firm structure and it's fine to put feet on them to reach the middle. The bed filling wants to be firm, not fluffy.;
, Remove cut material to a compost heap. You could leave it in place and build beds on top, except the slug population will increase to help it decompose. Slugs are recycling agents!, If you are planning on using wooden sides, either temporally or permanently, put them in place. Permanent sides have advantages in terms of access and defining an area (e.g.school gardens) but allow light soils to dry out faster and provide a hiding place for slugs (esp. as the wood decays), woodlice, ants and weeds. They also add significantly to the initial cost., If you have enough compost for a 6in (15cm) depth, this will be sufficient to suppress weed growth even on completely uncultivated land. If using less compost, then you can lay a thick layer of unprinted cardboard or newspaper, after removing tape and staples, before spreading the compost, to help suppress weed growth. It's a temporary barrier only, and your vegetables' roots will pass through to the soil below, after 8-10 weeks., This will make the growth of new sowings and plantings stronger and healthier. It wants to be dark in colour and reasonably crumbly.

It's best to keep the finest compost for the surface layer, making it easier to sow and plant into. If you are prepared to wait a year before planting, you can mulch with woodchips. Eventually they turn to compost, but they compete with plants for nitrogen while doing so.
Best keep woody material for paths, or use just a thin surface layer, and small pieces are better than large chips.

, Once this is done, even by walking on it in dry weather, it will be possible to sow and plant straightaway. Treading the compost down provides a secure planting medium, for plants such as brassicas (kale, broccoli, cabbage etc) which appreciate a firm footing.  

If there are many roots of vigorous perennial weeds in the soil (couch grass, bindweed), consider covering the bed and paths with light excluding polythene for a whole year, after spreading compost. This is easier when you have no wooden sides. You can plant through polythene, cut a hole or slit to insert the plant, then pull any weed growth that may emerge through this.

, Take as much root as possible, and pull or hoe weed seedlings as they appear.  Weed growth lessens with every month and from the second year is very manageable.

On soil with few weeds, pull all but the tiny ones and spread two to three inches (5-7cm) compost.

, To maintain fertility and a full bed, add a top dressing of compost to a depth of 1 to 2 inches (3-5cm) annually; this will support continual cropping of the land and high yields.

This method works for all vegetables including root crops, which do not suffer any detriment from a surface dressing of compost. Carrots for example grow large and mostly unforked.

, This allows them to be weed-free and makes it so that fewer weeds invade the beds. It's possible to push a large wheelbarrow along a 15-18in (40-45cm) path, it's fine to rest the legs on beds while emptying or filling. Path mulches in the first months, if there are many weeds to kill, could be cardboard with some wood shavings on top. Be wary of membranes, which need regular lifting and relaying, in order not to become buried by compost and soil."

Propagate your Rose Moss.",How to Water Germinating Moss Rose," If you plant outside, wait until all frost risk has passed – usually this means late spring. If your area doesn’t experience frost, you can sow the seeds around March.


Be aware that Rose Moss cannot germinate without full sun on the seed itself. If the seed is pushed too far under the soil the seeds will not sprout.;
, You’ll find that Moss Rose seeds are extremely small: be careful not to crowd them together in the planting position. You can try mixing fine seed with sand as this makes it easier to sow without crowding.


Seeds need to be sown about 8 inches (20.3 cm) apart. Put the seeds onto pre-watered fine soil or compost, then cover with 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) of fine compost.
Water using a very fine spray or mist of water to prevent the seeds from being disturbed.

, It’s important not to use a strong stream of water, eg from a hose, or you will wash away the seeds and young seedlings. Instead, use a watering can with a very fine rose (nozzle attachment), or use a spray bottle to mist water over the top of the soil.


You don’t need to overwater the seeds as they germinate. Give them a soak when you sow them then allow the soil to dry out before gently watering again.

, Moss Rose seeds germinate fairly quickly. As the young seedlings emerge you should continue gently watering them to prevent washing the small plants away.


Watering once or twice a week in dry conditions is fine; ideally let the top 2 inches (5.1 cm) of ground dry out between waterings.
After a few weeks you will have stronger plants and the roots will have grown enough to anchor the plants to the soil, meaning they can tolerate a stronger flow of water.
Continue watering weekly in dry periods once the plants are established.

, If you choose to germinate your Rose Moss seeds indoors you’ll need quite a few additional materials than outdoors. These include:


A seed tray or seed mat.
A covered protected area in a well-lit room.
A spray bottle capable of misting (not spraying).
Germination soil that has been sanitized for seedlings.
A sheet of plastic, such as plastic wrap.

, If you do not have sanitized germination soil begin by placing a few cups of soil no more than 4 inches (10.2 cm) deep in a metal pan. Cover with foil and heat in the oven at 180 degrees for no more than 30 minutes. Allow to cool and keep covered until ready to plant.

, Place the sterilized soil in your seed tray and moisten with clean water until the soil is completely moist. Sow the seeds directly on top of the soil and do not cover with additional soil.


Place the plastic wrap loosely over the top of the tray and place the tray in a warm, well-lit room, but not in direct sun or under heat lamps.

, When the soil appears dry, mist with water from your spray bottle. If the soil needs more than misting set the trays in a small amount of water and allow the water to soak up from the bottom.

, Once seedlings appear you may water normally and move the tray to a more sunnier location.

, It’s easier to grow Moss Rose from cuttings than from seed and this is an easy way to quickly make a lot of new plants. It’s best to take cuttings for around 3 times more plants than you require to allow for some cuttings to fail – although you may experience a better success rate than this.


Take 4 inch (10.2 cm) sections of healthy growth, remove the lower 2 inches (5.1 cm) of foliage, then insert about an inch into the soil. Firm the soil gently around the cutting.
After this your Moss Rose cuttings should root pretty quickly.

, It’s generally best to root cuttings outside as they prefer sun, but you can also try planting your cuttings on a sunny window ledge.


Give the cuttings a good watering when first planted, then refrain from watering until the top 2 inches (5.1 cm) of soil become dry.

, Cuttings will also root in water. Take the cuttings as described above and instead of putting into soil, put them into a glass container with 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5.1 cm) of water at the bottom.


The roots should be visible fairly quickly. Once decent roots have formed, move them to their planting location in soil.

, Rose Moss will tolerate drought but it’s best to water them regularly for best performance. Avoid using a hose pipe or sprinkler as this will damage the delicate flowers.


Irrigation works well as this waters the roots not the foliage. Alternatively, you can water at the base of the plant using a can.
As these are desert plants, you should water them about once a week, then allow the soil to dry out before watering again. The soil should not be waterlogged or wet over a long period of time.

, It’s best if you remove dead blooms once they wither, as this will encourage new flowers. You can just pinch off dead flowers with your fingertips.

, Moss Rose will keep blooming all summer and into fall but by the height of summer they may be a little past their best. If this happens, trim the plants back by around a third and provide a light water-soluble fertilizer such as tomato feed.

, You may find that your Moss Rose plants attract aphids. Control aphid attacks with an insecticide spray, or using dish soap dissolved in water in a spray can.


You can also hose them off with a high-pressure hose but this will usually be too strong for the delicate blooms of a Moss Rose.
Slugs and snails may also attack young plants. There are a variety of ways to control these but none work as well as pellets.

, Rose Moss will propagate cheerfully all by itself in your garden. If you want to help it along, or control where it spreads, you have several options for making new plants from your old one.


Remember Moss Rose is an annual plant so it won’t survive to flower again the following year. For this reason, it’s a good idea to propagate your plants annually to ensure you have a flowering Moss Rose in your garden every year.

Understand what is meant by a plant hardiness zone.,
Check plant tags to find the recommended zone for planting.,
Recognize the issues with the plant hardiness scale.,
Use the USDA zone map to find your exact plant hardiness zone.,
Familiarize yourself with the temperature scale.,
Take a plant's heat tolerance into account.,
Consider whether you live within a microclimate.,
Know that planting times will vary according to your hardiness zone.,
Play it safe.",How to Understanding Plant Hardiness Zones," Hardiness zones are based on regional temperature averages. These colorful bands have a difference of about 10 degrees Fahrenheit from one to the next.


Each zone is further divided into subzone a or b, with the former being 5 degrees (Fahrenheit) cooler than the latter.
One’s official zone indicates the lowest or highest possible temperature in their area during a normal year.;
, Gardeners should check plant tags and purchase specimens that are considered suitable for their particular zone.


For example, a perennial that is classified as being for zones 8 to 10 would probably not survive the winter in zone 6.
Likewise, gardeners in zone 11 would have a hard time getting the aforementioned plant through the summer.

, The hardiness zone map is not a completely infallible resource but it is good as a general guide. Some of the faults with the map are outlined below:


Though efforts have been made to incorporate known microclimates into the updated map, the revised edition may not account for all of the nuances that are out there.
The plant hardiness zones don't take into account extreme weather patterns, so gardeners who are experiencing unseasonably cold or warm periods may experience some plant loss as a result.
Growers should keep in mind that some specimens that are said to grow in their zone may not necessarily thrive there. After all, there are many factors besides temperature which may account for a perennial’s overall success or failure.

, The USDA has published a USDA Hardiness Zone Map which makes it easier to determine your exact zone. Go to the website and click on your state. A detailed map of the state that includes major cities will pop up to show you exactly which zone you live in.


To make this map, the USDA gathered average low winter temperature data for all areas throughout the United States and then grouped areas with similar temperatures together to form zones. Each individual zone is 10 degrees F warmer or cooler than the zones adjacent to it.
For instance, USDA Hardiness Zone 5 is assigned to areas where the average winter low is between -20 and -10 degrees F. USDA Hardiness Zone 6 is assigned to areas where the average winter low is between -10 and 0 degrees F (an average of 10 degrees warmer than zone 5). And USDA Hardiness Zone 4 is assigned to areas where the average winter low is between -30 and -20 degrees F (an average of 10 degrees colder than zone 5).
The zones are further subdivided into 5-degree Fahrenheit increments. USDA Hardiness Zone 5A winter lows are between -20 and -15 degrees Fahrenheit while zone 5B is -15 to -10 degrees Fahrenheit.

, While the average low temperature in the winter is a big factor in determining which plants will grow in your zone, the average high summer temperatures must also be considered.


Many plants cannot take the heat in hot southern climates. This high end of a plant’s temperature tolerance is actually taken into consideration when a plant is assigned a zone range.
For instance, Japanese spirea (Spiraea japonica) is hardy in USDA Hardiness Zones 4 to 8. This means it will only thrive in climates where winter temperatures drop to below 20 degrees Fahrenheit. It will not grow well in the mild winters and hot summers of USDA Hardiness Zone 9 or higher.

, Living in warmer climates in the west, south and along the coast can make finding your gardening zone a little more complicated. These areas are riddled with microclimates that are influenced by elevation. Temperatures within these microclimates are not the norm for the general area.


Fortunately, “Sunset Magazine” has gathered information about these microclimates to help gardeners purchase the right plants. Go to their “Plant Finder” page, click on “What is your Sunset Climate Zone?” and simply enter your zip code.
Sunset climate zone tolerances are not often listed for plants purchased through the mail, though. So when you live in these warmer areas, it is better to go to a local nursery or garden center to purchase plants. They will be very familiar with these microclimates and can recommend the right plants for your gardening zone.

, The best time to plant trees, shrubs and perennials depends to some extent on your USDA Hardiness Zone.


In Zones 9 through 1, where temperatures dip to below freezing during the winter, deciduous trees and shrubs should be planted right around the first killing frost in the fall.
Evergreens and perennial plants should be planted right after the last hard frost in the spring. If evergreens are planted in the fall, they often sustain damage to the leaves due to drying winter winds and cold temperatures.
The Farmer’s Almanac is a very helpful resource when trying to determine when the first and last frosts usually occur in your area.
In USDA Hardiness Zones 10 and above where temperatures rarely drop below freezing, the best time to plant trees and shrubs is in late fall, winter or very early spring to give the plants time to get established before the heat of the summer. Perennials should be planted after the last frost in the spring.

, Take the ever-fluctuating climate into consideration when selecting trees, shrubs and perennials. All areas throughout the United States experience unusual highs and lows from time to time.


Determine your Hardiness Zone then choose plants that are rated hardy for at least one Zone higher and one Zone lower to insure the plant will survive an unexpected extreme.

Apply for a full degree program.",How to Study Horticulture at Home2," Many tech schools, state universities, and even an Ivy League school or two, offer online or “distance learning” opportunities. Start by checking out the course catalogue for schools near you. Then expand outward to see what options you find.For example, open a web browser and search for “online horticulture classes.” Also search specialized courses on permaculture, gardening, or botanical illustration.
If you find interesting classes at a school that’s out of your price range, look for the same classes at more affordable schools.

, If you want to casually start up an education in horticulture, choose two or three classes from one of the universities you found in your research. Look at the horticulture group of classes and pick ones that perk up your interest.

Taking a couple of classes is a good way to find out if you are really interested enough in the subject to work hard on studying it.
You’ll pick up some useful knowledge in these classes, even if you choose not to pursue horticulture any further afterward.

, You may want to pursue horticulture as a career path. In many cases, to get a specialized job in a horticultural field you’ll need in-depth training, as well as a degree. Find a school that offers an Associate’s, Bachelor’s, or Master’s degree in horticulture.Areas of focus include but aren’t limited to: floral design, nursery management, research, sustainability, and turf management.
Most of the time, an Associate’s degree takes 18 months to two years to complete. A Bachelor’s degree usually takes four years. A Master’s degree requires previous study, and takes about two years to complete.

Remember that worms ARE living creatures, and thus they ingest, digest, secrete and excrete, the four basic living routines, and elemental functions of life in itself.,
Decide what you want to make your worm bins from, and if they will last, and where you live and the climate also factor in on what you should build the bins you plan on using.,
Mix your bedding together; just about anything organic works.,
Add a mix of wet shredded paper with clay, silt and sand, and some untreated wood sawdust or peat moss or bark chips, and if you want to, add a heaping helping of wet, but cured grass, hay, or rye straw soaked in water to your cleaned, rinsed, and sanitized 5 gallon (18.9 L) tubs, wooden bins or flat plastic tubs.,
Use a masons trowel to stir and add all the forms of bedding you want to use.,
Add your worms.,
Feed them, feed them often, and watch them grow!,
Make sure that your bins have adequate ventilation!,
Beware of pests.,
Every 3 weeks or so, empty your small bins by hand, using rubber or vinyl gloves, and see how the development is going.",How to Make Backyard and Basement Worm Farms," Concisely, you can get started with just a handful of worms, and expand farther as you need to. You can go full bore at once, and follow the guidelines of this article, and others for profit.;
, Just about anything can make a good worm bin. Wood, and organic pots of clay that have tiny holes in the bottom, and sides, will rot, but the do work great as a worm bin. Earthen pots of clay also absorb water, so remember to add just a little more water if you plan to use them. Crockery should be avoided, as some crockery may contain lead. Plastic tubs, such as you would find at any construction site, or if you live close to an apartment that is being renovated, or if you live in a high-rise, or even level ground, the plastic five-gallon, or three-gallon buckets are great. Remember to drill holes in the bottom for water release, and a few holes here and there, mostly there, in the sides for ventilation. Regardless, make sure that they have no chemicals, insecticides, or paints that could be dangerous. Lacquer thinner, solvents, turpentine, gypsum type sheet rock or drywall mud, as it is called, and most cleaning chemicals are caustic, and will kill worms. *It is also not a good idea to use glass, as it can break easily,

, If you have access to a paper shredder, you are half there already. Newspapers, non-glossy paper magazines, or even brown paper bags or paper stuffing or packages made from paper, are great bedding when shredded. Glossy paper magazines can contain some toxic inks. If you have to used these magazines, shred the pages, and soak them in HOT water for awhile, pour off the water, and repeat with warm water, until the stains of ink are no longer visible in the water. About 4 or 5 times should do well. Be sure to soak them in COLD water for at least 5 or 6 hours before you use them as bedding. Some glossy papers will actually fall apart when hot water is used. If this happens, use them ONLY in a compost pile. They will be OK there, but will not be good for bin use. If your glossy paper stays together, you can use it in the bins.

, You may want to add some organic potting soil, but DON'T get the kind that has plant food mixed in with the soil! This will surely kill your worms as it contains many acidic products. If you do use grass, make sure it is cured in the sun, if you mix it with the bedding. Green grass clippings on top also aid in giving them a form of organic greens. Later these can be mixed with the bedding if you wish.

, This works better than a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, or any such utensil, but don't use them to dig for your worms. Use your hands and a glove. Place several trowels full or at least two full cups, of pulverized limestone into the bedding mix for good measure. Mix thoroughly, rotating the tub on its edge, and mixing with a small bricklayers trowel, or if you have flat, plastic or wooden bins, mix as well as you can, and then turn the entire mix over into another bin and mix from the bottom once again. Be sure that it is very damp, but not soaking wet. Worms CAN drown. Add more pulverized limestone to the mix if you wish. Be liberal with the pulverized limestone. Wooden bins will also absorb some water because of the porous nature of wood.

, This is your choice since there are several types of worms that grow fast, and can really breed often. A European Night crawler seems to be a favorite. Canadian Night crawlers have to be kept between 39 to 50 °F (4 to 10 °C). Those touchily little crawlers are quite sensitive to the heat. Red Wigglers are good fish bait, and breed rapidly. They are best for composting, but can be used in bins. They are sold by the pound, and can be kept easily. Make sure they are Red Wigglers though, as some dealers will give you the wrong type of worms, and call them Red Wigglers.. If they look to small for a fishhook, then they are not suitable for fishing.


African Night crawlers are a great choice, but they breed a little slower than the others. They can withstand moderately high temperatures, but are sensitive to cold. These work best if your worm farm is in the basement or enclosed to where it will not fall below freezing. They seem to go dormant, and do not breed at all at temperatures below 40 F. Regardless of the species you select, they cannot stand sunlight or high temperatures for long. Keep them in the dark and relatively cool place.

, You can buy commercially blended foods, or you can make your own out of a mixture of manure, coffee grounds, tea bags, old oatmeal, unseasoned wheat flour, most table scraps except meat, or bone, and cornmeal, make sure if it is seasoned (added salt and baking soda) that you wash it through a coffee filter, or paper towel filter first, before mixing it with other feeds. The water you use will dissolve the baking powder and salt, and take it out of the way. What remains, you can neutralize with some extra pulverized limestone. Be liberal with the limestone as it is calcium carbonate, and helps to sweeten acidic soil, and acids are something that no worm likes, and this adds calcium to the soil in large quantities, which earthworms need to breed. Also when watering, and if it is possible, use rainwater.


Chlorinated water from the tap needs to sit for a day or so to get rid of the chlorine. Although it's not good for your worm beds, in an emergency, if your bin is too dry, you can use a small amount of mildly chlorinated tap water but the smallest sprinkle, the better.
One other choice you have is go to the Feed and Seed Dept, or go to your local Farm Supply, and find out if they have the crumbles of laying mash, cattle or horse feed that has not enriched, and no salt added. Some cream feeds, chop as they call it, are good, but you usually have to buy it in a 50 pound bag! That's a lot IF you are not going to winter-feed the worms! You can moisten a handful of these feeds and feed them a mix once a week, adding other ingredients mentioned above, on a time-sharing status. Please note also, sprinkle the food on top of the bedding. Do not mix with your bedding, straw, or potting soil. Just remember to FEED THEM OFTEN if you do not compost them.

, If you are using plastic tubs, drill holes in the bottom to let out excessive moisture, and prevent the bin from souring. Heavily watered bins can kill worms. The water should be collected in a tray, and used as liquid fertilizer, but also remember that this is an organic liquid fertilizer, and it is high in nitrogen. Sometimes, it will attract other insects.

, There are a few pests that you DON'T want in your worm bins, and some are dangerous to humans.


Millipedes, and centipedes are dangerous to humans. Millipedes can exude a strong acid, and some have been known to rupture themselves when seized, and exude this acid on a person's skin. Centipedes have powerful pincers and inflict painful bites to your fingers and hands. Use tongs to remove either of these pests, watching out for the dangers. Centipedes also are a threat to your worms, but remember, both are carnivores, and will kill every worm they can get to, and devour them in a short period.
Snails and slugs may also try to invade, but a simple copper wire wrapped around the top rim of your bins can keep out snails and slugs. If you do find one in your bin, remove it immediately.
Ants, cockroaches, mold and fungus are also not new to the worm farmer. Use ant traps to get rid of ants, and use roach traps and killer dusts, but don't let it come in contact with your bins.

, If you see little white streaks, handle them carefully, as these are baby worms! The little worm capsules you find, gently take them up and place them into the new bedding or in a new bin. Check and feed them if you find no food on the top. Harvest ONLY the worms you want to use, and replace the old bedding, and worm castings with new bedding. Place the long breeding worms back into the new bedding and let nature take its course. Worms cannot live in their own wastes, so change bedding when you see large amounts of castings. Not only is this a good hobby, but it can pay off big time turning wastes into something productive, and making organic liquid fertilizer for flowers or small garden plants.

"
"
Fill a 5-gallon bucket with water.,
Add the corn syrup or molasses to the water.,
Place castings in the bucket by either:


putting the castings into a thin mesh ""teabag"" of pantyhose or a similarly sheer sock and knotting the end.,
Realize the grade or particle sizes of your choice of castings (determined by source and packaging process) play a role in making this choice.,
Put the worm castings in directly into the bucket.,
Use a bubbler like an aquarium pump and air stone if you have one.,
Let water and castings bubble (or at least soak) for 24 hours.,
To produce high yield tea, conditions should be desirable for the microbes to proliferate, multiplying exponentially.,
Use within 48 hours.,
Refrigerate (in a sealed, labeled container) for up to 3 days.",How to Make Worm Castings Tea," Either use rainwater or let the water stand so the chlorine can evaporate out. You don't want to kill the beneficial micro-organisms, which is the point of municipal chlorine. Using a bubbler will speed up the release of Cl- ions from the water, cutting down the time the water needs to stand.;
, This will serve as food for the micro-organisms. It helps to dissolve the molasses in a small volume (like half a cup) of hot water before adding it to the bucket. This prevents potential obstruction of your air bubblers.

, The knotted end of the bag can be hung down and submerged so the tea bag is situated above the rising bubbles. Some simply dump the teabag in.
putting the castings directly in the bucket (with no tea bag) if you plan to use a watering can anyway, otherwise, straining through cheesecloth or mesh may be necessary when using backpack-type sprayer with nozzles that could clog easily with debris and detritus.

, Casting particles in sizes larger than marbles, or even bark mulch. Others are finely ground castings, smaller than ball bearings. The difference in total surface area exposed to water is much larger for the finely ground which has more exposure to the aerated water.

, Some people say put the castings in an old sock or stocking hose that has no holes and tie the opening closed. This does not allow the castings to exchange into the water freely and slows the growth of the micro critters. Both ways give satisfactory results with the castings right in the water. Also, slime mould formations which are micro critter super colonies, may form. This shows the intense populations of tea made this way. You can use a plastic watering can without the strainer on the end and apply the tea in total - castings and all.

, Place it in the the bucket and hold the air stone to the bottom with a rock. Plug in the bubbler so the the water is aerated.

, If you don't have a bubbler, consider stirring occasionally- don't worry you cannot hurt the micro critters (microbes) by stirring. The air stone at the bottom of the bucket will cause the tea to be in constant mix - this is the best way to get a high yield tea.

, The microorganisms from the digestive system of the worm are extruded in their castings. These aerobic (oxygen-dependent) microbes are ""good"" microbes for plants (nature's way). Bad microbes are typically anaerobic (oxygen kills them) and many give off offensive odors as they release byproducts of metabolism like hydrogen sulfide (rotten egg smell). Aerating the tea improves conditions (agitation, circulation, aeration) for the good microbes, which enhance (survival, reproduction, growth). Aeration helps suppress the presence or growth of bad ""bugs"" that will compete against the good ones. Use of a bubbler helps along dissolution of the molasses food as well; it dissolves and diffuses more rapidly. Some instructions for tea setups without a bubbler recommend up to three days of brewing.

, Exponential populations in limited spaces eventually peak and then plunge with massive population loss. We want the tea to be biologically active, alive, with good microbes like Bacillus subtilis. To avoid losing the beneficial microorganisms you created, use the worm compost tea as soon as possible.

, Non-pleasing odors from the tea after initial brewing or prolonged refrigeration may signal a low quality brew which should probably be dumped. This could be added to a composter or wormery to prevent waste.

Obtain a worm bin.,
If you don't want to buy a worm bin, you can also build one on your own.,
Use four old car tires for a makeshift home.,
Place the worm bin in a cool area to protect it from excessive heat.,
Prepare the bedding for your worms.,
Choose which worms you want.,
Feed your worms digestible amounts regularly.,
Maintain your bin.,
Pay attention to some composting ""dont's"".,
Harvest the compost once it's ready.",How to Make a Worm Compost System," The worm bin is basically the home for the worms, and the place where they digest the organic material you will give them. Worm bins can be purchased from many online vendors, or from your local gardening or farm supply store.;
, Use rubber storage totes, galvanized tubs, wood, or plastic.



Material: Rubber is cheap, easy to use and durable. Galvanized tubs are somewhat costly but will last forever. Wood will eventually be eaten, and plastic cracks easily, but either will do in a pinch. Some people prefer wooden compost worm bins because they may breathe better and absorb excess moisture, which can be hazardous to the worms. Just don't use chemically-treated wood, which may be dangerous to worms or leach harmful chemicals into your compost. 5 gallon (18.9 L) plastic buckets now for sale by most hardware stores can be used - especially if you live in an apartment. Clean the 5 gallon (18.9 L) buckets thoroughly with soap and let them sit for a day or so filled with clean water before using as a worm bin.

Ventilation: Your bin should be well-ventilated, with several 1/8 inch (3mm) holes 4 inches (100mm) from the bottom (otherwise the worms will stay at the bottom of the bin and you may drown your worms). For example, you can build a worm bin out of a large plastic tub with several dozen small holes drilled out on the bottom and sides. Untreated wooden bins are naturally ventilated because of structure of wood.

Size: The larger you make the container, the more worms it can sustain. Estimate 1 pound (0.45kg) of worms for every square foot of surface area. The maximum productive depth for your bin is 24 inches (61cm) deep because composting worms will not go further down than that.

Cover: The bin should have a cover to prevent light from getting in and to prevent the compost from drying out. Choose or make a lid that can be removed if your compost is too wet. Use a canvas tarp, doubled over and bungee-corded on, or kept in place with wood. Burlap sacks also work well, and can be watered directly.

, To make a four-tire wormery, create a base from old bricks or flagstones (must be flat and with as few cracks as possible).


Place a layer of heavy newspaper on top of the bricks. Stuff four old tires with newspapers.
Pile the tires on top of each other, with the first tire on the Sunday newspaper. Put some scrunched up paper or cardboard in the bottom to soak up any excess liquid.
Fill the entire wormery with organic material (semi-composted is best). Add the composting worms (tiger or brandling species are best).
Use a piece of board weighed down with bricks as a lid. The lid must be big enough to stop rain getting in.
Harvest a tire's worth of fertilizer roughly every 8 weeks (during warm months).

, If you're keeping your worm bin outside, consider placing it in the shade, under a tree, in the garage or shed, or along the side of the house.


Try keeping the outdoor temperature in the bin between 30 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit, along with at least 4 inches of moist bedding in the bin.This should be an ideal home for your compost-zapping worms.

, The bedding is the natural habitat of the worm that you're trying to replicate in your compost bin. Fill your bin with thin strips of unbleached corrugated cardboard or shredded newspaper, straw, dry grass, or some similar material. This provides a source of fiber to the worms and keeps the bin well-ventilated. Sprinkle a handful of dirt on top, and thoroughly moisten. Allow the water to soak in for at least a day before adding worms.


Over time, the bedding will be turned into nutrient-rich compost material by the worms. When you harvest the composted soil, you'll have to introduce new bedding into the worm bin again.
Canadian peat moss, sawdust, (rinsed) horse manure, and coconut pith fiber are also great for composting.
Avoid putting pine, redwood, bay or eucalyptus leaves into your bedding. Most brown leaves are acceptable in vermicompost, but eucalyptus leaves in particular act as an insecticide and will kill off your worms.

, There are several varieties of worms that that are bred and sold commercially for vermicomposting; just digging up earthworms from your backyard is not recommended. The Internet or local gardening club is your best bet for finding a worm vendor near you. A pound of worms is all that is recommended.


The worms most often used, Eisenia fetida (Red Wigglers), are about 4 inches long, mainly red along the body with a yellow tail. These worms have a healthy appetite and reproduce quickly. They are capable of eating more than half their own weight in food every day.
Another variety to consider are Eisenia hortensis, known as ""European night crawlers."" They do not reproduce quite as fast as the red wigglers, but grow to be larger, eat coarser paper and cardboard better, and seem to be heartier. They are also better fishing worms when they do reach full size.
However, as with any non-native species, it is important not to allow European night crawlers to reach the wild. Their voracious appetites and reproductive rates (especially among the red wigglers) have been known to upset the delicate balance of the hardwood forests by consuming the leaf litter too quickly. This event leaves too little leaf litter to slowly incubate the hard shelled nuts and leads to excessive erosion as well as negatively affecting the pH of the soil. So, do your best to keep them confined!

, The bedding of your compost bin is a great start, but the worms need a steady diet of food scraps in order to stay healthy and produce compost. Feed your worms at least once a week in the beginning, but only a small small amount. As the worms reproduce and grow in numbers, try to feed them at least a quart of food scraps per square foot of surface area each week.


Worms eat fruit and vegetable scraps; bread and other grains; tea leaves; coffee grounds; and egg shells. Worms eat basically what humans eat, except they are much less picky!
If you can process your scraps before you introduce them into the compost bin, you'll find that your worms will eat them quicker. Worms go through smaller-sized food more quickly than they can larger-sized or whole food. In this respect, they are also like humans.
Mix the scraps into the bedding when you feed the worms. This will cut down on fruit flies and will give the worms more opportunities to eat. Don't just leave the scraps on top of the compost heap.

, Keeping your bin elevated off the ground, using bricks, cinder blocks, or whatever is convenient will help speed composting and keep your worms happy. Worms are capable of escaping almost anything, but if you keep your worms fed and properly damp, they should not try to escape. A light in the same area will ensure your worms stay put.


Sprinkle the surface with water every other day. You want your bedding to have the dampness of a wrung-out sponge.
Add more cardboard, shredded newspaper, hay, or other fibrous material once a month, or as needed. Your worms will reduce everything in your bin quickly. You will start with a full bin of compost or paper/cardboard, and soon it will be half full. This is the time to add fibrous material.

, Composting bins are not difficult to maintain, but they do need to be looked after. Here are some things that you shouldn't do if you want a healthy, hearty ecosystem.


Don't feed your worms too much. If your compost bin starts to smell, it could be because you are feeding your worms more than they can process. When this happens, the bedding can also heat up, killing off the worms.
Don't feed your worms any combination of the following. These foods are difficult for the worms to digest:

Excessive citrus — no more than 1/5 of the total worm food
Meats or fish
Fats or excessively oily scraps
Dairy products (eggshells are fine)
Cat or dog feces
Twigs and branches



, After 3-6 months, you should have a fair amount of worm compost stored up in your bin. Now it's time to harvest. Keep in mind that you might not be able to save every worm when harvesting the compost. That's okay; by and large, your worms have multiplied, and there should be plenty to continue composting.


Put on rubber gloves, and move any large un-composted vegetable matter to one side. Then, with your gloved hands, gently scoop a section of worms and compost mixture onto a brightly lit piece of newspaper or plastic wrap. Scrape off the compost in layers. Wait a while giving the worms time to burrow into the center of the mound. Eventually you will end up with a pile of compost next to a pile of worms. After harvesting, you should replace the bedding and then return the worms to the bin, do whatever you want with the compost, and repeat.
If you prefer a hands-off technique, simply push the contents of the bin all to one side and add fresh food, water, dirt, and bedding to the empty space. The worms will slowly migrate over on their own. This requires much more patience, of course. It could take up to a few months for the worms to fully migrate to the scraps-side of the compost bin.

This can include the taste of the peach, as well as characteristics like type of skin and fruit size. Just keep in mind that each variety has its strengths and weaknesses while growing.The most common variety is the ‘Redhaven.’;
, Another factor in making a wise selection is where you will be growing your peaches. In the United States growing regions are broken up by the USDA into zones (this differs in other countries). Peaches typically grow in zones 5, 6, 7, and 8. You can also grow some varieties in zones 4, 9, and 10. Each zone has a variety the does particularly well:Zone 4 - Hale
Zone 5 - Madison
Zone 6 - Saturn
Zone 7 - Contender
Zone 8 - Frost
Zone 9 - Topaz
Zone 10 - Florida Beauty

, Once you select a type of peach, you need to separate the pit from the rest of the peach. You are off to a good start if you eat away the peach around the pit. Next, take a brush or rag and scrub off any remaining fruit. This will give you a nice, clean pit to start with., Use warm water and soap to wash away any residual traces of fruit. This will ensure that your pit does not attract pests. It also helps protect the pit from microbial growth., Pat the pit dry with a cloth or paper towel. Leave it sit overnight to finish drying. Inspect the pit to make sure that it is dry before proceeding. Too much water can cause the pit to rot., You can save yourself time and make the growing process easier if you remove the entire pit. The pit is the hard outer layer that protects the seed within it. Sometimes the pit will be split and you can separate it without damaging the seed. If the pit isn’t separated or you think you’ll damage the seed trying to remove it, just leave the pit in place.You can use a knife or other slim object to pry the pit apart where it has begun separating.
Handle the seeds with caution. They contain cyanide, which is toxic to humans and animals when ingested. Wear gloves and wash your hands when handling the seeds, and keep them away from children and pets.

, It is wise to plant more than one pit at a time. Many of them may not survive past their first year, or even grow at all. Each pit that you have selected should be placed in its own plastic bag., Stratification is the process of chilling the pit so that it will begin germinating. This process mimics the winter months and signals to the seed when to grow. To stratify the pits, place them in the cold for 8 weeks. You can do this outside if you live in a cold climate, or you can store them in your refrigerator for 8 weeks., Once the pits begin to sprout, remove them from the bags. Place each pit four inches below the surface of a one gallon pot of soil. Make sure to use a high nutrient blend such as soil based potting mix., Do not place any peach trees outside when there is a risk of frost. These trees typically do not survive a frost in the first year. Once the risk of frost is over, you can begin preparing the potted trees for transplant., To harden the trees, let them spend time outside each day. Gradually increase the time that they spend outside to allow them to develop a resistance to the effects of weather and pests. Start by placing them outside for one hour per day, and increase each day until they are staying outside all day.It may take a few weeks to appropriately harden your peach trees.

, After your trees have been hardened, it is time to plant your peach tree. Choose a suitable place in your garden and plant the two strongest trees. If you have space, you can plant more. If your space is limited, you can give any extra trees away."

Gather wood to make the frames of your boxes.,
Cut the frames (sides) of your box to create a box that is about 2 feet (0.6 m) x 3ft (60.96cm x 91.44cm) wide.

,
Glue, screw or nail the sides together to make your rectangular frame.,
Decide on which species of worms you wish to cultivate.,
Shred some newspaper, add some bits of vegetation and cover the bottom with about 1 - 2 inches (2.54 - 5.08 cm) of fertile topsoil.,
Repeat the first 3 steps to make more farms for Night Crawlers and Trout Worms.,
Change the design just slightly if you are breeding Reds and Tigers.,
Remove your worms by the dozen and put them into new worm containers by a count of your choice.",How to Make a Worm Farm," 1 inch (2.54 cm) is plenty thick enough for walls. Any thicker and the boxes will become much too heavy. The height of the walls should be between 4 - 5 inches (10.16 - 12.7 cm); anything less and you might have escapees. The base of the boxes should be cut from a 1/2 inch (1.27cm) plywood of sub-flooring material.;
,, Attach the bottom to the frame in the same fashion.

, Different worms need slightly different types of habitats.


Red Worms or Tiger Worms. These worms are big eaters, and as such, they are big poopers too. Worm castings are extremely fertile and rich. These are the worms to use if you are interested in having a customer base of organic gardeners and those who want to be environmentally friendly. They will have less garbage to put out to the curb for waste companies to pick up and fill our landfills.
Common Garden Worms (also known as Night Crawlers) or Trout Worms. These worms should be kept segregated from each other, but they are for one use: catching fish. Although they too have fertile castings, they do not eat nearly as much, and they do not produce as much poop as Reds or Tigers.

, Sprinkle with water to make it slightly moist. Add your species of worms, cover with a breathable rough covering, such as burlap. The environment must stay cool, moist and dark for the new occupants to be happy.

, Always keep at least one unoccupied farm on hand to change over when one worm farm gets too full of castings or overly populated. Worms will reproduce rather quickly if they have an optimal environment.

, Since these worms are bred for casting supplies, and they poop a lot, you will need to automate your cleaning and cultivating process a little. You will become a high rise worm landlord.


Repeat the first three steps, but in each subsequent bottom, drill holes about 1/4 - 1/2 inch (.635 - 1.27cm) in diameter. Stack the new addition with the holey bottom on top of the single story abode below. Decorate the new section with fresh strips of newspaper and food. The Red Worms and Tiger Worms below will migrate to the upper floor addition, leaving the bottom nice and full of castings to package and sell.

, The new container should have some soil or moss and a little food. They will keep for a long time in the refrigerator until you sell them.

Get a new or used trash can.,
After you have rinsed and cleaned the bin with warm water and a soft brush, drill a few holes in the bottom to release excess moisture.,
Start by laying down a nice thick bed of wet straw, shredded paper, cured grass clippings, clay and silt, not too rich in sand though, but you can use potting soils that do not have chemicals added.,
Choose a place for your bin that is partially shaded, so it will not over heat in the hot summer sun, and kill your worms.,
Layer the materials, and do not stir or mix them.,
Once you are about three quarters to the top, add your worms.,
Once the worms are added, and they have gone into the top of the materials, water generously from the top with rainwater, or non chlorinated water.,
Check on the compost bin from time to time, and if some materials have decayed enough, it may be wise to remove some of it, and replace it with new layers of organic materials.",How to Make a Portable Worm Compost Bin," It can be either hard plastic, or metal. Don't use less than a 25 gallon (94.6 L) can, but the bigger the size, the more composting materials it will hold. Do NOT use a liner.;
, You can begin to add the bottom table of compost. This can be several types of materials, and can be compacted down to about the first 6 or 7 inches (15.2 or 17.8 cm) of the bottom of the can.

, Fill the bottom of the can with these materials first, making sure that you cover the bottom part of the trash can. The next layer can be mostly any materials that you want to put in. Table scraps (except meat and bones), manure, fill dirt, leaves and small twigs, etc. At this point, mix some pulverized limestone in water, and pour this mix of limestone and water onto the top of the compost materials. Continue to stir the limestone so it will stay in the solution of the water. Be liberal here, as this sweetens the acidic soil, and helps add calcium to the bin.

, If you are going to leave the bin somewhere for a long long time, you may want to add lots of materials at one time. One good thing about a trash can is that it does have a lid. Keep it covered with the lid as much as possible at first, then if you know its going to rain, take of the top and let natures rainwater give a dose of moisture as often as possible. Put the trash can upon brick, blocks or rocks and put a tray below it to capture organic fertilizer that will be useful in many ways.

, Alternate between leaves, cured grass clippings, dirt and manure, chopped up greens of any kind, table scraps, and fill the can about three quarters of the way to the top with these items. Once again, be liberal with the pulverized limestone mixed in rainwater, or non chlorinated water. You can also use pelleted limestone, as it will break down over time.

, Red Wigglers are the normal choice, and you can get them pretty cheap. They work the compost materials quickly, and you don't need to feed them anymore at the top. You can use night crawlers too, but they often need shade, and cooler temperatures. Red Wigglers can often breed rapidly, and they can stand a range of temps. Use as many as you want to, but using at least 6 to 8 pounds or more of these worms for this bin is a good idea.

, Materials should be extremely damp, but not soaking wet. Put a tray below the compost bin to catch the water that flows out. This is highly enriched organic fertilizer that you can use on flower gardens, plants, or just about any other use.

, After 3 months, empty your compost bin completely, and remove castings, replace materials and put your worms back into the bin for the next session. Put castings into your garden, flowers bins, or sell them for profit. Gardeners will pay you for this type of composting fertilizers. It makes plants grow and produce many more garden veggies.

Know what worms like.,
Know what not to feed your worms.,
Feed worms around once a week.",How to Feed Worm Farm Worms," Just like any pet or animal in your care, the feeding always goes better when it's what the animal wants! Worms are really happy to consume the following:


Most fruit and vegetable scraps (see the exceptions in the next step).






Waste from your juicer (but not citrus).






Cardboard boxes - be sure to soak them first and tear into small pieces).






Paper, tissues, paper tickets, etc.






Your hair - give all hairbrushes a good weekly clean and give the worms your hair!






Coffee grounds.







Eggshells.






Banana skins (these are especially enjoyed).






Leaves.





;
, There are some things that your worms don't like or can even cause them harm. Do not feed worms the following food:


Any fruit that is very acidic - basically, don't give them tomatoes, any fruit from the citrus family, or kiwifruit. Some tropical fruits may also be too acidic.
Onion skins.
Dairy products, such as cheese, yogurt, cream.
Pasta.
Bread, buns, cake.
Meat, fish.

Spicy food.

, Keep an eye on their consumption rate, however, as this will determine how often you need to replenish their food supply.


The amount of food needed can vary from season to season

Obtain a large sturdy ice chest.,
Angle it down so that water will drain out the hole.,
Worms can be obtained as bait or online.,
Get some lawn clippings, newspapers shreds, leaves etc.,
Obtain a mister, a 1 gallon (3.8 L) per hour or less.,
Mount the mister above the ice chest and turn it on.,
Obtain a small cheap sump pump with a float switch ( try to buy one on craigslist for 10 bucks), maybe $50 new.,
By the time the water gets to the plants it's lost some or all of it's chlorine and picked up lots of micro nutrients and micro biotic life which is good for plants.,
Keep putting dirty salad in the ice chest, fill it up.",How to Make a Worm Box and Liquid Fertilizer," Elevate it on a sturdy table, retaining wall, stump or old car etc. You will be able to move it, but in 6 months it will weigh 75 lbs or more. Better to find a permanent spot for it now.;
, Find some old hose or situate it so that the water drains into a garbage can (medium to large). Every thing from now on will get plugged up unless you filter your tea. Use some old plastic dish washing things inside the ice chest, stacked around the hole. Use your imagination not your money. Get jiggy with it... a piece of pipe with some screen around it, old swamp cooler pad etc.

, You want only red wigglers (Red Worms).

, Think dirty nasty salad.

, Make sure it has the little filter on the back. Hook it to your hose (drill and tap a hose cap), figure it out it may cost a little. Better to think than to buy.

, You're making compost tea. not too exciting yet and what to do with it. For a while just bucket it out to the garden. Too much work.

, Plumb a hose to it and put the end where you want to water. When the garbage can fills up, the pump pumps. Move the hose occasionally.

, That's the point.

, When it goes down put some more in. Keep it full to the top. In six months it will sink 2 inches (5.1 cm) a day!. The worms will eat all the lawn clippings easily.

Gather recycled containers, such as milk jugs, clam-shell boxes, foil trays.,
Locate some soil to fill your containers.,
Find an area where the humidity will be in a normal range.,
Look for a place where the plants will get sunlight, if possible.,
Plant the seeds in the containers according to the instructions on the seed packet, if available.,
Keep the soil in your containers moist.,
Cover containers in which herbs are planted with plastic wrap to keep the soil moist after planting until the sprouts appear.,
Make sure the seedlings are not planted too thickly to successfully survive and grow until they are transplanted.,
Use a liquid fertilizer if the plants will be kept in the container for a long period of time.",How to Winter Sow Seeds Outdoors," They should all be able to hold a depth of three inches soil. There are also commercially manufactured containers made from organic material that allow plants to be transplanted directly into the soil when the weather warms, but the main thing you should keep in mind is choosing a container that will hold soil and keep it moist without allowing it to percolate through and leak out.;
, You can excavate topsoil from a flower bed or garden area if you have a suitable location for doing so, or you can buy a prepared potting soil. The soil should be suitable for the type plants you are starting, but essentially, it should have a good mix of organic compost, loam, and enough sand to insure drainage.

, A location too near heat sources may dry the planting soil too quickly, and damp locations can encourage the development of fungus, rot, or mold to the tender new growth of your new plants.

, A window facing the sunny side of your home is the best bet, but if there is none available, you may elect to purchase a sunlight spectrum light to provide artificial sunlight.

, If no planting instructions are included with your seed, plant them at a generic planting depth according to type. Most herbs and other plants with very small seeds should be planted at a shallow depth, between 1/4 and 1/2 inch. Plants with larger seeds should germinate successfully if planted at a depth of about 1 inch (2.5 cm).

, Flooding or over-watering the soil can cause your seeds to rot, but allowing the soil to become too dry after the seed has germinated will likely cause it to die, so sprinkle enough water on the soil to maintain moisture without causing excess water to pool or stand.

, This will decrease or eliminate the need to water the soil, which can dislodge tiny herb seeds. Be sure to uncover the container when the seed are sprouted.

, Again, small seeds require extra care, since it is easier to overpopulate a container with them.

, You can observe the health of the plants to help determine the need for supplemental fertilization. Pale green or yellow colored leaves mean a lack of plant nutrients or insufficient sunlight. If you are sure your plants are getting enough sun, try adding a very dilute mixture of water soluble fertilizer and observe the plants for improvements in color.

Obtain or make your growing bag.,
Position the bag where you will grow your plants.

,
Plant shallow-rooted plants in the bag.,
Keep the bag well watered.,
Make the most of the space.,
Add more nutrients as the season moves on.,
Prop up tall plants as needed.",How to Use Growing Bags for Plants," If you purchase it, look for a good quality peat-based compost mixture. If you make your own growing bag, add the same contents into a bag that is large enough to grow your plants. In both cases, you will need to make a rectangular slit in the bag to create a rectangle with edges on the top half of the bag. Make sure to leave plenty of edging to contain the peat compost mixture.;
,, Good choices include tomatoes, peppers (capsicum), eggplants, zucchini, cucumbers, marrow, strawberries, French beans, lettuce, herbs and flowers.

, Poke a few drainage holes in the side of the bag and keep it well watered. The plastic heats the peat mix up considerably, so keeping a moist soil is essential for the growing plants to succeed.

, When space is a premium, and gardening in this way is the only opportunity you have to grow your own vegetables, you can increase the crop by under planting. For example, if you are growing tomatoes which grow tall, add some lettuces or radishes underneath the tomatoes. Just be sure to wait until the tomatoes are well grown before planting the under-plants.

, Over time the plans will deplete the nutrients already in the mix and you will need to add more. A compost tea addition is ideal.

, You may need to add stakes or similar objects to prop up taller plants as they grow. Be careful not to pierce these through the bottom.

Check soil carefully.,
Look at the type of plant.,
Research how much water your plants need.,
See if the soil is wet.,
Give appropriate water.,
Get the timing right.The best time of day to water is always in the morning.,
Concentrate watering on the roots.,
Water slowly.,
Use a rain gauge.,
Use a sprinkler in your garden.,
Micro-drip irrigation systems can be installed to deliver water directly to where the plants can use it.,
Use waste water from preparing vegetables and washing up as well as that from baths and showers.",How to Water Plants Effectively," There are two types of soil:


Dry soil - It can be identified if the soil is sandy and has cracks in it.
Clay soil - If the soil is sticky and muddy then it is clay soil.;
, Is the plant younger, or a newly grown, or an older one. Younger plants can be at most 4-5 years of age. Then they are categorised as older plants.

, This varies from species to species, so look online or in gardening books.

, If the plants are grown in dry soil, it would need more amount of water and clay soil obviously needs less amount of water as it has more moisture.

, Remember that different kinds and ages of plants have different requirements. Younger ones typically need less water than older ones, while newly planted ones need only small amount of water.

, This gives the plant time to absorb the water and get ready to handle heat, cold, or just the energy it takes to produce chlorophyll, grow, and move nutrients around.If you water in the late afternoon or evening, the problem is that the plant is now wet and the air temperature is cool. Those are the best conditions for mildews, molds, and all kinds of disease problems. Keep life simple, water in the morning.


Watering in the middle of a very hot day isn't a good idea either, since the water can evaporate before it does any good, and can actually heat up too much and damage your plants.

, Roots require more water than leaves. In fact roots only require water. As said earlier wet leaves will lead to diseases.

, Watering fast is like giving just 20% of water to plants rest all waste.Water slower. Doing this water will remain around roots as a result it  will get more water. Watering fast may generate a great flow, causing erosion and leading to most of the water flowing away anyway.

, It measures how many centimetre the rain falls in that area so you would be able to give plants the desired quantity of water.

, Sprinklers are very effective. They give water to plants at the proper time, and you don't have to worry about doing it with a hose or watering can. It is similar to drop-by-drop method (irrigation method used in farming).

, Applied slowly, water gradually soaks to the roots, rather than running off or evaporating. It will save you time and reduce the amount of water that's wasted.

, Don't use water that contains bleach or powerful household cleaning products, which could damage plants.

, Unofficially, chia seeds are sometimes used to help treat diabetes, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease in general.Chia seeds have high amounts of omega-3 fatty acids and dietary fiber. Preliminary research suggests that these nutrients might be able to help minimize risk factors for various forms or heart disease.
People with diabetes, in particular, might be able to benefit from consuming 37 g of ""Salba"" chia seeds daily for 12 weeks. This dosage can help reduce blood pressure and lower the amounts of inflammatory C-reactive proteins and clot-forming von Willebrand factors in the blood.
You should not take chia seeds if you are pregnant, breast-feeding, at risk for prostate cancer or currently diagnosed with prostate cancer, or dealing with high triglyceride levels.
Talk to your doctor to determine a good dosage of chia seeds for your particular set of health conditions.

, Chia seed gel made from chia and plain water can be used as a substitute for eggs in most baked good recipes.


Grind a handful of chia seeds dry in a coffee grinder, blender, or food processor.
Mix 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of ground chia seeds with 3 Tbsp (45 ml) of water. Let it sit for 15 minutes or until it thickens into a gel.This amount can be used as a substitute for one egg in just about any baked recipe.

, Speaking of baking, you can grind chia seeds into a coarse gluten-free flour that can be used in a variety of recipes, including those for many baked goods.


Put a handful of seeds in a food processor, coffee grinder, or blender and pulse until a powder forms.
For thick doughs, you can substitute chia flour in equal parts.
For thin batter, mix one part chia seed flour with three parts gluten-free flour.

, Chia seeds absorb liquid and give it a thicker texture. In highly concentrated amounts, chia seeds can turn the liquid into gel, but in small enough amounts, it only acts as a thickener.


Add 2 Tbsp (30 ml) whole or ground chia seeds to soups, stews, gravies, and sauces instead of cornstarch or flour. Mix well to combine and let it sit for 5 minutes to gauge the new thickness.
Continue adding additional chia seeds to the liquid as needed to achieve your desired thickness.

, There are a variety of chia seed based snacks that you can make at home. Some of the easiest include chia crackers and chia seed pudding.


There are several variations of chia crackers you can make, but most simply require you to mix the seeds with a few seasonings and some water before baking.

Mix 1/2 cup (125 ml) chia seeds with 1/2 cup (125 ml) sunflower seeds, 1/2 cup (125 ml) pumpkin seeds, and 1/2 cup (125 ml) sesame seeds.Combine 1 cup (250 ml) water, 1 grated garlic clove, 1 tsp (5 ml) grated onion, and 1/4 tsp (125 ml) salt separately before stirring the seasoning liquid into the seeds.

, The word ""chia"" became popular in Western culture thanks to the commercially produced ""Chia Pet,"" but you can make your own cheap version of this at home by sprouting chia seeds in a small pot and watering consistently.


Fill a clay pot with soil. If you want to get creative, you can find a pot shaped like an animal, but any pot can be used.
Sprinkle the chia seeds over the pot. Gently press them into the soil with your fingers.
Add enough water to keep the soil moist. Continue watering the plant, keeping it regularly moist, and let the chia plant sit in a sunny area.
It should only take a few days for chia to sprout.

, If you pack chia seeds into a dark area of your yard, they can help prevent mud and make your lawn look neater and cleaner.


Spread a handful of chia seeds evenly over a small patch of yard in a shaded area. Use your feet or the back of a shovel to pat the chia seeds into the ground.
Without sun and regular watering, the chia seeds are unlikely to sprout into chia plants.

, Do this near where you plan to cut down the relevant plants. It should also be somewhere fairly clean and not too dusty as you don't want dust, dirt, and other things getting into the threshed seeds.

,, Fold the tarpaulin over to cover the plants and to stop the seeds from jumping out or flying away.

, Jump up and down on the folded tarpaulin. Get a friend to help or get the kids into it. The stomping and jumping will release the seeds and separate them from the chaff.


If kids are helping, remind them that the tarpaulin needs to stay over the plants while they're jumping up and down.

, Place a sieve or screen over the container that will enable you to sift the seeds. You will need to check the screen size against the seed size to ensure the seed can fall through but not much else, and especially not the chaff.

, This refers to the act of blowing the chaff off the seeds. You can do this in various ways:


Blow across the sieve or screen as you are sifting the seeds; rotate the container at the same time.
Pour the seeds from one container to another, using a fan or similar object to blow off the seeds.

, Light seed that blows away with the wind and winnowing should not be kept as it won't have good genetic material. Instead, look for the top 10 percent of seeds, which are the heaviest ones.

, Place in a cool, dry place for storage. Plant the next season.

Decide whether to wet trim or dry trim.",How to Trim Marijuana1," The marijuana plant’s resin can be difficult to wash off. Wearing disposable rubber gloves will protect your hands from its sticky buds., Marijuana plants are fragile and can be sensitive to rough treatment. Trimming your plant must be done carefully. Sharp sewing shears or a sharp kitchen knife should be adequate to trim your plant.Gardening shears are also commonly used to trim marijuana.Large fan leaves can be plucked with your fingers, as well as clipped with scissors or shears.

, You should not simply discard the leaves you trimmed. They can be used to make marijuana foodstuffs or hashish. So before trimming your marijuana plants, set three cookie sheets or other wide containers near the plants you’ll be trimming. On one sheet, set untrimmed buds. On the second sheet, set newly trimmed buds. And on the last sheet, set the leaves and other plant matter you trim from the plant., The top of your marijuana plant should have a cluster of white hairs sticking out the top of it. These are the plant’s pistils, or reproductive organs. As the plant ages, these pistils will change from white to brown. When about 70% of the pistils have darkened to a reddish brown, your plant is ready for harvest., Most people trim their marijuana plants before drying them. This is known as a “wet trim.” A wet trim makes it easier to separate leaves from buds, and produces better-looking buds. However, some people trim the plants after the buds of the plant have dried. This is known as a “dry trim.” This is the preferred method of trimming in a low-humidity environment, since the leaves will slow the drying process and you want the buds to dry slowly."

Keep the new pot in a place with low levels of light for a few days.",How to Transplant a Plant," You should do this approximately 1 or 2 days before the actual day of transplanting in order to let the fertilizer do its work.;
, You should use enough potting soil to reach approximately 2 inches (5.1 cm) below the rim of the pot.

, Make sure that there are absolutely no dry soil areas in your destination pot.

,, Grab the base of the plant with a flat hand, make sure to cover as much of the topsoil as possible. Flip the pot upside down and carefully pull the plant out with the soil. Don't move too quickly or else you may damage the roots in the process.

, Use a little bit of extra soil to fill in any holes and make sure that none of the roots are exposed. Lightly water the pot with the water-fertilizer mixture from before.

, It will take a day or 2 for the plant to adjust to its new soil environment, and only then should you bring it back into a full-light environment.

Transplant the jade plant in early spring.,
Use a heavy clay, terra cotta or ceramic container.,
Make sure the container has at least one drain hole in the bottom.,
Find a container that is only 1 to 2 inches deeper and wider than the old container.,
Use a peat-based potting mix with extra coarse builder’s sand or perlite added in.,
Put the new potting mix into the container at a depth of 1 to 2 inches.,
Remove the jade plant from its old container.,
Disinfect a pair of sharp scissors with a household disinfectant like Lysol.,
Trim off any roots that are much longer than the root mass.,
Put the jade plant in the new container.,
Water the jade plant with room-temperature water until it drains from the bottom.,
Take special care of the jade plant for four weeks after transplanting it.,
Water the plant with room-temperature water when the top of the potting mix begins to dry.,
Do not overwater the plant.,
Avoid giving the plant any fertilizer while the root system is recovering.,
Keep the plant out of direct sunlight.",How to Transplant a Jade Plant," This is the time when they are just entering a season of vigorous growth.They recover from the stress of being repotted more easily and quickly during this season.;
, This will help to keep the plant upright.Jade plants tend to become top heavy and fall over easily.

, This will allow excess water to drain from the pot.


If the excess water cannot drain away, it will keep the potting soil too moist and restrict air movement which can cause root rot and kill the plant.

, Larger containers will encourage excessive root growth or hold too much soil around the roots which will keep them wet for too long., This will allow the soil to drain more quickly.You can mix the perlite or sand into the potting mix at a ratio of two-thirds potting mix and one-third perlite or sand.

, The top of the jade plant root mass should be about 1 inch below the top of the container after it is transplanted.

, Do this by laying the pot on its side, grasping the base of the stem in your hand and sliding the roots out., Soak them in the disinfectant for five minutes, rinse them in tap water and dry them off with a clean towel.


This will kill fungal spores and bacteria that may infect the jade plant.

, Then, cut the roots off so they are even with the rest of the root mass.


Trimming off these long roots will cause the plant to develop a healthier root system within the root mass.

, Then, fill in the spaces around the roots with potting mix.

, This will settle the soil around the roots and give the plant some moisture.


If there is a saucer beneath the container to catch the water that drains from the hole, empty it after watering the plant.
Water left in the saucer could leach back up into the potting mix and keep the roots too wet.

, The jade plant will be stressed from being transplanted and should be cared for a little differently while it recovers.

, The jade plant needs to be watered more often than usual because the root system has been compromised and cannot absorb water efficiently.Room-temperature water will not shock the roots like cold tap water.
If the jade plant is not getting enough water, its succulent leaves will begin to shrivel and may develop brown spots., Too much water will cause the leaves to turn yellow.

, The jade plant does not need fertilizer during this time and it could burn the roots.

, As the leaves are not receiving moisture as efficiently as usual, they could be burned by too much sunlight.

Clip the fan leaves.,
Trim the sugar leaves.,
Leave the buds on the plant.,
Hang the branches to cure.,
Dispose of your plant.",How to Trim Marijuana2," The fan leaves are the large leaves that have five distinct points – a large, long point in the center and two smaller points on either side. Fan leaves can be plucked with your fingers or clipped with scissors or shears.Some people choose to clip their fan leaves later, after they’ve cured the plant. This slows down the drying process and produces more flavorful buds.

, The sugar leaves are those that emerge from the buds themselves. They are so short that their stems cannot be seen. Only their tips are visible. Use your scissors to snip them off., Generally, it’s a good idea to leave the buds you want (the ones close to the top of the plant) on the plant in order to slow the drying process. If you’re in a high-humidity environment, you might need to remove the buds in order to advance the drying process., When the bud-bearing branches have been removed and partitioned into individual pieces, they must be cured (dried). Using string or twist ties, hang the branches on your laundry line so that all parts are exposed to air. Hang your plants in a room with a temperature of about 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius) and no warmer than 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius).Use heavy ventilation in the form of a fan or a draft to help dry the branches at first.
As they dry, gradually decrease the ventilation to increase the moisture in the room, but never let the moisture exceed about 50%.
Don't expose your harvested plants to direct sunlight, heat, or moisture. The latter is especially bad, as it can produce mold, which can ruin a crop.
The goal is for your branches to slowly, naturally dry, so that when you smoke the buds, they produce a pleasing flavor. This may take upwards of a week.

, After removing all the buds, clip the rest of the leaves from all of the branches. There's no right way to do this. A firm tug on each leaf stalk might be one person's preferred method, while clipping might be another's. Once a marijuana plant has been totally trimmed of its buds and leaves, it should be disposed of. Place it in your compost bin or put it out with the rubbish."
"
Remove dead leaves.,
Cut all branches and shoots that are not directly connected to the trunk.,
Cut away the leaves from the top of the plant.,
FIM or top your plant.,
Super crop your plant.,
Pluck low-lying buds.,
Don’t prune too often.",How to Trim Marijuana3," As harvest time approaches, you'll want to begin reaching into the branches of the live plant and removing all of the dead and dying fan leaves (identifiable by their yellow hue) from the branches. This process allows the plant to focus as much energy as possible on growing healthy leaves, rather than wasting energy maintaining leaves that may die anyway. A gentle tug, sometimes firm, is all that's required to remove most leaves.It is normal for some leaves of the plant to die.

, As branches grow out from the main stalk of the plant, they will in turn develop shoots and branches of their own. However, they will struggle to get enough light and sap energy from the leaves located at the ends of the main branches. Trim these leaves and shoots away., If your main stalk has leaves sprouting straight up and out from it, trim them. This will not only allow the branches to get more light, but will also stimulate new branch growth.Cutting the top of your plant off is crucial if you have limited vertical growing space.

, FIMing refers to the process of cutting part of a recent shoot (known as a ""top"") from your plant in order to double the number of buds it produces. ""Topping"" mean to remove the whole shoot down to the base. FIMing also causes your plant to grow out rather than up.


Topping and FIMing produce slightly different results. Research which is best for your setup.
To FIM your marijuana plant, locate a new shoot, then use your shears or other trimming instrument to snip two-thirds of the shoot’s length.FIMing is not without risks. Every time you clip a shoot, you increase the risk that your plant will get a disease.
Your plant’s growth might slow after FIMing. This is normal.

, Super cropping refers to the practice of squeezing a branch of the plant firmly, thereby partially crushing its tissue. This will cause the plant to heal and rebuild the branch more strongly, and allow for more efficient circulation of nutrients and water within the plant.Select an old yet still supple branch, one that is still green, not brown and woody.
Pinch the mid-point of the branch between your thumb and index finger. With your opposite hand, pinch the branch at a point just above the spot your other hand is pinching it.
Bend the branch gently back and forth in an arc. Increase the angle of the arc gradually until you’ve heard the branch crack. You should also be able to see some white discoloration at the joint you’ve been working.
Rest the bent branch on top of or against a nearby branch to support its weight.

, If you see small buds sprouting from the lower portion of your plant, pluck or clip them off. These small buds will only drain energy from the larger and more plentiful buds growing near the top of the plant., After trimming your plant, it needs time to recover and heal. Trim your plant no more than once every three or four days. Often, your plant will only need to be trimmed twice a month. Prune more often during your plant’s early vegetative stage (when it first produces leaves) and toward the end of its flowering (bud-producing) stage."

Add blood meal to your garden soil to raise the nitrogen content in the soil for healthier vegetable crops.,
Use blood meal fertilizer on soil that you want to make more acidic, because this substance effectively lowers the pH in the soil.,
Watch your plants for signs of nitrogen deficiency throughout the growing season.,
Learn how to use blood meal as a deterrent for some types of pests in your garden.,
Use blood meal fertilizer when your crops need immediate assistance.",How to Use Blood Meal," Because blood meal is water soluble, in can be dissolved in water to create a liquid fertilizer. Blood meal is particularly helpful in garden beds that are used year after year, because nitrogen can be depleted from the soil through the plants after repeated growth cycles.;
, To find out the acidity of your garden soil before applying blood meal, take a sample to the local nursery for analysis. If you find the pH in your soil is too high to efficiently grow the crops you want, blood meal may be the perfect way to prepare your soil for your planting.

, One telltale sign that your crops are not getting enough of this important nutrient is yellowing leaves. If your plants begin to look like they are not getting enough nitrogen in the soil, an application of blood meal fertilizer during the growing season can return leaves to their green hue once again.

, This substance has been shown to be effective in keeping deer, rabbits and other pests away from garden beds during the growing season. However, blood meal fertilizer also attracts other types of critters, including dogs and raccoons. If you are interested in blood meal use as a deterrent, be sure the substance will actually keep away the specific animals you are currently dealing with.

, Blood meal is frequently used because it is one of the fastest acting fertilizers on the market today. A single application of blood meal is usually effective for 6 to 8 weeks before subsequent feedings are needed.

Give your plants plenty of light.,
Water your plants regularly.,
Fertilize your plants every few weeks.,
Clean dust off your plants.,
Move your plant away from air vents.",How to Take Care of Plants1," One of the primary concerns for house plants is making sure they get enough light. Keeping your plants on a side-table in your living room may look good, but if it is too far from a window, your plant may not last long. Look up the sun requirements for your specific plant, and move them to a location that matches those requirements. Keep in mind that windows facing the south side of your house will receive the most light, while windows facing the north side will receive the least amount of light. Basic sunshine guidelines are as follows:


Plants that need ‘full sunlight’ should be placed somewhere that gets 4-6 hours of direct light per day.
Plants that need ‘partial sunlight’ should be placed somewhere that gets 2-3 hours of direct light per day.
Plants that need ‘shade’ should be placed somewhere that gets 1 hour of direct sunlight per day.;
, Getting the proper balance of water for houseplants can be tricky: too much water, and the roots will start to rot because of poor drainage, and too little water and they’ll dry out. The specific amounts of water needed will vary from plant to plant, as some like to be very wet all the time while others (like cacti and succulents) only need watering once every few weeks. However, most plants will thrive when watered 2-3 times a week. Use a spray bottle or small watering can, and add enough water each time so that the soil is moist without being muddy.


Stick your finger in the soil up to your 2nd knuckle to see how wet it is; if your finger comes back dry, you need to water your plant. If it is wet at all, then hold off on watering for a day or two more.
Always use warm water for your plants, as cold water can shock the roots and cause damage to the plant.Give your plants a deep watering about once a month. Place them in the sink and let the water run through them. This will help keep salts from building up on the surface of the soil.

, Fertilizer is a soil additive that supplies plants with nutrients. It is particularly important to fertilize indoor plants every 2-3 weeks, because there is no organic matter being added to the soil naturally like there would be outdoors. Most fertilizers come with a 3-number series, such as 10-20-10; these numbers refer to the amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium the fertilizer contains. Because every kind of plant requires different amounts of those three minerals, the type of fertilizer you need to use will vary. However, starting with a ‘middle ground’ fertilizer such as a 6-12-6 or 10-10-10 mix should be good enough for most plants.


Spray or sprinkle the fertilizer directly onto the top of the soil, according to the package directions.
Liquid fertilizers can be mixed with water in your watering can. To apply, simply water your plants.
You don’t need to mix the fertilizer into the potted soil, as it will dissolve and incorporate into the mixture on its own over time.

, Indoor plants will become coated in a thin layer of dust over time. This dust takes away from the plants’ natural beauty, and it also makes it harder for them to grow by clogging the ‘pores’ on the leaves. As a result, it is important to clean off any dust you notice on a regular basis. Depending on the size of your plant, there are two different general cleaning methods: wipe them off with a cloth, or rinse them in the sink under running water. If you choose to wipe down your plants, mix a small amount of warm water with a bit of dish soap or plant soap, and dip a clean rag into the mixture before carefully wiping down the leaves. If you run them under water, just turn on warm water in your sink and carefully rinse each leaf with your hands or a clean dish rag.


Rinsing down your plant under running water works best for smaller plants. Make sure not to get too much water into the pot itself, though.
There are brands of plant cleaning spray on the market that you can use to spray the dust off your plants.

, Moisture levels inside of houses tends to be lower than moisture levels outside of houses. As a result, it is common for houseplants to become dried up due to a lack of humidity. Although regular watering can help prevent this, a bigger issue causing this is placing your indoor plants near air vents. Whether the heater or the air conditioner is the one working, the constant air flow will dry out the leaves of the plants and cause them to die off. To solve this problem, move them away from any vents in the room. You can also incorporate a humidifier into your décor nearby to add moisture to the air."

Make sure your plants are getting enough water.,
Weed your garden regularly.,
Mulch your garden every few months.,
Cut off any dead or diseased plants.,
Deadhead your flowers.,
Fertilize your plants once a month.",How to Take Care of Plants2," Caring for plants in a garden relies heavily on the natural elements and environment in proximity. As a result, the amount of watering you need to do is dependent on what the weather and soil is like in your area. It’s generally a good rule of thumb to water your plants 2-3 times a week either by hand with a watering can, or with a sprinkler system. The soil of your garden should be damp without being soggy, and not so dry that it is crumbly and dusty.


Check the ideal watering amounts for each plant, as some varieties prefer lots of water while others require very little.

, Weeds can spring up overnight and ruin a perfectly lovely garden. Weeds aren’t only an eyesore, they also take up valuable growing space and use nutrients in the soil that could otherwise go towards growing your garden. As a result, you should try to pull weeds whenever you see them pop up. Grasp each weed as close to the ground as you’re able, and then pull it straight up. doing this will increase the likelihood of pulling out the root system and slowing the growth of future weeds.


You can use weed killers in your garden, but most aren’t plant-specific and will kill all surrounding plants (not just the weeds).
Check for weeds growing underneath the canopy of a plant or bush.

, Mulch is a type of organic compost that is added to the top of your garden soil to prevent weeds from growing and to trap moisture. Mulching will also add nutrients to the soil as it mixes in over time, helping your plants to grow even larger. You can purchase mulch at most garden supply stores. Simply add a layer of mulch 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) thick over the entirety of the topsoil in your garden.Be careful not to cover up the base of your plants with mulch, as this will inhibit their growth. This is especially important for small trees and bushes.
You can add a layer of organic compost as a substitute for garden mulch, if you want. Keep in mind that compost will not prevent weeds like mulch will, although it is beneficial to your plant's growth.
For permanent plantings, you can lay down landscape fabric over the soil to act as a weed barrier. Using this in combination with mulch will reduce weeds to almost nothing.

, Plant disease can spread quickly through a garden, if not contained. The same is true for a plant that is injured; if you don’t remove the dying limbs, it can continue to spread to the rest of the plant. Whenever you notice plants that are browning, dry, brittle, or otherwise sickly looking, use a pair of gardening shears to cut off the branches from the base. Throw these branches away rather than leaving them in your garden as compost, because if they do contain a plant disease, it can still spread to nearby plants.

, The term ‘deadhead’ refers to the practice of cutting off the dead flower heads on a plant. This will stimulate new growth, and remove the brown and dying flower. To do this, simply use a pair of gardening shears to snip the flower just below the bud. Over the next few days, you should notice a new bud begin to form and bloom.


To encourage the growth of leaves, cut flower buds before they bloom. This will conserve the plant's energy.

, Outdoor plants get more nutrients from their surrounding environment than do indoor plants, meaning that they need to be fertilized much less. Find a fertilizer that meets your plants specific mineral requirements, or choose an ‘average’ fertilizer such as a 6-12-6 or 10-10-10 mixture from your local nursery. Spray or sprinkle the fertilizer onto the plants once every 4-5 weeks, according to package directions.


Mix the fertilizer into the top few inches of soil. This can help reduce harmful runoff of fertilizers into waterways and other areas. If fertilizer is left on top of the soil, the nutrients will enter the air instead of the soil.
Consider organic options for fertilizing. Most nutrition contained in chemical fertilizers is wasted because it is released faster than plants can use it. Furthermore, they only provide three nutrients. Mature organic compost or organic mixes provide more micronutrients. Organic compost will release these nutrients over a long period as plants need them.
If you’re unsure as to what fertilizer to use, ask your local nursery worker for help."
"
Add drainage to poorly draining soil.,
Move plants that are placed too closely together.,
Avoid adding too much mulch.,
Cut off any dead or diseased plants.,
Avoid over-watering your plants.,
Make sure you don’t plant your plants too deeply.",How to Take Care of Plants3," If your garden patch or potted plant constantly has a pool of water sitting on top, then the soil is poorly draining. This is bad, because the buildup of water can cause the roots of the plant to rot, killing the plant over time. To remedy this, carefully dig out the plant and a clump of the surrounding soil; place the plant on a tarp or in another clean pot. Mix compost or peat into the soil. Replace your plant in its original location.


If all of your soil is poorly draining, you can dig it up and mix in sand to help increase the drainage.

, If you got a bit over-enthusiastic and planted several plants near each other when they were small, you may have been surprised when they grew up and began competing for space in your garden or indoor pot. Plants that are put too close together will not grow as large, since there are not enough nutrients to be shared between them. Simply dig up the offending plants, and relocate them to a new garden plot or pot that has more room. Fill in the empty space with fresh gardening soil.Always use store-bought gardening soil rather than soil from your yard, as the soil from your yard contains insects, plant diseases, and weeds that will spread to your plant in its new location.
You can tell that plants are too close if they are growing into each other, or if their primary stems/branches become tangled.

, While mulching is beneficial for adding nutrients and blocking out weeds, adding too much mulch can be problematic for a garden. This is because the mulch will not only block out weeds, but will also prevent new growth from your plants from breaking the surface. Never add more than a 2-inch thick layer of mulch to your garden. If your garden isn’t growing after you’ve mulched, take off 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of mulch and wait a few weeks for improvement.


If you add mulch too high on the base of a stem or tree, it will cut off valuable sunlight and prevent growth. Move mulch off the base of the stems and tree trunks in your garden.

, Plant disease can spread quickly through a garden, if not contained. The same is true for a plant that is injured; if you don’t remove the dying limbs, it can continue to spread to the rest of the plant. Whenever you notice plants that are yellow, browning, dry, brittle, or otherwise sickly looking, use a pair of gardening shears to cut off the branches from the base.


Throw these branches away rather than leaving them in your garden as compost, because if they do contain a plant disease, it can still spread to nearby plants.

, Although you may think you’re watering your plants correctly, if they begin to turn yellow and droop, you’re probably giving them too much water. Most plant’s don’t need to be watered daily, in fact they do better when given a lot of water every few days. Only water your plants when the soil is dry at least 2-inches deep. If you water every time the top of the soil looks dry, you are almost guaranteed to over-water your plant. If you are having difficulty giving too much water to indoor plants, try switching to a spray bottle for watering your plants, rather than using a watering can. Spray bottles make it much harder to add too much water, since very little is released at one time., If your plants are slowly dying and wilting for no known reason, you may have buried them too deeply. The roots of the plant need to be relatively close to the surface, so that they can extract all the nutrients from the topsoil and have access to the sun. Carefully dig up your plants, and replant them so that the root ball is just-at or just-below the surface of the soil. If the root ball is partially exposed, spread a thin layer of mulch over the top to protect it.


When transplanting a plant from a pot to the garden, keep the soil level at the same depth that it was in the original pot.
If your roots are mostly above the surface, your plant will die as well. You want the roots to be level with the garden topsoil.

Install large hooks into ceiling beams to help support large or heavy hanging baskets.





;
, At some times, especially in warm or hot weather, you may need to water your plants up to 3 times per day.


Check the dryness of a plant by lifting its container slightly out of the hanging basket and feeling its weight. Dry plants will be significantly lighter than hydrated plants.






Place one of your fingers 1 inch (2.54 cm) below the surface of the soil in one of your hanging plants. If the soil feels dry, you will need to water your plant.







, Since hanging plants are watered more frequently because of their tendency to dry out faster, nutrients must be replenished in the soil by fertilizer.


Treat your hanging plants with fertilizer when the soil is moist and before the plants begin to wilt to gain the ideal results.






Apply fertilizer to the soil of your hanging plants by following the instructions provided by the fertilizer's manufacturer. Some fertilizers will require you to apply them twice a week; whereas other types of fertilizers can be applied once every several months.







, This will allow your hanging plants to apply their energy toward growing flowers, stems, and branches that have not yet grown or bloomed."
"
Ask your neighbor to clarify exactly what is expected of you.,
Write down the instructions.,
Arrange for easy access.,
Use the standard watering gear your neighbor does.,
Attend to the plants daily.,
Water the plants.,
Be especially vigilant during hot weather.,
Use the hose with care.,
Chase away or get rid of pests.,
Remember to lock up everything behind you.,
Leave your neighbors a note the day before they come back if it doesn't rain.",How to Take Care of Your Neighbor's Plants While They're Away," If the plants are the usual types that you know how to care for, this won't be such an issue as being expected to care for plants in need of special fertilizing or watering regimes. Things to ask include:


Do any of the plants require more or less water than every day?






Do any of the plants require shifting for the purposes of sunlight/shade/temperature? Or perhaps there is a need to move a shade cloth, or open a window, etc.






Will any of the plants need deadheading (removal of blooms), removal of anything in the time you're in charge?






Do any plants need misting as well as/instead of watering? Some tropical or delicate species prefer misting over direct watering.






Are there particular things to watch out for and deal with, such as insect infestations or disease? If yes, what should you do to contain the problem?






Are you responsible for indoor and outdoor plants or just one or the other?






Do you need to know anything technical, such as timer switches for irrigation systems, etc.? If so, also ask what you do should the system fail––know who to call to get it fixed.






Are there any other special requirements that you should be aware of?





;
, That way you won't forget and you'll have a checklist of what needs to be done to follow.


This might including feeding pets, checking the house is secure, switching lights on and off, etc. too. Add everything to the list, under suitable sub-headings.







, If your neighbors have plants inside that they don't want to bring out, find out their garage code or have them give a key to you to get into their house.

, The plants are used to what your neighbor is already using to water the plants, so ask to be shown all relevant water utensils they want you to use, along with any instructions for proper use.

, Unless your neighbor has given you more specific instructions, it's a good idea to check on the plants every day that your neighbor is away. Any more times than this is unnecessary unless your neighbor has made that clear.

, Not all plants take kindly to a daily watering, while others need it badly, especially when the weather is hot. For plants that need to be ""well-drained"", stick your finger into the surrounding soil. If it's moist, the plant may not need more water; if it's dry, water the plant.


Small plants should be watered for about 5-10 seconds, and tall plants should be watered for about 10-15 seconds. If the tall plants are producing food, water them for about 10-20 seconds.

, When the temperatures go up, the plant will need more water. Some plants may also need more shade; this is something it is wise to discuss with your neighbors before they leave. If you haven't discussed it, take note of wilting and browning; if this is occurring, consider shifting container plants or rigging up shade cloth over garden plants that don't seem to coping too well with long-term heat.

, To use the hose outside, gently turn it on, move the plants that are blocking the hose, and roll it out. Gently press down and water each plant. After using the hose, roll it back and move the plants back where they should be.


A sprayer is often a good way to water plants but never have it set high; always use the lowest settings.

, If pest infestations suddenly descend upon your neighbor's plants while they're away, do your best to defend the plants.


Use chairs, tables, or anything else to block the plants from preventing deer or any other animal eating the plants. If they get in one day, try to find something else to block the animals from breaking in.






Use organic pesticides, such as soap spray, to kill bugs such as aphids if there is an outbreak. Never use anything that might harm the plant; research online or ask at a garden center what you should do first.







, After each visit, leave the place exactly as you found it, even if some of it doesn't make sense to you. Turn off lights, lock doors/gates/sheds, etc. and put all the watering/gardening gear back inside a locked area. If anything happens, you should be able to tell your neighbor that things were done and left exactly the way the neighbor expected.

, Tell your neighbors how great the plants were and how much water you used. Ask them any questions about the plants and what you should do the next time they want you to come and take care of their plants.

",How to Save an Overwatered Plant," Even plants that are in full sun can be overwatered.;
, If the leaves are light green or yellowed, it is a sign of overwatering. If the new growth is brown instead of green, this is a similar sign.

, If there aren’t any drainage holes, then it is very likely that the plant is suffering from overwatering, since the excess water just sits in the pot, drowning the roots. You will need to get a new, well-drained pot to save it.

, Look for green soil, which is actually algae growing in the overabundance of water. You will need to buy new soil.

, These are signs the plant has started to die due to overwatering., An overwatered plant can’t hydrate its upper extremities. Although the plant will dry more slowly, it will keep the plant from being too stressed.

, Gently grab on the top of the soil or the plant and lift it out.

, Placing it on top of a wire mesh baking rack will allow air to dry out the roots for a while. Note if the roots are brown. Healthy roots should be white.

, Place some gravel or plant mesh at the bottom to give the plant even more room to drain.

, Throw this soil in the trash so that it isn’t used again.

, If they are starting to smell and decompose into a compost-like material, you will need to prune them away before repotting. Only prune what is definitely diseased and/or rotting.,, It will help them to get some water, without overwatering the soil.

, Put a saucer under the pot to catch excess water.

, Don’t wait so long that the soil is completely dry, or you may shock the plant. Test the surface each time before you water.

, The root system needs to be healthy to absorb these nutrients. Also, fertilizer can burn unhealthy roots., This will help give the plant more nutrients as it recovers.

Harvest the seeds.",How to Save Garden Seeds1," Choose plants early in the season. Select plants and flowers that are bright, healthy, and able to survive different conditions, including rain and heat. Choose vegetable plants that are plentiful, bright and full of flavor. Perennials and annuals are reliable for keeping their look and growth patterns from generation to generation.

, When flowers stop growing, seeds will begin to show up. Keep some fading flowers on the plants. This is called going to seed, which means they produce seed heads or seed pods. Allow the seeds to dry while they are still on the plant, if the weather is not wet.

, Gather seed pods from the flowers when the seed pods are dry and brown. Pick the pods by hand, or use clippers if stems are difficult to remove.

Make your floral arrangement.",How to Select Everlasting Flowers," Look for plants that are interesting in shape, texture or colour once dried. In addition, consider how successfully a plant will dry; it needs to retain its shape and not fall apart or disintegrate. The parts of a plant suitable for everlasting arrangements include flowers, seeds, seed pods, reeds, leaves and stems.;
, There is a variety of plants suitable to choose for everlasting flower arrangements. Examples of suitable plants include:

Queen Anne's lace







Honesty (Lunaria)







Bells of Ireland (Molucella)







Love-in-a-mist (Nigella)







Statice







Xeranthemum







Banksia







Protea







Eucalyptus leaves







Straw flowers







Hydrangea







,
If you intend to grow the plants in your own garden, choose the seeds that you need. Plant them according to the instructions.






If you do not have access to the plant seeds, or they will not grow quickly enough (for example, eucalyptus leaves, banksia etc.), seek the relevant plant elements from a florist, nursery etc. Sometimes plant and flower wholesalers might be able to help you out.







, When growing your own or when purchasing fresh flowers, cut flower stems just before flowers are fully developed. Tie the flowers in bunches and hang these upside down in a well ventilated place until dried. It is usually best to cut seed pods and seeds after they have dried on the plant stems.

, Design the arrangement on paper according to the plant elements that you have available. Follow the design when putting together your arrangement. Display when completed.

Choose a site for your organic garden.,
Consider a container garden.,
Make a compost pile.,
Add the right soil.,
Control weeds.,
Rethink your lawn.,
Invite birds, worms, and friendly insects.,
Start now.,
Watch out for toxins in planting beds next to older houses: If your house ever had lead paint, even if it has been painted over with latex/vinyl paint -- lead is in the soil.",How to Start an Organic Garden,"


Think small, especially at first. A small garden takes less work and fewer materials than a large one. A well-maintained 4' by 4' garden can furnish all of the fresh vegetables that one person will eat.
Don't over-plant. If you're growing food, think in terms of yield, and plan in terms of meals per person.
Even a window box or a few containers can be a starter garden.;
, Try growing in pots or boxes on a patio. Even growing herbs in one of your south-facing windows and garnishing your favorite dishes and soups is great fun.

If you don’t have a sunny backyard or patio, you, may be able to grow parsley, mints, garlic/green onions, or chives (require cool season temps) incredibly nutritious herbs, or even small tomatoes (need cool temps at night to set fruit and warmth in daytime to mature), using this technique.

, Compost is the main ingredient for developing rich organic soil. You can use almost any kind of organic material to make compost that will enrich your soil, but the best things to start with are usually right there in your garden: fallen leaves, weeds (preferably before they go to seed) and grass clippings, to name a few.

, The key to organic agriculture is great soil. Add as much organic material to your soil as you can. This can be from your compost heap. Soil that has been built up with plenty of organic matter is good for your garden for a lot of reasons.


It will nourish your plants without chemical fertilizers, keeping them more natural, rather than encouraging bursts of fast growth that can weaken plants.
It is easier to get shovels into, and weeds out of, enriched soil that isn't so hard packed.
It is softer, so plant roots can penetrate more easily and more deeply.
It will help water and air spend the right amount of time in contact with roots. Clay soils can be heavy and stay wet a long time. Sandy soils can drain water too quickly. Compost mitigates both conditions.

, Weeds are any plant you don't want growing in an area, and may include invasive ornamental or productive plants, such as ivy and mint.


Use a hoe and keep it sharp. You can use a grinding wheel to put an edge on it. Try a Dutch hoe or scuffle hoe if you have only used a conventional gooseneck style hoe. Hoe each area frequently enough to keep green weeds down. Regularly taking off the green portions of weeds deprives them of the nourishment they need to continue regrowing.
Hand weed to remove the roots of perennial weeds that grow back. Also hand weed carefully around established plants, to avoid uprooting the plants you want.
Plant moderately thickly, particularly for ornamental or decorative areas. Companion plantings can fill in spaces in vegetable gardens, too, and make the most of a small space. Spaces that are planted thickly enough will discourage weeds from growing between plants that you want.
Mulch un-planted areas around plants and trees 3-4"" deep where you wish to have no weeds. Organic mulches, including bark, wood chips, grass clippings, and mulch, gradually break down and enrich the soil. In the meantime, they control weeds, help to moderate soil temperatures, and slow evaporation, meaning that you can water less.
Try heat to control weeds in cracks, in the form of steam, a heat gun, boiling water, or even a small blowtorch, carefully applied. If you want space between slabs or stepping stones, try planting between them with a low, decorative plant that can withstand some foot traffic, such as thyme.

, A pristine lawn is a lot of work, and depending on your climate may require a lot of fertilizer and water to maintain. It's also a monoculture that is difficult to maintain. At the very least, consider letting clover and other plants in, and don't panic if a few weeds spring up. Consider planting something besides lawn or making your lawn smaller, especially in arid climates.

, Many creatures can help your garden. Learn which ones they are and arrange conditions to encourage them.

, Get a jump on your gardening effort at any time of year.

, Lead leaches out of weathered paint for many years, chips and peeling paint and remains in the soil for a long time. Lead base paint was the rule for hundreds of years up through the 1970s, but painted wood, shingles, trim, stucco, brick may have been covered with siding yet the danger was already in the soil. So never plant fruit, veggies, herbs, or fruit-bearing trees in the soil next to the house if known—or suspected—to have been painted with lead-based paint. The lead will be absorbed by plants, which is very dangerous."

Allow vegetables to remain on the plant until after they have ripened.,
Dry fruit and vegetable seeds in the sun after taking them out of the food.",How to Save Garden Seeds2," Vegetables that are overripe will be easy to pull off the plant, and the seeds inside will be easy to access. Take the seeds from the vegetables or fruits by scooping them out of the center.;
, This will prevent rot and mold. Let them sit on a dry, warm surface until they are no longer moist to the touch. Or, place them in a ventilated, dry container or box to remove moisture.

Determine the size and amounts of plant stake you need.,
Strike the stake about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) away from the plant's stem into the ground by using a hammer or mallet.,
Secure the stake to the plant with non-wired plant ties, nylon stockings, or strong wool.,
Check on your plants regularly, and apply additional ties when the plans grow.",How to Stake a Plant," If you have a fast-growing plant, you may need to re-stake them every few months. Consider how large the plant will be in a year, and stake accordingly. The stake should be about 12 inches (30.5 cm) higher than the plant. Additionally, if your plant is in an area that doesn't suffer from strong winds, you may be able to use 1 to 2 stakes. For gustier winds, plan for at least 3 stakes.


If you're using wooden stakes, make sure the wood is left untreated. Stains or paints on the wood may contain chemicals that can leach into the soil.
Reusable garden stakes are a long-lasting option and fold easily for winter storage. Ideal for vegetable plants, these stakes might come in L shapes and hook closely together to make whatever size you desire.;
, Place the stake at an angle to offer additional support to the plant.

, You should use a figure-8 loop to allow the plant to move without scratching or rubbing the stem. You can use the same method for more than 1 stake.

, Add the ties about 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) apart. Make sure you secure the tie to the stake and not the plant. All of the branches may be gathered at a single stake near the plant's center to provide additional support.

Remove any visible fertilizer.,
Leach the soil with water.,
Remove damaged leaves.,
Stop fertilizing your plant.,
Re-pot your plant if necessary.,
Switch to low-nitrogen fertilizer.",How to Revive an Overfertilized Plant," If the fertilizer is a powder, and you can see it on the plant or topsoil, removing it will help prevent your plant from further overfeeding. Additionally, if the fertilizer salts have created a crust (typically white), that must also be removed.;
, This will move the fertilizer further away from the plant's root system, further helping to prevent additional over-fertilization, and permitting the plant's roots to begin to heal.


Revive over-fertilized plants in your garden. Flood the soil around the root system before allowing the water to continue to drip at the plant's base for 30 minutes.
Rescue over-fed plants in a pot. Fill the pot with water, and allow it to drain out the bottom. Repeat this step 4 times in order to make sure all the fertilizer is washed, or leached, away from the plant's roots.

, Using a pair of scissors, cut off the leaves that look burned (this means they have brown spots on them). Also, remove any wilting leaves, or leaves that have an incorrect shape. Even if you can rescue an overfed plant, those leaves already damaged cannot be revived. Removing them is important to ensuring the plant's future health. If they are permitted to remain, your plant may become a victim of pests and other maladies.

, If your plant has been overfed, do not provide it more fertilizer until it appears healthy again (3 to 4 weeks). Allow time for your plant and its roots to recover from the strain of an overabundance of fertilizer.

, If the plant was severely overfed, transferring it to new, fresh soil after the leaching process is complete will provide your plant and its roots many opportunities to heal.

, When the time comes to begin feeding your plant again, you can prevent the negative effects of over-fertilization by using fertilizer devoid of nitrogen.

Choose a healthy 6-inch sucker.,
Shear the sucker.,
Place the sucker in a jar filled with warm water.,
Transplant the tomato sucker after about one to two weeks.",How to Root Tomato Suckers1," These are the best sized tomato suckers for rooting. You can usually find them growing between a main production stem and a leaf. Make sure they’re healthy and visually free from disease. Ideally, it shouldn’t be flowering., Place a pair of shears at the base of the sucker, right where it meets the main stem. Clip quickly and firmly to cut it cleanly.


After shearing, you can scrape the sides of the stem with a knife. Some gardeners believe this might make the roots grow more quickly, but it isn’t necessary.
Make sure you’re using clean shears. That way you’ll avoid spreading disease between your plants.
Shear off the sucker’s lower leaves., Being transplanted to a water jar is a big shock for a plant, and it may wilt for the first few days. Make sure to keep it out of direct sunlight initially, so that it has time to recover. After this period, you can place it in a sunny spot, like a windowsill. Don’t leave the cutting outside; it needs protection from the elements.


Change the water every few days, always using warm water., This should be sufficient time for new roots to have sprouted. Looking through the jar will allow you to keep track of the sprouting roots. When you see about an inch (2.5cm) of roots you can transplant the tomato sucker to your garden. Otherwise, let the plant root for a few more days, checking it occasionally.If you want to transplant the tomato sucker to a larger pot instead of your garden, make sure it’s opaque. Direct sunlight can kill roots over time."

Shear a 6 inch sucker.,
Plant your tomato cutting in a transparent cup filled with soil.,
Water the soil thoroughly.,
Place a plastic baggie over the plant.,
Transplant the tomato sucker after about a week.",How to Root Tomato Suckers2," This is the ideal length for rooting a new tomato plant. You can find healthy suckers of this size between a main production stem and a leaf.Place the shears at the base of the sucker, against the main stem. Cut it cleanly and firmly, then use a knife to cut the bottom of the sucker at a 45 degree angle.


If you want to give the sucker some extra rooting help, you can scrape the sides of the stem with a knife.
Make sure you’re using clean shears. That way you’ll avoid spreading disease between your plants., Eight ounce (237ml) cups are the perfect size for this. Transparent cups will allow you to see the roots once they sprout, so you can more accurately gauge their progress. You can use any garden soil for this step, though regular soil from your lawn may not be the best choice.Poke holes in the bottom of the cup. This will allow water to drain from the cup, and air will flow more freely, promoting the growth of healthy roots.You should place the transparent cup on a windowsill. This will give it enough light to grow without shocking the roots with too much sunlight.

, Because a rootless cutting doesn’t draw water from soil as effectively, it’s important to provide it with an abundance of water. You want the soil to be so moist that water will drip from the holes at the bottom of the cup.


You should place your cup on a surface that won’t be damaged by dripping water., It should be large enough to cover the plant with plenty of free space; you should leave about four inches (10cm) of clearance between the sucker’s leaves and the top of the plastic bag. Leave it unsealed.


The baggie will retain the moisture released by the plant’s leaves, which the plant will then reabsorb. This will help it stay alive as it roots.
Don’t be alarmed if the plant looks to be wilting in the first couple of days. It will recover., This should be sufficient time for new roots to have sprouted. Simply look through the side of the translucent cup to check for roots. If you see roots, transplant the tomato sucker to your garden. Otherwise, let the plant root for a few more days, checking for roots occasionally.


If you want to transplant the tomato sucker to a larger pot, make sure it’s opaque. Direct sunlight can kill roots."

Cut fresh flowers in the spring.,
Nip off the long stems.,
Thin the lilac.,
Don't prune later in the summer or fall.,
Take an assessment of your lilac.,
Determine if your lilac was grafted.,
Use clippers to trim the plant close to the ground.,
Cut back the suckers.",How to Prune Lilacs," When lilac flowers reach their peak and are just this side of fading out, cutting them to create indoor bouquets actually helps the plant. Left on their stems, the flowers will die but continue sapping energy that could be spent on new growth. So don't feel guilty or wasteful when you go outside with your hand trimmers to take off the prettiest flowers - you're doing just the right thing for your lilac bush or tree.


Another term for this type of pruning is deadheading. In addition to pruning flowers just past their peak, prune those that are already dying.
Make the cut just at the base of the flowers.;
, Take a look at your lilac bush or tree and assess whether there are any extra-long but healthy-looking stems that need to be cut back. Doing so will help the lilac keep its pretty shape. The process of cutting back the stems a bit is called tipping off. Use a hand clipper to cut longer stems back to the next closest pair of side shoots.


This means you'll be trimming the stem back beyond the flowered part, and all the way down to where side shoots are growing off.
If A long stem doesn't have side shoots closer to the base, trim it back to the closest node or bud, where new shoots will sprout.
Tipping encourages lilacs to sprout new healthy, bushy growth near the cut.

, Search for dead or diseased stems. If you see any limp, brown or diseased stems in your lilac bush or tree, cut them out close to the base. This process is called thinning, and it helps the plant by allowing fresh air to circulate through the plant and removing dying foliage that sap its energy.

, This annual pruning should take place in early-to-late spring (May or June). Such pruning will encourage the development of new buds, which will continue maturing over the year before they bloom the following spring. However, if you prune too late in the summer, you risk cutting away some of this new growth - hence causing next spring's bloom to fall short.


If you prune in the fall or winter, your lilac may not produce flowers at all.

, If it's old, overgrown, or unshapely, giving it a rejuvenating pruning will help restore it to a healthier and more attractive state. This type of pruning goes beyond a lighter annual pruning to severely cut the bush or tree back, allowing for new growth to occur.Do your assessment in early spring, before the lilac has come back to life. This is the best time of year for a deeper pruning.
Keep in mind that doing a rejuvenating pruning will mean losing the maturing buds that would otherwise turn into this spring's flowers. Though you might sacrifice this year's blossoms, you'll be rewarded in the following seasons with better growth and flowers.

, Some lilacs are grafted with other varieties in order to produce a particular flower shape or color. Grafted plants need to be pruned with a bit more care, since cutting below the grafted area will disturb the graft and change the way your plant grows. Look for an area on one of the lilac's main trunks where there's a noticeable difference in bark near a lump. This is probably the graft. If you see no such thing, the plant likely hasn't been grafted, so there's no need to look out when you make cuts.

, If the trunks are very thick, you may need a saw. Cut each branch back by 1/3 to 1/2. The lilac will grow back, but it'll take a season or two.


If you discovered that your plant was grafted, be sure not to cut below the graft.

, Suckers are baby trunks growing out from the original plant, or sprouting from the ground close by. Cut these back all the way to the base of the trunk or the ground to prevent them from getting any bigger. Suckers take away energy from the rest of the plant. A healthy lilac bush or tree should have no more than 2 or 3 large trunks."

Replant your lily after the heavy frosts and rainfalls of winter are over.,
Make sure your bulbs were not damaged during the winter before replanting them.,
Cut away any ‘dead heads’ while the flower blooms after being replanted.,
Remove the bulb in late fall to store it over winter again.,
Store the bulb in a brown bag during the winter and then repeat the replanting process in the spring.",How to Replant a Stargazer Lily Outside1," If you've moved your Stargazer lily indoors to protect it over the winter months, you should think about replanting it outside once the frosts and heavy rainfall are over. This is likely to be in mid-spring.


Try to prepare the ground well ahead of time by applying plenty of organic matter (such as manure) to the soil in order to improve drainage.
You should start doing this over the winter, well before you replant your Stargazer lilies in the spring. If you apply fresh manure too close to planting there’s always a risk of ‘scorching’ the plant tissue, so avoid this if possible.;
, Check your overwintered bulbs carefully for any signs of rot or damage. Plant them in a hole around 5 inches (12.7 cm) deep and at least twice the width of your bulb.


Cover the bulbs with soil, water well and apply a layer of mulch to a depth of about 2 inches (5.1 cm).
Stargazer lilies should be spaced about 10 inches (25.4 cm) apart.

, As your plant flowers in the growing season, pinch away the dead flower heads to prevent seed production.


This helps the plant to store energy that will keep it alive over the winter and allow it to be successfully replanted the following year.
Be sure to let the foliage and flower stems die back naturally without cutting them, as this also helps the plant to preserve energy.

, In late fall you can cut back the brown foliage and stem to about 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the bulb. Lift the bulbs without damaging them and try to keep as much of the root intact as possible. Wash the bulb off under lukewarm water.


It’s also a good idea to apply a fungicidal powder (available at any garden supply store). Apply the fungicidal powder according the the instructions on the packaging.

, Place the roots in a paper bag with some light, soil-less potting mix, ideally one with lots of perilite, as this helps the air circulate.


Overwinter the bags in a cool dry place such as a shed or cellar. This method of overwintering should give your plants the best chance of getting re-established the following year.

Prune your buddleia in early spring.,
Prune severely.,
Remove older branches.,
Prune dead flowers after the blooming season finishes.",How to Prune Buddleia1," When you prune your buddleia matters greatly in terms of care. You should always prune your plant in early spring. Usually, March is the recommended time for pruning.However, when to prune truly depends on your region. Severe frost, present in late spring in some areas, can cause damage to a buddleia.Making a decision on when to prune your buddleia heavily depends on the weather in your area. As stated above, if you prune too soon early spring frost can harm the plant. However, waiting until later in the summer, or even the fall, can be deadly for the buddleia. If new growths do not harden before winter, they will be killed by the cold. This results in a dead plant the next spring.Keep an eye on the forecast, especially if you live in a colder area or an area with unpredictable weather patterns. If you see freezing temperatures or snow in your 10 day forecast, hold off on pruning. Wait until the weather's been consistently warm and above freezing for a few weeks before pruning.;
, Buddleias bloom on new wood. Even if there is no sign of rot or damage to existing branches, cut branches back to the ground in early spring. This will stimulate blooming and growth from your buddleia during the flowering season.Buddleias grow in bunches of stems sprouting from the same patch of ground. You prune the plant by cutting these stems downward towards the ground.
Stems should be at least a foot tall. Stop pruning once your stems are about a foot in length. Trimming any shorter could cause damage to the plant.When you finish pruning your buddleia, it should look somewhat like a stag's antlers. Don't be alarmed by how much you cut from the plant. Such intense pruning is what helps the buddleia grow new flowers when the rainy season passes.

, Buddleias can become overcrowded if too many branches sprout. If your buddleia bush looks crowded, remove older branches completely rather than just trimming them down.It's fairly easy to differentiate old stems from young stems. Young stems tend to be green. Old stems are of a darker shade and usually have peeling, gray-brown bark.You should dig out old branches by the roots. This will prevent them from re-blooming in the coming season., While the main pruning should be done in spring, wait until the buddleia appears to be done flowering. You should prune again once all flowers have bloomed. Clip any dead or faded flowers from the plant to keep it looking healthy and strong.The buddleia flowers in multiple places. Both main stems and side shoots that grow from main stems may flower. When seeking out dead flowers, look in all these places.Watch to make sure all potential flowers have bloomed before pruning again. You should not prune flowers, even dead ones, until the buddleia is completely done blooming.

Help your plant to survive cold winters.",How to Replant a Stargazer Lily Outside2," If your Stargazer lily has been an indoor plant up to this point, you can still move it outdoors and expect it to thrive. Choose a sunny spot if possible, although these lilies will tolerate a patch of garden that is in shade for part of the day.

, Stargazers aren't too fussy about the soil type but they prefer a well-drained soil. If your garden soil retains puddles easily, you may like to incorporate some compost or organic matter such as well-rotted manure into the ground to improve the drainage. The further ahead of planting you can do this, the better.

, It’s best to transplant an indoor Stargazer to the outdoors in the springtime, however you can do this at any time in the growing season from spring to late autumn.

, Remove the plant from its container being careful not to damage the roots or bulb. Make a hole around 5 inches (12.7 cm) deep and at least twice the width of your bulb.


If you’re planting more than one Stargazer lily, they should be spaced about 10 inches (25.4 cm) apart. Place the plant in the hole and cover the bulbs with soil.
Water well and apply a layer of mulch (grass clippings, straw or bark chips work well).

, If you’re in a climate which experiences cold, wet winters you might want to protect your Stargazer lily over the winter months by mulching, cloche protection or moving it back indoors over the winter.


If you choose to move your plant indoors for the winter, you may find Method 1 helpful when it comes time to replant your stargazer lily.

Replant your lily.,
Be aware that your lily may ‘protest’ the location change.",How to Replant a Stargazer Lily Outside3," If you need to move your Stargazer lily, try to do so in the late fall after the growing season ends, or in the springtime.


It’s always a good idea to prepare a new planting site well ahead of time, so dig plenty of organic matter into the ground a few months in advance if you can do so.
Well-rotted manure or spent mushroom compost works well.

, Dig up the plants from their old location carefully. This means using a garden spade to cut the soil a good distance from the plant so as not to damage the plant and bulb.


You may find older plants have divided themselves and are now clumps of bulbs rather than singles.
If that’s the case, separate groups of bulbs and replant them individually in the new location.

, In the new location, make a hole around 5 inches (12.7 cm) deep and at least twice the width of your bulb. Cover the bulbs with soil, water well and apply a layer of mulch to a depth of about 2 inches (5.1 cm).


Stargazer lilies should be spaced about 10 inches (25.4 cm) apart. They’ll appreciate being watered when the soil is dry, at least until they are well-established.
Stargazer lilies will thrive if fed regularly during their lifetime.

, Sometimes a lily will protest against a move by not flowering that year. Don't worry too much though - it should flower again the following year.

Spread mulch in early spring.,
Plant new buddleias 5 to 10 feet away from existing plants.,
Water appropriately.",How to Prune Buddleia2," If you live in a colder region, you may have to work harder to control weeds and keep your plant healthy. Spread mulch or compost around the stump of your buddleia plant, as this will help it retain moisture and fight off unwanted weeds. Spread about 6 inches of mulch or compost along the stumps of the plant., You may decide you want to plant more buddleias. You should keep the new plants 5 to 10 feet away from existing plants to make sure all your plants have adequate space to grow.Buddleias may expand as they grow, branching out new stems. Therefore, it's vital you make sure the plants have the space necessary to thrive.

, Buddleias need to be watered. The amount of water they need depends on the season. Young buddleias that are still growing should be watered thoroughly.


Buddleias do tolerate drought well. However, dry soil can be a problem for the plants. Therefore, regular watering is important in dry months.Water the soil around the buddleia thoroughly so the soil is moist without being over-saturated. Before a buddleia blooms, it will need more watering.Water the buddleia at least once a week before it blooms. You may want to water twice a week or more if you live in an area experiencing a drought or very hot temperatures.Once a buddleia is full grown, it requires less watering.However, check the soil surrounding the plant regularly to make sure it's damp. If it feels dry, water the soil until it moistens slightly.

Bring potted plants indoors.,
Apply a layer of mulch.,
Cover your plants.,
Build a cold frame or greenhouse.,
Water your plants.,
Supply a heat source.,
Choose plants that are suited to your climate.",How to Protect Plants from the Cold," The first and easiest solution to the cold is to simply remove your plants from the low temperatures. If you have any potted plants or hanging baskets outdoors, bring them inside your home. Even a move to the garage or a sun room will be beneficial, as this will still increase the temperature by at least +10ºF (+5.5ºC). If you’re able to, the best solution is to place your plants around the interior of your home as decoration. They’ll get the heat they need without cluttering your extra space.


Place potted plants near windows as per their sun requirements; east and west facing windows get the most light, while north and south windows get a bit less.
Avoid putting potted plants near vents, as this can dry them out and cause them to begin dying off.
Placing plants too near to a window can be damaging if it is extremely cold outside; freezing temperatures can transfer from the window to your plant if they are touching.;
, Mulch acts as an insulator, holding in heat and moisture in the soil. It is used to protect the root systems of your plants from cold temperatures. Sometimes the cold temperature is not what damages the plant, but rather the freeze/thaw cycle affecting the soil and causing it to ""heave"" the plant. Similarly, the cold soil can prevent water from easily being drawn up from the plant. Regardless of the reason, applying a layer 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) thick of mulch will help prevent these problems.


Mulch made of wheat or pine straw works well, as it is easy to remove once you’re read to bare the soil again, and it traps heat well.
Certain plants, such as roses and strawberries, may be overwintered by covering them completely with a clean mulch.
Insulation works both ways. It can prevent the soil from cooling off too quickly, but it can also prevent it from warming up promptly when the time comes. You may wish to rake it back away from the plants as spring starts to warm up., Throw an old blanket, drop cloth, or tarp over tender plants. If you need to protect your plants from a small number of especially cold nights, a simple shelter such as an old blanket may be enough. Choose your covering, and then carefully spread it out so that it is not touching any of the leaves or branches of your plant. You may need to use a few stakes to prop it up, otherwise it can damage the plant. This method works best to protect from frost rather than cold temperatures, as the covering won’t increase the temperature too much.


Take it off during the day so that the plants can get light and air.
You may need to weigh or tie down the cloth so that it doesn't blow away.

, Build a simple, temporary cold frame by bending slender metal rods into loops and sticking the ends into the ground across a garden row. Then, place a length of row cover fabric over the loops so that it encloses the plant. This will trap heat and block out frost, and is the best solution for keeping your plants safe and warm in the winter. On the flip side, it does require a bit of construction and is not the most attractive solution.


Build a somewhat more permanent cold frame by hinging a window or storm window to one side of an open-bottomed box built from scrap lumber.

Make sure the plants in your greenhouse or cold frame receive adequate ventilation. Think about how warm the inside of your car gets on a sunny day. If daytime temperatures are warm, open up to allow air to circulate. If you don't, you could overheat your plants or build up too much moisture inside.

, Heavily water the soil around your plants prior to a very cold night or freeze. The soil will trap the heat better wet than when it is dry, and evaporate slowly which warms the air around the plants. Don't do this if you expect a hard freeze though, since it could backfire, but to protect against a little frost, a generous watering can help to retain some of the day's heat into the night.


Don’t water soil that is frozen, as this won’t help and can actually make conditions for the plants more difficult.
Don’t heavily water the soil around succulents, as they can’t tolerate the moisture levels., If you’re undergoing a bout of extremely cold weather that your plants won’t be able to survive, you can help them out by giving them a heat source. If you have a relatively large area to protect, you may be able to build a makeshift greenhouse (as described above) large enough to include a space heater. Stick to small space heaters specifically designed for greenhouses or outdoor use, and never place the heat source in direct contact with your plants or flammable material (such as a fabric cover).


Use outdoor-safe extension cords and materials to avoid a dangerous situation.
Uncover your plants and turn of the heat source during the day to allow ventilation and prevent overheating. Follow safety instructions in the heater manual if there is one, and check on it frequently at first to make sure no nearby objects are getting dangerously hot.

, This is the simplest, lowest-effort choice. Learn your which growing zone you are in (if your country has such a classification system; the US system is coordinated by the USDA) or at least your likely low and high temperatures for the year and choose plants that can withstand those temperatures. Some plants may die back, lose their leaves, or otherwise go dormant in winter, so take the time to know how plants that are well adapted to your climate handle it. The disadvantage to this approach, of course, is that it limits your selection of plants.


Annuals are plants that die back each year and must be replanted if they do not reseed themselves. In colder climates, some perennial plants may be grown as annuals if they would otherwise not survive the winter. The growing season of some annuals may be extended with shelters or by starting the plants indoors or in a greenhouse.
Perennials are plants that continue growing from one year to the next. For these, you will need to learn what, if any, additional care they require to survive the winter.
Talk to the people at your favorite nursery about what to expect from a plant during winters in your area. Also ask where to plant and how to care for a plant before you purchase it.
Look for varieties and cultivars of plants suited to your climate. There are some varieties that are bred hardier than others, making them better options for cold environments."

Follow your local weather forecasts.,
Pack mulch around your bedding plants to retain heat and moisture.,
Water your bedding plants before it becomes dark outside.,
Use a soil thermometer to check the temperature of the ground.,
Cover your bedding plants when the soil temperature is below freezing.,
Remove the covers from your bedding plants after all frost has thawed.",How to Protect Bedding Plants from Frost," This procedure will help you determine if you need to protect your bedding plants from frost at any given time, especially during seasonal and temperature changes.;
, Mulch may prevent the ground surrounding your bedding plants from freezing.


Mulch can be used in the form of straw, loose tree leaves, tree bark, or pine needles.







, The wet soil will raise the humidity levels in the area surrounding your plants and help them retain heat.


You may want to water your bedding plants up to 1 or 2 days before freezing conditions are expected. If you water your plants during freezing temperatures, they may freeze immediately.







, This will help you determine if the ground is cold enough to cause your bedding plants to freeze.


Purchase a soil thermometer from any retail store that specializes in gardening products.






Insert the soil thermometer into the ground between 4 and 6 inches (10.16 and 15.24 cm) to determine its temperature. Refer to the instructions provided by the soil thermometer's manufacturer to make sure it has been inserted properly for an accurate reading.







, Freezing temperatures are below 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius).


You may also want to cover your bedding plants if the temperature is slightly above freezing levels in the event the temperature continues to drop overnight.






Place layers of horticultural fleece over your bedding plants. Horticultural fleece is insulating material that will keep your plants warm during frost conditions but still expose them to air, rain, and light.






Alternative forms of bedding plant covers are plastic tarps, newspapers, cardboard, bed linens, or similar types of light materials.






Use heavy objects such as stones or jars to weigh down the sides of the protective covering.







, This procedure will expose your plants to fresh air and prevent your plants from overheating in the sun.

Find a friend or garden with a Mother-of-Thousands plant.,
Pick some plantlets.,
Store the plantlets in a plastic bag.,
Fill a shallow bowl with potting soil.,
Place the plantlets gently on the surface of the soil, approximately three quarters of an inch (2 centimeters) to one inch (2.5 centimeters) apart.,
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.,
Take the plantlets to a sunny place.,
Keep the soil moist, not wet.,
Wait, monitor and observe.,
Remove the plastic wrap from the bowl when the plants are too tall for it.,
Replant to more appropriate pots or bowls when the plantlets have grown significant roots.,
Enjoy your newly-propagated Mother-of-Thousands!

,
Prepare for the plant to die after it flowers.",How to Propagate Mother of Thousands from Plantlets," You do not need to own a Mother-of-Thousands plant, but you need access to one with plantlets.;
, As Mother-of-Thousands grows, small plantlets, similar to buds, grow along the ridges of plant leaves. Take more than one, because the plantlets can easily die. Do not worry about harming the plant itself by taking the plantlets. They all fall off anyway, and the Mother-of-Thousands will have more energy to grow when it does not have to support the plantlets anymore.

, Keep them in the bag until you can transplant the plantlets. Don't let them dry up, or they will die.

, It does not need to be deep. The roots will not be very deep at first, so a large bowl is not necessary.

, They do not need to be pushed into the soil. Mother-of-Thousands naturally propagates by dropping its plantlets.

, This will help keep moisture in, as well as working as a makeshift greenhouse.

, Windowsills work wonders, but remember that the more sun the plantlets get, the more attention you will need to give them.

, Mother-of-Thousands is a succulent, which means it does not need much water. It does need moisture to stimulate the growth of roots, though.

, Stimulated by the moisture and the soil, the plant grows roots via mitosis of meristematic-type tissue in notches in the leaves. You may start to see small, thin, white roots sprout from the base of the plantlets. Make sure you keep an eye on the moisture and height of the plantlets.

, They are now ready to stretch for the sun!

, You can test the plant lets by gently lifting them. Be careful when doing this; you can damage the small roots if are too rough.

,, Unfortunately, some species of Mother-of-Thousands, and their lookalikes can die after blooming small purple-pink flowers late in life. Not all plants will develop these flowers, it happens very sporadically if at all. Their life-span can be extended in preparation for the appearance of flowers by simply watering it less once it grows to about 1 foot (0.3 m) to 1.5 feet (0.5 m). Be careful not to let it get dehydrated, there is a fine line between too much and too little water. If it does look like its life is about to end, simply take a couple of its plantlets and grow a new plant or two.

Select a stalk for propagating.,
Trim the leaves from the shoot.,
Cut the shoot off of the stalk.,
Prepare a pot for rooting the new shoot.,
Place the cutting into the pot.",How to Propagate Lucky Bamboo," The stalk of the lucky bamboo plant is the thick, cylindrical base from which the smaller, leafy shoots grow. Select a stalk with at least 1 long, healthy shoot to take your cutting.;
, Once you have selected a shoot to cut, remove all of the smaller leaves by plucking them off with your fingers. Leave only the few long, mature leaves at the top of the shoot. Removing the leaves keeps the plant's energy focused on growing new roots rather than supporting the leaves.

, Use a very sharp knife or a pair of scissors to cut cleanly through the shoot about a half an inch (1 cm) away from where it meets the stalk. The cleaner and straighter the cut, the less likely it will be to succumb to a bacterial infection. It is a good idea to sanitize your blade in rubbing alcohol before making the cut.

If you want to save the stalk from which you took your cutting, you will need to cut it as well. Cut the stalk about a half an inch (1 cm) below the area where the cut shoot joined it. Garden shears will make cutting through big, woody stalks easier.






Once the stalk is cut, you need to seal the wound with wax to prevent bacterial infection. Melt some candle wax onto the wound until it is completely covered. When placed back in water or soil, the stalk will grow new shoots in a month or so.







, Lucky bamboo cuttings can be rooted in water or soil, but water works best for stimulating root growth. Prepare a small pot by filling it with purified water (bottled water works well). If you use tap water, it is best to let the water sit out exposed to the air for 24 hours before using it - this keeps the chlorine from damaging the plant.

, Place the freshly cut end of the shoot into the water, making sure it is submerged at least 1 inch (2.5 cm). Place the pot into a shady spot, as direct sunlight will harm the plant. In 1 or 2 months, the plant should have developed several roots from the cut end. The shoot will eventually grow new shoots and can be propagated again using the same method.

Use the pieces of cane that have a bud beginning to develop on it. Cane cutting propagation depends on utilizing canes that have buds on them. The buds will grow into new shoots.
Discard the stalks that don't have buds on them. When you create new plants, you only want to use the canes that will be able to develop new growth.

, When reproducing plants with cane cuttings, you want to provide a healthy soil for the canes to grow in.


Pile the soil into the pot to approximately 1/2 an inch (1.27 cm) from the lip of the container.

Prepare the soil.,
Plant seeds.,
Water your plants every other day.,
Watch your beautiful garden grow!

",How to Plant Your First Garden," Seeds are very inexpensive at your local dollar market. Alternately, you can start with bedding plants (or seedlings).;
, Ideally, some parts of it should get full sun (6 hours of continuous sunshine per day), and some parts should get partial sun (either dappled sun, or full sun for less than 6 hours per day). Even if parts of your garden are in total shade, there are a variety of plants (including foliage plants and even flowers) that can flourish.

, There are at least two ways to do this.


Dig and churn up all of the packed dirt about 2 feet (0.6 m) down. Add compost and mix it into your dirt. This can be very exhausting work and often requires the use of power equipment. It is often ineffective, especially if you live in a new suburban area where they likely took all the good topsoil away before they started constructing the homes.






Build a box and fill it with good soil.







, Read the instructions on the back of the seed package, or on the plastic tag in your plant pot. You may have to ask experts when to plant them if it does not say on the back. Plant bedding plants when you are sure you can. Some seeds (such as tomatoes) should be started indoors, in small pots or seed trays, before the last frost, and only transplanted outdoors when the weather warms up.

, Don't drown them in water.

Plant zinnia seeds a quarter inch (.6 centimeter) deep.,
Give them adequate space to grow.,
Thin your zinnias when they reach three inches.,
Water your zinnias lightly.,
Fertilize your zinnias every other week.,
Minimize the risk of mildew.",How to Plant Zinnias," You can look local frost dates up online. Frost dates are the dates where frost can be expected overnight or in the morning. The Farmer's Almanac online can help you find your frost date by entering your zip code.It's important to plant zinnias after the last frost date. Zinnia seeds will not survive if they're exposed to frost.It's a good idea to wait a few days or a few weeks after the last predicted frost date. Weather is unpredictable and there's always a chance the forecast could be wrong.;
, Zinnias require a lot of sun to thrive. When planting zinnias, choose an area where they get full exposure to sun. Avoid areas with any shade that could block out the warmth from the sun., A simple testing kit, which you can buy online or at a local greenhouse, will allow you to test your soil's pH level. For zinnias, the soil's pH should be between 5.5 and 7.5If your soil's pH is out of range, adjust the soil as necessary.

Tests vary in terms of use. Usually, you insert the test in the soil for a set period of time, sort of like using a thermometer, and then check the test to see the pH.

, If your pH is too high or too low, you can take measures to adjust soil pH. Adding organic materials to your soil, which you can purchase online or at a greenhouse, can later your soil's pH.Limestone is your best option to raise pH levels. Limestone should be added to the top seven inches of your soil.
To lower pH levels, opt for acidic materials such as pine needles and peat moss. If you need to lower your soil's pH fast, opt for sulfur.

, Zinnias actually thrive with less water. In the event your soil gets moist, pour a small amount of sand into the ground prior to planting to get the soil relatively firm and water-free.For example, if you planned to plant and there was an unexpected rainfall, some sand can be used to improve conditions.
However, in the event of a very heavy rainfall, you may want to wait a few days to plant. The soil will be very wet and adding sand may not be enough to dry it out.

, Use your fingers to make small holes in the ground. The holes should be about a quarter of an inch (.6 centimeter) deep for the zinnias to grow safely., Proper spacing is important as overcrowded zinnias may not grow. Small varieties of zinnias should be placed four inches (about 10 centimeters) apart. Larger varieties should be placed two feet (about .6 meter) apart.It's a good idea to bring a measuring tape to ensure proper spacing rather than estimating on your own.

, Zinnias do not require a lot of trimming early on. However, when they reach three inches (about 8 centimeters), their leaves may be growing to the point they're touching and overlapping. At this point, use garden shears to trim any leaves and thin the plants so they're about six to 18 inches (about 15 to 46 centimeters) apart., Before they begin to grow, water your zinnias daily. After they've become established, however, zinnias do not need a lot of watering. You can get by watering your zinnias once every three days., Purchase a water soluble fertilizer online or from a local greenhouse. Work the fertilizer into the ground surrounding the zinnias every other week to promote growth.Review your fertilizer's package for precise instructions on use. The package should indicate how much fertilizer should be used depending on the size of your garden.

, Zinnias are not susceptible to a lot of pests, but may become infected with mildew. Take measures to protect your zinnias from mildew. To prevent mildew, do not overwater zinnias. When you do water zinnias, water them at soil level. Make sure to trim your zinnias regularly to prevent overcrowding."

Prune cane-growing shrubs after they have flowered.,
Use the correct tools.,
Dip the pruning tools in disinfectant to prevent contamination.,
Prune the branches above the nearest bud, in a sloping fashion.,
Wipe down the tools after each cut.,
Dispose of the cut plant material.,
Oil your tools before putting them back into storage.",How to Prune Cane Growing Shrubs1," In general, you should try to prune cane-growing shrubs after they have flowered. This does vary somewhat from plant to plant and gardeners should investigate the needs of their specific cane-growing shrub before pruning it.


However, damaged or vandalized plants may be trimmed at any time of the year.





;
, You will need hand shears or clippers, long handled loppers, and possibly pruning saws or wood rasps to help make the necessary adjustments to your garden shrubs.

, Dipping the tools in a disinfectant solution before using them helps to prevent any lingering contaminants from being transmitted to the shrubs in question.


A mixture of 9 parts water to 1 part bleach or rubbing alcohol is recommended. Most disinfectants will eventually corrode tools, so try to oil garden implements after disinfecting or using them because this will help keep them from rusting.







, Always use sharp, bypass hand pruners to cut canes and branches that are 1/2-inch thick or smaller. Sharp loppers should be used if the canes are thicker than ½ inch. Dull pruners and loppers will crush the canes and stems rather than giving a nice, clean cut.Make the pruning cuts ¼ inch above a new growth bud. On most cane-growing shrubs, new growth buds are located at an indentation or line that circles the cane, though this is not always the case. They are raised, usually triangular shaped patches of plant.
Make the cut at an angle facing away from the bud. Do not make the angle too drastic or cut too close to the bud as both of these actions can permanently damage bud growth.

, When removing dead or ailing branches, it is best to wipe down the tools after every cut is made in order to prevent the spread of diseases. Likewise, once one is finished pruning out the contaminated plant parts, they should wipe down the implements used before moving on to other portions of the shrub.

, Once they are done with their pruning, gardeners should cart away all the leftover plant material. Parts that are not diseased can be chopped up and added to the compost bin. Other pieces should be bagged and left for the local waste removal companies to pick up. Diseased parts can also be burned.

, Gardeners who have not already oiled their gardening implements should do so before putting them back into storage. Consider keeping your tools in a place where they are easily found for later use.

Weed as needed.,
Protect your crop from pests.",How to Plant Wheat," About 1,000 square feet will yield one bushel, or 60 lbs (30 kg), of grain. That’s about the space of a backyard. You'll need to figure out how much wheat you want to grow and how much space it will take., Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested in early spring. It also tends to be the preferred variety since it is more nutritious and competes with fewer weeds in the spring. Spring wheat is planted in the spring and harvested in the fall. It is the more common variety in areas that have colder winters., Your wheat should get plenty of sun while it grows, so make sure you plant it in full sun. The area where you plant should get about eight hours of sun a day. This is true whether you plant winter or spring wheat. Don't plan on planting your crop anywhere where there's too much shade., Prepare to plant winter wheat in the fall, approximately 6 to 8 weeks before the soil freezes, as this allows for strong root growth. Spring wheat can be planted as early as you can work the soil. Wheat grows best in 70 to 75 degree Fahrenheit ((21 to 24 degrees Celsius) weather, so you should plant your wheat when the weather is approaching that temperature (and eventually rising)., You should till your soil to a depth of 6 inches (15 cm). You can use a rake, rototiller, or shovel to prepare the soil, although a rototiller or rake is probably best if you're covering a large area. The ground needs to be as close to even as possible once you're finished, so you might need to run a rake over the top of the soil to even it out.







, If your soil is overly dry (it will be a light brown color) or somewhat rocky, you might need a layer of compost. This provides the soil with extra nutrients and can help the wheat grow better. Soil that is a rich brown color and moist to the touch doesn't need any extra compost. 







, You can use your hand, but an actual seed spreader is best, because it gives you more even coverage. You should spread the seeds so that you have approximately one seed per 1 square inch (2.5 square centimeters) of space. The package of seeds should tell you how many pounds of seed you should use per 1,000 square feet of planting area, to give you a better idea of how much seed you need for large areas., Once you’ve spread the seeds, they need to get worked into the soil. Using a metal rake, gently rake over the seeds so they get worked into the soil. Make sure you rake evenly so your crop doesn't come up in clumps.







, This prevents the seed from drying out in the sun and from birds feeding on it. Cover spring wheat without about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) of soil. Winter wheat should be 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) deep. The seed should never be covered by more than 3 inches (7.6 cm) of soil.








, You should soak the area that’s planted right away. Keep the entire planting area moist until the wheat begins to grow. Cooler weather and more rain means less watering on your part.







, If your planting area goes through a dry spell - no rain for a week or so - you'll need to water the planting area. This will probably be more necessary if you're planting winter wheat than if you plant spring wheat.







, Wheat grows very close together, so you might not need to weed regularly. You should, however, keep an eye out for weeds, especially if it's your first time growing and you haven't spread your seeds evenly.







, Slugs and insects like sawflies can destroy a crop of wheat. Slugs are likely to appear when the wheat is still very short, under 4 or 5 inches (9 to 10 cm). If you see them, use slug baits to keep them away from your wheat. If you notice sawflies, spray your crop with insecticide to protect the wheat."

Prune shrubs in late winter to mid-spring, depending on the plant.,
Prune the shrubs in order to reduce their height.,
Prune older shrubs to give them new life.,
Prune shrubs to remove any diseased growth.",How to Prune Cane Growing Shrubs2," In general, late winter through mid-spring is the best time to prune. The new flourish of growth will fill out the shrub quickly. However, if the shrub is rather large and growing vigorously, it should be trimmed during the summer. Pruning at this time suppresses aggressive growth.


Pruning from late summer through fall should be avoided. Shrubs pruned at this time will put on new, lush growth that is either lost in the fall or damaged during the winter. Blooming season and whether the shrub blooms on old wood or new wood should also be taken into consideration.
For example, border forsythias (Forsythia x intermedia) bloom on “old wood” or stems that form during the previous year. They should be pruned immediately after they finish flowering, usually in mid-spring, so that they will have time to form new flower buds for the following year.Roses (Rosa spp. and hybrids) should be pruned in late winter or very early spring because they form blooms on new stems. Broken canes need to be removed as soon as they are noticed regardless of the shrub type., Reduce the height of cane-growing shrubs by completely removing the oldest, tallest canes. Cut them off close to the base of the shrub. Prune out a few of the canes at the center of the shrub if it seems to be too crowded. You should also prune any canes that are growing at an odd angle across other canes.

, Over-grown, older shrubs that are still healthy can be rejuvenated. The first rejuvenation option is cutting all of the canes back to a height of 6 to 10 inches (15.2 to 25.4 cm) in late winter or early spring.


Then, in early to mid-summer after the shrub has put on new growth, prune off half of the new canes and trim several of the remaining new canes back by a few inches.
The other option is to completely remove the older, thicker canes in late winter to early spring each year for three years. Remove up to one-third of the canes each time but always remove the oldest canes first.

, When diseases like stem canker attack a cane-growing shrub, the diseased canes should be completely removed immediately, regardless of the shrub’s blooming habit or the time of year. Put the diseased canes into the garbage or have them removed from the property. Disinfect the pruners or loppers with household disinfectant before and after each cut to help prevent the spread of disease.

Plant additional yews far apart.,
Water yew once a week.,
Fertilize the yew once a year.,
Trim the yew once a year.,
Wash soil exposed to winter salt.,
Remove pests from the plant.",How to Plant Yew," Yew is an evergreen, so it does best when avoiding the summer heat and winter frost. In spring, plant around the beginning of April when you see no more frost on the ground. In autumn, plant in September to let the yew take root before winter., Pick yew plants one or two feet high (45-60 cm). These young plants are easier to move and adapt to new ground than taller plants. You can get these with their roots balled, bare, or in a container. Seeds and cuttings, while able to grow when planted the same way as young plants, take a few years to sprout., Yew still grows well in open areas, but is more likely to dry up when under full sunlight. The best area is shady for half the day. Young yews are most vulnerable to intense sunlight, so keep them near taller yew hedges or walls.Other hedges and walls also shield the yew from strong winds.

, Avoid places where puddles of water remain hours after a hard rain. Opt for soil that feels loamy rather than compact. Good soil will feel soft, rich, and easy to dig. Soil that feels soggy can give the yew root rot.Soil can be amended with sand or gravel for better drainage.
Yew also grows well in containers. Get a good, slightly acidic soil from a gardening center and a container with drainage holes.

, Make the trench about 12 inches (30 cm) deep and 20 inches (50 cm) wide. Clear out all of the dirt along with the stones, weeds, and other debris. Don’t worry about providing too much space. Yew grows high and wide.In heavy soil, gather the soil into a ridge six inches (15 cm) high and three feet (1 m) wide before planting. This will help with soil drainage., Remove the plant from its container. Place the plant firmly in the middle of the trench. If your yew has bare roots, spread the roots apart so that they don’t grow into one another. Roots that are balled or in dirt from a container can be left alone.

Remember, yews can be left above ground and grown in a container. Don’t ever plant the container in the ground., A little bit of water can help the yew take root, but should only be done when the soil is dry. If the soil is dry about an inch (2 cm) down from the surface, water the area. Moisten the soil until it is damp but not waterlogged., Fill the hole with loose soil. The yew is better planted shallow than deep, so don’t cover much of the bark. Keep the center of the bed slightly higher than the outside edges to protect the yew from disease. Afterwards, press down on the soil or walk across it to make sure the yew is secure., First, lay out string in a straight line, passing over your first yew. You can tie the string to two poles to keep it straight. Walk about six and a half to ten feet (2-3 m) from the yew. Use the string as a guide to plant the yews in a straight line. The yews will fill in the space between them as they grow, forming a solid hedge line., During the first summer after planting, water the yew well. Once a week, give the soil a good soaking. Don’t waterlog the soil. If it rained during the week, test the soil first. When the soil feels damp about an inch (2 cm) down, you don’t need to water the plant. Stop watering near the beginning of winter. After this, the yew usually can take care of itself., Get compost or potash from your local gardening center. Take out any weeds around the yew, then spread the fertilizer. Liquid feed once a month will also encourage growth. Once the yew has grown tall and strong, fertilization is less important but can still be done to ensure the plant’s health., The yew will grow thick, requiring trimming to control it and keep yew hedges even. Put on safety goggles and sturdy gloves. You can use shears or trimmers. Work slowly, cutting off the branches that stick out. Keep the plant tapered by cutting the top end slightly shorter than the bottom end. This will enable light to reach lower branches.It’s best to let the hedge grow about four inches (10 cm) higher than you want it and then trim it. Do not attempt to cut the top off until the plant has grown.
Trimming can be done in any season other than winter.
A neglected yew can be renovated by trimming it very short in the middle of spring. The yew will need a few years to grow back to the desired size., In addition to waterlogged soil or sunlight exposure, browning is caused by road salt getting into the soil. In spring, the side of the yew closest to the road will turn brown. Do not prune these areas. Leach the soil by soaking it with water.Do add walls if possible to shield the yew from salt splashes. Make sure the yew is planted away from run-off areas.
If there is a lot of rain after an exposure, you won’t need to flush out the salt.
If your yew is in a pot, add water until it drains from the holes in the bottom of the pot.

, Yew doesn’t have many invasive species that will damage it. If you see the plant turning brown, examine it. Look for colored balls on the needles and stem. These are insects that can be scraped off with a knife. Also, shield the yew with walls or wire to keep out hungry deer and pet waste.In warmer climates such as the American South and Southwest, root knot nematodes may be the problem. Remove the yew if possible. Treat the soil with a fumigant or heat it for six weeks by covering it with plastic.
If you see yellow mushrooms near the yew, the plant may die very quickly from Armillaria root rot. Dig up the soil so the yew’s base is exposed. Replace the soil right before winter.
To minimize your risk of a honey fungus attack, trim off broken pieces of root before planting the yew. Add compost to the soil regularly.

If you can't find sugar cane plants at your local garden center, it can often be found at roadside stands and farmer's markets. Asian groceries also often stock sugar cane plants.


Look for long, thick stems, which are more likely to produce healthy new plants.
The stems have joints, and a new plant will sprout from each one. Keeping this in mind, buy as many stems as you need to produce the size crop you want.;
, Leave three to four joints per piece, to make it more likely that each piece will produce a few sprouts. If the stems have any leaves or flowers, go ahead and remove them.

, Sugar cane stems are planted horizontally on their sides, in four-inch deep furrows, or trenches. They need full sun, so choose an area that isn't shaded. Dig furrows long enough to fit each piece of cane you're planting, and space the furrows one foot apart.Use a spade or hoe, rather than a shovel, to make it easier to dig the furrows.

, Use a hose to lightly moisten the furrows to prepare them for the sugar cane. Make sure the water has drained and there are no remaining puddles before you plant.

, Place the stems horizontally into the furrows. Cover them with soil. Do not plant stems upright, or they will not grow.

, In the spring, usually in April or May, shoots will start to grow from the nodes of the stems. You'll see them breaking through the soil to form individual sugar cane stalks, which will grow quite tall by summer's end.

, Since sugar cane is a type of grass, it thrives on nitrogen-rich fertilizers. You can fertilize the sugar cane plants with standard grass fertilizer, or go for an organic option: chicken manure. Fertilizing just once, when the sprouts first emerge, will help the sugar cane grow strong and healthy so you'll have a good harvest in the fall., Sugarcane requires little maintenance except for weeding. Weeds could choke the new sprouts before they have the chance to grow. Constant weeding is necessary until the canes grow large enough to produce shade and choke harmful weeds on their own.

, A number of pests and diseases can impact sugar cane. Pests such as bores and insects are more likely to impact a crop when they experience waterlogged conditions, while diseases can cause fungal growth and rot stocks. Check your sugar cane regularly for pests or rotting, and take preventative measures to discourage pests and diseases whenever possible.Selecting sugar cane varieties that are resistant to diseases and viruses known to affect crops in your area is one of the best pest management strategies.The application of controlled amounts of appropriate fungicides or pesticides may help prevent the propagation of a pest or disease within your crop.If you do spot a plant that appears to be infected with pests or a disease, remove it immediately.

, Sugar cane plants should be left to grow for as long as possible before the first frost of the year. If they are left in the ground after the first frost, you will not be able to use your plants to make sugar syrup.


If you live in a place with long, cold winters, play it safe and harvest your sugar cane by the end of September.
If you live in a place with mild winters, you may be able to let your sugar cane grow until late October.
If you live in the United States, you can check your area's frost dates by visiting http://www.almanac.com/gardening/frostdates/states.

, The mature stalks will be tall and thick, similar to bamboo, so simple garden shears won't cut it. Use a machete or a saw to cut the sugar cane as close to the ground as possible, so you'll be able to make use of as much of the plant as possible.

, You don't want to damage the roots of the established sugar cane plants. If you leave the roots in the ground, your sugar cane will come up again next year.

, Be sure to wear gloves since the leaves are quite sharp. Use them to cover up the planting bed. The leaves will act as an organic mulch that will protect the sugar cane roots over the winter. If you don't have enough leaves to cover the whole bed, use some extra straw to finish the job., After a season outside, they'll have mildew and dirt on them. Use warm water and a scrub brush to scrub dirt and debris from the stems until they're completely clean., The stems will be quite stiff, so a meat cleaver is a better tool for the job than a knife. Chop the stem into small sections, then chop those in half so you have a pile of small pieces of sugar cane.If you had a commercial sugar cane press, chopping the stems wouldn't be necessary. On large farms, juice is extracted from sugar cane using huge, heavy presses. There is no equivalent machine suitable for home use, so the chop-and-boil-method is used instead.

, The sugar is extracted through a long process of boiling the pieces down for about two hours. The sugar water is ready when it has the same flavor as a piece of raw sugar cane. You'll have to taste-test it to determine when it's ready.Another clue is to look at the sugar cane pieces. After a few hours, the color will turn to a light brown, which indicates the sugar has been extracted.
Check the pot every half hour or so to make sure that the pieces are still covered with water; if not, add more.

, Use the strainer to catch all the fibrous pieces of sugar cane. You don't need these anymore, so you can discard them.

, Boil the sugar water until it cooks down significantly and takes on the texture of thick syrup. This can take anywhere from one to two hours, so be sure to monitor the pot to make sure you don't overcook it. To test whether the syrup is ready, dip a cold spoon in the pot and check the texture.If you like your syrup on the thin side, you can remove it from heat when it still easily slides from the back of the spoon.
For thicker syrup, remove it from heat when it coats the back of the spoon instead of slipping right off.

, Place a lid on the jar and allow the syrup to cool completely before storing it in a cool, dry place.

Think about how plants would grow naturally when determining where to place your plants.,
Consider planting self-multiplying plants.,
Try to pick out plants with different kinds of foliage.,
Consider creating a cohesive design throughout your yard.",How to Plant Under a Tree," The area beneath large, mature trees can be planted with flowering perennials and annuals to brighten an otherwise drab and often bare patch of land. The plants must be chosen carefully, however, as not all perennials and annuals can grow there. You should select plants that thrive in the shade and are shallow-rooted.


Hostas (Hosta spp.) are ideal for such areas. Their large leaves can be variegated or various shades of blue and green and their flowers are commonly purple or white. They are generally hardy in USDA hardiness zones 3 to 9, although this varies somewhat depending on the cultivar, and range in height from a few inches to 5 feet (1.5 m).
Impatiens (Impatiens spp.)are flowering annuals that are good for growing under a tree. They are available in a variety of colors and sizes and bloom profusely from spring to first frost.
Other plants that can be grown under trees include cyclamen, bluebells, foam flower, spotted dead nettle, sweet woodruff, Canadian wild ginger, ferns, and vinca. Understory plantings that have high canopies might be a good place for bleeding hearts and 'PJM' rhododendrons.;
, It is a good idea to place several inches of compost, grass clippings, and/or leaf mold around the tree in question before adding any extra plants. This is especially true for gardeners who are trying to create underplantings for coniferous trees, because the fallen needles underneath them tend to make the soil too acidic for other plants to survive there.


Spread a 2-inch layer of compost, sphagnum peat moss, aged cow manure or a 50 percent combination of good topsoil and sphagnum peat moss, cow manure or compost over the area under the tree.
Work it into the top 4 inches (10.2 cm) of soil with a dirt shovel. Be very careful to avoid digging too deep and damaging the tree roots. Smooth out the loosened, amended soil with a dirt rake.

, Using a substantial layer of compost and the smallest possible versions of new plants will also help prevent root disturbance.


Choosing small plants will mitigate the amount of soil disturbance required to cover their roots.
The compost helps because it forms a soil-like layer in which plants can easily be placed so that gardeners do not have to dig into the original soil.

, Plant the perennials or annuals in the spring after the last expected hard frost. Dig the planting holes with a hand shovel to avoid damaging the tree roots. The hole should be just deep enough for the perennial or annual plant’s roots.


Where larger surface tree roots are growing, position the plants a few inches away from the root. Be sure to space the plants out to allow for their mature width.
For example, if a particular hosta cultivar is expected to reach a width of 2 feet (0.6 m), set multiple hostas 2 feet (0.6 m) or more apart so there will be at least an inch or two between the mature plants.

, Spread a 2-inch depth of organic mulch over the soil around the plants but keep it away from the bark of the tree. There should be at least 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of space between the tree and the mulch to protect the tree from rot and disease.

, Water the plants often enough to keep the soil from drying out completely. Since they are planted under a tree, they will have to be watered more often than if they were planted in a garden away from the tree. Trees absorb huge amounts of water and will easily out-compete smaller plants.

, Avoid building a raised bed around a tree. The addition of even 6 inches (15.2 cm) of soil over its root structure and up against its bark commonly causes serious damage to a tree which may not become evident for two to five years.


The additional soil reduces oxygen levels around the tree’s root system and roots need oxygen to stay healthy. Roots will often grow up into a raised bed in search of oxygen, defeating the whole point of building it in the first place.
The soil will also cause tree bark to rot or develop fungal and bacterial infections.

, When making underplantings, gardeners should not use power tools because doing so could harm the tree roots and severely damage the tree itself.

, For underplantings, it is recommended that gardeners choose a few types of plants and use them in large quantities for a cohesive design.


Likewise, selecting a color scheme of two or three complementary hues is the best way to obtain good results. Both of these factors will help one’s underplanting from end up a garish eyesore.
However, gardeners should keep in mind that even the best designs will take a few years before they flow together and stop looking sparse.

, It is recommended that gardeners arrange their plants in wavy, drifting lines similar to how they appear in nature.


Underplantings that encircle the tree and bare spots near the tree trunk don’t look natural at all, so they should be avoided.

, Even if they are only around for a short time period, bulb plants such as daffodils, tulips, snowdrops, and crocuses look great under trees. Where they are zone compatible, these plants will also self-multiply and this helps fill up bare spots.

, Most but not all shade plants tend to be of varying green hues and even the most long lived flowers won’t bloom forever. Therefore, it’s a good idea to spruce up the contrast in one’s underplantings by adding plants that have different types of foliage.

, Gardeners who have created a workable design should feel free to use it on the other trees in their yard so that their entire estate blends together in an appealing way.


This is also a good way to save money if one’s underplantings require division every so often.
It is simple to take the extraneous materials from one tree and move them to the next until the entire yard is filled up at no additional cost.

While other types of bamboo and plants in general can thrive while being exposed to three or so hours of sunlight a day, moso bamboo needs six or more.;
, While moso bamboo may not necessarily need an excessive amount of water, it grows best in a location where it has constant access to water. Opt for an area that’s relatively easy to make and keep moist., Choose a cooler environment that doesn’t freeze for long periods. For the best possible end result, plant your seeds in the springtime. Once your moso bamboo is more established, it will be able to handle temperatures as low as 5 degrees Fahrenheit (-15 degrees Celsius), but it will have a hard time coming back from damage caused by colder, longer periods of time., Break seed dormancy by keeping them in the refrigerator for two or three weeks before you sow them. You can put them in the ground outside during winter months instead and hope for springtime germination, but the chances of success when using this method are lower, because you won’t be able to regulate moisture and temperature., Either a peat-based or peat-free compost mixed with sand in equal parts will create a strong foundation that will allow your seeds to get a good start.Make enough of your mixture to fill your pot about three fourths of the way., Soften up your seeds by soaking them for 24 hours in a bowl of water. In addition to softening, this step allows you to assess which of your seeds are viable and which aren’t. Any seeds that sink to the bottom most likely won’t sprout, so don’t bother planting those., While the seeds are soaking, fill your pot a little over halfway with your sand and compost mixture, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it sit in a temperature somewhere between 68 and 78 degrees Fahrenheit (20-26 degrees Celsius)., Place the seeds in the pot several inches apart and cover the seeds with about a quarter inch of your medium. At this point in the process, the seeds will be very sensitive to environmental influences, and require consistently warm temperatures, light shade, and moisture.

Bamboo typically takes around a month or so to germinate, however, sometimes it can take up to six months. Be patient and consider this before assuming that your seeds aren’t viable., Dig a hole the size of your pot somewhere in the sunny area you’ve selected. Once your moso bamboo plant is several inches tall and appears to be somewhat strong and stable, gently remove it from the pot in the shady, warm area while keeping the roots and compost mixture as intact as possible., As your moso bamboo tries to weather its new environment, place three or four stakes around the base of the plant and tie a rope around its culms. This will stabilize the plant and keep it from uprooting or getting damaged while it gets stronger., When you initially transport the plant, make sure to soak the ground with water so that your moso bamboo starts off with a healthy amount of moisture. Put a three or four inch layer of mulch around your plant to help it retain moisture."

Test your soil pH using a kit available from most home and garden stores, and use compost or Sphagnum peat moss to acidify the soil if necessary., ‘Uala readily grows in nutritionally poor soil, but may struggle in heavy clay or very sandy soil. Create a good soil environment by making rows of 10 in (25.5 cm) high and 3.5 ft (1 m) apart. Mix organic compost into the soil, but avoid adding nitrogen-rich fertilizers, as these could stunt the tubers.You may also be able to grow ‘uala in a grow bed if you do not have the space or capacity to put in rows.

, ‘Uala should not be placed outdoors until the soil temperature has reached at least 60° F, (15.5° C). In cold or mild climates, you can help warm the soil by placing black plastic over the planting area for two to three weeks prior to planting. Plastic sheeting is available at most home improvement and big box stores.’Uala does best in USDA plant hardiness zones 9, 10, and 11.Growing ‘uala outside of these zones will likely require some soil warming efforts., ‘Uala is typically grown from slips, or sprouts cut from stored tubers. Slips are often available from garden centers, nurseries, and local farmers at events such as farmer’s markets. Buying your slips locally will help you get a variety that is known to grow well in your area., About six weeks before planting in the ground, start your slips in a pot or box of moist, loose soil or mulch. Keep the soil moist and keep the area climate-controlled at 75° to 80° F (24° to 26.5° C). Leave the slips in the pot until they sprout shoots 6 to 9 in (15 to 23 cm) long., Once your slips start sprouting, cut the plant off at the soil above the roots. This allows the slips to grow new roots that aren’t bunched and can produce better tubers. Then, transplant the sprouts two to three inches (5 to 7.5 cm) deep in the rows, leaving 18 or so inches (about 46 cm) between each plant.As ‘Uala can be very temperature sensitive, it is a good idea to wait until after the last frost to transplant. If you live in a warm, rainy area, it is also recommended that you let the rains pass prior to transplanting.

, ‘Uala will typically need at least four months of frost-free growth to take hold and produce quality tubers. Monitor your garden and cover plants as necessary if unexpected cold snaps happen after they are transplanted., The amount you need to water will depend greatly on your area, but ‘uala needs ample water, especially early on while the slips are regrowing their roots. Make sure the soil is moist but not muddy throughout the day. Be sure to use a gentle water delivery system such as a low-pressure hose setting or drip irrigation system while the sprouts are still taking root in the beds.If you live in a hot, dry area, you may want to water in small five to ten minute intervals every two or three hours, whereas more humid or temperate climates may allow you to water once or twice a day for fifteen or so minutes at a time.

, Hoe or otherwise weed the growing area to keep other plants from out-competing or choking out the ‘uala. Then, reshape the beds with soil and mulch as necessary to ensure roots are covered and the plants stay healthy., While ‘uala is hearty, it is susceptible to certain pests and diseases, including sweet potato weevils and scurf. Look for indications of disease including overly-punctured leaves and stems, and black rot. Remove any infected plants as soon as you see a problem.Minimize your chances of scurf by only planting slips from healthy plants and disease resistant cultivars.

, Hold your sieve (sifter) above the tray and put soil, usually seed starting medium or potting soil, into it, breaking it up as you do. Don't worry if some of the soil gets on your work area and not in the tray; you can brush it up and use it for the next tray. Fill the tray until it overflows, and then lift the tray a little and tap it against your work surface to settle the soil.
, Drag the stick or striking board across the top of the tray to make sure the soil is flush with the top and evenly dispersed. Your hand can perform the same function. Take about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) of soil off the top of the tray. If you have a striking board, you can easily insert the indented side of it into the tray and sweep away a thin layer of soil. Otherwise, use your hand or some tool that will fit into the tray to scrape the soil off the top.

, Press the firming board (a thin board that fits perfectly inside the tray) down on the soil until the top of the board is level with the top of the tray. You can also use your hands if you don't have a firming board.

, Use a watering can with a rose (the apparatus with many holes) on the end of the spout. Turn the rose upside down and hold the can to one side of the tray. Tilt the can until water begins to shower out, and then pass the can over the tray four times.

English ivy prefers partial sun or filtered shade, but it will grow in full shade. If you plant ivy in an area that is not shaded during the heat of the day, provide the plant with a shade screen for the first 4 to 6 months.
Ivy is an invasive plant, so pick an area where it has plenty of room to grow and will not interfere with other plants.
Be absolutely certain you want to plant it, as it's invasive, considered a weed in many areas and not allowed in some. See Warnings below.;
, English ivy grows best in a pH of around 7.

, Add hydrated lime to raise the alkalinity, or sulfur to raise the acidity. Follow package directions when adjusting your soil pH, and then test the soil again to check the new pH level.

, English ivy grow best in well-drained, fertile soil.

, The hole should be slightly wider than the plant's root base.

, This stimulates the growth of the plant and its roots.

, Fill in the hole with soil.

,, Mulch helps plants retain moisture and prevents weeds from growing.

Pick out a spot for your ranunculus based on your climate.,
Find a spot to plant your ranunculus where the soil drains well.,
Plant your ranunculus from tubers (aka bulbs) if possible.,
Be aware that you can generally tell how many flowers you will get by looking at the bulb or tuber.,
Try growing ranunculus from seed if you cannot purchase tubers.,
Consider planting your ranunculus in a container.,
Keep animals away from the ranunculus, as the flowers are poisonous.",How to Plant and Care for a Ranunculus1," Ranunculus plants prefer a sunny location but if you are in an especially hot climate they will tolerate some shade. Ranunculus tend not to tolerate heavy frost so if you are planting them in cooler climates it is recommended to store the tubers, which are also know as bulbs, inside for the winter.Storing ranunculus tubers will be covered in Step 6 of Method 2 further down in the article.;
, Aside from planting your ranunculus in the sun, you should also keep the soil in mind when choosing a spot for your plant. Ranunculus grow well in well-drained soil and prefer rich, sandy ground. Avoid planting your ranunculus in areas where puddles remain long after rainfall, or if you know your soil is heavy clay.You can determine if your soil is predominantly clay by squeezing a handful of moist soil in your palm. If it clumps together, you likely have a clay-heavy soil. You can improve soil drainage by mixing your soil with a generous amount of substances such as plant fibers (bark or grass clippings) or well-rotted manure. These ‘soil extras’ will help your ranunculus to grow.

, Tubers, or bulbs, are generally the preferred way to grow ranunculus. A tuber is similar to a root; ranunculus tubers look like spiders, claws, or bunches of bananas. Their odd appearance is helpful when it comes to planting. Plant the tuber with the pointed ‘claw’ end or ‘spider’s legs’ facing downwards. To plant your tubers:


You should plant smaller varieties so that they are about 2 inches (5.1 cm) deep and 5 inches (12.7 cm) apart from other tubers.
Plant larger varieties, such as Ranunculus Tecolote, up to 12 inches (30.5 cm) apart.
You don’t need to soak them before planting. It’s best to plant in batches of up to a dozen for maximum effect. Plant as soon as the last frosts have ended, usually in the spring.
Water the tubers and the ground around them after you have planted them. Watering them will help to settle the soil.
Do not water until sprouts emerge.

, The size of the bulb will help indicate the number of flowers it will produce.


‘Jumbos’ are the largest at around 3 inches (7.6 cm) diameter and will produce 30-40 flowers.
Smaller tubers of around 2 inches (5.1 cm) diameter can produce a dozen or so.

, Ranunculus can also be grown from seed. It’s best to sow the seeds indoors in September as ranunculus seeds prefer a cool temperature. To plant ranunculus seeds:


Sow, or place, the seeds into pre-moistened compost that’s lightweight and suitable for seed sowing.
Do not cover the seeds with soil. Keep the soil moist and out of direct sunlight.
Maintain the seeds at a temperature of around 70 °F (21 °C) and a little cooler at night. The seeds should germinate, or grow into small plants, in around two to three weeks.
Wait until the young plants have around half a dozen leaves before transplanting them into larger pots. Protect these young plants from frost and transfer them into outdoor soil in the following spring if so desired.

, To plant ranunculus tubers in pots, fill the container about three quarters full of soil. Place the tubers so that they are around 10 inches (25.4 cm) apart from each other and fill the container with soil so that the tubers are covered in about two inches of soil.Water the tubers to settle the soil.


Remember container plants tend to dry out more easily than plants in the ground, so be mindful of watering over the growing season. Watering will be covered in Step 2 of Method 2.
Keep in mind that ranunculus plants tend to make a large root system, so don’t crowd them too much in containers.

, All ranunculus plants are poisonous to livestock, and can also be harmful to pets and people. The plants have an unpleasant taste and cause blisters to form in the mouth. This generally means animals avoid eating them unless no other plants are available, which is good if you have deer in your area, but bad if you have pets.


Consider planting the ranunculus in an area where your pets and livestock can’t reach them, such as a fenced off garden or in a pot (which is covered in Step 6, the previous step, of this section).

"
"
Feed your plants with ‘plant feed’ every 14 or so days.,
Water your ranunculus.,
Defend your ranunculus against pests.,
Remove withered flowerheads with sharp garden scissors.,
Allow your plant to ‘die back’ in the winter.,
Store the ranunculus inside during the winter if you live in a climate that gets heavy frost.,
Understand that many gardeners view ranunculus as annuals.,
Preserve blooms that you cut.",How to Plant and Care for a Ranunculus2," During the active growing season, which is generally spring through summer, try to support your plants by feeding them every fortnight (which is every 14 days). Start doing this as soon as the first buds appear on the plant.


A general water-soluble plant feed or one that your rake into the soil is fine. This encourages the plant to produce flowers. You can purchase plant feed at your local gardening supply store.

, You should make a point to water your tubers just after planting, as mentioned above. Continue to water your new plants once every 10 to 14 days. When the first foliage, or leaves, appear on your plants, you should try to water them once a week.Continue watering your plants once a week until fall comes around. In the fall, the ranunculus will die back, or go dormant, and will not need to be watered. Dormancy is covered more thoroughly in Step 5 of this section.

, Sadly, ranunculus can fall prey to pests like slugs and aphids. Luckily, there are measures you can take to make sure that these pests stay away.


Combat slugs with slug pellets, which are sprinkled around your ranunculus. You can purchase these pellets at a garden supply store.
A standard aphid spray or insecticidal soap should be applied if aphid attack occurs.

, As with many flowering plants, it’s advisable to remove spent flowerheads once they wither (when they dry up and die). This not only makes the plant look tidier, it also encourages other flowers to form and reduces the amount of energy the plant spends on seed formation, which helps preserve its strength.


Use a sharp pair of scissors to snip off the dead heads as soon as they begin to look scruffy. Try to cut the flower at the base of the stem, which is located in amongst the foliage, or leaves.

, Once the flowering season ends in fall, allow the foliage to die back. Dying back means that the plant becomes dormant until the next flowering season.To encourage the plant to regrow the next season:


Refrain from cutting the dead growth away before the first frost. You don’t need to water the plant while it is dormant; in fact, these plants do better if they are not watered while they are dormant in the winter.

, Ranunculus will tolerate a light frost if left in the ground through a fairly mild winter. If your local climate regularly experiences heavy frost then dig up the tubers and store them in a cool dark place such as a garden shed for the winter.


Try to avoid bringing them into a heated space like your home as they tend to rot under these conditions.

, Because of the difficulty establishing ranunculus as perennials (plants which flower year after year), many gardeners just treat them as annuals (plants which flower only one year). However, if you are determined to see yours bloom again, dig up your tubers for the winter, as described in the previous step.

, Ranunculus make a beautiful cut flower that generally remains healthy for awhile after being cut if measures are taken to preserve the cut. To preserve the life of cut ranunculus flowers, cut them early in the morning just as the buds are starting to open.


A good clean cut using a sharp blade will help make the cut clean. Snip the stem at the base of the plant just about the crown and within the foliage. This avoids leaving exposed cut stems.

Select a species of ivy.,
Select a spot for growing the ivy.,
Water the soil thoroughly before planting the ivy.,
Dig holes for the plants.,
Set the new plants into the holes.,
Avoid fertilizing the new plants for at least 3 months.,
Propagate the ivy as needed.,
Control the ivy as needed.",How to Plant Ivy," Nearly all species of ivy will grow well in anything from full sun to deep shade, and all will provide excellent ground cover and erosion control. The most common species is English Ivy (Hedera helix), although another popular variety is Algerian Ivy (Hedera Canariensis), which sports broad, 8 inch (20 cm) leaves. You should plant the ivy in spring.;
, Ivy works well in nearly any location, but it is especially useful for addressing difficult gardening spots. Steep hills, which are hard to plant with grass or other plants due to erosion concerns, are perfect for ivy. Ivy also works well in very shady areas that would otherwise need to be mulched. You can also consider planting ivy to grow up a wall or trellis.

, New ivy plants will grow best in soil that is very moist.

, For planting English Ivy and most other species, the holes should be about 12 inches (30 cm) apart and about 6 inches (15 cm) deep. The depth of the hole should be just enough to accommodate the root of the new plant.

, Place the root of each new plant or trimming into a hole, and fill the rest of the hole with soil. Ivy will grow best in loamy soil with a high concentration of organic matter. Prune the visible section of the plant to about 6 inches (15 cm).

, Once they are established, fertilize them every 2 months (during spring and summer) with an all-purpose fertilizer. Adding compost to the surrounding soil will also boost the ivy's growth and improve the soil.

, Ivy multiplies very readily, so you may not need to do any propagating. If you do, you can simply pin any portion of the ivy's stem down to the soil, and it will develop new roots at that point. You can also propagate ivy from leaf cuttings, but pinning the stems down is generally more effective.

, Ivy reproduces very rapidly, and is considered an invasive species. If you are planting ivy, you should make a commitment to keep it contained within your garden. If ivy is allowed to spread freely, it can disrupt the nutrient cycles in your local ecosystem.

Make your shelves 4 feet (1.2 m) long to accommodate standard fluorescent fixtures. Options for shelve width are 12 inches (30.5 cm) and 24 inches (61.0 cm). Distance between shelves must account for the height of the lighting and the flats. 18 inches (45.7 cm) is suggested for the distance between shelves.;
, This should be a standard 4 foot (1.2 m) fluorescent fixture, available anywhere. If you hang them with a chain and hooks, they will be more adjustable. Position lamps in a place where they will not be noticed by the casual onlooker. Cool white bulbs are suitable.

, Standard nursery flats fit perfectly and are commonly available. The ones that provide drainage are used. It is not recommended that you use flats that do not drain. Use something to keep the flats slightly off the shelve so as to provide drainage and circulation underneath. One suggestion is corrugated vinyl roofing material. Heating mats designed for the purpose sometimes include a wire support which works well.

, It is suggested that you slant your shelve ever so slightly so that the water runs towards a bucket or tub. The tubs used for mixing concrete are ideal.

, Use smaller containers that fit with the standard flats. Many configurations are available or use whatever you have. Use store bought standard potting soil, not dirt.

,, Soak them in water overnight in a dark cabinet. Then place a paper towel in a shallow plate, place the seed upon the towel, then fold the towel over. Make sure the plate is filled with water then drain off the excess water, leaving the paper soaked and the seeds inside. Put in the cabinet. Check at least every eight hours. Avoid letting the paper dry out. You will be able to sight whether the seeds have germinated or not. The time can vary.

, Once you have visual verification, plant the seeds in the home you have previously prepared for them. Plant them shallow, so that they are just covered. Use a pencil or your finger to make a shallow hole for the seed then cover them. Each seedling should be individually marked if the strain is rare or valuable.

, For tiny seedlings where careful and attentive watering should rule, be sure to let them dry out, but not too much. Employ plain water at first. Water gently, use a mister on it's most gentle setting to water new seedlings

, Beginners are the most likeliest to make this mistake. They want to be moist, but well drained for a successful yield.

In the summer months ,you can water them more frequently if the leaves show any signs of drying (for example, every 4 days)., In about a week to 10 days, the seeds should germinate if the soil temperature is above 16ºC.,, Floral buds appear about 35 days after planting; floral buds of cotton are called squares. At about 60 days after planting the the first white flowers will appear.They are a flower one day and after that the fruit is called a boll. The boll grows larger each day as the seeds mature.The fibers are located on the seed coat. When the seed and fiber development is complete the boll splits. Stop watering the plants once first cotton bolls open about 17-19 weeks after planting. You can then harvest it, if wished."

The mature tree or shrub should not press against buildings, block windows, or intrude on driveways and paths. It should not touch overhead wires either.
Unless you are planting a hedge, the mature trees and shrubs should not touch each other.;
,


Many areas have a “Miss Dig” service that will locate buried utility lines for you. Look in your local phone book for a number.
Call your utility company to locate underground lines if there is no service to locate them in the area.
If it is your septic lines or things that weren’t put in by a utility company you may be able to check a blueprint, use a probe or even ask a neighbor if you don’t know where the underground lines run.

,


For bare root trees, the hole should be as deep as the dark mark on the plant stem that indicates the soil level in the nursery or 2”, (5.1 cm.), above the top root branch. It should be wide enough so the roots can be spread out and won’t be bunched up in the hole. Too wide is fine, too deep or too shallow is not.
For potted trees and shrubs, measure the pot diameter and make the hole slightly wider. Measure the depth to the top of the soil, not to the top of the pot, and make the hole that deep.
For balled and burlap plants, measure the width of the ball and make your hole slightly wider. Unwrap the top of the ball and check for the top root branch. Leave the burlap under the root ball for now. Measure from the bottom of the root ball to the top root branch. Make your hole 2” (5.1 cm) deeper than that.

, Fold back burlap coverings on root balls so you can see the roots, but let it remain under the root ball until you lift the root ball and set it into the hole.

,


If the roots are circling around the outside of the root ball they need to be untangled and spread out.
If they can’t be untangled completely, cut them so that the end of the root will face downward or outward.

,


Remove as much burlap or other wrapping material as you can after the tree or shrub is set in the hole.
Remove any wire cages, and all wires and strings from around the roots of trees and shrubs.

, Do not add fertilizer, topsoil, peat, or other amendments.

, Do not tamp the soil down with your feet. Add more soil if it settles and exposes too much of the root system.

,


Stake evergreens in windy locations or top heavy weeping trees so they don’t blow over before the roots establish themselves.
Remove stakes after 1 year for evergreens, some weeping trees may need a permanent stake near the trunk.

If a soil amendment is going to be used, such as compost, work it into a wide area of soil; don’t just add it to holes when planting the perennials.

,


Perennials should be planted at the same depth they are growing in a pot. On bare root plants, make the hole 1”, (2.5 cm), deeper than the top of the roots.
Make the hole wider than the current root ball by a few inches. There should be plenty of room to spread the roots out.

Control pests.",How to Plant a Walnut Tree," Preparing walnut seeds can take months of waiting, and success rate can be low. You may choose to purchase a seedling and skip to that section instead. Before using either method, be aware that walnut trees, especially of the black walnut species, release chemicals into the soil that kill many nearby plants, including pine trees, apple trees, tomatoes, and others.This, along with their massive size and sometimes aggressive spreading of new walnut plants, can make them unpopular in cities and suburbs., In the autumn, gather nuts that have fallen from walnut trees, or gently hit walnut branches with a PVC pipe to cause ripe nuts to fall.Even when ripe and fallen, most nuts will still be encased in a thick green or brown husk around the nutshell.



Warning: walnut husks can stain and irritate skin and clothing. Waterproof gloves are recommended.

, If you plan to start a walnut orchard to produce nuts or timber, ask a local forester or look online for a species and variety specialized for your climate and your intended purpose. Ideally, purchase walnut seed from trees within 100 miles (160 km) of your planting location, as these may be better adapted.Walnuts typically grow in USDA hardiness zones 4—9, or areas with a -30 to +30ºF (-34 to -1ºC) minimum temperature, but some varieties are better suited to cold than others.


Black walnut is highly expensive and in-demand for its timber, while English walnut (also called Persian walnut) is commonly grown for either nuts or timber. Many varieties of each exist, along with other, less widely available species.Walnuts from a grocery store are unlikely to have the moisture necessary to germinate. Even if they do, the nuts were likely produced by a hybrid tree or a tree variety suited for a different climate, making success in your area unlikely.

, Walnuts can grow without the husks being removed, but many people remove the husks to check the walnuts inside are undamaged, and to make them easier to handle. To remove the husk, soak the walnuts in a bucket of water until the outer husk is soft to the touch, waiting up to three days for the hardest nuts. Crack and peel off the softened husk by hand.If the husks have dried out, they can be almost impossible to remove. Try driving over them in a car.
For a larger quantity of walnuts, run them through a corn sheller, or even rotate them in a cement mixer with gravel and water for 30 minutes., Walnuts, like many plant seeds, need to experience a moist, cold environment before the plant awakens from its dormancy and emerges from the shell. This takes 3–4 months for walnuts, depending on the variety, during which they should be kept moist. Keeping seeds in an environment for this purpose is called stratification, and for walnuts can be done in one of the following ways:


Keep small amounts of walnuts in moist peat moss or moist sand, inside plastic bags kept in a refrigerator, or in another location between 34 and 41ºF (2–5ºC).For a large quantity of nuts, dig a pit in fast-draining soil, 1 to 2 feet (.3 to .6 meters) deep. Fill this pit by alternating single layers of nuts with 2 inch (5 cm) layers of sand, leaves, or mulch. Cover the pit with screening to keep out rodents., After the ground has thawed, and at least 90 days have passed, remove the seeds from their cold environment. Viable seeds should have a small sprout emerging. Keep the seeds moist for a full week before planting., All walnut species require high quality soil, and this step is especially important if you are starting a walnut orchard. Choose a location with well-draining, loamy soil at least three feet (0.9 m) deep. Avoid steep slopes, ridge tops, rocky soil, and soil with large amounts of clay.The lower areas of north-facing slopes are acceptable in rolling or mountainous terrain (or south-facing, if located in the Southern Hemisphere).


Walnut is fairly versatile when it comes to soil pH. Soils between 6.0 and 6.5 pH may be best, but anything from 5 to 8 should be acceptable.

, Remove existing vegetation from the planting site before planting, as they will compete for the same nutrients the walnut tree or trees need. For an orchard-sized planting, cultivating the field to aerate the soil is also recommended., Dig small holes, about 2–3 inches (5–7.5 cm) deep, and place the walnuts sideways at the bottom of these, then refill with dirt.When planting multiple trees, place the holes 12–17 feet (3.7—5.2m) apart, in a grid position.Optionally, you may plant two or more nuts in each spot, 8 inches (20 cm) from each other. Once the seedlings have grown for a year or two, remove all but the healthiest from each spot.See the tips section for an alternate planting method to protect against squirrels and other small animals.

, The next section contains information on caring for seedlings and growing trees. Skip over the steps that involve planting trees from seedlings.

, Measure the seedling's diameter 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the root collar, where the roots meet the trunk. Select seedlings with a minimum diameter here of 1/4 inch (0.64 cm), and preferably larger. This is the most important measurement for predicting quality.Bare-root seedlings, sold without any soil, should be planted in early spring, before bud growth, and should be planted immediately after acquiring.
Containerized seedlings can handle later planting dates and drier soils, but are typically much more expensive., Choose well-draining, loamy soil, avoiding steep slopes and hilltops. Place the seedlings in holes that are twice as wide in diameter as the seedling roots, and just deep enough to bury the roots. For best results, backfill with one part compost for every three parts normal soil.Tamp down the soil and water thoroughly.


Plant the seedlings 12–17 feet (3.7—5.2m) to get the most nuts from your trees. Keeping seedlings 10–12 ft (3.0–3.7 m) apart is best for timber production.

, For at least the first two years after planting, whether grown from nut or seed, the walnut tree needs supplemental watering, especially during dry or warm weather. Weekly waterings are best for newly planted trees, but you can water less as the tree grows. Give the plant a thorough watering, but do not water again until the soil has mostly dried. Frequent watering can harm the plant.After two or three years, the trees only need to be watered during the hottest time of year or during a drought, about one to three times a month., Care for seedlings by keeping the area around them free of sod and weeds, which will compete with the growth of small seedlings. Remove sod and weeds by hand or by laying fabric weed barrier. Larger seedlings can be treated with mulch to keep weeds at bay, using about 2 or 3 inches over the root zones.Do not use mulch on plants that have not yet emerged from the soil, as it can block the sprout from growing. Wait until the seedling is woody and has developed roots.

, If you are raising the walnut for timber, it is important to prune early to ensure a straight trunk, leaving one ""leader"" branch at the top of the tree and guiding it straight and upright over the next one or two growing seasons.Saplings grown for nuts can be left alone until after thinning, but subsequent pruning is wise for black walnut trees, as these are usually sold for timber eventually, even nut varieties.If you have not pruned trees before, especially saplings, finding an experienced pruner to help you identify leaders and important branches is recommended.
If the top of the tree is forked, bend the best leader upright and tape it to other branches as support, then cut off the tip of the supporting branches to prevent growth., Most orchards begin with more plants than the area can support. Once the trees are large enough that the branches are beginning to run into each other, select the healthiest trees that display the characteristics you value, typically a straight trunk and rapid growth. Remove the rest, but avoid clearing too much space that can cause weeds or even competing trees to grow.You may wish to use a crown competition formula to help you make your decision.

, Fertilization is somewhat controversial, at least for black walnuts, because it can assist competing weeds more than the tree if the soil is already rich in nutrients. Wait until the trunk is ""pole"" size, or at least 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter measured 4.5 feet (1.4 m) above the ground.Ideally, send soil or leaves to a forestry laboratory to identify exact nutrient deficiencies. If this is not possible, apply fertilizer containing 3 lbs nitrogen, 5 lbs triple super phosphate, and 8 lbs muriate of potash to each tree in late spring. Leave a few trees unfertilized to compare the effect, and, if positive, reapply every 3–5 years.Test soil pH after fertilizing to see if you need to adjust it back to normal levels.

, Squirrels are a common sight in walnut groves, and can take an entire crop of nuts if not controlled. Cover the trunks with plastic tree guard to keep them from climbing them, and prune away branches less than 6 ft. (1.8 m) from the ground if you are able to do so without causing knots that diminish timber value.Other pests such as caterpillars, aphids, and flies vary by region, and may not harm your tree if they are active late in the growing season.Consult a nearby forester or experienced walnut grower for information specific to your region.


Keep livestock away from walnut trees of any size, as the damage they cause may even make the timber value of adult trees worthless."

",How to Plant an Evergreen Hedge," You can buy hedges in containers from garden centres or nurseries. Good hedge plants include:


Yew
Laurel
Photinia
Privets;
,


If you buy a hedge without any soil around the roots, known as bare-rooted, it should be planted in the dormant season between November and March northern hemisphere and May to September southern hemisphere. If it has been grown in a container, plant it in April (September in the southern hemisphere), so that it can become established before the onset of winter.

, Hedges are commonly exposed as they are used as borders, and you often simply have to plant them where they are required. Whilst the hedge is establishing itself, it is worth providing it with protection from prevailing winds with windbreak netting.

, Thoroughly fork over the soil and remove any weeds and stones from the site.


Shovel plenty of manure onto the surface soil, and fork the two into each other to ensure a rich bed for planting.

, Pull taut in order to mark out the side of your trench.


Once you have staked out a trench you are happy with, use the string as a guide and start to dig. The trench should accommodate the plants being 50 centimeter (19.7 in) apart, and be slightly deeper than the root balls.
Using a garden fork, prick the sides and base of the hole to break up the smooth surface created by the spade. This will encourage the roots to grow outwards and help rain to move through the soil.

, The plants need to be planted at the right depth, and at fifty centimetres intervals.


Remove the plant from its pot, or remove any bags that surround the roots as shown here. Tease the roots outwards to ensure they grow away from the root ball.
Ensure all the roots are below the surface, but that the base of the stem is not buried, as this can cause rot. Check it is the right depth by laying a cane across the trench. If the plant is standing too high or low you'll need to remove or add some of the soil in the bottom of the hole.
Refill the trench with the soil fertiliser mix you removed, and gently firm it up with your heel once it has reached the correct level.

, Water in each plant with an entire watering can, or even a hose. If you plant the example plant used for this article, yew, ensure that it isn't damaged by water-logging but don't let it dry out either. Water regularly throughout spring, summer and autumn, especially when it is particularly dry.

Use a thermometer to regularly check the tank’s water temperature. If it falls outside the 72-78 range, you’ll need to install heating or cooling systems as appropriate. Check your local pet store for guidance when acquiring these systems., While Brazilian Waterweed can grow in a variety of settings, there’s such a thing as an ideal pH for its growth. This pH range will facilitate the growth of the Brazilian Waterweed. You can buy pH testing kits at your local pet store as well as online.Controlling your aquarium’s pH level is done with two products: acid and alkaline buffers. The former lower the water’s pH level, while the latter will increase it. Usually you’ll need to combine the two to keep the pH between the 6.5 and 7.5 range., Brazilian Waterweed needs a good amount of light to thrive, otherwise it might wither and die. Too much light, and you’ll be dealing with an algae problem. A good rule of thumb to ensure you give your plant the right amount of light is to use a lighting system that’s 2-4 watts per gallon (3.8 liters) of water., Brazilian Waterweed is typically sold in bundles in pet stores that are bound together to be more attractive in displays. Leaving this rubber band on the plants can damage the stems and stunt growth once planted in your tank. Use a pair of scissors to cut the rubber band off., Rubber banding the stems together may have caused damage to the plant. If you find any stems that are discolored, or rotting, prune them off with shears. Keep an eye out for leaves that may have been caught in the rubber band and need trimming as well., Use your hands to push individual stems into the bottom of your aquarium. You’ll want to plant them about two inches (5 cm) deep and one inch (2.5 cm) away from each other. Any shallower and the plants will drift to the surface and float. Any closer together and the plants won’t have enough room to grow., While you’ll want to use this kind of soil to encourage growth for many aquarium plants, Brazilian Waterweed is notorious for spreading quickly. You should avoid spurring its growth further, or you can expect to do a lot of trimming.

If you have other plants in your aquarium, you may not have a choice but to use nutrient-rich soil. Be ready to trim your Brazillian Waterweed if this is the case., This plant grows so quickly that soil isn’t even really need for its growth. Depending on your tank, you might be able to simply let the plant float for a different look, especially in larger tanks. However, the plant might grow to obscure your tank’s light source and crowd other plants in your aquarium. You’ll likely need to trim it often to avoid this."
"
Make sure the water’s pH is between 6.5 and 7.5.,
Regulate the aquarium’s temperature.,

Watch the plant for algae.",How to Plant an Amazon Sword Plant," Most tap or well water will usually fall within this pH range, but you should still test it before adding Amazon Sword plants to your aquarium. You can buy pH testing kits specifically for aquariums from your local pet store (though they can also be purchased online).

Controlling an aquarium’s pH level is done through the use of alkaline buffers, which increase water’s pH level, and acid buffers which lower it.
To reach and maintain a pH level in the 6.5 to 7.5 range, you’ll likely need to use a combination of these products. Always follow the product’s instructions to safely control your aquarium’s pH level.;
, For optimal growth, the water’s temperature should stay between 72 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit (22 to 28 Celsius). Use a thermometer to check the tank’s temperature regularly and adjust accordingly.

If the water is too cold, install an aquarium heater. The wattage you need will depend on your aquarium’s size, with 100 watts being suited for 20 gallon tanks, 175 watts for 55 gallon tanks and 300 watts for 100 gallon tanks.
To cool an aquarium in hotter seasons, you can replace the glass top with a screen, and position a fan so it blows across the water. If the water is too warm for an extended period, you should consider getting a chiller, which will help cool the water., While Amazon Swords can tolerate various light intensities, you’ll want to keep them in low to medium lighting conditions. Too much light might cause leaf burn, making your plant more likely to start wilting. Make sure to keep the lights on for a good chunk of the day to promote growth., Amazon Sword plants need nutrient-rich soil, especially rich in iron, in order to thrive. If you need to add soil (also called substrate) to your aquarium tank without removing everything, you can use a PVC pipe, two inches in diameter (5 cm) to deliver the substrate. Gently push the pipe into your existing soil to create a seal, then pour your substrate through. Lift the PVC pipe slightly to spread it around the bottom of the tank.

Alternatively, you can transfer your fish and uproot any plants in your tank to change your soil. You shouldn’t need to remove the water from the tank to do this., Scoop out a small hole, wide enough to cover the Amazon Sword’s root bundle. The hole should be high enough that the plant’s crown (where the roots meet the stem) is just at the soil line. Set the plant in the hole and scoop the dirt back onto the roots. It’s important that you pack the dirt tightly around the roots to prevent the plant from floating up. Make sure not to cover the plant’s crown, as you bury the roots., Amazon Swords can grow quite large, so you want to avoid placing them near the middle or the front of your aquarium. Not only will they obscure your view of the tank, but they can overtake other plants and even block out the tank’s lights., Amazon Sword plants can grow to be up to 20 inches in height, and will grow long running stalks that spread into new plants. If you don’t have a particularly large tank, it’s even more important to prune the plant effectively. Prune it away from the light sources, which it tends to snuff out, and keep it from spreading too wildly around the tank. It’s best to use shears for this., Wilting Amazon Sword leaves won’t heal or regain their green sheen. Once you notice leaves that have turned transparent, brown or are wilting, you should pluck them from the main plant. You can use shears to trim them off, but you can also just pull them off with your hands. Grab the leaf as close to the stem as possible, and pull upwards. Dead leaves should come off without using too much pressure., Aquariums are complex ecosystems, and any number of factors might cause algae to start growing on your Amazon Swords. If this starts to happen, use a microfiber cloth to wipe off the algae regularly. If the situation doesn’t resolve itself after a few days, it might be caused by a nutrient imbalance in the tank, overfeeding or improperly maintained filters."

Place the tree fern into the hole.,
Firm the dug out soil around the tree fern.,
Water thoroughly.",How to Plant a Tree Fern," Visit the local nursery and make your choice, keeping space and garden theme in mind.

, The area needs to have well drained soil and be easy to keep watered.

, You might need to soak the ground first to help make digging easier.

, One-third of the tree trunk should be sitting in the ground. You might need help to lift the tree fern carefully and to have one person hold it in place while the other person fills in the soil.
, Add well-rotted compost around the base of the tree fern.

, Saturate the newly planted tree fern as a welcome home gift, to help it settle in nicely. Water the top of the tree where the fronds meet as well as the planting area on the ground.

Select a container that is 5 to 10 inches (12.7 to 25.4 cm) tall and 5 to 10 inches wide, depending on the size of the plant.,
Avoid plastic containers.,
Be aware that algae thrives in clear containers.,
Use pea gravel, aquarium gravel or small glass aquarium marbles.,
Pour the gravel, stones or marbles into a bucket or colander.,
Rinse them once more with distilled or purified water.,
Pour the cleaned gravel, stones or marbles into the bottom of the container to a depth of 1 to 2 inches.,
Finish filling the container one handful at a time.,
Pour distilled or purified water into the container until the stones are covered.,
Place your lucky bamboo in a spot with bright, indirect light.,
Change the water every one to two weeks, using distilled or purified water.,
Notice if the plant's stems are starting to get mushy when you water it.,
Be aware that lucky bamboo is not an edible plant.",How to Plant Bamboo in Water," Lucky bamboo will eventually grow to a height of 3 to 5 feet but, if it is only 8 to 10 inches tall, a 5-inch square container is more than large enough., They are usually too light, even with stones at the bottom as they can easily be tipped over.


Look for glass or ceramic containers, as these are heavier and more durable.

, Clear glass containers are often to show off the color of the stones and the lucky bamboo roots, making the plant more visually appealing.If you do choose to plant the lucky bamboo in a clear container, be prepared to wash the algae out of the container every week or two when you change the water.

, Purchase enough of this material to fill the container.Lucky bamboo can be grown in potting soil that contains coarse sand and vermiculite for fast drainage but it is usually grown in water., Set it in a sink or tub and wash the gravel, stones or marbles with tap water to remove any residual dust or dirt.

, This will help to remove any lingering salts, fluoride or chlorine commonly found in tap water. Chlorine, fluoride and dissolved salts are harmful to lucky bamboo plants as these substances will cause the bamboo’s leaves to develop brown, dry edges.


Chlorine will dissipate naturally if the water is left in an open container for 24 to 36 hours.
Distilled and purified water can be purchased at the grocery store and most convenience stores.
Tap water can be used if you have a purifying system that attaches to the faucet, or a water purifying pitcher that removes dissolved salts and fluoride.

, Insert the lucky bamboo stems into the container. Hold them upright with the bottoms of the stems touching the top of the gravel, stones or marbles.

, Make sure you spread the gravel evenly around the lucky bamboo stems. Fill the container to within 1 to 2 inches of the top., These plants should not be planted in plain tap water.

, Keep in mind that lucky bamboo does not grow quickly even under the best of circumstances., If the water is not changed regularly, bacteria can grow, resulting in root rot and mushy stems., If this occurs, throw the plant away.


Wash the container and stones or gravel with hot soapy water and soak them in a 10 percent bleach water solution for 5 to 10 minutes to kill the bacteria before reusing them for a new lucky bamboo plant.

, However, it is considered safe and non-toxic to people and pets."

Choose plants that can handle cold temperatures.,
Select plants that bloom in the fall.,
Consider plants with colourful foliage.,
Try planting vegetables.",How to Plant an Autumn Container Garden1," When you are planting a fall container garden, it is important to choose plants that can survive cold temperatures, including frost. Take into consideration the climate in your region, and choose plants that can survive well into the winter months. Here are a few plants to consider when designing a fall container garden.New Zealand flax.
Begonias .
Pansies.
Heuchera.
Evergreens.
Ornamental grasses, such as carex.;
, If you would like your container garden to have a pop of colour, then you should select plants that bloom and flower in the fall. These plants can continue to flower with less light as the days get shorter. In the late fall and early winter months many plants will lose their leaves and colour. The landscape can begin to look grey and drab. As a result, you can add colour to your yard through the use of autumn container gardens. The following plants will provide flowers well into the fall and come in a variety of colours:Chrysanthemums.
Pansies.
Ornamental kale.

, When designing an autumn container garden, you can also add colour using foliage. For instance, many non-flowering plant varieties will produce colourful leaves during the fall. These are excellent for autumn containers because they are often hardier plants that can survive the cold weather and also add texture and colour to your garden.For example, heuchera has colourful fall foliage and works well in fall container gardens.
Similarly, ornamental grasses in the autumn months can have an orange or purple hue to them that work well in container gardens.
Avoid planting sweet potato vines or coleus. Despite the fact that they are an excellent colour, they will not be able to survive the cold fall climate.

, You can also try planting some hearty vegetables in the fall. Many gardeners lament the fact that they can no longer grow flowers or vegetables in the colder seasons. This is not necessarily true. There are a variety of vegetable plants that can continue to thrive even after the first frost. If you are interested in growing a fall vegetable container garden, consider these plants:Garlic: Can continue to grow throughout the winter and even survive during frosty weather conditions.
Kale: Thrives in the fall and early winter months. Cannot survive the coldest winter climate, but will live through early winter.
Turnips: Will continue to grow in a container garden through the winter as long as they are buried deep in the soil.
Carrots: Will also grow during the winter as long as they are buried deep within a container for warmth.

Make sure you have enough space in your garden.,
Be aware that sweet shrub can grow very tall.,
Grow sweet shrub in moist, rich, slightly acidic soil.,
Plant your sweet shrub in a shady location.,
Make sure to plant Sweet Shrub in a location where you can enjoy its scent.",How to Plant a Sweet Shrub1," It's important to be aware that Sweet Shrub lasts a long time and can be quite invasive. As a result, you may prefer it in a large garden as it may spread too wide if you only have a smaller patch.

Sweet Shrub is a prolific seed producer but the plant tends to spread by putting out suckers that root themselves. You may want to be vigilant about that if you want to control the plant in your own garden.



 


Also take care that it doesn't invade your neighbors! Pinch out suckers in the spring to contain the plant’s spread.





;
, Sweet shrub plants not only spread widely, they can also grow very tall; some gardeners report varieties ten feet tall but 3–8 feet (0.9–2.4 m) tall is more common for a mature plant. They are also long-lived.

, Sweet Shrub isn't fussy about the kind of soil it grows in, but it will do best in a moist, rich soil with plenty of room for growth.

Avoid boggy locations or anywhere puddles tend to linger after rainfall. The plant won’t mind a clay soil.






Sweet shrub also has a slight preference for neutral or slightly acid soil.







, Sweet Shrub will grow in both sun and shade but usually favors shady locations. Sweet Shrub plants grown in full sun will grow more slowly and won’t reach the same height as shade-grown plants.In nature the plant would grow in woody areas, so it thrives best in dappled shade.


If you have a patch of trees in your yard that offer partial shade, consider planting Sweet Shrub underneath.

, Many people like to plant the Sweet Shrub bush in proximity to a house, seating area or pathway to fully benefit from the scent. It’s also common to plant them under windows to enjoy the fragrance inside the house.

Make sure plants are close together.,
Include plants with complementary colours and heights.,
Use containers that won’t crack in freezing temperatures.",How to Plant an Autumn Container Garden2," In the spring and summer months you typically space plants further apart in container gardens because the plants will grow into each other as they mature. In the fall, however, place plants closer together in order to fill the container. These plants will likely stagnate and not grow much bigger. As a result, you should select plants that are already mature and place them close to each other to create a full and beautiful container garden., In order to design an appealing autumn container garden, you should take into consideration the colour and size of the plants. Choose colours that complement each other. You should also select plants that are a variety of heights. For instance, you do not want to plant all low bedding with no taller plants to add variety. Instead, you should look to include ground cover, taller plants, and maybe even a few plants that will hang over the edges of the container.For example, you could plant red chrysanthemums with some yellow ornamental grasses and green and purple heuchera.
This will cover different height levels and will give an excellent pop of colour to your home in the autumn months.

, It is also important to consider the type of container to use in the fall and winter months. Clay pots may crack and break in the colder weather. Instead, you should use fiberglass, iron, stone, or thick plaster containers that can stand up to the changing weather conditions. Many of these options are extremely heavy and may be difficult to move around.Try planting in a lightweight plastic container and then placing that inside your larger stone or iron containers.This will also make it easier for you to take out and switch plants between seasons.

Water less in the autumn.,
Protect your plants from frost damage.,
Position the containers in as much light as possible.,
Do not use fertilizer in the autumn.",How to Plant an Autumn Container Garden3," The cooler temperatures associated with the autumn months result in less plant growth. As a result, plants do not need to be watered as frequently in the fall as they do in the spring and summer. Check plants before watering them, to determine if they need water. Look at and touch the soil to see if it is dry. Typically dry soil is light in colour. Water the entire root area until water begins to drain out the bottom of the pot.In the autumn you will likely only need to water your container garden one to two times per week., Although it is important to select plants that can handle frost, you can also take some added steps to further protect your container garden from frost damage. There are a number of things that can be done to avoid frost damage in the fall. Try out these tips to ensure your container garden stays healthy:


Place the container in a sheltered area: At night, if there is frost in the forecast, you should move your containers into a sheltered place. For example, move into the corner of the front porch so that it is protected from the wind.
Bring containers inside at night. If there is a sustained cold period, you may want to bring the containers in at night. This will protect your plants from the elements.
Raise containers off the ground. For example, you can purchase a container that has pot feet, or place the container on bricks. This will aid with drainage and can help prevent the pot from cracking in the cold weather.Place a sheet or fabric over the plants. If you are experiencing a cold snap, you can give your plants added protection by covering them with an old sheet or piece of fabric., You should situate container gardens in an area that gets as much sunlight as possible during the shortened fall days. This will help to keep your plants healthy and green for longer. Do not keep the planter under a covered porch and in the shade all day. This can increase the speed at which the plants become dormant., Although fertilizer is recommended throughout the spring and summer months to help plant growth, it is less important in the autumn. Typically, controlled release fertilizers are impacted by the temperature and as a result not much fertilizer is released for plant use during colder temperatures. Because of this fertilizer is unnecessary.


If you live in a milder climate you may find that fertilizer is necessary in the autumn.
Use a water-soluble fertilizer in the autumn because it will be more effective.

Grow Sweet Shrub from seeds.,
Grow Sweet Shrub from cuttings.,
Grow Sweet Shrub from a nursery plant.",How to Plant a Sweet Shrub2," Sweet Shrub can easily be grown from seeds. Simply sow the seeds in springtime (March or April), preferably in a shady area of the garden in rich, well-drained, loamy soil.

Some gardeners are unlucky enough to chance upon an unscented variety when growing from seed. To prevent this, you can try planting more seeds than you need plants and removing any that emerge unscented when the plants eventually flower.






It will take two or three years for a plant grown from seed to flower. Flowers first appear in mid-March and continue into May.







, Your Sweet Shrub will flower faster if you grow it from plant cuttings instead of from seeds. Take the cuttings from a scented bush and plant them in July.

Plant the cuttings in the same conditions as you would the seeds and water until well-established.






Growing Sweet Shrub from cuttings will eliminate the chance of you growing an unscented variety of the shrub.

, If you are buying a nursery plant, try to buy it while it is blooming to get an idea of the fragrance. Plant in loamy soil, in shade conditions.

Alternately you can buy a named cultivar that is known for having a good fragrance. 'Michael Lindsey' is known for having a pleasant fragrance as well as attractive shiny leaves.






Avoid taking plants from the wild as these are endangered in some areas.

Prune sweet shrub in early summer, after flowering.,
Water sweet shrub frequently until well-established.,
Protect your Sweet Shrub from disease.,
Transplant Sweet Shrub in fall or winter.,
Harvest the seeds once they turn brown.,
Don't eat any part of the Sweet Shrub plant.",How to Plant a Sweet Shrub3," Sweet Shrub requires little in the way of maintenance, but you may like to prune it to keep the plant in shape and prevent it from growing too wide. Pruning should be done immediately after flowering, which means in the early summer.

Due to the fact that this plant spreads by producing side shoots known as suckers, you can control the width by pinching these off as they emerge.






Thinning out old growth will usually ensure the new growth comes through more vigorously the following growing season.







, After you have planted Sweet Shrub, it's important to keep it watered until it is well-established, regardless of whether you planted it from seed, cuttings or nursery plant.


Once established, Sweet Shrub is very tolerant of dry conditions. As a result, it will only need light watering during periods of drought, when you should water it once a week.

, Sweet Shrub doesn’t tend to be bothered by disease but root rot can occur in poorly-drained soil. To avoid this, don’t plant the bush where puddles form and don’t easily drain away.

If you observe warty growths on stems close to the ground, this may indicate bacterial crown gall.






The best solution is to remove the plant and surrounding soil to prevent re-infection.







, If you need to transplant Sweet Shrub, do it in fall or winter. Take cuttings in July if you wish to quickly reproduce from a parent plant.


To reproduce a plant from suckers, take a rooted sucker and replant it until a proper root system is established before planting on.
This is usually the fastest way to get a mature flowering plant.

, Wait until the seed pods turn brown if you wish to harvest the Sweet Shrub seeds. Don’t wait any longer though – the seeds are best planted mature but fresh.


The seeds are best planted immediately. If this isn't possible, keep them for up to 3 months wrapped in moss inside a plastic bag in the refrigerator.

, Although it has been eaten as a spice in the past, Sweet Shrub is poisonous in large enough quantities, especially the seed. Don’t confuse it will true Allspice, which is best purchased from the grocery store!"

Account for personal taste.,
Plant in the fall or spring.,
Place plants with similar needs close to each other.,
Water regularly.,
Check the soil moisture.,
Reduce watering.,
Mulch the plant bed.,
Control the amount of sunlight.",How to Plant a Low Water Garden," Different types of plants do well in different climates. If you live in a dry, arid climate, you want to plant things from similar climates. The same holds true if you live in a wetter, cooler climate. Plants that are native to your area are always a good place to start when considering what will grow in your climate.For example, you wouldn’t plant a cactus in marshlands, but it would do really well in a desert climate.
Other low water plants, such as hostas, will do well in drier climates.;
, For any plant that you choose, you should know its soil requirements. Some plants require high levels of organic material in the soil, while others can do without it. You might also run into plants that are sensitive to salt content and other nutrient factors. How quickly your soil drains should be considered as well. Some plants require a quick-draining soil.Crab grass and silky thread grass both do well in most soils and require little water.

, Before deciding where to plant your plants, make sure that there is adequate sunlight. You can measure this by simply noticing when the sun hits the garden area and when the area is taken over by shade. If there are at least eight hours in between, the garden should do fine.Unless the plant(s) you have chosen specifically calls for less, the garden area should receive at least eight hours of direct sunlight each day.

, Low water plants range from grasses to cacti. Look at different plants in a garden catalog or online. You can also visit a local greenhouse or garden store to see plants up close. Plant the ones that are most satisfying to you. A few common choices are:Blanket Flower
Sea Holly
Lavender
Salvia
Kangaroo Paw
Cacti
Hostas

, You should be planting in the fall to spring time frame. That said, planting in fall is typically best. Planting in fall gives the root system time to set in the soil before the summer heat hits the plant. The soil is also subject to less evaporation during the fall than in warmer months., Over watering and under watering are both bad for plants. If you have a group of plants with different water needs, it is easy to flood some in order to give others the water they need. Instead, group plants with similar needs together so that maintaining your garden is as easy as giving each group of plants the right amount of watering., For the first year, the root system will be poorly set in the soil. This means that you will need to water your plant regularly to allow the root system to develop. Even though your plants are low water, they will require regular watering until their roots are well developed., Use a spade to remove the surface soil. Check the moisture near the roots before and after watering. If the soil is dry, you need to water more. If it is saturated, you should use less water next time. Ideally, the soil will be moist but not saturated., After the first year, low water plants will need much less watering. You may still need to water occasionally (once a week or so) in the second year. By the third year, most low water plants require monthly waterings at the most. Many will require no watering at all., Spread mulch over the plant bed to keep the soil cool. This also helps to prevent water from evaporating out of the soil. You should use mulch layer to prevent weeds from growing in your garden and keep the soil from being washed away., If your garden gets too much sunlight, you can plant a tall tree nearby to cast shade over the garden. Another option is to build a lattice or other structure to partially block the sunlight. Make sure that you do allow adequate sunlight into the garden, however, or your plants will suffer."

You will also want to select a soil made especially for growing seeds.Make sure your seed starting trays or pots have holes for proper drainage. If you choose to plant in a pot rather than starting in trays, a six inch (15 cm) pot should be good enough to start.
Look for a soil that is made especially for starting seeds, or make your own by combining 1 part each of peat moss, vermiculite, and perlite.;
, Starting plants, especially herbs and vegetables, from seeds is not always easy, so it’s important to select seeds that have a good chance of being successful. Herbs and vegetables such as lettuce are good choices to start in pots.Remember to check your hardiness zone to make sure you are growing a plant that will survive in your area if you plan to keep it outdoors or transplant it later on.Look at your local nursery or farmer’s market for seeds that have been carefully screened and selected for quality.

, Rinse out your pots or seed trays to remove any dust and particulates, and moisten your soil. The soil should be damp but not wet. Then, fill your pot up to half an inch (1.25 cm) from the top with your soil mixture.It is also sometimes recommended that a thin layer of sand be added to the bottom of the pot before soil to promote better drainage.

, Your seed packet will typically let you know how deep to plant your seeds, and how far apart each seed should be. Consult your seed packet, or otherwise talk to the seed provider, to get specific instructions regarding how deep and how far apart seeds need to be planted.Your seed packet will also tell you the best time of year to start sowing your seeds, if you plan on keeping the pots outdoors.

, Once you are fully prepared to start planting, place your seeds in the pot as indicated on the seed packets. Gently press in the seeds, or lightly cover them with a seed-starting mixture or mulch.You can use toothpicks to tweezers to help you distribute and press in larger seeds.

, Use a mister or a small watering can to moisten the seeds after planting. The top layer of seed starter or mulch should be damp, but not wet. Be sure to add small amounts of water at a time, as adding too much could displace or wash away the seeds., Most seeds will need a consistent temperature of between 65° and 75° Fahrenheit (18° to 24° C) and regular exposure to sunlight to properly germinate. Keep your seeds in a climate controlled environment and a sunny area where your seeds will get a full day’s worth of exposure.If you live in an area where sunlight or temperature is variable, you may also consider purchasing a sun lamp or heating mats to help encourage your seeds to grow.
Some seed starting trays come with a cover to create a warm, moist environment for the seeds. Keep this on until the seeds sprout from the soil.
If you don't have a cover, you can slip a plastic bag over the pot to keep moisture in until the seeds sprout. Keep the seeds out of direct sunlight while the cover is on, or they will overheat.

, Water the seeds as the soil starts to dry. It should always be moist, but never wet or muddy. Do not water the seeds if the soil is already moist to the touch, as overwatering your plant can be just as harmful as underwatering., After the seeds have sprouted, give your pot a quarter turn each day. This will prevent your seeds from overreaching toward the light, which can cause weaker stems. , Once your seeds start to sprout leaves, you will need to ensure they get proper nutrients. Use a half-strength liquid fertilizer on a weekly or every-other-week basis to keep them growing strong. You can increase the strength of the mixture gradually as the plants grow bigger., If you started your seedlings in trays, you will eventually need to transplant them to a pot or outdoors. Likewise, as potted plants grow you may need to move them into larger pots. Monitor your plant to make sure it has plenty of room to grow in the pot. If it is outgrowing its space, transplant it into a larger container.

Select a type of plant that thrives in your growing region.Not all plants can grow in every region.,
Know what time of year to plant the seed.,
Get seed-starting supplies.",How to Plant a Seed1," An area's temperature and climate factor greatly in the plant's chances of success. If you live in a northern region, for example, you'll have trouble growing a plant native to a tropical rainforest. When you pick out seeds to plant, do a little research to make sure the plant species does well in your area.


If you have a greenhouse or plan to grow your plant indoors, you may be able to plant a seed even if the species is not native to your growing region.
A good way to figure out what plants grow well in your area is to visit a local nursery and talk with an employee there. He or she will be able to help you pick out hardy seeds that have a great chance of germinating and growing into healthy plants.
Some seeds are easy to plant in many growing regions and under a lot of different conditions. Look for ""easy seeds,"" which are hardy and simple to grow for the beginning gardener.
In the US, you can look up your USDA hardiness zone. Find a seed that grows well in your zone.;
, The time of year you plant seeds is determined by both the plant's needs and your growing region. If you live in a place with long, cold winters, you may need to wait until mid-Spring to plant your seeds. If you live in a place that warms up early in the year, you can probably start earlier. Check your seed packet for information on how early to start your seeds.


Starting seeds too early or late can prevent germination from occurring, so it's important to figure out the right time to plant to ensure success.
If you are starting seeds indoors, you should keep in mind that most vegetable seeds need to be started at least two weeks before the last frost, and some as early as 2-3 months before the last frost. Even if you live in a cold area, you'll need to plan ahead to make sure you start your seeds in time for the growing season.
Some seeds should be planted directly in the soil outside. Always research your specific seed and plant to understand how best to start it.

, Most seeds need similar growing conditions when they're first starting out. When the seeds sprout and grow into plants, they'll have more specific needs in terms of soil, sun, and temperature conditions. To get ready for planting seeds, you'll need the following supplies:


Seed containers. Each seed will need 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of space to germinate and take root. You can grow them all together in an open flat, or choose individual seed containers. Try making your own containers out of recycled yogurt cups or egg cartons.
Seed growing medium. Seeds contain all the nutrients they need to germinate, so there's no need to use a growing medium that has been enriched with nutrients. Don't use potting soil, since it's too dense for fragile new roots to penetrate. Use a mix of vermiculite or perlite and either peat moss, coir, or compost.Nurseries sell bags of seed-starting mix if you don't want to make your own.
Depending on what you are growing, you may need equipment to provide enough light and heat. Some seeds do much better with a heat mat under the soil, and many require overhead lighting. When considering grow lights, research what how much light a plant requires and how intense the lighting should be."
"
Prepare the growing containers.,
Sow the seeds.,
Keep the seeds moist.,
Keep the seedlings healthy.,
Weed out the weaker seedlings.",How to Plant a Seed2," Start by moistening the seed-starting medium thoroughly, so that it provides a good growing environment for the seeds. Fill the containers with the medium, leaving about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of space between the top of the growing medium and the rim of the containers. Place the containers in a sunny, well-ventilated area with a steady, warm temperature.

, The way you sow your seeds is depending on what type of plant you're growing, so it's necessary to read the seed packet carefully first. Many seeds can be scattered evenly across the surface of the growing medium. Be sure not to place too many seeds in the same growing container, since you don't want them to crowd each other too much.


Most seeds should be planted twice as deep as they are wide. Some seeds should be planted about 1⁄2 to 1⁄4 inch (1.3 to 0.6 cm) below the surface of the growing medium. Check your seed pack to make sure you sow the seeds correctly.
Some seeds do best when they are chilled or soaked before sowing.
Be sure you're providing the right sunlight conditions for your specific seed species. Most seeds can germinate without light, but they'll need sun as soon as they sprout.
Most seeds do best with a temperature of about 78 degrees, but some need colder or warmer conditions to germinate.

, Seed growing medium tends to dry out quickly, since there's no soil to hold the water. Be sure to water the seeds consistently, never allowing them to dry out too much.


You can lightly drape a piece of plastic wrap over the seed trays to help trap in moisture.
Don't overwater the containers, or the seeds could become waterlogged. They should be moist, but not dripping wet.

, As the seeds sprout into seedlings, you'll see thin green stems emerge from the growing medium. If the containers aren't already placed in a sunny area, be sure to move them to a place with direct sunlight or provide them with grow lights overhead. Keep them moist at all times and make sure the temperature never drops below the recommended level.


You can place a heat mat under the seed starting tray to maintain the correct temperature.

, After a week or two, weed out the weaker-looking seedlings so that the stronger ones have more room to grow. Leave about 2 - 3 seedlings per container.

"
"
Plan to transplant after the last frost.,
Move the seedling container to a covered outdoor area.,
Prepare the planting bed according to the plant's needs.,
Plant the seedlings in the ground.,
Water and fertilize the seedlings.",How to Plant a Seed3," If you timed the planting right, the seedlings should have a set of mature leaves and be ready to transplant in time for the growing season, which starts after the last frost of the year. This falls in a different month depending on where you live. If you're unsure when the last frost might take place, ask for advice at your local nursery.

, A few days before you're ready to plant the seedlings, move them to an outdoor shed or garage. Start by giving them an hour outside a day, and increase the amount of time over a week or two. This helps them get used to the outdoor climate before you place them directly in the ground. Without this extra time to acclimate, the shock of the transplant may cause them to suffer.


If you don't have a covered outdoor area, you can place the seedlings outside and construct a makeshift shelter. Leave them in the sun during the day, and cover them with a cardboard box to protect them from the wind at night.
You could also match the temperature in the room where the seedlings are kept to the temperature outside.

, The planting bed should be located in an area that gets the proper amount of sunlight and shade your plant needs. The soil should have the correct pH balance and composition of nutrients. Be sure that it drains well, too.


You can change the pH of the soil by adding amendments like compost or manure. If you are doing this, you should prepare the bed a week or two before planting.

, Dig holes in the ground that are roughly the size of your seedling containers. Make sure the holes are spaced far enough apart so that the plants have plenty of room to grow. Carefully lift the seedlings from their containers, gently separate the root balls a bit, and plant them in the holes.

, As they grow, continue providing the correct conditions for the plants to grow healthy.

Divide only when needed.",How to Plant Allium Bulbs," Plant allium bulbs once the trees start losing their leaves. Usually, you can plant them any date between late September and late November as long as the ground hasn't frozen yet.


Roots tend to form in the fall. You may also notice a few sprouts in the fall if you live in warmer climates, but most stems and buds form in the spring.;
, Alliums love the sun, so they thrive best when you plant them in a garden bed that receives full sun—six hours or more of direct sunlight. The soil can be of average nutritional quality, but it should drain well.Most alliums can also grow in partial sun to light shade, but the stems might become weaker with less sunlight, and weak stems may not be able to support the weight of the flowers once they bloom.
To determine whether or not the soil drains well, pay attention to it after a heavy rain. If you can spot puddles five to six hours after the last drop of rain, the soil is too compact and does not drain adequately well.

, While starting with well-draining soil will make things easier for you, you can also amend the soil to improve its drainage abilities. Mix in 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm) of organic material like peat moss, compost, ground bark, or decomposed manure.


Dig this material into the top 12 to 18 inches (30 to 45 cm) of soil to ensure that the soil near the bulb will drain well.
As a general rule, you do not need to amend the soil for the sake of adding nutritional content. Allium bulbs can grow in soils with poor nutritional quality, but they will rot in soggy soils.

, Dig a hole that is roughly two to three times the diameter of the bulb. This may seem deep, but bulbs do better when planted deep and tend to weaken if planted in shallow depths.


When planting multiple allium bulbs, the bulbs should be spaced 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) apart.
Consider spreading a 2-inch (5-cm) layer of agricultural grit or spent compost at the bottom of the hole before laying the bulb inside.Doing so can improve drainage conditions.

, The stalk will grow out of the pointed end, so that pointed end must be positioned upward when you place the bulb in the ground.

, To ensure that the bulbs are well protected and well fed, you need to minimize the amount of air pockets in the soil. Do this by using your hands and feet to flatten the soil over the bulb, packing it in as firmly as possible.

, Add enough water to thoroughly dampen the soil. You need the soil to become saturated and heavy so that it settles around the bulb.

, Regardless of whether you keep the containers indoors or outdoors, you should still plant the bulbs in the fall once you notice leaves dropping from the trees in your neighborhood. Fall planting allows the bulbs to develop their roots and makes it easier for them to follow their natural growing cycle.


You may want to consider keeping the containers in a cool location during the winter. Allium bulbs actually thrive when they are allowed to cool down during the dormant season. You do not need to keep the containers outside, but storing them in a garage, basement, root cellar, or shed works well.

, The container you use should be about five to six times deeper than the diameter of the bulb. It should also be wide enough to allow 6 inches (15 cm) of free space in between the bulb and all sides of the container.


There should be at least four moderately sized drainage holes at the bottom of your container. Use a drill to create holes if necessary. Allium bulbs will rot if they are forced to sit in waterlogged soil.

, Most commercial potting mediums work well enough, but you should opt for one that feels fairly light over one that feels heavy and dense.


Keep in mind that allium bulbs do not have many nutritional needs, but they do need well-draining soil. Dense soils that retain moisture can cause the bulbs to rot.

, Allium bulbs can grow in partial sun to light shade, but they thrive in areas of full sun. Place the container in a spot that receives at least six hours of direct sunlight daily.


Large amounts of sunlight will help the alliums develop strong stems, and strong stems are more likely to support large blooms.
If your container is too large to move, make sure that you position it in your desired location before adding the soil and planting the bulbs.
If you are able to move your container, move it to different areas of the house or garden throughout the day so that it receives as much sunlight as possible.

, Roots grow from the rounded end of the bulb and a stem emerges from the point, so you need to make sure that the pointed side of the bulb faces upward when you place the bulb in the soil.


If you plant more than one bulb in each container, make sure that the bulbs are 6 inches (15 cm) apart and 6 inches (15 cm) away from the side of the container.
Dig a hole that is two to three times the diameter of the bulb when planting it. Consider sprinkling in 2 inches (5 cm) of compost before you place the bulb in the hole for improved drainage and nutrition.

, Pack the soil in with your hands as firmly as possible to minimize the amount of air pockets. The bulbs will grow best when protected by packed soil.

, Water the bulb until you can see a little water running out from the drainage holes at the bottom of your container. The soil needs to be saturated and heavy so that it packs itself in around the bulb.

, Allium bulbs need minimal moisture, but they should get about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water per week. You may not need to water them during regular periods of rainfall, but you should consider watering them lightly during dry periods.


You only need to water the bulbs during their active growth periods—spring, summer, and early fall. Once the plant enters dormancy, you can stop watering it.

, You shouldn't need to worry about pests, rodents, or diseases when you plant alliums.They are not susceptible to any serious plant diseases, and they actually tend to drive off deer, rodents, and most insects. As such, pesticides and fungicides are not necessary.


Since alliums are so good at discouraging garden pests, they are often used as a border plant. Consider positioning alliums around the perimeter of your garden to protect more tempting flowers lying further in.

, If you decide to pick the flowers for decorative purposes, leave behind as many leaves as possible. The bulb will produce flowers each year but it needs to gather as many nutrients through photosynthesis as possible each season. Its leaves are crucial in this process.


Allium flowers can be used in bouquets and similar decorations, just like any other garden flower. Some stalks can have a slight onion scent, but in most cases, the scent isn't noticeable to the human nose.

, The leaves tend to turn yellow by mid-summer. Once you see them die back on their own, you can bet that the plant is slipping into dormancy. You can cut away leaves and foliage at this point.


Do not cut off the foliage after the blooms drop. The leaves still need to gather sunlight to produce energy so that the bulb can be strengthened for next season.

, While not strictly necessary, it can be a good idea to give the bulbs a light feeding of potash during the early spring, before you see any stems peek through the soil.


For average to good soils, this really isn't necessary. Consider doing it if your soil condition is poor, though.
Potash feed will encourage root and bulb formation. It refers to any potassium-rich fertilizer.

, If you notice a decrease in flower production after a few years, you might need to divide the bulbs and replant them to encourage better growth.This especially applies to smaller bulbs. Many large bulbs are self-propagating and take care of the process themselves.
Divide the bulbs after they enter dormancy but before the ground freezes. Dig out the clump of bulbs using a garden fork, working carefully to avoid cutting into the bulbs.
After you remove the clump of bulbs, gently shake off excess dirt before carefully twisting the bulbs apart one at a time. Allow the roots to untangle themselves and do not tear them apart.

Choose a planting area with six or more hours of sunshine.,
Give flowering almonds plenty of room to grow.,
Try to plant your flowering shrubs as soon as possible after purchasing them.,
Plant container, B&B, and bare-rooting flowering shrubs in the fall right after the first frost.,
Use loamy soil that is high in organic matter.,
Dig a planting hole that is twice the width of the flowering almond root mass.,
Remove the shrub from the container and set it in the hole.,
Fill the hole halfway with backfill soil.,
Finish filling the hole.,
Create a 3-inch high ridge of dirt around the outer edge of the root mass.,
Give the flowering almond 2 to 3 gallons (7.6 to 11.4 L) of water two to three times a week.,
Water the tree with a gallon jug or watering can.,
Check the root mass by poking a finger into the center.",How to Plant a Flowering Almond Shrub," Flowering almonds will bloom more profusely when planted in full sunlight. However, they can also be planted in areas with partial shade and at least four hours of direct sunlight each day.


Do not plant them in areas where water tends to puddle or where the soil drains slowly as flowering almonds commonly develop root rot in slow-draining soil.
Flowering Almond shrubs are fairly easy to grow in nearly any type of soil but they must be planted properly in order to thrive. They do well in shrub borders and naturalized areas and can be planted as informal hedges, specimen plants or accent plants.;
, There should be at least 1 foot of space between them and any other shrubs or structures after they reach their mature width.


Dwarf flowering almonds can grow to a width of about 4 feet so they will need to be planted at least 3 feet away from the house and other shrubs.
Full-sized flowering almonds can grow to 15 feet wide so they should be planted at least 8 feet away from shrubs and buildings.

, If they cannot be planted the same day, water them as often as necessary to keep the roots consistently moist until they can be planted in the ground.

, This is the best time to plant container, balled and burlapped (B&B) and bare-root flowering shrubs. They can also be planted during the spring, summer or fall.Bare-root flowering shrubs are leafless, in a dormant state, and do not have any soil on their roots. They are generally smaller than plants sold in containers but are usually 40-70% less expensive than container plants.Planting at this time allows the shrub to devote its energy to spreading its roots, rather than growing stems and leaves, resulting in a better-established shrub in the spring.

, Even though flowering almonds will grow in any type of soil, including clay or sandy soil, adding organic matter before planting will improve the soil texture. It will also add nutrients to the soil, making it easier for the shrub to get established after planting.Well-aged cow manure, compost, sphagnum peat moss, composted pine bark and leaf mold are all good organic matter you can use or combine together to supply the plants with a wide variety of nutrients and textures.
Spread a 2-inch depth of organic matter over the entire planting area and mix it into the soil thoroughly to a depth of 8 to 10 inches with a rototiller.
Do not just add the organic matter to the backfill soil as this will encourage the flowering almond to keep its roots within the planting hole rather than growing out into the surrounding soil, resulting in a shallow-rooted flowering almond that will not thrive.
The soil pH can be acidic, neutral or alkaline., It should not be deeper than the height of the root mass.Planting it deeper than it was growing previously will likely result in root rot or cankers.


Use a dirt shovel to dig the hole.

, Balled and burlapped (B&B) shrubs should be set in the planting hole with the burlap or plastic covering left on the roots.If the root mass is covered in natural burlap, remove the wire or twine holding the burlap closed at the top. Pull the burlap off the top and sides of the root mass but leave it in the bottom of the hole. It will decompose naturally over time. Pulling it all the way off the roots could cause damage.
If the root mass is packaged in a plastic wrap, remove the wire or twine at the top and gently pull the plastic out from under the root mass after setting the shrub in the hole. The plastic will not decompose and will keep the roots from growing into the soil.

, Pour 1 to 2 gallons (3.8 to 7.6 L) of water over the soil to settle it around the roots.

, Then water the shrub with 2 to 3 gallons (7.6 to 11.4 L) of water to finish settling the soil and give the flowering almond a generous drink.

, This will help the supplemental water to soak into the root mass instead of the surrounding soil.Spread a 2- to 3-inch depth of organic mulch over the soil around the shrub but keep it a few inches away from the stems to help prevent stem cankers.

, You will need to adjust this amount if it rains, or when winter arrives and the ground freezes.

, You can also poke a hole in the bottom of a 5 gallon (18.9 L) bucket and set it next to the shrub so the water drains from the hole into the soil directly above the root mass. You can than just fill the bucket halfway each time the shrub needs water.


The root mass must be kept slightly moist at all times but not soaking wet., If the soil is soaking wet, wait a few more days to water the shrub. If soil is dry, water it immediately.


Maintain uniformly moist soil during the following growing season as well. Flowering almonds require lightly moist soil until they become established in the soil, which usually takes about one year.
The shrub will not show obvious signs of over- or under-watering during the fall immediately after planting; however, in the following spring and summer, the leaves will wilt, curl, turn brown or yellow and drop from the branches if the shrub is not getting enough water.If the shrub is being watered too much, new leaves will be yellow or pale green, new stems will wilt and the leaves that stay green may become brittle.

Decide what you want to grow.,

Know when to plant.,
Prepare the soil.,

Care for the plants according to their needs.,
Keep animals and insects away.",How to Plant a Garden," There are many different types of gardens, and they all provide a different type of pleasure. Think about why you want to start a garden when you're deciding what to plant. What type of garden will suit your yard, meet your needs, and bring you the most pleasure?



Vegetable gardens are a practical choice for people who want to be able to eat what they grow. Growing your own vegetables saves a lot of money, and home-grown vegetables are highly nutritious. That said, vegetable gardens require more preparation up front, and they need consistent, ongoing care to ensure they produce a crop.If adding beauty to your home is your primary goal, you may want to grow a flower garden. Choose flowers with different shapes, colors, and textures to create a gorgeous new feature. Plant greenery among them so the garden stays pretty after the blooms have gone for the summer. Flowers do not require strict soil conditions like vegetables do, and they don't take quite as much ongoing care.
If you don't have a lot of space, you can still grow a wonderful garden. Consider growing herbs, which can look beautiful. If you enjoy cooking from scratch, an herb garden can give you access to fresh herbs in your backyard.When you have specific ideas about the type of garden you want to grow, determine which varieties of those plants will grow in your particular growing region.Some varieties of the same plant will grow better in certain climates, regions, and soil types than other varieties.;
, Choose an area of your yard or property with conditions that meet the needs of the plants you want to grow. Many vegetables, for example, need full sun for most of the day. Flowers, on the other hand, often require partial shade to thrive. If your yard has both shade and sun, you can have plants that need both types of conditions. Aside from sun, take the following into account:


Choose an area with good drainage. If you see a puddle of standing water after it rains, the soil there probably has clay or rocks that are preventing the water from draining well. This isn't good for the roots of many types of plants. If the soil conditions aren't ideal, you can always build a raised bed and fill it with nutrient-rich, well drained soil instead.
Consider the aesthetic you're going for. Plant it within view of your home's windows if you want to be able to see it from inside. Plant it in an area away from trees that drop a lot of leaves, so it will be easier to keep neat and trim. Also darker soil tends to be the better soil for plants.
It's easier to garden on flat land, but planting on a hill is also just fine and can have a very pretty effect. Choose an area without a lot of roots and rocks, so the soil won't be too difficult to till. You can have rocks and roots when you start but you must get the roots and rocks out immediately.
Consider the location in regards to how you will use and visit it. If you are growing herbs for cooking purposes, plant them near your back door. If you are growing flowers for ornamental purposes, you may want them somewhere farther away so that you can go on a long stroll.

, You'll need seeds, bulbs, or sprouted seedlings or bulbs to plant. These can be purchased from a catalog, an online store, a dollar store, or your local nursery. You'll also need to figure out which garden tools and other supplies to purchase based on the type of garden you're planting and its size. Simple hand tools will do for small gardens, but if it's bigger than a few yards, the work will be much easier with bigger machines. Consider getting these supplies:


Seeds. Nurseries have great selections, and you can ask the staff there about which varieties do well in your region. Seeds are usually started indoors a month or two before the weather warms and its time to plant. Some seeds, however, do better when planted directly in the ground outside. Check the seed packet for specific recommendations.
Bulbs or seedlings. Seedlings and bulbs can be planted as soon as they're purchased. Some bulbs take years to come up from the ground so you have to be patient.
Fertilizer. This gives your plants an extra nutritional boost, helping them grow strong and healthy. Choose a natural fertilizer like blood meal, bone meal, or compost. You can also get chemical fertilizers geared toward specific plants. The coffee from coffee filters also works okay.
Mulch and topsoil. Many plants should be protected from cool weather and wind when they're first put in the ground. Depending on what you're planting, choose mulch or another ground covering like hay, and pick up some extra topsoil.
A soil tiller. This machine breaks up new ground for the first time. Buy or rent one if your garden area is more than a few years squared. You only need it for the initial tilling if you're not up to breaking the soil by hand. After the first tilling, you can use hand tools to maintain it.
A shovel, a spade, and a garden rake. These essential garden tools are used to dig holes, move plants, and dig weeds.A ruler or measuring tape. This helps you figure out how deep to dig the holes for plants that need to be put into the ground at varying depths and how to space plants at the appropriate distance.
A hose and sprinkler. Can be used for filling a watering can. Or can be set to mist and water the plants itself.
Fencing supplies. Whether you're growing flowers or vegetables, you may want to fence in your garden to keep out deer, rabbits, squirrels and other critters.
Garden notebook. This will help you plan and track your garden activities and harvests. After a few seasons you will have records to look back on so that you can make adjustments to your garden.

, Different vegetables, flowers, herbs and other plants must be planted at specific times of the year. Some plants must be planted before the last frost of the year, some after the temperature has warmed past the frosting point. Some must be planted in the spring, some in the summer, and some in the fall.Pay attention to when you're supposed to plant the items you've chosen to grow.

, Mark the corners of the garden area with rocks, survey flags, stakes, or other markers to show what area the garden will cover. Remove any rocks, roots, sticks, and big weeds from within the boundaries you have marked. Use the soil tiller or a garden fork and rake to break up the ground into small pieces. Work the soil to a depth of about 12 inches (30.5 cm), and mix in compost or fertilizer you're using.Be sure to use the right amount of fertilizer for the plants you're growing. Using too much can actually harm them.
If you're tilling an area with grass, you might want to remove the big clumps of grass as you go to make it easier to till the soil underneath.
If you have too many rocks in the soil, consider building a screen to sift out large rocks. Build a wooden frame to support a square of hardware cloth. After you have broken up the soil, shovel it onto the screen and work the soil through it. Large rocks will be left on top of the screen. You can use these to establish a pathway or border for your new garden.

, Use the spade to dig holes to the correct depth, and be sure to space them far enough apart that each individual plant will have enough room to grow.Place the seedlings in the ground and fill in the holes with topsoil. Finish with a layer of mulch, if necessary.

, A new garden should be kept moist at all times. If the seedlings dry out, they will be likely to die before they mature. Use the garden hoses to spray the area with water in the morning.


Check the soil often. If it seems to be dry, water it again.
Don't water the area in the evening, since if water sits overnight it can cause mold to grow. If your plants look like they need water, however, it is better to water them at night than not at all, as long as you do not make a habit of it.

, As your garden grows, so will weeds. It's important to pull them out before they crowd out your vegetables and flowers. Be diligent and weed at least twice a week to prevent this from happening.

, Some plants are low maintenance, while others need consistent care throughout the growing season and beyond. Here are the factors you should take into consideration:


How often does the plant need to be watered? It usually tapers off after the first few weeks.
How often does the plant need to be fertilized? Some need to be fertilized more than once during the growing season.
Does the plant need to be pruned? Some plants grow healthier when extra stems, leaves and dead blossoms are removed.
Does the plant need support? Some plants do much better with a trellis, stake, or cage to support their limbs as they grow heavy fruits.

, You may need to take measures to protect your garden from deer, birds, squirrels, and insects that enjoy eating plants. If you see holes in your plants or other signs that there's a problem, determine what type of creature is causing it and take appropriate measures.


Erecting a small fence can be an effective way to keep animals out.
Natural insect deterrents often work quite well, and they keep your garden organic.
Try planting at least 20% of your garden with flowers to attract beneficial predators that will eat the pests. Some plants also help repel insects, such as basil and geraniums."

Purchase ladybugs or their larvae if these insects are not showing up in your garden on their own. You can order them from distributors online, or check with your local garden shop.;
, Birds are natural pesticides. They will eat the unwelcome insects in your garden, so attract them to the area.


Use sunflowers to attract birds as well. If you plant them in your garden side by side like a hedge, you can also create a border around your garden to keep deer and other small animals out of your plants and flowers.

, Lightweight nets will keep insects off your plants and flowers without using any harmful chemicals.


Find netting that is transparent enough to allow sunlight to reach your garden. You can find this netting at home and garden stores or in organic produce shops.

, Your fingers can act as an organic pesticide. Pick off visible slugs, beetles and other insects.


Place the insects in a dish or bowl filled with warm soapy water to kill them.
Use a stick to brush moths and bugs out of trees or from branches and leaves you cannot reach.

,


Mix petroleum oil and water in a spray bottle. Spray the solution onto plants and flowers in your garden to repel insects.

, You can find organic products at home and garden stores such as Lowes and Home Depot, discount department stores such as WalMart and Target, and through online retailers.


Read labels. Make sure there are no chemicals or ingredients you do not recognize.

, Most organic pesticides will be sprayed directly onto plants, leaves, trees and flowers.


Try an organic pesticide that includes diatomaceous earth, which is a powder made from the fossils of sea creatures. It causes insects to dehydrate and die.
Use a product that includes garlic. Garlic is a natural insecticide and fungicide and works best on fruit and vegetable plants.

Consider relocating the squirrels if there isn't much else working.",How to Stop Squirrels from Eating Your Birdseed," There are several on the market that are weight-activated, allowing birds to feed but not squirrels. Some have better features, and might last longer, but are also a bit on the expensive side.;
, These tend to be less expensive, and are not quite as sturdy but will do the trick. These feeders will definitely slow down the seed consumption and might work if you only have an occasional squirrel, but are not truly squirrel-proof like the choices above.

, Baffles can be hung or placed on poles or posts and they work if used correctly. The magic formula is ten feet by five feet. That is, athletic squirrels can jump ten feet horizontally and five feet vertically.


Pole baffles are the easiest to situate. You can use either a straight pole or a shepherd's staff pole, just make sure that it is tall enough. Place the pole ten feet away from any trees, fence or other structure from where the squirrel might jump. Mount the baffle five feet high on the pole.
Make sure that feeders hang above the top of the baffle. If you want to hang a baffle, the best way is to string a wire between two trees, place the baffle in the middle, ten feet away from either tree, and hang the feeder underneath the baffle.
Make sure the bottom of the feeder is above five feet. Metal baffles tend to be most effective.

, Nyjer seed, millet, safflower, canary seed and canola seed all are ingredients that squirrels avoid. Unfortunately a hungry squirrel will eat anything that will provide it nourishment.

, It is a non-toxic ingredient and will not harm or kill birds. It will not lower body temperature and will not freeze birds in cold climates. Pepper seeds are disseminated naturally by birds eating these seeds in the wild.


The only caveat might be the use of powdered hot pepper. This powdered form is not natural to birds and if wind-blown could cause temporary discomfort to the eyes due to nerves about the mucous membrane. An alternative would be the use of crushed hot pepper flakes, hot pepper seeds, hot peppercorns (whole or cracked) or coarsely ground hot pepper.

, It doesn't always work that well, but if you can't beat the squirrels, at least enjoy them! Get a squirrel feeder and give them a little corn or some critter munchies. They can be very entertaining when pursuing their own food.


If you prefer the entertainment value, make the feeder difficult to reach and enjoy their gymnastics trying to reach it.

, Suet is very cheap and it bribes the squirrels to eat the suet, which can help encourage them to leave the bird feeder alone. Once again, the entertainment factor will be high., Relocation is not as effective as some of the other method. You can eliminate problem squirrels by using live traps to harmlessly catch them. However, be aware that relocating squirrels to another area is often a death sentence for the squirrels. Moreover, squirrel populations tend to build back up quickly, so this can be an ongoing effort.


Make sure to take the squirrels several miles away and give them a nice, new home with lots of trees.
Do not relocate nursing females.
Know the local regulations concerning relocating wild animals.

Once you're done, congratulate yourself!",How to Weed and Deadhead," Always wear gloves: you never know if you might be allergic to a weed or it might stick you. Your ultimate goal is to get the roots of the weed out, as well as any remains of the weed itself, or else it will have a chance to grow back again.;
, If you can't get it out with just your hands, try to figure out if the problem is the soil. Is the soil dry and crusty on top? You might want to use a small rake or trowel to brake up the soil. Does the soil have rocks underneath it? Remove the rocks so you can get to the root of the weed. Then try to pull it out.

, If it isn't the soil, though, the plant might be holding on with its roots, or connected to another weed (like grass), so you'll have to use a shovel or trowel (mini shovel) to dig around it and pull it out by the base.

, If you have the weeds you want, and if you have a green waste (a garbage can especially for garden scraps, like weeds), just toss them in there. If you don't have a green waste, you might want to invest in one; you won't regret it.

, Deadheading might seem simple: just take the end off, but if you don't do it right, it could still be fatal to the plant. So, first, you'll want to have the right tools:


Scissors (you'll want these especially for deadheading because they can't be used on paper after this).
Clippers (these are for the bigger stems).
Kneeling pad (or else your knees will have a hard time. You can get one of these at a planting store for about $1.00.).
Bucket or something to put them in instead of the ground.

, Make yourself comfortable. You may be here for a while.

, You may be able to find them easily because they look dark and sad compared to all the other flowers. Find the part of the stem (it may be really deep down in the plant) that splits off into other stems or ends up at the ground. If it ends at the ground, clip it off very close to the ground, if it ends with another stem connecting to it, clip the bad stem off as close to the base of the other stem as possible.

, Then repeat that process with the next deadhead, and the next, and the next, until all the deadheads are gone from the plant.

, Place some ceramic bowls of tasty treats for the squirrels at the edge of the garden bed. Either purchase commercially prepared squirrel feed or make your own. The idea behind this is the squirrels will prefer the easy food versus the food that needs to be dug up.

, As owls are natural enemies of squirrels, this may work as a good deterrent., The seeds are not the only part of the corn threatened; the squirrels will be delighted to relieve you of your corn crop from the moment the seedlings appear through to the growth of mature cobs of corn! A mesh fence might be a good investment if you intend growing corn regularly. If you also have rabbits, bury the fence 1 foot (0.3 m) deep, and build it 3 foot (0.9 m) high.Ensure there is no overhang from branches that they can launch themselves from into the vegetable patch. Bench the top 4 inches (10cm) of the fence over the discourage the climbers.


In addition, lay mesh over the freshly planted corn to stop digging for the seed.If you do build this fence, you can also cover the top with finer mesh to deter bird pests.

Apply the insecticide permethrin to the soil.,
Use a bait to destroy the entire ant colony.,
Cover the topsoil with Diatomaceous Earth (DE).,
Mix 1 tablespoon peppermint soap with 2 cups of water.",How to Remove Ants from Potted Plants1," When ants eat or come into contact with permethrin, their nervous system is paralyzed and the pests die. Permethrin comes in several forms: concentrated liquid, dust, powder, and aerosol. Before applying permethrin to any potted plant, read the product instructions carefully. If administered improperly, this insecticide can cause harm to humans.


Use the concentrated liquid form on your potted plants. Follow the product instructions to make an effective permethrin solution and apply as instructed.If you, a family member, or pet are sprayed with and ingest permethrin, call a doctor or vet immediately.;
, Ants are drawn to the bait, which contains slow-acting insecticides, by sugars, oils, and proteins. Worker ants bring the poisonous food back to the colony and pass the harmful item directly to the mouths of other worker ants, larvae, and queens. As the poisonous bait is passed from ant to ant or ant to larvae, the colony slowly dwindles.


You can purchase ant bait in stick form and insert it directly into the infested potted plant.
You may also use a reusable bait station. Since this trap is refillable, this method is ideal to eradicate a substantial infestation. Fill the reusable bait station with the insecticide of your choice. Close the station and set it near the base of the plant. Check the bait station frequently so that you can empty and or refill it as needed.Baits are considered the safest form of insecticide. Before using ant baits, however, always read the label to ensure that it is safe to use around children and pets.Purchase baits that include one of the following active ingredients: hydramethylnon, fipronil, boric acid, or avermectin B.
Do not purchase baits that contain cyfluthrin or permethrin. These fast-attacking insecticides will kill the worker ant before it can reach the colony., DE is an organic, mineral-based insecticide. Using an applicator bulb is the safest way to apply diatomaceous earth. Use an applicator bulb to distribute this chalk-like substance around the base and on the soil of the infested potted plant. Within approximately 30 minutes of coming into contact with DE, the ants on the plant will die.

Row a boat through the lily pads.,
Rake away the lily pads.,
Fill the pond with fish.,
Use a spade.,
Try an aquatic mower.",How to Remove Lily Pads1," If the body of water in question is a lake or a large pond, and you want to remove the lily pads to provide a path for boats, simply rowing the boat through the lily pads is often enough to open a path and keep it opened.It is best to do this with a rowboat, rather than a motorized boat, since the pads could potentially get caught in the blades of a motor.;
, If the pond is relatively undisturbed and the roots of the pads are not too tangled, surface raking is a viable solution to remove lily pads. Row a boat into the middle of the pond, or wade to the center of the pond if the water is shallow enough. Use a standard garden rake to pull the pads off the surface of the water. Some hardier varieties may have resistant roots that make surface raking difficult, and you may not be able to remove the pads at the root. This works well as a short-term solution, but the lily pads will often re-grow afterward.

, If the pads are growing in your own private pond, adding several grass carp (note grass carp is a non-native species and may be invasive) or other fish that dine on water lilies can naturally reduce the amount of pads that form on the surface. Typically, adding two fish per acre of water is an effective amount. The fish should be young, since young fish eat more than older fish.

, This method works best with shallow ponds that you can wade into, and is difficult to accomplish with deeper ponds and lakes. While standing in the water, drive the metal edge of the spade beneath the root of the lily pad. Loosen the root from its place and then lift the freed pad off the surface of the water. This solution can take a long time to accomplish, and it may be difficult to use it if you have a large pond and are working by yourself. It proves effective, though, and literally removes the lily pads at the root of the problem.

, An aquatic mower is a specially designed tool that works like a weed cutter, except that it trims away weeds and vegetation that grows on the surface of a body of water. It is usually used against algae and seaweed, but it also works against lily pads. The mower can be used from a boat, so it works in deep ponds as well as shallow ponds.

Cover the ground.",How to Remove an Ivy Plant1," If you’re working on uncovering a large area of land, you will likely require the help of 2-3 people in the process. You each will need pruning shears or a hacksaw to cut through the largest vines and roots.;
, Ivy grows outwards and can quickly spread to cover a large portion of the ground, easily growing over other plants and objects. A large area completely covered in ivy, typically in a shaded section of land, is called an ivy desert. The first step is to find the edges of this area, and making note of any large plants the ivy covers in the interior of the section.

, Use a pair of pruning shears and work your way around the ivy desert, cutting through the thickest branches and roots. If the area you are working with is quite large, cut through it in smaller sections so that you don’t have to work with so much space at once.

, Stand shoulder-to-shoulder next to your volunteer helpers, and begin to roll the ivy as if it were a giant mat into a log shape. Continue rolling until the entire area of ground has been exposed, and all the ivy is contained within the roll. Depending on the size of the land you’re working on, you may have to create several logs of ivy to carry out.

, Ivy can still re-root itself in the ground even when it has been cut off, so remove the ivy logs you’ve just rolled from the premises. You can dispose of these in a safe place later, after you’ve made sure the ground is ivy-free.

, As aforementioned, it doesn’t take much ivy to start another huge patch. Before heading off in confidence with your ivy logs, be sure to take a few minutes to review the weeded area. Pick up any remaining ivy, and cut/pull out the roots if they are visible.

, A layer of mulch will discourage new ivy from taking hold. To make the vine's comeback even less likely, plant less invasive shade-loving plants such as hostas."

Prepare the solution.,
Divide the solution.,
Pour approximately half of the mixture through the soil.,
Submerge the entire pot in the insecticide solution.,
Rinse the plant and pot with fresh water.",How to Remove Ants from Potted Plants2," If your potted plant is totally infested with tiny pests, flooding the soil with a water-insecticide solution will cause the ants to flee their nest. The ants that come into contact with the insecticide mixture will die or drown. To prepare the solution:


Grab a clean bucket.
Fill the bucket with 1 gallon of water. (If your potted plant is large, double or triple the amount of water).
Stir in 1 cup of insecticidal soap or dish soap or detergent per 1 gallon of water. Some dish soaps and detergents are a milder, less expensive, but less reliable alternatives to insecticidal soap. Branded dish soaps and detergents include: Dawn, Palmolive, Dove, Ivory, and Joy., First, set aside approximately half of the solution to submerge the pot in. Find a bucket or tub that is large enough for the pot to fit inside and fill it with half the mixture. Second, fill a small spray bottle with the solution—you will use this to spray any ants that might escape from the soil. Lastly, you will pour all of the remaining solution to through the infested plant's soil.

, Move the plant to a shady spot in your yard. Slowly pour half of the insecticide mixture through the soil of the potted plant. Spray any ants that escape the potted plant with the insecticide mixture. Let the planted pot sit for 1 hour.Insecticidal soap is mild and safe to use in organic gardens. These soaps contain specially formatted potassium fatty acids that kill insects on contact but are not harmful to humans or animals. Since these soaps have a low mammalian toxicity, they are considered safe to use around children and pets and are approved for use on organic farms. While it should not ruin your yard or garden, you may wish to work on a concrete patio or driveway to reduce any possible risk of damage., After pouring the solution through the soil, and catching the runoff in a container, pick up the pot and submerge it in the insecticide solution. Let it sit in the solution for 15 minutes. Spray any ants that escape the potted plant with the insecticide mixture. Remove the potted plant from the solution and set it on the ground., Use a hose to drench the entire potted plant with clean water. The fresh water will flush out any remaining insecticide solution. Allow the plant and soil to dry completely before moving it to a sunny location or watering it again."
"
Rinse the plant's roots.,
Clean the pot.,
Replant the pot.",How to Remove Ants from Potted Plants3," In order to eradicate the ant colony, you need to remove and replace the infested soil. Use a gardening trowel to carefully remove the plant from the pot. Throw away any soil remaining in the pot. Gently spray the roots with a hose to dislodge any ants or infested soil.


This is a messy job—work in a spot that can get dirty and wet., After removing the infected soil from the pot, you need to sanitize the container. Thoroughly cleaning the pot will ensure that all traces of the infected soil are removed. Use a cloth or sponge to scrub the inside and outside of the pot with a 1:10 bleach to water solution., Fill your pot with fresh, uninfected soil. Insert the plant into the clean soil and fill in any gaps with more dirt. When you have finished, water your plant thoroughly.

Surround your plant with contact paper instead of ant bait. As the ants try to cross the contact paper, they will get stuck.


Cut out a ring of contact paper that fits tightly around the base of your potted plant.
Separate the two layers and place the non-sticky side of the contact paper on the ground.
Set your plant directly in the center of the contact paper ring (on top of the sticky side).

Hand pull small privet.,
Use a weed wrench.,
Hammer the bark of larger stems.,
Know the limits of hand cutting.,
Control privet growth by brush mulching.",How to Remove a Privet Hedge1," You can remove seedlings and small saplings by hand pulling them, but this is only an option if the privet is taller than 15 inches (40 cm) and thinner than your wrist.


Pull the privet as early as possible to prevent it from producing seeds. Spring or early summer is ideal. Also note that the process is usually easiest when the soil is moist.
Grab the privet stem at its base. Firmly pull it straight up and without twisting it. Twisting the privet can cause the roots to break, and if any roots remain in the soil, the plant can regrow.
If the plant refuses to budge, it might be a sprout from a lateral root instead of a new plant. You'll need to try a different removal option if this is the case.;
, If you're dealing with privet saplings thinner than 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter, you might be able to use a weed wrench to remove it.Weed wrenches are most effective on privet with only a single stem, but you might be able to use one on multi-stemmed privet, as well.
Place the mouth of the wrench around the base of the privet, then rock the long handle back and forth until the tool yanks up the plant.
Pulling privet in this manner will disturb the soil, so you should avoid using this option in areas with plants you wish to preserve or when privet lies along stream banks and slopes.

, Once privet becomes wider than the average adult wrist, hammering is the most effective way to remove it without the use of chemicals.In late winter, use a hammer and chisel to remove the bark from a 4 inch (10 cm) section of the trunk. Ideally, this section should lie above ground but beneath the first branch.
Throughout the remaining growing period, continue wounding the bark to maintain this blank patch. Within a year or less, the privet should lose its foliage and gradually die off. After the privet dies, you can cut the trunk and dig up the stump.

, You can cut young privet by hand using standard weed cutters and similar tools, but when used alone, the privet will regrow.


If you do cut the privet, trim it as close to the ground as possible early in the growing season. Stumps re-sprout at a rapid pace, so you may need to cut the privet multiple times throughout the season.
Alternatively, you can cut the privet and apply an herbicide to the exposed plant. Doing so should kill the privet. See the ""Cut and Paint Treatment"" section for more detail.

, Brush mulching won't be enough to permanently remove the privet, but it should help keep it under control.


This option can work especially well when dealing with dense patches of privet.
Use brush mulching in the spring, summer, or winter. Avoid brush mulching in the fall since the privet may spread seed during that season.
Drive the brush mulcher over the privet patch, mowing down each individual privet plant as you work. Any remaining stumps should be hidden beneath the resulting mulch, and when the privet regrows, it should do so evenly, making it easier to remove with other methods.

Use chemicals after the primary flowering period has ended.Chemical treatment is most effective and least likely to cause permanent damage to your pond's ecosystem when the season's first batch of lily blooms have died off.

,
Figure out where to apply treatment.,
Apply an agricultural surfactant.,
Choose the right type of herbicide.,
Apply the herbicide to the top of the pads.,
Rake away the dead lily pads.,
Repeat this process over several weeks.",How to Remove Lily Pads2,", Chemicals are usually applied from the center of the pond outward, doing small sections at a time. Spraying an entire pond at once can cause too many plants to decompose and may rob the aquatic life living beneath the surface of valuable oxygen. To avoid this, apply the treatment to the most overgrown areas of the pond first before tackling other small sections after a few weeks pass.

, Applying an herbicide directly to the lily pad may work, but oftentimes, you will need to apply a surfactant beforehand to dissolve the protective wax coating on the outer surface of the pad. Spray the surfactant onto the top of the pad liberally.

, Glyphosate-based herbicides are the most commonly used for lily pad removal, but imazapyr-based herbicides will also work.Both are broad spectrum, non-selective herbicides that essentially kill any surface plant they come into contact with, but neither kills plants hat live under the surface of the water.

, Follow the instructions on the herbicide's label to determine an appropriate dosage. Usually, aquatic herbicides are sprayed directly over the top of the lily pad until the surface is thoroughly and evenly coated.

, The herbicide will kill the plant, leaving dead plant matter floating on the surface. Wade or row into the water and rake away dead lily pads. Pull up the roots, if possible. While the herbicide should have killed the roots, it will not be good for your pond if too many dead roots linger at the bottom and are allowed to decompose.

, Wait two to three weeks in between applications, spraying one small section at a time to prevent the ecosystem of the pond from becoming unbalanced. After the entire pond has been covered, go back over areas that were already treated if too many of the lily pads survived the initial application.

Determine the extent of coverage.,
Select the area of ivy to be removed.,
Cut off the ivy at the base of the trunk.,
Cut the ivy again at a higher level.,
Remove remaining ivy.,
Dispose of the ivy.",How to Remove an Ivy Plant2," Large spreads of ivy can quickly swallow up whole trees, and kill them off by choking off their roots. Check your tree to determine its health, and how much of it is covered by ivy. Depending on the amount, it may be too damaged to save and may need to be removed along with the ivy.

, Thankfully, it is not necessary to remove all of the ivy on a tree in order to kill it off. The root system of the ivy is in the ground, so you only have to remove the bottom-most section of ivy and the rest will eventually die. If there is little enough, you may be better off pulling out all the ivy. If your tree is nearly engulfed, measure out a space about 4–5 feet (1.2–1.5 m) high from the roots of the tree up the trunk, and outwards in a radius of about 3 feet (0.9 m) on the ground.

, Use a pair of gardening shears or a small hacksaw to cut away at the ivy in sections around the base of the tree. It will take a bit of elbow grease to get it all pulled away from the tree, and there will probably be pieces that break off from the roots, but don’t worry about it just yet. Focus on getting the majority of the ivy off from the roots and trunk of the tree., Go around the tree a second time with your shears, this time severing ivy vines at the highest point you can safely reach. Tear the cut sections off the tree. This will ensure that you haven't missed any vines, and minimize the fire hazard from dead vines.

, With the majority of the ivy removed, make your way around the tree and pull off any smaller pieces or intact roots that you see. This will prevent the ivy from growing back and filling in the space you just cleared.

, Carry the ivy you pulled away from the area, and store it in a dry, flat area (on rocks or concrete is best) until you can destroy the plant."

Prepare your supplies.,
Make the ivy easier to remove.,
Begin pulling the ivy off your structure.,
Brush off the remaining ivy.,
Wash off your structure.,
Apply weed killer.",How to Remove an Ivy Plant3," Removing ivy from structures can be a bit tricky, as you don’t want to damage your walls/fences in the process of removal. You will mostly use your hands, but will also need gloves, garden shears, a hose/water, a wire brush, and dish detergent or weed killer.

, Start by hosing down the ivy with a bit of water, as this will soften the vines and roots a bit in order to make them easier to pull off. When you begin to remove the ivy, start from the top and work your way down, as this will give more time for the water to soak into the thicker vines near the bottom and make tugging easier for you., In order to prevent damage to your fence/building, use only your hands to gently tug the ivy away. If you come to a strong or thick vine of the ivy, use your gardening shears to snip it and then pull it off using your hands. Be as gentle as you can, because if you pull the ivy too hard it is likely to remove some of the wood or brick/mortar that is supporting your structure.

, When you’ve gotten all of the largest sections of ivy, including the vines and leaves, pulled off of your structure, you can use your stiff bristle or wire brush to scrape off the small tendrils the plant may have left behind. Use a dry brush to start, and wipe away as much of the plant as you are able.

, Fill a bowl or bucket with water and a strong dish detergent, and then continue scrubbing the walls down using this mixture and your stiff bristle brush. This will kill off any remaining plant on the structure, and help to wash off any debris or grime left behind from the ivy.

, If the tactics above don't do the job, try a weed killer. Make sure to choose one that will not damage surrounding plants or building materials, and follow all safety precautions on the label. It may take some time for the weed killer to take effect."
"
Leave it to dry in the sun.,
Suffocate the ivy.,
Chip the ivy.",How to Remove an Ivy Plant4," Ivy can still survive even when pulled from the ground, but will have a much harder time doing so on dry, rough terrain. Leave your pulled ivy out on a rocky area or concrete slab that gets full sunlight. It may take a few days, but you’ll notice the plant begin to wilt and die as it absorbs the heat and loses nutrients being stuck on dry land.

, If you have enough supplies on hand, you can store the ivy in large plastic bags or garbage bags for several days or weeks. Instead of overdosing the ivy with too much sunlight, you’ll starve the plant of light and remove it from its growth source. Keep the ivy/bags in a cool, dry area away from plantable ground or trees.

, If you happen to have a wood chipper on hand, you can put the ivy through the chipper to destroy it. This will kill it, but to be safe you should dispose of the chips away from your home and garden to prevent a possible reinfestation.


If you don't have a chipper, you can lay the ivy out in a sunny location and pass over it a few times with a lawn mower. Leave the chopped-up vines to dry out in the sun.

Apply foliar treatments late in the growing season.,
Purchase an appropriate herbicide.,
Mix the herbicide with water.,
Spray the herbicide onto the privet.,
Repeat if needed.",How to Remove a Privet Hedge2," These treatments are most effective in late summer through early winter. Spring applications are usually ineffective, but summer applications may bring about moderate levels of removal.Note that the privet must still retain green leaves for foliar treatment to be truly effective. The air temperature should be about 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) or higher.
Avoid spraying foliar treatments on windy days or near water sources.

, Look for foliar herbicides with glyphosate as an active ingredient.


More precisely, you should use a concentrated type with 41 percent glyphosate, if not more. ""Ready to Use"" formulas generally aren't concentrated enough to work.
Formulas containing a surfactant may also prove more effective than those without one.

, Combine 4 to 6 fluid ounces (125 to 185 ml) of herbicide for every 1 gallon (4 L) of water.


Follow the label instructions for more precise measurements.
If the product must be mixed with an additional surfactant, add 0.6 fluid ounces (18 ml) per 1 gallon (4 L) of water.

, Use a sprayer to apply the diluted herbicide directly over the privet patch, covering as much as possible.


Single nozzle backpack sprayers are recommended, but you can also use a hose or handgun style sprayer. High-volume handgun sprayers might be most effective when treating high-density patches.
Spray until the entire crown foliage is thoroughly wet, but stop before you create any product runoff.
Work carefully to avoid spraying other plants since the herbicide will kill non-selectively.

, For dense privet patches, you may need to repeat another application of herbicide one year after the first treatment.


If dense foliage grew back, you will need to apply more foliar herbicide.
If only one or two stems grow back, you can consider using an herbicide treatment that targets individual plants.

"
"
Apply during dry weather.,
Mix triclopyr with oil.,
Spray the bottom of the stem.,
Follow up only as needed.",How to Remove a Privet Hedge3," You can apply basal bark herbicides year-round, but the bark of the privet should be dry before treatment.


Additionally, the ground should not be frozen. It might be best to apply the herbicide in the late winter or early spring, before foliage develops and hides the targeted stems. Summer and fall applications are more difficult to perform properly, but can still be effective when done right.

, Combine 26 fluid ounces (770 ml) of an oil-soluble triclopyr ester product with enough horticultural oil to create 1 gallon (4 L) of product.


Diesel, bark oil, and kerosene are all acceptable options.
Note that ready-to-use triclopyr ester herbicides are usually effective against privet, so you can opt for one of these instead of using an herbicide you need to mix.

, Spray or paint the bottom 12 to 15 inches (30.5 to 38 cm) of each privet stem, thoroughly wetting all sides of the bark.


Note that this may only work on privet stems less than 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter.
Application is easiest when you use a backpack sprayer with a low pressure spray. Attach an adjustable cone nozzle, flat-fan nozzle, or hollow-cone nozzle to the spray hose.
Continue wetting the bark until it appears covered, but do not allow the herbicide to run off and puddle in the soil around the base of the stem.

, Basal bark treatments will kill the privet after a period of several months, so you need to give it adequate time to work. If some privet still remains after most has died off, however, you can try another application.


Ideally, any follow-up application should be made no sooner than the fall or winter if you applied the initial treatment during late winter or early spring.
Before reapplying additional herbicide, evaluate your options. Small stems that may have been missed during the initial application can be successfully treated with the basal bark method. Medium stems and large stems may respond more effectively to other treatments, however.

"

Apply this treatment during the fall.,
Mix an appropriate herbicide solution.,
Cut down the privet.,
Paint the privet with the herbicide solution.,
Reapply only if necessary.",How to Remove a Privet Hedge4," While this treatment can be effective throughout different seasons, it is usually easiest to apply it during the late fall, after most foliage has died off.


Do not use the cut-and-paint method during early spring. Privet sap flows upward at that time of year, so the exposed stump will quickly become damp and sticky after you cut it, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the herbicide.

, Herbicides made with glyphosate or triclopyr amine are best. Mix either herbicide with water to form an appropriate solution.


When using glyphosate, choose a concentrate with 41 percent or higher. When using triclopyr amine, choose a concentrate with 44 percent or higher.
For either glyphosate or triclopyr amine, combine 32 fluid ounces (945 ml) with enough water to make 1 gallon (4 L) of prepared solution.
If you'll need to postpone chemical treatment after performing the cutting, you should use 26 fluid ounces (770 ml) of a triclopyr ester herbicide mixed with enough diesel or bark oil to create 1 gallon (4 L) of solution.

, Cut down the privet stem, leaving only a short stump. Remove any sawdust from the site before continuing.


Any cut you make should lie beneath the lowest branch of the stem. Cuts lying at ground level are best, but the process should still work as long as the stump is low and there are no branches left on the remains.
If the privet is larger than 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter, you may need to drill holes into the stump to improve the effectiveness of the herbicide. Use a 10 mm drill bit to create downward holes in the cut surface, spacing them 4 inches (10 cm) apart.

, For the best results, you should immediately paint or spray the cut area with your prepared herbicide solution.


One of the easiest ways to apply the solution is with a spray bottle.
Cover the entire cut area until it becomes moist, but do not allow the herbicide to drip off and form a puddle around the stump.
Herbicide application should usually be performed within minutes of the cutting procedure. If you cannot do so, apply an appropriate triclopyr ester solution within two or three weeks of cutting.

, If done correctly, every treated privet stem should die off, making a second application unnecessary in most cases.


If the privet does not die off within one or two months, however, you can attempt to reapply the herbicide solution following the same procedure.

Realize that there a lot of other weed plants related to thistles that are omitted from this article.",How to Root Out Thistles1," A thistle is a garden weed that has leaves that really look like a hybrid between a lettuce in a cactus. Many species do have a furry down that gives the plant a frosty appearance and many of the ones that are aggressive weeds have purple to pink button shape flowers that do in a way resemble large dandelions only purple. Also like dandelions, after the flowers are pollinated and die they turn into a fluffy head which the wind blows and spreads the seeds around.
